gold silk curtain, weighing two tons, which was hoisted up to the
sunrise rings of the proscenium arch at Radio City Music Hall last
Thursday as part of the hall's estimated $70 million renovation.
Only one month before the scheduled reopening of Radio City Music

Cardinal John O'Connor at St. Patrick's Cathedral on Sunday. For
the 47 nuns of the order, the cardinal's well-being is a deeply

community, which is dedicated to defending human life. Doctors at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center removed a small tumor from
O'Connor's brain, his spokesman said Saturday. The tumor was

sunrise rings of the proscenium arch at Radio City Music Hall last
Thursday as part of the hall's estimated $70 million renovation.
Only one month before the scheduled reopening of Radio City Music

Cardinal John O'Connor at St. Patrick's Cathedral on Sunday. For
the 47 nuns of the order, the cardinal's well-being is a deeply

community, which is dedicated to defending human life. Doctors at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center removed a small tumor from
O'Connor's brain, his spokesman said Saturday. The tumor was
diagnosed while the 79-year-old cardinal was hospitalized for tests

Bean. ``One would think so, but if they were as deeply closeted as
I was, who would know?'' (Gary Rothstein/New York Times Photo)

JETER BREAKS THROUGH, AND ANGELS PAY PRICE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ As he waits his turn for his first at-bat
every game, Derek Jeter turns toward the stands and hold up two
fingers of his right hand, or one, or whatever signal happens to be
appropriate. Mike Borzello charts pitches for the Yankees from the
stands and operates a radar gun, and he responds in kind _ perhaps
two fingers, if the pitcher is throwing 92 miles an hour, or three
fingers for 93.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter uses the sign language to help him gauge opposing
pitchers, and he has had fair success this season doing so. He had
more Sunday night, hitting two singles, a double and a home run
while the Yankees embarrassed Anaheim, 8-3. Darryl Strawberry
smashed his first home run since rejoining the Yankees last week,
the 333rd homer of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Yarnall, who has journeyed from the Mets to the Florida
Marlins to the Yankees in the last 15 months in trades for Mike
Piazza and then Mike Lowell, struck out four in six innings and
earned his first victory in his first major league start. The
Yankees are 84-52 and on a pace to win 100 games.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday night's game, Jeter leaned back on two chair legs
at his locker and chatted about his offense, in a hoarse voice he
blamed on the air-conditioning in the team's hotel. Jeter said he
has felt better at the plate than last month, when he was pulling
the ball so much. Now he is again hitting the ball to the opposite
field. But Jeter added that he wanted to get back to the way he hit
earlier this season, when he was driving the ball more.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into this game, Jeter had just six extra-base hits and
eight runs batted in during his last 23 games. He had not hit a
home run since Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances were ripe for a breakout Sunday night. Chuck
Finley, the Angels' left-hander who usually pitches well against
the Yankees, was unable to make his scheduled start because of back
trouble; in the late afternoon and early evening shadows of this
game, which started at 5 p.m., Finley would have been even tougher
than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fyhrie, a journeyman right-hander who gets by on lots of
savvy and little stuff, started in place of Finley, and Jeter
singled through the middle in the first inning. Then, in the third
inning, Jeter drove a pitch high over the wall in left field _ his
first home run after 100 homerless at-bats and his 22nd of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees hammered Fyhrie for six hits (including four
extra-base hits) in the first three innings, and the Anaheim
relievers could not contain Jeter, either. He slammed a double in
the fifth inning, driving home a run, and he led off the eighth
inning with another single for his first four-hit game of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter's numbers continue to mount at an extraordinary rate. He
has 188 hits, the most in the American League. At his current rate,
he will accumulate 224 hits _ which would give him 800 for his
first four full seasons, and the most for any Yankee since Don
Mattingly had 238 in 1986. Jeter has 109 runs scored and 89 RBI,
and is batting .353, a point behind Boston's Nomar Garciaparra, who
leads the American League.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry provided the exclamation point in the Yankees'
victory Sunday night. They scored three runs in the fifth inning
and assumed a 7-3 lead, and with two outs in the sixth, Strawberry
batted against Al Levine, the Angels' third pitcher of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry blasted a high drive down the right-field line; fans
stood, their voices escalating as the ball neared the stands, and
the Yankees rushed forward in their dugout to see if Strawberry's
drive would stay fair.
</P>
<P>
   It did not. Strawberry, who had taken a few steps down the
first-base line, returned to the batter's box and crushed Levine's
next pitch beyond right field, where Anaheim's Garret Anderson took
one step and then stopped to admire the flight of the ball.
Estimated distance: 415 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee fans here cheered loudly as Strawberry ambled around
the bases with his first major league home run since Aug. 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry has reached base in 10 of his 14 plate appearances,
with four hits in eight at-bats and six walks. Joe Torre, the
Yankees' manager, intends to use Strawberry when he rests Chili
Davis, the designated hitter. But as one member of the organization
said recently, if Strawberry hits and Davis does not, Strawberry
will play in the postseason _ just as Davis played last year in the
playoffs, after Tim Raines and Strawberry were beset by physical
problems.

METS' KENNY ROGERS SEARCHES FOR HIS COMFORT ZONE 
CANSECO SOUNDING UPBEAT ABOUT FUTURE WITH RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They still remember Kenny Rogers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He was gone almost two years but he said they still recognize
him when he steps outside his Upper East Side apartment in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you they know who you are,'' Rogers said. ``I can
drive for three hours out to the middle of nowhere and they still
recognize me. You know how it is in New York. You do well there,
they're going to love you. You do bad, you're going to hear about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers found out about New York during his two years with the
Yankees. He heard about it, too. Given a four-year, $19.7 million
contract before the 1996 season, Rogers won only 12 games in each
of his two years and pitched poorly in the playoffs before being
traded to the Oakland Athletics for third baseman Scott Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   The trade looked like a giveaway because the Yankees felt
Rogers, a country boy from central Florida, was totally unsuited to
pitch in New York. Brosius, now an All-Star, had hit .203 the year
before and the Yankees agreed to pay a substantial portion of
Rogers salary to convince the Athletics to do the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rogers is back in New York, only this time with the Mets.
Undeterred by what happened across town, the Mets acquired Rogers
from the Athletics on July 23 for two minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   He is there to reinforce a mediocre starting rotation and get
the Mets in the playoffs. After that, he's a free agent. The
question then will be if he wants to remain in New York or go
someplace where he's most comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Like Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a possibility,'' Rogers said with a smile. ``Any place
you're comfortable and is good for your family, you'd like to play
there. But it can change in a hurry. A place you have your heart
set on, they may not need a left-hander.''
</P>
<P>
   But knowing the Rangers have an all-right-handed rotation in a
ballpark that favors left-handers, Rogers smiled and said, ``Being
left-handed doesn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers refuses to admit he blundered by not accepting a
four-year, $17 million offer from the Rangers after the 1995
season. The World Series ring from playing for the Yankees in 1996
shows he might be right even though he pitched terrible in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   But his experience in New York was one reason he got on the
phone in the off-season and told his best friend, Rafael Palmeiro,
he needed to take control of his contract situation himself.
Palmeiro did and ended up re-signing with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He owes me,'' Rogers said, again with a smile. ``He owes me
big-time. He could be an MVP this year. That's what happens when
you're playing somewhere where you feel comfortable. Comfort is the
key. If you're comfortable, you can relax and go out and play the
game. If you're not comfortable, it makes everything a little
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Palmeiro, ``I'm trying to get him over here but he and his
agent, Scott Boras, are probably going to play the free-agent game
again. But he'll be sought after. He's a good pitcher. It's going
to be up to him where he wants to play. He put his family through a
lot the past three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was not comfortable with the Yankees and the Mets knew
that. Assistant general manager Omar Minaya admitted some people
within the organization were against trading for him because of
what happened across town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any qualms,'' Minaya said. ``It was just a bad
situation, especially his second year. I think New York brings out
the best in a veteran player. You put a veteran in a pennant race
in New York, it creates an intensity you can't find anywhere in any
city in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers insisted his time with the Yankees would have been
different if he had been healthy. But he had shoulder problems and
was slow in recovering from arthroscopic surgery after the 1996
season.
</P>
<P>
   But Yankees manager Joe Torre saw it differently. He saw it as a
lack of confidence. After the 1996 season, he said, ``I still
believe in Kenny Rogers. The problem is he doesn't believe in
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who won 16 games for Oakland last year, responded by
saying, ``If I didn't feel confident in myself, I wouldn't have
made it this far. If I was capable of pitching well, it would have
worked out. But you've got to feel comfortable and I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said he will take a more active role this off-season than
in 1995 when he let Boras shop him to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my future, not anybody else's,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't rule out returning to the Mets. He is 3-0 with a 3.97
earned-run average in seven starts since the trade and said there's
a much different atmosphere at Shea Stadium than with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The most important factor is he is much closer to his family _
wife Becky and their two children _ than when he was in Oakland.
Rogers makes his permanent home in Tampa, Fla., and his family can
join him in New York when the Mets are in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife was really happy when she heard about the trade,''
Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   His family had a hard time getting out to the West Coast; that's
why Rogers made it clear he wasn't going to stay in Oakland beyond
this year. His position alienated many of his teammates and was a
factor in why the Athletics, despite being contenders in the
wild-card race, traded him to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they made up their own reasons,'' Rogers said.
``Whatever they want to make up is fine. I'm not going to feel bad
because I wanted to be closer to my family. If anybody doesn't like
that, too bad.'' nn

BOOK TOUR OPENS DEBATE ON MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - On Tuesday, Arizona Sen. John McCain will make some
New York book-tour appearances that strongly resemble campaign
opportunities to boost him in the race for the GOP presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an uncommon event. But to some observers, it also
raises questions about whether the mix of book publicizing and
political preening has gone too far, whether publishers are
improperly, even illegally, helping underwrite campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, for instance, will take part in a whirlwind of
interviews by such media personalities as Kathie Lee Gifford, Regis
Philbin and Don Imus. Later he will be feted at a book signing
party by Michael Bloomberg and Georgette Mosbacher.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate will be asked about his campaign and will be given
a broad forum to air his political views _ a media dream come true
for someone running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Later, McCain will travel to Rockefeller Center, where he hopes
that throngs of New Yorkers will line up to get his signature on
their copies of his new book, ``Faith of My Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is not the only candidate who has piggybacked a book on
his campaign. Pat Buchanan, Dan Quayle and Steve Forbes also have
come out with books this year, and Alan Keyes and George W. Bush
are finishing ones.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle also hit the book-tour circuit, and he had to be careful
not to commingle the campaigning with the marketing too much.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission advises campaigns that if
publishers pay for a book tour closely tied to a campaign, it could
be considered a corporate contribution to the campaign. Corporate
contributions to presidential campaigns are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Huff, a spokeswoman for the FEC, said the agency hasn't
formally spoken on the issue of presidential book tours. But she
said FEC lawyers believe that candidates should keep the two
separate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would really depend if it was strictly book-related, as
opposed to maybe throwing in a few campaign-related activities -
(then it) would be maybe considered a corporate contribution,''
Huff said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides said they have been careful to pay for many of the
activities associated with the book tour and to keep it separate
from his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is that we are paying for a lot of it just
because the guidelines are clear,'' said Wes Gullett, McCain's
deputy campaign director.
</P>
<P>
   But the top aide to presidential hopeful Steve Forbes, who
recently released a campaign book entitled ``A New Birth of
Freedom,'' said that he believes any book tour associated with a
campaign should be paid for entirely by the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dal Col, Forbes' campaign manager, said the Forbes campaign
will pay for expenses on all book tours the candidate decides to
take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that is remotely concerning the book will be paid for
by the campaign so there is no ambiguity or doubt,'' Dal Col said.
``Anyone not doing that is taking a risk of accepting a corporate
contribution or at least creating the perception of accepting a
corporate contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gullett's statement, the McCain campaign seems to have
made little effort to divorce itself from the book tour.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign announces each of the book tour's dates and cities
on its Web site, and aides told ``The Arizona Republic'' they are
doing fund-raisers in most of the cities on the tour. A
fund-raising letter McCain sent out Aug. 27 includes a promotional
leaflet for the book, indicating that the book has become an
integral part of the campaign's fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gullett acknowledges that the book is a plus for McCain's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets John's personal story out there and it gives him an
opportunity to be interviewed by a lot of the national media,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gains, such book tours can also have downsides.
</P>
<P>
   They take candidates through many states, but not always ones
key to the campaign. For instance, this month, McCain will go to
Rockford, Ill., Kansas City, Mo., and Boston, none of them in
states vital to his presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of it helping with overall things, it gives him an
opportunity to be in a lot of places, but it also takes us out of
(key states like) New Hampshire and South Carolina,'' Gullett said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of those book-stop states will be big.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the McCain tour will cut a wide swath through
California, a state McCain must win to garner the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, now California is an early (primary) state,''
Gullett said.
</P>
<P>
   Also tapping into the book-tour potential has been former Vice
President Dan Quayle. Last month, he got maximum mileage out of his
tour for his book ``Worth Fighting For'' by hosting a book signing
right after a speech he made at the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign promoted the speech as a major foreign policy
address and issued press releases on campaign stationery about the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Following the address, Quayle signed copies of his book for an
hour and then did radio interviews about the campaign and the book.
He was later whisked away in a chauffeured car arranged by the
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the candidate's trip was paid for by the campaign,
with the exception of the limousine that ferried Quayle to and from
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is is a gray area, and we've really tried to be careful
about it,'' Quayle's campaign chairman Kyle McSlarrow said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Quayle's publisher said the corporation has
also made every effort to not mix book-promotion dollars with
campaign dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to be extremely mindful of keeping those two
separate,'' said Jana Munsinger of Word Publishing, which issued
Quayle's book. ``We want to make sure that the publisher isn't
helping pay for the campaign. I've spent hours on the phone with
(Quayle's lawyer).''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush is also expected to release a book
this fall, but a spokeswoman for Bush's publisher said the
candidate is not expected to go on tour for the book.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to GOP candidate Alan Keyes, a talk-show host who is
putting the finishing touches on a book he started before the race,
say the dicey legal complications are troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Godzich, an aide to Keyes, said the question is just one
more thing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes' schedule is ``wacky,'' he has to make a living while he's
running for office, and then questions arise about whether the two
activities are improperly mixed, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes hard to say what's what,'' Godzich said, sighing. &QL;

`EDVENTURE' WILL BRING SA FARI INTO VALLEY SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA BIGGS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - From the primitive wilds of Africa, via satellite
phone and laptop, an Arizona State University professor hopes to
inspire the world's children to learn, to think, to dream.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Wilson will use the Internet to bring students along on
his ``African Edventure'' _ with videos of scuba diving in Lake
Malawi, hiking the 19,340 foot summit of Kilimanjaro and bungee
jumping 709 feet from a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson departs Sept. 13 for South Africa, where he will meet up
with videographer Aaron Frick of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The target date to begin their six-month, 18,000 mile expedition
is Oct. 15. They will travel by Land Rover and sleep in a rooftop
tent to be better protected from malaria-carrying mosquitoes and
baboon ``raiding parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Items on his itinerary that sound like fun are actually his
strongest teaching tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've used that (bungee jump) as a way to demonstrate gravity,
acceleration and energy,'' Wilson said. ``So those sort of boring
things, it's a way to get kids not to switch off.''
</P>
<P>
   Scuba diving will be used to demonstrate density and pressure.
To teach conservation biology, Wilson will visit a cheetah preserve
in Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not, `Oh, let's go look at the cute cheetahs,' '' he
said. ``It's the science of conservation biology. It's everything
from the high-tech DNA science to capturing animals that are
causing problems on neighboring farms.''
</P>
<P>
   To rev up interest in the trip, they've sent videos to schools
from Thailand to Australia, as well as the United States. Some
Valley teachers have already made plans to tag along - virtually.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Udall, an eighth-grade teacher at McKemy Middle School in
Tempe, is incorporating Wilson's trip into her lesson plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids will be following him,'' Udall said. ``We're going to
be studying Africa at the time he is over there. We'll be
corresponding through e-mail and fax.''
</P>
<P>
   The expedition's Web site, www.Africa-Edventure.org, will be a
base camp of sorts, where schoolchildren can visit to follow
Wilson's progress. People are encouraged to e-mail questions, ideas
and comments.
</P>
<P>
   During the seven-day hike up Kilimanjaro, Wilson will pitch camp
each day and set up the satellite phone. He's hoping to receive
phone calls while on the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll only be there for a short time,'' Wilson said. ``It's
kind of difficult to know when we'll be able to get the sat phone
up and running.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's goal in posting diary entries on the Web site is not
just to teach, but to inspire children to think about controversial
issues, such as the survival balance between people and animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, I wanted to hit the science because I'm a
scientist, but there are so many issues,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   He cites the ``bushmeat trade'' as an example. Animals are
butchered for food, ornaments or other uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely horrific,'' Wilson said. But he also
understands that the survival of locals might depend on hunting
animals for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to put provocative questions like, `If you were in
that situation where you had to make a decision of eating that
gorilla or starving your family, what would you do?' '' Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is not without danger. Some areas, such as northeast
Kenya, cannot be safely traveled in a lone vehicle, so Wilson and
Frick will join up with a convoy.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Edventure'' vehicle was built from 1973-era parts of
ex-military vehicles. It's equipped with riot grids inside the
windows, fuel capacity to travel 1,200 miles, and solar panels to
run a refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not actually for food,'' Wilson said, ``it's to keep the
film cold. I bought 600 feet of film.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the journey, they will visit places where scientists have
discovered evidence of early human ancestors - what Wilson calls
the ``Dawn of Humans'' project.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and Frick have financed most of the trip themselves, but
they have formed loose alliances with the Phoenix Zoo and ASU's
information technology staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in particular excited and interested in the educational
aspect of it, letting children get a first-hand look at the animals
and his adventure,'' said Alice Sluga, public relations manager for
the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ASU Professor Sam DiGangi said students and staff have been
working with Wilson for several months. Though a trek across Africa
is hardly a new idea, DiGangi said the ``Edventure'' takes it to a
new level.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of a resource for teachers . . . this is a very
innovative approach that he's taking,'' DiGangi said.
</P>
<P>
   DiGangi called the project a valuable experience for his group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably involved 15-20 staff and students, ranging
everywhere from the graphic artist to the network programmers,
people who are doing the technical aspects of making the site work.
Also our video production people _ we digitized and encoded the
video so it could be streamed across the Internet,'' DiGangi said.
</P>
<P>
   As the realization of Wilson's dream approaches, last-minute
problems such as how to disassemble a winch and ship it do little
to dampen his excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to do this. Always,'' he said. ``There's
some charm or charisma in getting out there in remote Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Even _ or especially _ with much of the world watching. &QL;

DISNEY'S TRY AT OWNERSHIP A GOOFY ERROR THAT SHOULD END
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Disney has made billions of dollars drawing pictures of lions,
fairy godmothers and a talking mouse, putting them on an animation
board and parading them in front of a movie camera.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to baseball, the fabled family entertainment
giant has been a colossal flop, taking a reasonably average
franchise and turning it into a running joke. The Anaheim Angels
have become to baseball what ``Pocahontas'' and ``Hercules'' were
to cinematic art. Now everybody is either jumping ship or being
tossed overboard.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins, a good baseball man who deserved better,
went first on Friday, resigning his position one step ahead of the
lynch mob. There was little doubt Collins was in deep trouble since
his players, including that renown warrior Mo Vaughn, quit on him
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   The sad irony is Collins wants to manage but can't, while Jim
Leyland can manage the Colorado Rockies as long as he wants but is
ready to quit at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Leyland, smart enough to realize the Rockies will never have
enough pitching to win, is ``burned out'' and insists he'll never
manage again. But some say he really wants the Detroit job.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Rockies should hire Collins, who has never been a guy
to run away from a challenge. It's just that he had no choice in
Anaheim, and it's a good bet Don Baylor will replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Disney does have a choice, and the company is ready to get out
of the sports business. They've put both the Angels and their
hockey team, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, up for sale, and
apparently they've found a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Henry T. Nicholas III, 39 years old and worth billions, is ready
to plunk down some $400 million for the two franchises. Nicholas
made his fortune running Broadcom, a manufacturer of high-speed
communication chips, but needs a sports franchise so the whole
world will know he's a financial and technological genius. After
all, what good is it to be a billionaire when nobody has ever heard
of you?
</P>
<P>
   That might end up being the bigger trend in baseball ownership.
Everybody trembled at the coming of entertainment giants such as
Disney and Fox, but all they've done is foul things up. The next
wave of owners could be a bunch of self-made multimillionaires from
Microsoft, Silicon Valley and Telecom Corridor who are dying to
shed themselves of their anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Call it baseball's version of ``Revenge of the Nerds.'' Pretty
soon athletes will be working for the same geeks whose lunch money
they were stealing in junior high.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn will no doubt love that.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is just the first of many problems for whoever owns the
Angels. He's into only the first year of a six-year, $80 million
contract and what an inaugural campaign it was. Not only did he
lead the mutiny against his manager, but he also alienated pitcher
Troy Percival last week in Cleveland when he remained in the
clubhouse while the rest of the team was engaged in a brawl on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn has had to play hurt, and injuries have been a big part
of the Angels' disaster. Vaughn, Gary DiSarcina, Tim Salmon and Jim
Edmonds have all missed substantial playing time because of
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest problem for the Angels is that every big-name
pitcher brought in the past few years _ Tim Belcher, Jim Abbott,
Ken Hill, Jack McDowell _ has been a bust.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney people can market. They can entertain. They can draw
a picture of a mouse and they can sell souvenirs by the truckload.
But when your pitching stinks, your players have quit and your best

VIOLENCE ERUPTS IN EAST TIMOR AND MANY ARE KILLED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS Security Council actions in 2nd graf) (lb)

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ As the outside world looked on in horror
and the Indonesian government promised East Timor protection but
evaded fulfilling those pledges, armed thugs systematically took
over the island territory on Sunday, killing and terrorizing
residents and trapping U.N. workers in their compound.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday night, there were many reports of large numbers of
killings, with an overall death toll reaching perhaps into the
hundreds. In New York the U.N. Security Council condemned the vio-
lence and decided to send a five- member mission.
</P>
<P>
   In Dili, the territory's capital, armed men were said to have
fired into crowds of refugees at the port and at a school beside
the U.N. compound and to have set fire to a building adjacent to
the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Diocese, where refugees had
taken shelter. The gunmen were reported to be massacring residents
in the pro-independence neighborhood of Becora.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of killings and terror in other towns,
including an unconfirmed report that 100 people had been killed in
the town of Same and 20 in the town of Atsabe.
</P>
<P>
   The reports could not be confirmed, because foreigners have been
evacuated from most rural areas and roads are blocked by militia
gangs. But Ana Gomes, Portugal's envoy to Jakarta, told a
Portuguese radio station that ``over 100 dead would be a
conservative estimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Several top Indonesian officials, including the armed forces
chief and the foreign minister, flew to Dili for a brief visit and
promised to restore order. But they did not venture beyond the tiny
airport as the irregular militias _ created and armed by the
military _ fired their weapons and burned houses in the streets
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials estimated that in Dili some 25,000 people had
taken shelter where they could, and witnesses reported thousands
huddled in police headquarters, the U.N. compound and the few other
sanctuaries available. Terrified parents tried to pass their
children over coils of razor wire outside the besieged U.N.
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Australia said it was sending an aircraft to evacuate its
nationals and all nonessential U.N. staff. Australia and nearby
islands were reported to be preparing to receive as many as 100,000
East Timorese evacuees.
</P>
<P>
   Security worsened, rather than improved, after the visit of the
Indonesian dignitaries, said Prime Minister Antonio Guterres of
Portugal. His country abandoned East Timor as a colony in 1975,
opening the way for Indonesia to invade and declare the island
territory its 27th province.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for Indonesia itself and the international
community to understand that Indonesia is no longer able to keep
law and order,'' Guterres told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   In a referendum last Monday, 78.5 percent of the East Timorese
who voted favored breaking free as a separate nation. But that
vote, administered by the United Nations, does not take effect
until it is ratified by the Indonesian Parliament later this year,
leaving the territory of 800,000 people in a dangerous limbo after
decades of virtual civil war between pro-independence forces and
the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   The mayhem this weekend spurred increasing calls for the United
Nations or individual countries _ like nearby Australia, which has
volunteered its armed forces _ to send in peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   But Foreign Minister Ali Alatas asserted Indonesia's
responsibility for East Timor and said no foreign forces would be
allowed into the territory. Other officials insisted that they
would maintain order on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The armed forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, said, ``I call on those
people causing the deteriorating situation to stop their actions.''
But as of Sunday evening, residents reached by telephone said the
shooting and burning continued.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's apparent yearlong policy of issuing statements but
taking little action to curb militia violence drew expressions of
exasperation from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned about the continuing violence,'' President
Clinton said, ``and the people who lost the election should
recognize that they lost it fair and square and should now find a
way to go forward peacefully. The Indonesians should do all they
can to keep the peace and prevent the bloodshed. They have the
capacity, I think, that would enable them to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gomes, the Portuguese diplomat, placed the responsibility
for the violence directly on the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an uncontrolled chaos,'' she said. ``It is a
provoked, planned and orchestrated chaos by military forces. They
want to scare the international community _ the observers and the
journalists _ to get them out and massacre the East Timorese.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents said Sunday evening that part of the Mahkota Hotel,
where most journalists stayed until they were evacuated Sunday, had
been burned. They said the territory's main human rights
organization, Yayasan Hak, had been attacked with stones and
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   There were several reports Monday morning of sustained
automatic-weapons fire overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Given the serious damage that is being done to Indonesia's
international standing, with the eyes of the United Nations and the
foreign press focused on East Timor, a number of Indonesian and
foreign analysts said they found the government's motives difficult
to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine anything more damning to the image of
Indonesia than this sort of thing,'' said James Fox, director of
Pacific and Asian studies at the Australian National University,
who was in East Timor for the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't take much to provide law and order,'' he said.
``There is obviously an unwillingness to do it. Either they don't
realize the cost that this will entail or they have decided they'll
pay that cost.''

</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian military has a long and intense attachment to
East Timor, where thousands of its men have died and others have
made their careers. The military recruited and armed the militia
groups early this year after President B.J. Habibie suddenly
announced that he would let East Timor go free if it voted down his
offer of more autonomy within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   With some members of the military viewing the possibility of
independence as a defeat, their aim in creating the militias
appeared to be to influence or derail the vote through a campaign
of intimidation and terror.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also say that the military, which traditionally
has helped keep together the diverse 13,000 islands that make up
Indonesia, fears that if East Timor gains independence, other parts
of the nation will seek to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   In the two days since the result of the vote was announced early
Saturday, the militias have run wild. ``To what end?'' Fox said.
``This is so counterproductive and self-defeating. It has to be
stubbornness and upset.''
</P>
<P>
   The chaos drove some 5,000 East Timorese to flee Sunday aboard
inter-island ferries, according to reports from Dili, although
militia thugs reportedly prevented some people from departing.
</P>
<P>
   Another 2,000 people took shelter at the compound of the
territory's Roman Catholic prelate, Bishop Carlos Belo, who in 1996
shared the Nobel Peace Prize with the pro-independence activist
Jose Ramos Horta.
</P>
<P>
   The police said as many as 15,000 people were crowded into the
grounds of the main police headquarters. More than 1,000 broke
their way into the U.N. compound, where most of the remaining U.N.
workers and a handful of journalists also took shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds more journalists, aid workers and U.N. officials who
had completed their electoral work fled Sunday aboard chartered
aircraft. As their planes took off, they could see flames and smoke
rising from fires burning within and around the outskirts of the
tiny seaside capital.
</P>
<P>
   But David Wimhurst, the chief spokesman for the United Nations
in East Timor, said no U.N. staff were leaving before their time
was up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to stay put,'' he said by telephone from within the
besieged compound. ``All this violence is clearly an attempt to
intimidate us out of here, and we have resisted this
intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The United Nations is obviously doing everything it
can to put pressure on the Indonesian government to maintain law
and order, but it is increasingly apparent that these appeals are
falling on deaf ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those calling for quick intervention by the United Nations
was Ramos Horta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing an imminent, extraordinary humanitarian
catastrophe right under the eyes of the Security Council, and they
are not acting promptly to stop the killings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whole villages have fled for safety into the barren hills, and
Ramos Horta said that in the coming days ``thousands will be
starving and dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Belo echoed his call for help. ``This is the time that we badly
need some peacekeeping troops in this region to protect ordinary
people who have no weapons, such as children, women and the
elderly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Australian officials said they had prepared an intervention
force, but Prime Minister John Howard said Sunday, ``You can't go
into the territory of another country without that country's
approval, and East Timor remains a part of Indonesia until a formal
act of separation takes place.''

OLDER AIRPLANE BEACONS LEAD TO MANY FALSE ALARMS, FRUSTRATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDD SLIVKA  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The garbage can wasn't lost at sea. It just sounded that way.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard and Washington state's aviation division heard
the signal _ a high-pitched warble _ that meant a plane or ship was
in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Newell Lee heard it, too, and it drove him nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is the man responsible for tracking down emergency beacons
that help authorities locate planes that go down over land.
</P>
<P>
   After four hours of direction finding and flyovers, Lee figured
it out. A fisherman at Poulsbo Marina had thrown his old disaster
beacon in a garbage can. That's when it got wet and started
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   No one was lost at sea.
</P>
<P>
   No planes had crashed in fiery heaps in the folds of the
Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   It was just another distress call on the commonly used and often
unreliable 121.5-megahertz radio frequency.
</P>
<P>
   More than 170,000 121.5-MHz emergency beacons are used
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Once a beacon is activated, it sends a signal to a satellite,
which relays the beacon's approximate position to a ground station.
It helps leads rescuers to boats and planes.
</P>
<P>
   But the 121.5-MHz frequency isn't just for boats and planes;
it's also the same frequency used by, say, a garage-door opener or
a miskeyed microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Designating the emergency frequency was a good idea in the late
1960s, when it was uncrowded. Technology has passed it by, and many
machines use it.
</P>
<P>
   Newer beacons use the 406-MHz frequency, dedicated solely for
search-and-rescue purposes. Because of the high cost of those
beacons _ $2,500, compared with $150 _ the old frequency remains
far more popular. Until 406-MHz beacons come down in price, the
older frequency will remain the standard _ and a major headache.
</P>
<P>
   Each time something goes out on 121.5, authorities have to
investigate. Those false alarms cost taxpayers money, though
neither the Coast Guard nor the state Department of
Transportation's Aviation Division has figures available.
</P>
<P>
   But this much is known: Nationwide, there were 3,468 distress
calls on the 121.5 frequency recorded by the Coast Guard between
July 1998 and July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, 56 were real distress calls.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the 13th Coast Guard District _ which covers
waters from the California-Oregon state line to Canada _ reported
88 alerts on the frequency between April and July.
</P>
<P>
   None of them was real distress calls, and to this day, 80
percent remain a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The beacons sent a signal to a satellite, then stopped
transmitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a guy will be washing his boat and hit the thing by
accident,'' says Coast Guard Lt. Adam Wasserman, a duty officer at
the district's command center in Seattle. ``Or it's someone's
garage door opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've caught the Navy a couple times. Someone's keyed a mike
on one of their aircraft and leaves it open and that can send a
signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Every incident must be investigated, which takes time,
especially because the troublesome beacons use anonymous signals.
Coded signals, such as those used on the 406-MHz band, can tell
searchers who the boat or plane belongs to, along with addresses
and phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Some newer planes and boats are equipped with the new beacons;
others aren't.
</P>
<P>
   It's not known how many boats and planes in Washington use the
121.5-MHz frequency, but the Coast Guard and the state Department
of Transportation would like to see boaters and pilots use the
406-MHz band, but haven't forced a change because of the high cost
of the new beacons.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they call it a safety issue.
</P>
<P>
   Because beacons on the 121.5-MHz frequency are so unreliable,
rescue workers are reluctant to dedicate planes and boats to
searches until they can prove there is a real emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``High false alarm rate makes first-alert launch infeasible,''
the Coast Guard's search-and-rescue manual reads. ``Absent
independent distress corroboration (command centers) must wait for
additional alert information. 121.5-MHz beacon launch decisions
take six hours longer than for 406-MHz beacons on average. Almost
half of aviation accident survivors perish in the first six hours
after the incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, an aeronautics program specialist with the state
Transportation Department, is disgusted with the frequency.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of out every 80 is probably real here,'' he says. ``I used
to figure the 121s had a 92 percent failure rate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard is less forgiving in its estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fewer than one in 100 alerts are actual distresses,''
according to a passage in the search-and-rescue manual.
</P>
<P>
   The 121.5-MHz beacon is uncoded, just a warbling tone for planes
to track.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to ascertain the situation is to dispatch
resources to investigate _ a costly disadvantage,'' the Coast Guard
manual reads.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has his own problems with the broadcasts, which fall into
two categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get one or two a month where it's something beside (an
emergency beacon) that's broken down or gone haywire,'' he said.
``We go and check it out and it turns out to be the machine at the
cellophane factory has gone crazy and is putting out that
frequency.''
</P>
<P>
   The other half?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first course of action is to call the local airport and
see if anyone has heard it,'' Lee says. ``Of course, no one has. So
we send a pilot up to look, and the pilot is just getting off the
ground and the signal goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   When the first report of an emergency beacon comes in by
satellite, it includes a preliminary set of coordinates, usually
accurate to within 10 to 20 kilometers, which is a lot of ground to
cover.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the unreliability, search authorities have become
reluctant to put their own people at risk based only on the
testimony of a 121.5-MHz beacon.
</P>
<P>
   And when they do search, the results are often anti-climactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horror stories?'' Lee asks. ``What kind of horror stories do
you want? About three weeks ago, we had in a garbage can at the
Fisherman's Terminal. About eight years ago, I had two Civil Air
Patrol squadrons digging through Olympia's garbage dump.''
</P>
<P>
   Most calls that come from the 121.5-MHz frequency take between
2{ and four hours to clear, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   And that fact sets rescue personnel to worrying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about the 121.5s is they stick in the back of your
mind,'' says Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Rich Howes, a duty officer at the
district command center. ``The 406s you can usually figure out with
a phone call. But the 121s just take forever, and you get one and
you're always kind of wondering `What was that?'''

REVIEW FINDS STATE WORKERS WERE TRYING TO INTERVENE WHEN BOY DIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT GAVIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. _ Laura Mjelde had a history of drug use and a
social welfare file filled with complaints of child neglect and
abuse, nearly all determined to be unsubstantiated. For months a
Washington state social worker had tried to get her into drug
testing and treatment, but she always found excuses to avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   By last September, the frustrated social worker became so
concerned about Mjelde's two children that he told his supervisor
he was prepared to take the case to court _ the first step in
taking the children from the mother. But Child Protective Services
officials decided they didn't have enough evidence for court
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month later, Mjelde's 14-month-old son, Christopher
Hutton, drowned in a bathtub in Renton, Wash., while under the care
of Mjelde's boyfriend, Stanley Red. Mjelde, Red, and Red's sister,
Cynthia, then cremated the baby, drinking brandy while the tiny
body burned in an aluminum trash can in a park. Prosecutors called
it a case that ``shocked the conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   The short life of Christopher Hutton today seems particularly
tragic, not because social workers turned their backs on him and
his older brother, but rather because they tried repeatedly to
protect them, according to a review by the Department of Social and
Health Services recently obtained by the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   The DSHS report, obtained under the state Public Records Act,
shows social workers closely monitoring the family and responding
quickly to complaints; threatening, pleading and encouraging Mjelde
to get help. It also reveals the frustrations and difficult
decisions facing social workers who, despite concerns for children,
must operate within a system that strives to keep children with
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Katharine Cahn, director of the Northwest Institute for Children
and Families, said the Hutton case is typical of chronic neglect
cases that are perhaps the hardest for social workers to gauge.
These cases are rarely clear-cut, Cahn said; they present no solid
evidence of abuse or imminent danger to children that would make it
an easy decision to take the children away.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the tightrope they walk,'' Cahn said. ``It's such a
momentous decision, the court requires review every step of the
way, and all of a sudden what looks simple becomes very, very
complex. People don't remove a child lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Katz, an instructor at the University of Washington's
School of Social Work, adds that caseworkers also must weigh the
potential of additional damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can absolutely do harm,'' she said. ``A 1-year-old baby
taken (from parents) would cry without ending. You can't say to the
kid, `Everything will be all right.' The child is devastated. They
lose weight. They don't sleep well. It's a terrible thing to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Mjelde's oldest son was placed in foster care after her arrest
in March. A child born to her in May while she was jailed was
reportedly placed with a family member.
</P>
<P>
   Mjelde, 22, who pleaded guilty to rendering criminal assistance
in connection with Christopher's death, is free on bail pending a
Sept. 24 sentencing, according to the King County Prosecutor's
Office. Prosecutors on that day will ask for a one-year jail term
and also will recommend 16 years for Stanley Red, who pleaded
guilty to first-degree manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   They also will seek a sentence of 30 days of community service
for Cynthia Red, who also has pled guilty to rendering criminal
assistance for her limited role in the cremation.
</P>
<P>
   The just-released DSHS internal review is the first in a
two-step process followed when a child dies while under agency
supervision. An independent panel, overseen by the state Department
of Health, is also conducting a review.
</P>
<P>
   While the internal review shows social workers tried to stay on
top of the case, Vicki Wallen, the state's Family and Children's
ombudsman, warned of an inherent conflict-of-interest in the DSHS
review process.
</P>
<P>
   She declined comment on specific cases, including that of
Christopher Hutton, but said her independent watchdog agency plans
its own study of how DSHS investigates itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you ensure an independent review when the information is
being provided by DSHS?'' Wallen asked.
</P>
<P>
   Mjelde first entered the child protection system nearly two
years before Christopher Hutton was born, according to the internal
review. In December 1995, King County sheriff's deputies responded
to an abuse complaint in south King County and found her oldest son
with scratches, marks on his face and legs, and blood and mucus
coming from his nose.
</P>
<P>
   Mjelde and a male friend claimed the boy had fallen, and a
doctor could not determine conclusively how the boy was injured. No
action was taken, but social workers tried to follow up, losing
track of Mjelde in March 1996, when she moved.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, Tukwila Police responded to another abuse
complaint involving her oldest son. Christopher was born a few
weeks later, on Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Social workers, investigating after Christopher's birth, found
no injuries, and a nutritionist who was working with the family
said the children seemed attached to their mother, and well-cared
for.
</P>
<P>
   Social workers determined the risk to the children was low, but
remained concerned about Mjelde's use of marijuana and other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   They warned her to stop and recommended parenting classes and
drug counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Another neglect complaint came in October 1997. This time,
social workers found a tidy apartment, the children well-cared for
and no evidence of drug use. Once again, they determined the risk
to the children was low.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a year, Mjelde was back in the system. Jailed on
outstanding warrants, she left Christopher, then 11 months old,
with a friend, who then passed him to another woman. Unable to care
for him, the woman called police. The report doesn't say where the
older child was at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher was dirty, but otherwise all right, according to the
review. Social workers placed him in foster care. When Mjelde was
released, they reunited the family on condition that she get safe
housing and treatment for drug and alcohol abuse. They also tried
to connect her with other services.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two months, social workers followed up several
times, at least once threatening to take her to court. Even after
Christopher's death in October _ which Mjelde kept hidden by
telling social workers he was with his father _ state workers
continued to check on Mjelde and insist she pursue drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
   At least twice before learning of Christopher's death, they
considered seeking court intervention, but determined they lacked
enough evidence. In December, an outside panel of experts, called
the Child Protection Team, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In January, DSHS officials finally thought they were ready to
seek custody of Mjelde's children.
</P>
<P>
   But then Renton Police called to say they believed Christopher,
who had been reported missing, was in fact dead.
</P>
<P>
   Mjelde confessed a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems as they are doing the job within reasonable
expectations,'' Cahn, of the Northwest Institute for Children and
Families said, of the social worker's actions. ``You go home, and
you never know. You hope you made the right decision. It's a
devilish choice _ damned if you, damned if you don't.''

<P>
   The memory, they say, is the first thing to go when the gray
hairs force unconditional surrender from the dark-colored ones atop
your head. But in this case, the longest-tenured football coach in
the Big 12 pleads extenuating circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Spike Dykes, 61, normally has recall abilities that would be the
envy of most circus elephants. So it produced a mild surprise when
the Texas Tech coach came home after a recent practice and gushed
about his starting quarterback. His wife, Sharon, said she'd heard
it all before. At the same time, last year.
</P>
<P>
   That's when it dawned on Dykes: Rob Peters, after an
injury-marred 1998 season, is ready to stun opponents the way he
did his coach during summer two-a-days. And not a moment too soon.
Tech opens its season Monday night against Arizona State at 7 p.m.
in Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I'd forgotten how good a healthy Rob Peters
is,'' Dykes said. ``We never got to see that in games last year.
Everything was out of sync a little bit. At times, he was
struggling ... to throw the routes you take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you watch him in practice now, and he can throw the deep
pass much better. He's better on the (sideline) routes and the
short ones, too. He's made remarkable improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters gets a thumbs-up review from his coach because a broken
thumb no longer impairs his throwing mechanics. Peters suffered a
chipped bone in his right thumb on the first play of the 1998
opener against UT-El Paso. After two weeks of inactivity, he spent
the rest of the season trying to compensate for the injury.
</P>
<P>
   He adjusted his grip to minimize the pain, which created
inconsistency with Peters' release. Some weeks, he looked like
Johnny Unitas. Witness his 322 passing yards in a 42-35 upset of
Texas. Other times, Peters resembled Johnny Come-Lately. Check out
his fourth-quarter benching after completing 10-of-23 passes, with
a couple of ill-timed turnovers, in a 20-17 loss to Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I really had to zip it, I wasn't sure where it would go.
The ball never came out the same way twice, especially on deep
throws,'' said Peters, who still completed 52.5 percent of his
attempts for 1,269 yards, with more touchdowns (9) than
interceptions (4). ``It feels great to throw with a normal grip
again. I can put the ball where I want it, when I want it there. My
confidence level is back where it needs to be.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, are his passes, thanks to off-season thumb surgery that
kept Peters out of spring practice. But the biggest questions
heading into Monday night's game are these: Who, besides flanker
Derek Dorris, will handle the brunt of those receptions? The other
four players in Tech's receiver rotation have combined for fewer
career catches (21) than Dorris had last season (28 receptions, 395
yards, 3 TDs).
</P>
<P>
   That begs the question: With the departure of leading receiver
Donnie Hart, a finalist for the 1998 Biletnikoff Award, can the Red
Raiders generate enough of an aerial threat to prevent defenses
from stacking the line to stop standout tailback Ricky Williams?
</P>
<P>
   Dykes said they can, pointing to Tim Baker, Justin Reed, Dee
Jackson and Darrell Jones as targets capable of eliminating
opponents' temptation to double-team Dorris. Although that foursome
combined for just 14 catches last season (10 of those by Baker),
Dykes predicted better days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after losing Donnie Hart, I think we will be improved
over last year at receiver. That position, as a group, will be more
productive,'' Dykes said, citing greater accuracy from Peters as a
primary factor that should lead to better stats.
</P>
<P>
   Peters, a fifth-year senior, said he's ready to accept the
challenge. A graduate student on pace to receive his master's
degree in the spring, Peters (6-foot-3, 229 pounds) understands the
need to increase his completion percentage and decrease his
penchant for turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   During narrow losses to Oklahoma (20-17), Missouri (28-26) and
Colorado (19-17) last season, four Peters fumbles and an
interception resulted in 31 points by opponents. As a team, Tech
suffered 26 turnovers last season, up from 14 in 1997. Peters said
his thumb surgery should help in that department as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have enough strength in my thumb to squeeze the ball
and hold it as well as I had in the past,'' Peters said. ``If I got
my hand slapped, I couldn't hold the ball. That shouldn't be a
problem anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor should starting his car, tying his shoes or throwing the
deep route _ three activities that caused shooting pain in 1998.
Peters said he understands if Dykes considers him a different
player than the one he witnessed last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone here has seen what I can do in a game
yet,'' Peters said. ``I'm just excited to finally get to play at
100 percent.'' nn

TCU DROPS HEARTBREAKER TO NO. 15 ARIZONA
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Patrick Batteaux's fourth-down pass bounced
twice and then dribbled a couple of inches farther.
</P>
<P>
   Only 50 seconds remained, so TCU's upset bid of No. 15 Arizona
dribbled away, too.
</P>
<P>
   Wildcats coach Dick Tomey and his crew had escaped from a
rain-soaked Amon Carter Stadium with a 35-31 victory Sunday night,
a victory that for so long looked to belong to coach Dennis
Franchione and his Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts, it really hurts,'' TCU safety Curtis Fuller said.
``I believe in my heart they are a real good football team, and we
were right there with them for four quarters. We blew some
coverages; they capitalized on our mistakes. We shut down the run,
passing was their only option.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it didn't matter that the Frogs led until late in
the third quarter and then again until only 2:10 remained. It was
then that the Wildcats grabbed the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it didn't matter that the Frogs' defense had two
safeties, three fumbles recovered, including one returned for a
touchdown and an interception. The Frogs' offense never quite was
able to capitalize.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it didn't matter that the Frogs had held the
Wildcats to 14 yards rushing on 37 attempts. The Wildcats simply
passed and passed and passed. Wildcats receiver Dennis Northcutt
finished with 10 catches for 257 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found a lot of different ways to get him the football,''
Franchione said of Northcutt. ``He was very hard to defend. ... We
didn't get enough pressure on their quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   They finished with 337 yards passing, including four touchdown
passes touchdowns in the second half. The game-winning one came
with 2:10 remaining, a 30-yard pass from Keith Smith to Northcutt.
</P>
<P>
   TCU had faced a fourth-and-inches with 4:18 remaining, but
Franchione decided to punt, setting up Arizona's game-winning
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a sound football play to punt the ball away,''
Franchione said. ``I changed my mind about 12 times in 30
seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs had one last chance and 2:01 to make something of it.
</P>
<P>
   They got as close as Arizona's 43-yard line, but Batteaux's
fourth-down pass was well short of Mike Scarborough's reach. TCU
finished with 204 yards rushing, including 170 by tailback
LaDainian Tomlinson, but only 77 yards passing.
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs frenzied comeback attempt was necessitated by
the Wildcats comeback.
</P>
<P>
   TCU had a 25-7 lead early in the third quarter. But unlike their
41-7 season-opening loss to Penn State, where Arizona got down and
stayed down, the Wildcats thawed after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona scored three touchdowns in the third quarter, all on
pass plays. There was a 38-yarder from Ortege Jenkins to Northcutt
followed by the 22-yarder from Jenkins to Brandon Manumaleuna and
capped by a another Jenkins-to-Northcutt score, a 59-yarder this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Arizona had a 28-25 lead.
</P>
<P>
   TCU responded with two Chris Kaylakie field goals, a 43-yarder
to end third-quarter scoring and a 44-yarder to open fourth-quarter
scoring and give TCU a 31-28 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs defense looked like they might be able to make it
stand up until Northcutt struck one more time. TCU's defense,
especially the front four, did what they had been doing ever since
the opening seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Leo Mills fumbled TCU's opening kickoff, forcing the
Wildcats to start at the 1-yard line. A couple of seconds later,
Frogs linebacker Shannon Brazzell tackled Trung Canidate for a
safety. Thirteen seconds had elapsed and TCU had a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   And so went most of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats couldn't get any type of running game going, and
the Frogs couldn't take advantage of the good field position. So
the Wildcats stopped trying to run the ball, and the Frogs managed
to turn some of the turnovers into scores.
</P>
<P>
   There was a 18-yard touchdown run by Tomlinson and a 51-yard
Kendrick Patterson fumble recovery and 8-yard pass from Batteaux to
Scarborough to send the Frogs into halftime thinking of an upset.
</P>
<P>
   There was Scarborough again, seemingly a lifetime later,
watching the ball bounce in front of him and the upset become the
one that got away. nn

LIONEL JACKSON SR., 84, PUBLISHER OF NEW HAVEN PAPERS UNTIL 1982
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn.)  (rk) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lionel S. Jackson Sr., the former publisher of The New Haven
Register and The New Haven Journal-Courier, died on Wednesday at
his home in Montecito, Calif. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who retired in the 1980s, was a son of John Day
Jackson, who bought The Journal-Courier, a morning paper, in 1925
to dovetail with The Register, the afternoon paper he already
owned.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Beginning in the late 1950s, when their father retired,
Jackson and his brother Richard controlled the paper together. But
Richard fell ill in the early 1970s, and Jackson became the sole
publisher of the two papers from 1972 to 1982, when his son, Lionel
Jackson Jr., succeeded him. Jackson was the company's chairman and
chief executive from 1981 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In May 1986, The Register and The Journal-Courier were bought
by the Ingersoll Publications Co. for $185 million. The
Journal-Courier closed in 1987 and The Register switched to morning
publication. The Register is now owned by The Journal Register Co.
of Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   A native of New Haven, Jackson attended Yale, worked at The
Register and served in the Army in World War II, rising to the rank
of first lieutenant. After the war, he resumed his newspaper
career.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was active in Connecticut nonprofit organizations,
including Yale-New Haven Hospital and the New Haven Symphony
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   His 1938 marriage to Patricia Woolsey ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son, who is traveling in Southeast Asia, he is
survived by his wife of a dozen years, the former Patricia Hope
Johnstone; two daughters, Suzanne Cartier of Manhattan and Sheila
Leach of San Francisco; five grandchildren; two
great-grandchildren, and a sister, Katherine Reese of Havre de
Grace, Md.

RAIN SHOWERS REPLACED BY TEARS AFTER FROGS FALTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ First came the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a forecast that TCU fans know all too well:
</P>
<P>
   Heartbreak. With an inevitable shower of tears.
</P>
<P>
   So fair and foul a night it was for TCU, a team that appeared to
have a thunderous upset within its grasp.
</P>
<P>
   After seizing opportunity after opportunity, while dazzling the
home crowd, the Horned Frogs squandered an 18-point lead and then
went quietly into the damp night. You could argue that they weren't
supposed to upset the 15th-ranked Arizona Wildcats, and they
didn't, losing 35-31.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that the Frogs sustained the ruse for nearly four
quarters made the night hard to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   At the intermission, TCU was outgaining the visiting 'Cats on
the ground, 163 yards to 3, and appeared to have a solid grip on
its 23-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With Patrick Batteaux and LaDainian Tomlinson sparking the
option, the Frogs were able to control both the clock and the
scoreboard. Tomlinson had 144 yards on the ground by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   An intriguing upset was on the verge of taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Press box archaeologists began scurrying for traces of the last
so-momentous TCU upset in a season opener _ the last time that the
Frogs had upset someone so truly good. We were back to 1943 and
Dutch Meyer _ 13-0 over Arkansas _ when we realized it wasn't going
to matter.
</P>
<P>
   For coach Dennis Franchione's young team, it could have been a
stunning affirmation, a golden reminder that their Sun Bowl triumph
over Southern Cal was no fluke. I would argue that playing the No.
15 team in the country off its feet for nearly four quarters is
affirmation enough.
</P>
<P>
   But for some Frog fans, this is going to be deja vu, TCU-style,
all over again.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Tomlinson finished with 170 yards rushing. The
defense held alleged Heisman candidate Trung Canidate to only 56
yards. It prompted Arizona coach Dick Tomey to go to his bench and
replace quarterback Keith Smith with the slipperier Ortege Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in the simplest of terms, the Frogs lost because they could
not cover the Wildcats' dazzling receiver Dennis Northcutt.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, Northcutt found a seam, a canyon, or a cavernous
opening in the TCU secondary. The Frogs gave Northcutt the respect
_ and the 10-yard cushion most of the night _ he richly deserved.
</P>
<P>
   But they never could really stop him. Northcutt finished with
257 yards in receptions and scored three touchdowns, including the
game-winner with 2:10 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Great teams are led by great players. Maybe, in time, Arizona
will prove to be the national power that it was forecast to be. In
Northcutt, the Penn State debacle aside, it has a solid start.
</P>
<P>
   How the Frogs view the toasting by Northcutt remains to be seen.
The Frogs remain young and precocious. And there was little shown
Sunday night to suggest that they should not be a favorite in the
Western Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   If one trait buttressed Franchione's team in last year's bowl
season, it was its resiliency, its ability to bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   With this team, we will see. This is a defeat that will be hard
to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   So fair and foul a night ... Batteaux mostly ran the option like
an experienced veteran. But his passing was inconsistent. When the
Frogs needed to play from behind, Batteaux failed to move the team.
</P>
<P>
   The first half, as it turned out, was a tease. Arizona rebounded
after the intermission and, for the most part, dominated the final
30 minutes, mostly because Jenkins and Smith kept finding
Northcutt.
</P>
<P>
   For TCU fans, what could have been a memorable night ended up
reeking of the familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Heartbreak, mixed with a shower of tears. nn

TCU'S TOMLINSON BLISTERS ARIZONA FOR 170 YARDS IN LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU running back LaDainian Tomlinson needed
five games last season before reaching the 100-yard mark in a
single game, and he managed it only twice in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, in front of a national television audience and
against a nationally ranked opponent, Tomlinson nearly had it by
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his 91 yards in the first two quarters and TCU's early
lead, the Frogs could not hold on in a 35-31 loss to Arizona at
Amon Carter Stadium. Tomlinson, who looked like a player headed for
the TCU record books early in the game, finished with 170 yards on
28 carries for an average of 6.1 yards per rush.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats slowed Tomlinson to one yard on a single carry in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   His day wasn't near the best all-time at TCU, but it was close
to the best in Tomlinson's resume.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-foot-11, 217-pound junior from Waco, Tomlinson's best game
was in 1997 when he rushed for 180 yards against Tulsa. Sunday
night's was second-best, ahead of two games of 165 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats had trouble early with Tomlinson's speed to the
corners, and he teamed with quarterback Patrick Batteaux on option
pitches to make Arizona pay. Tomlinson had runs of 10, 11, 15, 29,
19 and 11 yards in the first half and a rush of 29 in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, on a second-and-5 from the Arizona 29-yard
line, TCU pitched to Tomlinson to the left for an 11-yard gain and
a first down. On the next play, Tomlinson ran 15 yards for the
touchdown and a 9-0 TCU lead with 3:05 left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On first-and-20 from the Arizona 41 in the second quarter, the
Frogs elected to go with Tomlinson on four consecutive downs.
</P>
<P>
   A run for nine yards and oneyard set up a third-and-10 at the
Arizona 31. Tomlinson took an option pitch left and ran 19 yards
for the first down at the Arizona 12. After a four-yard Tomlinson
gain, TCU scored on a touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Tomlinson picked up seven yards and a
first down at the 25 with 4:47 left to put the Horned Frogs in
field-goal range. When the drive stalled, Chris Kaylakie kicked a
43-yard field goal to make it 28-28.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the third, Tomlinson had 27 carries for 169 yards.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, the Wildcats stacked the line of
scrimmage and took TCU's running game away. The Frogs went to the
air, and they took a 31-28 lead with 13:18 left in the game.
Arizona answered with a late touchdown, and TCU's final two drives
came up empty. nn

REV UP THE ZAMBONI, IT'S TIME TO HIT ICE AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ Repeat after me: There's not one thing bad about
winning the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually we're repeating after Mike Keane, the veteran
Dallas Stars winger who patiently attempted to explain that mantra
to a skeptical outsider Sunday after the team's first training camp
workout.
</P>
<P>
   The skeptic would be me, because I'm struggling to understand
how a team so fresh from a Stanley Cup championship that the beer
in the silver goblet's still cold can possibly be ready to rekindle
the same hunger that drove them through the most grueling trek in
team sports less than three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, my body hasn't recovered from Buffalo yet. How can the
Stars possibly be ready to play again? Granted, it's a poor analogy
since I'm generally wheezing after back-to-back computer baseball
games, but you get my drift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing bad comes from winning the Cup,'' Keane insisted again
as he straddled his mountain bike and prepared to peddle away from
little Dobson Arena, the Stars' late summer home away from home.
``Nothing. I see no other reason but to play for the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess some players play for the money, or the fame, but if
you win the Cup, the money and the fame and all those things come
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-eight days after the Stars sent Buffalo into a whining
pout with a Game 6 triple-overtime victory to win the Stanley Cup,
they were back on the ice here Sunday morning, beginning the
arduous journey all over again.
</P>
<P>
   This must be somebody's idea of a cruel joke. Since it has
brought us all together at this playground for the rich and famous
for a few days, however, I'm all for it.
</P>
<P>
   I just haven't quite figured out how they're going to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it just Sunday that we were watching Brett Hull, skating
on one leg, score the final game-winning goal over a sprawled out
Dominik Hasek? Didn't we just reach for our hankies as Mike Modano
wept openly in the Stars' emotion-choked locker room?
</P>
<P>
   ``We counted the number of days we had (until camp) as soon as
that day was over,'' Modano admitted after a lively and vocal
practice session. ``It was something like 70, but suddenly it's
single digits and then you're here again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully as the season goes on we'll get more of a hunger
going. Complacency is a word (coach Ken Hitchcock) is probably
going to be using a lot. Teams will be grading themselves against
us every night. Hopefully that will give us a little push. You get
that winning feeling, you want to keep it, you want to have it.
Always.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't be easy. Dynasty is fast becoming a lost word in
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Detroit had the best chance to have a dynasty like
Edmonton did in the '80s,'' Keane said. ``They won two in a row.
But the game has changed with free agency. Key players get hurt.
This year they couldn't get past Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate is now on for the Stars. Sure, they've discovered the
formula for winning the Cup. But will they be as hungry the second
time around? Will they be as willing to make the sacrifices that
have to be made knowing how difficult it is, especially now that
they will always be able to say they played for a Stanley Cup
champion?
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you have the key, the lock and the door, and you
don't want to give that up,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``You feel
like you have all those aspects and you're not interested in giving
that up to anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I thought I knew about winning, there's another
level out there that I didn't recognize. We're not prepared to let
that feeling go.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, an avid Civil War historian, often finds motivational
techniques there that he can apply to coaching the Stars. But even
the Union didn't have to win back-to-back Lincoln Cups.
</P>
<P>
   Hitch's Juniors teams, however, won six championships in seven
years. He knows a little bit about repeating.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I learned is that it's not people chasing you, it's not
people going after you, it's you focusing only on yourself,''
Hitchcock said. ``When you get where we're at, the focus changes to
nothing but yourself. You have no focus on anything to the outside.
Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't worry about what other teams are doing. You don't
worry about what other teams are saying. You're not focused on what
trade another team has made or what elevation they're going to,
you're focused on only yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The process gets easier now, said Keane, who should know, since
he has three Stanley Cups (Montreal, Colorado, Dallas) on his
resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've won a Cup, you know what it takes to win,'' he
said. ``People look at you, they see a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   I look at this team and I still see Buffalo. I still see the
sweat, the blood, the tears from 23 playoff games, eight of which
went into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   I still hear the whining.
</P>
<P>
   And you're telling me it starts all over again in less than a
month?
</P>
<P>
   I don't think I'm ready for this but don't worry boss, I'm
willing to train right here in Vail for as long as it takes. nn

DETERMINED WINGER AIMS FOR SPOT ON STARS ROSTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ Jamie Wright has added seven pounds of muscle to
his six-foot frame. But maybe even more important for the Stars'
hopeful winger-to-be, he added a good dose of determination.
</P>
<P>
   Wright on Sunday was one of the standouts of the Stars' first
training camp workouts, scoring two goals in the intrasquad
scrimmage. It was a welcome opening act for a player who said he
might be running out of chances to impress the critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I see this as a do-or-die season for me,'' said
the 24-year-old winger who has had mixed results in two tries at
earning a permanent spot on the Stars. ``I understand my situation,
and now is the time for me to make a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Two seasons ago, Wright was good enough to play in 21
regular-season games and five playoff games with the Stars. Last
season, he wasn't even invited to hang around as a spare part in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot more time than anyone else to think about things
this summer. I had a good 31/2 months to work out,'' he said of his
improved conditioning. ``I was obviously excited that they were
able to win the Stanley Cup, but there's also a bad taste that I
wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said he sees the change in Wright's
determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen him?'' Hitchcock responded. ``Just looking at
him, he's a different player. He's matured.'' SEVERYN SAVED
</P>
<P>
   The NHL has reversed its decision and will include Brent
Severyn's name on the Stanley Cup, Stars general manager Bob Gainey
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Severyn, who did not meet the NHL's criteria of playing in 41
regular-season games or one game of the Stanley Cup Finals, played
all of last season with the Stars and was included after an appeal
was lodged by the Stars _ an appeal that was pushed through by
Stars winger Mike Keane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the whole organization really, all the players and
everything,'' Keane said of the push to include his former
teammate. ``Sevy was a part of that team from the start. He
deserved to be on the Cup, so we just let them know that.'' NEW
SLOGAN
</P>
<P>
   Coach Ken Hitchcock has used a slogan for his previous three
training camps and has a new one this season _ ``Enjoy the
Challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to face every team's best efforts every time we go
out and we might as well be ready for it,'' center Guy Carbonneau
said. ``In the end, it could make us a better team.'' NO ADVANTAGE
</P>
<P>
   While the Stars might find it difficult to breathe in the high
altitude of the Rocky Mountains, they'll get no conditioning
advantage from six days in Vail, Colo., said J.J. McQueen, the
Stars' strength and conditioning coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to be up here 4-6 weeks to feel any difference and
I'm not sure it would make that much of a difference,'' McQueen
said.
</P>
<P>
   What the Stars are taking advantage of is a cool climate and a
great atmosphere for training and camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think just walking out the door, it makes things easier to
get back to work up here,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   McQueen said his plan is to work the players just enough to make
them feel it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to complement the on-ice workouts and practices,''
McQueen said. ``We don't want to wear them out and let them have
nothing left for the scrimmages. We just want to push their
conditioning.'' HEALTH REPORT
</P>
<P>
   Winger Grant Marshall said he'll likely only play in two
preseason games due to a severe tear of his left groin muscle he
sustained in the playoffs. Marshall can participate in light
skating, but will not go through any on-ice drills at training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   The other Stars' injuries, however, are responding well. Brett
Hull is working out and said he feels ``a lot better than I thought
I would'' after suffering a tear of the medial collateral ligament
in his right knee and two pulled groins in the playoffs. Mike
Modano's fractured thumb has healed and now he said he experiences
only a little pain from strained ligaments in his thumb.

STARS OPEN CAMP FILLED WITH GUSTO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ Mike Modano skated up and down the ice, making
plays and almost glowing with a new inner leadership. Joe
Nieuwendyk glided through practice as if he was still playing in
the Stanley Cup playoffs. And Brett Hull declined an invitation to
sit out a full-contact scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day back to the NHL grind _ the official start of
training camp _ the defending Stanley Cup champion Stars on Sunday
surprised their coach. And maybe even themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in here a little cautious and concerned. But the
moment they skated out onto the ice, all the apprehension
disappeared,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``The veterans went
out and had a lot of fun and really enjoyed themselves. To tell you
the truth, I think everyone is excited to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Greeted by a sunny day with temperatures in the 70s, two groups
of the Stars' 53 players chugged through an on-ice practice, an
off-ice workout and an intrasquad scrimmage that created a buzz of
fans and media around the Dobson Ice Arena. And while many expected
there to be a severe hangover after a short summer left little time
to rehabilitate, the Stars showed they're ready to defend their
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if excited is the word, but it is good to be
back,'' said Nieuwendyk, just two months removed from winning the
Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff's most valuable player. ``There were
a lot of turnovers and you could see some rust, but there were also
some pretty good plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The scrimmage highlighted the day's activities as Hitchcock
chose to break up his old combinations and move some of his star
players onto lines with newcomers fighting for jobs. The results,
for at least one day, were sensational.
</P>
<P>
   Modano played on a line with wingers Jamie Wright and Jon Sim _
both fighting for a roster spot. Wright scored two goals.
</P>
<P>
   Hull played with Mike Keane and 27-year-old center Pavel Patera,
an import from the Czech Republic who will be a roster regular for
the Stars this season. The trio were exciting every time they were
on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk played beside Jere Lehtinen and Warren Luhning,
helping Luhning score a goal in his first workout with the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Blake Sloan played beside Guy Carbonneau, Jamie Pushor took
shifts with Darryl Sydor and Shawn Chambers often played beside
Brad Lukowich _ continuing the apprentice program.
</P>
<P>
   In each situation, Hitchcock found a solid balance between
veterans and newcomers. The veterans helped the newcomers learn and
the newcomers helped the veterans pick up the pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sometimes nice to go back and be with the young guns,''
Modano said. ``It's kind of refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said the balance was so important, he plans to follow
through during the team's nine preseason games, which begin
Saturday at Reunion Arena against the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't give a player who has the potential to make the team
a real opportunity unless you put him with legitimate players,''
Hitchcock said. ``I don't think you get a true look at them until
that's there. So that's what we're going to do for the next 31/2
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said the speed of the young players and the push to
incorporate more passing through the neutral zone created more
scoring chances on the first day of workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's evident we can get around the ice a lot quicker and make
plays a lot quicker,'' Hitchcock said. ``And we saw against teams
like Buffalo that, when you have footspeed, you can give people a
lot of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   And on a day when there was concern that the challenges would be
presented mostly to the Stars, that was a welcome realization. nn

STOUTMIRE WAIVED AS COWBOYS TRIM TO 53
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The release of former starting safety Omar
Stoutmire was one 17 roster moves made by the Dallas Cowboys on
Sunday to comply with the NFL's 53-man limit.
</P>
<P>
   But it's clear that the Cowboys aren't through maneuvering their
final roster heading into Sunday's season opener against the
Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who was unavailable to comment,
huddled with coach Chan Gailey and members of the scouting
department late into the evening at the team's Valley Ranch
headquarters analyzing possible additions from the league waiver
wire.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are likely looking for help at cornerback, running
back and tight end.
</P>
<P>
   The release of Beau Morgan and Denvis Manns leaves the Cowboys
without a backup to running backs Emmitt Smith and Chris Warren.
Former Cowboys running back Sherman Williams is being considered.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys need to bolster their depth at cornerback because of
the uncertainty surrounding the availability of injured veterans
Deion Sanders (toe) and Kevin Smith (back). Both could miss the
first two games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Mathis and Charlie Williams are slated to start against
the Redskins, but they are backed up by rookie free-agent Duane
Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   The problem at tight end stems from an injury as well. With
rookie seventh-round pick Mike Lucky out four to six weeks with a
stress fracture in his left foot, the Cowboys are without a true
run-blocking tight end to backup starter David LaFleur and work in
their two-tight-end offense.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the Cowboys can find a good financial
fit on the waiver wire to fill in until Lucky comes back. Other
stop-gap answers include using defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban or an
extra offensive lineman to play tight end on short-yardage
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Stoutmire's departure likely paved the way for the salary-cap
strapped Cowboys to field a practice squad, which can consist of no
more than five players. Morgan and rookie receiver MarTay Jenkins
top the list of possible practice candidates. The decisions will be
made this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of Sunday's moves include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Linebacker Robert Thomas beating out Ryan Neufeld and David
McCann to back up Daryl Johnston at fullback.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former TCU receiver Jason Tucker making the squad as the sixth
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cowboys keeping six defensive tackles _ Michael Myers,
Alonzo Spellman, Darren Benson, Nathan Davis, Brandon Noble and
Chad Hennings. When the Cowboys need a roster spot to add another
player they will look to this position, as only Spellman, Hennings
and Davis are sure bets to be with the team for the season opener.

CATCHING UP AT THE U.S. OPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
MEN'S RECAP
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recapping the first week: Three of the top six seeds exited
before the end of the first day when No. 1 Pete Sampras pulled out
before playing a point because of a back injury, No. 4 Patrick
Rafter withdrew in the fifth set of his first-round match against
Cedric Pioline because of shoulder tendinitis, and No. 6 Tim Henman
lost in straight sets to Guillermo Canas. That robbed the bracket
of two of its marquee players and another who seemingly had an
outside chance to win it all. By the end of the week, third-seed
Yevgeny Kafelnikov was guaranteeing that only he, Andre Agassi or
Richard Krajicek could win the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite: Andre Agassi. Agassi was having a great year anyway,
losing only four matches since winning the French Open. Three of
those were to Sampras, so Agassi became the heavy favorite when the
top seed pulled out. Agassi showed the role was deserved by
dropping just one set in winning his first three matches.
</P>
<P>
   Challengers: Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Richard Krajicek, Todd Martin,
Greg Rusedski. All have games well suited to the hard courts of the
National Tennis Center, and with the exception of Martin's tough
five-set victory in the first round against Stephane Huet, had
little problems advancing to the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   Possible breakthroughs: Marcelo Rios, Gustavo Kuerten. Rios, the
No. 10 seed, is into the fourth round at the Open for the first
time. However, a quarterfinal date with Agassi looms. Kuerten,
perceived as a clay-court specialist, has a clear path to the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead: Martin and Rusedski, are the best two hard-court
players in the top half of the bracket, but they meet in the fourth
round tomorrow. Kafelnikov and Krajicek are on a collision course
to meet in the quarterfinals, with the winner likely to face
Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN'S RECAP
</P>
<P>
   Recapping the first week: The women's bracket was more notable
for what happened off the court than on it, with a mild war of
words between the Williams family and top-seeded Martina Hingis.
Richard Williams predicted his daughters, Venus and Serena, would
meet in the final, prompting Hingis to comment on the mouth size of
the father and his offspring. Hingis later extended an olive branch
to papa Williams in the form of an autographed T-shirt. The best
stories on the court were Jennifer Capriati, who continued her
comeback with an upset of No. 11 Nathalie Tauziat, and Anke Huber,
who beat No. 8 Jana Novotna and No. 15 Amelie Mauresmo.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite: Hingis. The Smiling Assassin is refocused after losing
in the first round and as deadly as ever, dropping just 21 games in
winning her first four matches.
</P>
<P>
   Challengers: Lindsay Davenport, Venus Williams, Monica Seles,
Serena Williams. While Hingis and the two Williamses got all the
attention, Davenport cruised into the fourth round. The defending
champion lost a mere seven games in winning her first three
matches. The Williams sisters both struggled, Serena dropping a set
in the third round and Venus in the fourth, but toughened up when
it counted.
</P>
<P>
   Possible breakthrough: Barbara Schett. The 12th seed dropped
just two games in winning her third- and fourth-round matches. Next
up, though, is Venus Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead: Only Huber and Schett stand in the way of a dream
semifinal between Hingis and Venus Williams. Inconsistent Mary
Pierce is the only real obstacle between Davenport and the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   COMEBACK KIDS
</P>
<P>
   Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati were teen-agers when they
staged a match for the ages in the 1991 semifinals. Seles prevailed
in a third-set tie-breaker and went on to beat Martina Navratilova
in the final.
</P>
<P>
   They meet again today in the fourth round in different
circumstances. Seles, whose stellar career was sidetracked when she
was stabbed on the court in 1993, is seeded fourth. Capriati, who
missed two years after being arrested for marijuana possession and
shoplifting, is unseeded.
THE OTHER GERMAN
</P>
<P>
   Steffi Graf has retired, but there's still a German in the Open
quarterfinals. Anke Huber, ranked No. 27 in the world, advanced
with a 6-4, 6-4 victory against 15th-seeded Amelie Mauresmo, one
round after knocking off eighth-seeded Jana Novotna.
SHOT OF THE DAY
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Haas hit a between-the-legs shot for a clean winner in his
match against Hicham Arazi.
SINGIN' IN THE RAIN
</P>
<P>
   Inclement weather wreaked havoc with the schedule. Martina
Hingis and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario were scheduled to play in the
morning session, but ended up toiling under the lights. Two of the
men's fourth-round matches still were in the early stages when
another rain delay hit at 10:30 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast calls for lots more thunderstorms today, and a
chance for rain the next four days.
QUOTE OF THE DAY
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Medvedev said he would consider marrying girlfriend Huber
if he wins the Open. Responded Huber: ``If I win it, I'll consider
it, too.''

VAUGHN A SCAPEGOAT FOR ANGELS' TROUBLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Mo Vaughn is getting a few boos at Edison Field these
days, probably because some fans expect more for $80 million, which
Vaughn will get over the life of his six-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Fans also might put some blame on him for some of the discord in
the clubhouse, because he came with expectations of being a
clubhouse leader.
</P>
<P>
   But general manager Bill Bavasi, who orchestrated the free-agent
deal to bring in Vaughn, doesn't think it's fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problems aren't because of what happened with Mo,'' Bavasi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn went 0 for 3 with two walks Sunday and is now hitting
.262 with 23 homers and a team-leading 83 RBI. His home run and RBI
totals project to 27 and 99, despite missing 22 games and being
hampered all season with a severely sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Hurting: Maybe Chuck Finley and Tim Salmon have been hanging
around each other a little too much lately.
</P>
<P>
   Both arrived at the ballpark Sunday complaining of bad backs,
and both were sent out for precautionary MRI exams.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who was scheduled to start Sunday against the Yankees,
has been bothered by a sore back since his last start in Cleveland
last Tuesday. He is expected to make his next start, probably
Friday in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, who initially was diagnosed with a strained lower back,
pinch-hit in the sixth inning Sunday and walked.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the call: The Angels will promote three players from the
minors Tuesday _ catchers Bret Hemphill and Steve Decker and
outfielder Jeff DaVanon.
</P>
<P>
   DaVanon was one of the three minor-leaguers acquired in the
trade that sent Randy Velarde and Omar Olivares to the A's last
month. DaVanon was playing at Double-A in the A's organization
before the trade but has played well at Triple-A Edmonton for the
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   In 32 games with the Trappers, DaVanon is hitting .325 with six
homers and 19 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Percival waits: Troy Percival's three-game suspension for
hitting the Indians' David Justice with a pitch last Tuesday is
being appealed, but Percival doesn't know when his case will be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   The league has asked him to have his appeal conducted on the
phone because the Angels won't be in New York, where the league
offices are located, again this season.

IN 20 YEARS, ESPN HAS CHANGED THE FACE OF SPORTS BROADCASTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Conn. _ Ten weeks ago, when Tony Hawk turned the first
``900'' in a skateboarding competition, it was not only fitting
that ESPN be there to record the event, it was pretty much
required, dude.
</P>
<P>
   Hawk was competing, after all, in the X (for extreme) Games, an
invention of ESPN, which 20 years ago launched itself into the
cable consciousness with these words from sportscaster Lee Leonard:
``If you're a fan, if you're a fan, what you'll see in the next
minutes, hours and days to follow may convince you you've gone to
sports heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who only remember skateboarding as a playground
activity of the '60s, a ``900'' is boarder-talk for 2{ revolutions
in the air _ a full 900 degrees. To all you throwbacks, as well as
all the sports widows/widowers out there, Leonard's words may seem
a tad overinflated. But to a new generation of athletes, as well as
millions of people who are happy to watch sports programming
twenty-four/seven, Leonard was a prophet. Over the ensuing two
decades, ESPN has done what every entrepreneur dreams: It found a
need and filled it. Along the way, it also changed the way sports
fans get their information.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some will argue that ESPN created the need, that 20
years ago most Americans really had no wish to see the professional
slo-pitch softball world series (ESPN's first live event), or an
installment of pro beach hockey hosted by a bikini babe (one of its
more recent inventions; the game, that is, not the babe).
</P>
<P>
   ESPN anchor Chris Berman disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not have been the sports you wanted to see,
necessarily,'' he said recently, ``... but there's an audience for
all of those, and we believed there were people out there just like
us that wanted to see sports 24 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman, one of the first broadcasters to make humor a regular
part of sports reportage, should know. Tomorrow at 4 p.m. he'll
host a three-hour special on ESPN's 20th anniversary. He's been
there for all but three weeks of those 20 years, and vividly
recalls the early days, such as the time he did play-by-play for a
darts tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever do a replay on darts?'' he asked. ```Ooh, nice wrist
action. Really good!'''
</P>
<P>
   Berman, who remembers when ESPN amounted to three satellite
dishes and 70 employees, is unapologetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper,'' he admitted, ``we looked like a wing and a prayer.
But I will say this: We never put junk on.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong words from a guy who works for a company that now has 25
dishes and 2,100 employees who have to find enough sports-related
stuff _ we didn't say junk _ to fill 24 hours on not one, but five,
cable channels: ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN Classic, ESPNEWS and ESPN
International.
</P>
<P>
   That's only the foreword of the book on ESPN. If there were a
dictionary illustration for ``branding,'' it might well be the ESPN
logo.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there aren't many serious sports nuts who can get through
a day without tuning in ESPN cable or listening to ESPN Radio or
logging on to ESPN.com or leafing through ESPN The Magazine. Heck,
in Baltimore, Chicago and, soon, New York City, they can do it all
and have dinner, too, at ESPN Zone, the latest in themed restaurant
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   This explosion of ESPN's presence has happened mostly in the
'90s, especially after Walt Disney Co.'s 1996 acquisition of
Capital Cities/ABC Inc., which had owned 80 percent of ESPN since
1984. With Disney's deep pockets and marketing savvy, ESPN is the
Microsoft of sports information: No. 1, and a couple of light years
ahead of the competition. But where Microsoft is perceived by many
as arrogant, ESPN is like your best buddy.
</P>
<P>
   It all started with Bill Rasmussen in 1978. Rasmussen, public
relations director of the New England Whalers of the old World
Hockey Association, wanted to build a sports network in
Connecticut. He figured one of the linchpins would be Whalers
telecasts, a sure way to build interest in the team, which had
moved from Boston to Hartford in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The dream eventually expanded to accommodate a national vision
and, bankrolled by the Getty Oil Co., Rasmussen launched the
Entertainment and Sports Programming Network on Sept. 7, 1979, with
the first edition of ``SportsCenter.''
</P>
<P>
   Building credibility is crucial to any television start-up.
ESPN's got a boost when veteran NBC sportscaster Jim Simpson signed
on a week after liftoff. But the real turning point came in March
1980, when ESPN aired the obscure early-round games of the NCAA
basketball tournament, featuring a motormouth analyst named Dick
Vitale.
</P>
<P>
   Fans loved it, and after Simpson taught Vitale the value of
coming up for air _ he had Vitale's microphone cut during one
telecast _ Vitale became the love-him-or-hate-him mainstay of
basketball on ESPN. He was loud, obnoxious, funny and the
antithesis of the traditionally colorless ``color commentator.''
His presence and his patois _ ``it's awesome, bay-bee!'' _ made the
broadcast an event that was sometimes bigger than the game.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are Web sites devoted to getting Vitale off the air,
but others cherish the humorous, self-deprecating,
you-know-as-much-as-we-do style that is the hallmark of ESPN. Some
Web sites offer dictionaries to help decipher Vitale's own patter;
some pay tribute to Berman and the hundreds of nicknames he has
bestowed on athletes, such as Bert ``Be Home'' Blyleven and Roberto
``Remember The'' Alomar; others focus on the inventive ways
``SportsCenter'' anchors describe home runs, such as Dan Patrick's
``it's deep and I don't think it's playable'' and Stuart Scott's
``boo-yah!''
</P>
<P>
   In Vitale-speak, ESPN has made ``prime-time players'' of several
anchors. Berman, Patrick, Scott and Kenny Mayne are among fan
favorites still drawing a paycheck in Bristol, which is a hundred
miles from New York, a hundred miles from Boston, and across the
street from the world's skinniest skyscraper, which Otis Elevator
Co. uses to crash-test its products.
</P>
<P>
   Others have left the semirural charms of central Connecticut for
bigger bucks and higher profiles, notably Craig Kilborn, who jumped
to Comedy Central and is now hosting his own late-night talk show
on CBS, and the celebrated Keith Olbermann, who left ESPN to join
MSNBC, then left MSNBC to join Fox Sports Net, Rupert Murdoch's
ESPN wannabe.
</P>
<P>
   Al Jaffe, vice president of talent negotiation and production
recruitment at ESPN, says there's no requirement that a
``SportsCenter'' anchor be a comedian. The majority, in fact, are
pretty straight shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the heart of everything,'' Jaffe said, ``is sports
knowledge. There isn't one anchor here who doesn't know sports
really well.''
</P>
<P>
   But they also have more than a passing interest in literature,
history, pop culture, whatever, and can salt their sports reports
with esoterica pulled right out of left field. They do go overboard
at times. Movie buff Rich Eisen recently performed a spoof of ``The
Blair Witch Project'' to spotlight the Chicago Bears' quarterback
woes (``The Which Bear Project''). And Scott, one of ESPN's most
creative anchors, sometimes seems to forget he's doing a sports
show, not a comedy routine.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe says management neither encourages nor discourages the
shticky stuff. Rather, it stresses the avoidance of ``cookie
cutter'' journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I don't want is the 40-regular, off-the-rack style,''
Jaffe said. ``When we're hiring, the question John Walsh always
asks is, `Are they smart?'''
</P>
<P>
   John Walsh is senior vice president and executive editor of
ESPN. A relative newcomer _ he came aboard in 1990 _ Walsh spent
much of his career in print journalism, including tours at Rolling
Stone, the Washington Post, U.S. News &AMP; World Report and Inside
Sports.
</P>
<P>
   He has overseen ESPN's expansion this decade, always aware that
good television starts with good writing. ESPN anchors write their
own material, and anchor applicants have to write a mock show so
Walsh can see if they're good writers or simply good readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can judge it by grammar,'' Walsh said, ``by the way they
choose their sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh chooses his sentences carefully when describing ESPN's
impact on sports journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's presumptuous of me to talk about it,'' he said. But he
does remember going to a meeting of New England sports editors once
and being amazed at how many said they used ``SportsCenter'' as a
guide for the next day's sports pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed it,'' Walsh said. ``It was unfathomable. I was
the last guy to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh is probably being modest, because he tends to agree with
Jaffe's contention that ``we are still the sports network of
record. Sports fans are afraid not to watch us.''
</P>
<P>
   That goes double for local sportscasters. ESPN has so changed
the sports landscape that the late sports reports on local TV
rarely provide complete, league-wide scores. They focus on the home
teams, figuring that viewers have already gotten their national
information from ESPN or a competitor like CNN/SI or Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Johnson, an associate professor in the Edward R. Murrow
School of Communications at Washington State University, considers
ESPN the sports equivalent of CNN. Just as we've become accustomed
to turning to CNN when national or international news breaks, he
said, we expect ESPN to be on top of the big sports story.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything is going to happen in sports,'' Johnson said,
``you pretty well know ESPN is going to have it.'' The corollary,
he said, is that ``local stations know they'd better cover local
stories because that's how they can distinguish themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN programming is so pervasive that athletes can't help but
notice. ``SportsCenter,'' ESPN's flagship program of daily
highlights, is sometimes on the air as often as 12 hours a day _
three hours live and the rest on tape. Along with ``Jerry
Springer,'' it is a favorite in locker rooms around the country
because it's human nature to see if you've made the highlight reel.
</P>
<P>
   This has led critics to suggest that ESPN is changing the way
team sports are played, and some ESPN reporters are sensitive to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It concerns me,'' anchor Dan Patrick admitted. ``It concerns
me that we value dunks, that if you can dunk you're a great player.
That's not the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, Patrick decreed that one edition of
``SportsCenter'' be dunk-free. He said production assistants
grumbled, but they managed to comply until the final highlight,
when a dunk sneaked in because it's just one of those automatic
things that people don't even think about when putting together
highlight clips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were apologizing to the viewers because we showed a dunk,''
Patrick recalled with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   But the awareness has stayed with him, even if Dick Glover,
ESPN's executive vice president of programming, doesn't entirely
agree that ESPN might be showing youngsters an unseemly sort of
behavior by focusing, say, on Shawn Kemp's histrionics after a
dramatic dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Glover says ESPN would be roundly criticized if it didn't show
the complete truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In point of fact,'' he said of this chicken-and-egg issue,
``we wish we had the power that people sometimes think we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most visible sign of ESPN's influence is the ABC
television series ``Sports Night,'' which Aaron Sorkin created
because he got hooked on ``SportsCenter'' while holed up in a hotel
writing the film ``The American President.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin wanted to create something that spoke to him the way the
accessible, intelligent people on ``SportsCenter'' did. He speaks
for sports fanatics across America, skateboarders and non, when he
says, ``I felt like this is a place I'd like to work. This is a
place where I could meet my best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The ESPN empire
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1979 by Bill Rasmussen, ESPN was controlled by the
Getty Oil Co. for the first five years. When Getty merged with
Texaco in 1984, it sold its 85 percent interest to Capital
Cities/ABC Inc., which had bought 15 percent of ESPN earlier that
year. ABC, now a unit of Walt Disney Co., sold a 20 percent
interest in the company to Nabisco, which sold its share to Hearst
Corp. in 1990. The 80/20 split between Disney/ABC and Hearst
continues today.
</P>
<P>
   _ ESPN. Twenty-year-old flagship sports-television network
reaching 76 million homes.
</P>
<P>
   _ ESPN2. Launched in 1993, the ``second'' ESPN now reaches 65
million homes.

<P>
   _ ESPNEWS. All-day sports news network launched in 1996.

   _ ESPN Classic. Created in 1997 when ESPN acquired Classic
Sports Network, a 24-hour channel featuring footage of historic

on radio, with more than 600 affiliates.

I CONFESS; I PAID NO ATTENTION TO ESPN DURING ITS START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story drifted through the sports department about some cable
outfit back East that was going to do a 24-hour sports network,
even though it had almost no major sports contracts, or even local
sports to fill time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' I said to someone in the office, ``is an idea that's
so dead a cat wouldn't eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, go ahead and laugh at me now. But remember, I said the
same thing about Microsoft and Amazon.com. So there.
</P>
<P>
   I paid no attention to ESPN during its start _ hey, in '79 I was
trying to get over the death of Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols by
converting to the Bee Gees. Maybe you can appreciate the
distraction.
</P>
<P>
   But by the spring of 1980, the NCAA men's basketball tournament
was about to fire up again, the year after the epic championship
match between Michigan State's Magic Johnson and Indiana State's
Larry Bird gave college hoops such an adrenaline spike.
</P>
<P>
   That spring was also when the Seattle SuperSonics were defending
their NBA championship and Bird and Johnson had been through
Seattle for the first time as pro rookies. Basketball hereabouts
was large.
</P>
<P>
   It would be fun to reveal that during a time of high hoops
interest ESPN showed me some great NBA national coverage that would
be useful in comparing with the champion Sonics. But ESPN didn't
televise the NBA. Nor did ESPN televise the Final Four, which
remains to this day the province of the broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   It would be fun to say I enjoyed ESPN's telecast of the early
rounds of the tournament, which I had never seen before. While
there was some entertainment there, I couldn't get over this one
monumentally annoying color analyst, who shouted every sentence and
closed them all with ``bay-bee!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I thought, it's a rookie network that has to let everyone
try out. That clown won't make the first cut.
</P>
<P>
   What I did find helpful and amusing that spring was an ESPN
telecast, or maybe it was a long highlight, that few others might
remember _ the finals of the National Invitation Tournament, which
back then had a little fizz because the NCAA hadn't yet expanded
its field all the way to the Van Allen radiation belt.
</P>
<P>
   In this game was a skinny 7-foot-4 freshman who brought the ball
up the floor, shot from outside and ran with the grace of someone a
foot shorter. He had 15 points and 15 rebounds, leading Virginia to
a 58-55 win over Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, I had never heard of Ralph Sampson. After that TV
flash, I figured I had seen athletic genius in its obscure genesis.
For a young sportswriter, this was cool, because I knew something
most of my colleagues and rivals didn't. Those things were coins of
my new professional realm.
</P>
<P>
   Bad break, however, for feline diets everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't know was the wise guys had already discovered
ESPN. What I came to learn over the past 20 years is that there are
no more Sampson-like coins, because ESPN has made sure nothing is
obscure.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone under 30, it's probably hard to believe that someone
of Sampson's extraordinary talents was once a regional secret.
Today, of course, all of America would know about a gifted 7-foot-4
freshman down to his junior prom date.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this is good or bad is a matter for social
anthropologists. But it's hard to deny that a well-done, 24-hour
sports channel has transformed the sporting landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes alter their games to create a highlight worthy of
national telecast. Teams change schedules and routines to
accommodate ESPN attention. Media types track its coverage to shape
their own work. New sports plot how their games will show on ESPN.
And ESPN can invent its own events, the X Games, and not be shamed
into surrendering the silliness.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that ESPN's 20th anniversary today is a sufficient
cultural touchstone to draw A-1 of this newspaper is testimony to
its reach and influence _ not to mention a slow news day.
</P>
<P>
   Without ESPN bringing sports to the sports nation, would:
</P>
<P>
   _Anyone have heard of the Big East Conference?
</P>
<P>
   _Shawn Kemp have grabbed his crotch after a dunk?
</P>
<P>
   _Dick Vitale be anything but a vacuum-cleaner salesman with a
limp, having had his foot crushed in doorways endless times?
</P>
<P>
   _Bert Blyleven be known more for the Chris Berman-bestowed
middle name ``Be Home By'' instead of a stalwart pitching career?
</P>
<P>
   _Drunken college kids spend a fair chunk of the semester
gyrating behind ESPN's live remote talking-head set on game days so
they could show mom and dad back home what a rotten investment that
tuition money was?
</P>
<P>
   _Stuart Scott have taken smug hipness to frontiers unknown even
to Pat O'Brien?
</P>
<P>
   _Big-time sailing still be interesting only to wealthy elites
after a camera in 1987 was fixed on the mast of an America's Cup
yacht while it was being blasted by the Indian Ocean?
</P>
<P>
   _Lame rock songs by Gary Glitter become annoying national sports
anthems?
</P>
<P>
   _The scoring signal of the weird-hatted official in Aussie-rules
football be considered the funniest gesture in worldwide sports?
</P>
<P>
   _Postgame interviews in clubhouses and locker rooms be
interrupted by athletes craning to see themselves on
``SportsCenter''?
</P>
<P>
   _Baseball have suffered one of its greatest indignities when its
September stretch-drive coverage was bumped to ESPN2 in order to
telecast NFL games, which draw three and four times the Sunday
audience?
</P>
<P>
   _Sports anchors everywhere feel compelled to twist metaphors
beyond recognition, a task normally reserved for columnists who do
that sort of overreaching for a living?
</P>
<P>
   _Anyone watch Berman grow over the 20 years and recognize that
his chins are as rings to trees?
</P>
<P>
   The answers are all no. Maybe this ESPN thing will catch fire,
after all.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
TERESA Weatherspoon did it again Sunday, scoring the final three
points of the game on a bomb launched from somewhere in the next
county. This time, however, nobody noticed or cared.
</P>
<P>
   No, this time the confetti kept spewing, in perfect rhythm with
the unbridled hysteria on display in the jammed Compaq Center,
Laptop of champions. There would be no more outrageous reversals of
fortune, no more daggers in Van Chancellor's overstressed heart.
</P>
<P>
   Cruel fate wouldn't dare jack with the Comets any further.
Enough was by-gosh enough.
</P>
<P>
   Destiny's-turned-dynasty's darlings had long since stuck a fork
in T-Spoon and her fellow mugging victims from New York. Knives,
too, and probably every other kitchen utensil you can imagine.
Houston's lady killers shackled the Liberty with what Chancellor
called ``the best defense I've ever seen in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   New York scored six points in the first 15:52 of the second
half. That's how you explain the Comets landing their Game 3
knockout punch despite hitting an atrocious 28.8 percent from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   OK, the possibility exists that a bit of lousy offense also had
a hand in Houston's 59-47 three-peat clinching performance, but
there's no reason to rain on the Comets' parade at such an
exuberant and relief-filled moment, after a season that would have
turned Job himself into a blubbering fool.
</P>
<P>
   When you lose your starting point guard to cancer, then she
passes away a week before the playoffs start, you are dealing with
adversity of such magnitude as to render virtually all other
purported examples of same superficial.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets' winning No. 3 for No. 10 _ Perrot's number _ becomes
an instant contender then, on emotional grounds alone, for
story-of-the-millennium honors in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't think the spirit of Kim Perrot is alive in the
Comets' world right now,'' Chancellor said, ``you're dead wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody thinks that, of course. Perrot, who went from being a
no-hoper in Houston's inaugural tryout camp to becoming the floor
general and inspirational leader for the first two championship
teams, will always be accorded a special niche in the city's
sporting lore.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kim's closest friend, Cynthia Cooper, the woman
singularly most responsible for making Sam Houston's town the
epicenter of women's pro hoops, she now qualifies as a certified
Texas legend, up there with ol' General Sam himself. Coop was born
in Chicago and grew up in Los Angeles, but we're claiming her,
period. End of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   And she seems to appreciate us as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like the fans have lived every moment with us,''
Cooper said. ``All the hurt and the pain we've felt, they felt it
also. They are definitely the sixth man or the X-factor or whatever
you want to call them. I'm just thankful they're ours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, when (Weatherspoon) hit that big shot, the fans
went to the box office, and every ticket sold out within a couple
hours. That shows you how great the fans of Houston are.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, the greatest player in the WNBA all three of its
seasons, had sunk just a single field goal in 10 tries during the
68-67 sucker-punch defeat Saturday. On Sunday, however, she nailed
her first bucket in the opening moments to inform everyone _
especially the Liberty _ that she would be making her presence more
felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right from the beginning,'' she said, ``I wanted to establish
that I was going to the basket today, that I was going to be a
force to be reckoned with. I was going to go down fighting for my
team to win a third championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Coop's 24 points, 13 of which came on free throws, were 11 more
than anyone else scored. The Liberty would be led, nominally
anyway, by Sue Wicks' 11. Of all the participants on both teams,
New York's Vickie Johnson (4-for-7) was the only one to shoot
better than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were beating the out of each other,'' Wicks said
indelicately.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the Liberty got the worst of the carnage by far,
never mind its minute advantage (.309-.288) in shooting percentage.
New York also suffered 16 turnovers, and its bruises wouldn't
translate into many gimmie points. The Comets attempted 32 free
throws to New York's nine and made 19 more, providing the winning
margin with plenty to spare.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Richie Adubato, the Liberty coach, accepted the
blame instead of predictably laying it on home-court-biased
officiating. He said he needs to do a better job of teaching his
players to attack the basket _ a la Coop.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, fairly late in life, the 36-year-old Cooper has made
herself an icon of her sport and given Houston a new reason to
celebrate Labor Day weekend. Three tries, three titles. Anybody for
a four-peat? Coop wouldn't guarantee same, but she promised to try
her best to deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   And her best has always been good enough.

SUCCESS FOR KENNY MAYNE COMES AFTER MANY OBSTACLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be that everything in Kenny Mayne's life was like his
hair _ going everywhere but the intended direction.
</P>
<P>
   Now he sits in a chair on the SportsCenter set, amusing America
with his one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Not that long ago, one of the nation's most recognized faces in
sports journalism was known only as Kenny, the part-timer hired by
Sea-Tac Disposal near Seattle to assemble garbage cans.
</P>
<P>
   Or the reserve quarterback at Nevada-Las Vegas. Or the second
stringer at KSTW, Seattle's UPN affiliate. Or the mop-up guy
peddling MCI. Or the loser at Longacres horse racing track.
</P>
<P>
   If Mayne was on a ladder to success, the rungs kept snapping.
For a while, sea level was a tough climb, even in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In the broadcasting business, for all of the breakups, there is
an occasional breakthrough. Mayne finally had one, ESPN rewarding
his persistence with a job at the highest-rated sports cable
channel in the country.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, this 40-year-old man who should have been enjoying his
popularity and riches, could not. He would have traded the
professional pinnacle for a child to be named later.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mayne household, where Kenny lives with his wife Laura,
it was never known as the birthing process. It was the birthing
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Using his on-air vernacular, the Maynes, after so many
disappointments, finally experienced a ``Yahtzee'' on Aug. 16 when
their little girl, Riley Hope, was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't understate the thickness of emotion,'' Mayne said.
``It's pretty humbling. We were so used to the tragedies that
occurred in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, when the pediatrician came by to check on Riley
Hope, the Maynes were understandably anxious until receiving the
doctor's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lady actually said the word `perfect,''' Mayne said.
``It's what most people get to hear, and we never had.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Laura Mayne gave birth to premature twins. One,
Creighton, was stillborn. The other, Connor, weighed 1 pound, 7
ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, after surviving countless operations and
growing to 7 pounds, Connor's battle ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody fought to live more than this guy,'' Mayne said.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, Laura became pregnant again with a little girl
they planned to call Riley. Mayne found out about it on the same
day he got his new assignment with Dan Patrick. It seemed like all
the karma was finally connecting. Until September, when Laura
miscarried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything came crushing down on us again,'' Mayne said. ``I
didn't know how Laura was ever going to pull through. It was the
next-closest thing to suicidal. I took some time off.''
</P>
<P>
   And then _ as if to reaffirm that life isn't fair, it's a foul
ball in the seats _ Laura lost another baby, a Billy-to-be, last
October.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, when Laura was in her sixth month of
pregnancy, the Maynes were encouraged because they had been told
that every previous problem was unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors,'' Mayne said, ``couldn't come up with anything
but bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what his career was filled with early on.
</P>
<P>
   For the longest time, this could have been a
local-boy-tries-but-never-makes-good story.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1994, when the Federal Way, Wash., product began to appear
on ESPN2, Mayne was like one of the claimers he used to bet on at
Longacres _ a 50-to-1 shot.
</P>
<P>
   Business was down, really down, on Mayne street. In 1986, the
guy you think is so funny now was a weekend sports anchor at KSTW,
doing offbeat bits, eventually clashing with management and
quitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one night (on the air) when he said he felt like he
had a runny nose,'' said Shawn Doran, one of Mayne's lifelong
friends. ``He continued to read the story even though he had blood
all over his hand and blood running down his face. Then he comes
back from a commercial with a wad of toilet paper hanging out his
nose.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving KSTW, Mayne was either trying to find himself, a
job or both. That was when he began talking trash. To pay the bills
for a while, Mayne assembled garbage cans, the big green toters
that you wheel to the curb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was using tools that I had never heard of, like an air-rivet
gun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After there were no more cans to assemble, Mayne needed another
job. So he looked in the classifieds and was hired by a
telemarketing firm. New position: Pre-paid legal insurance
salesman. Pay: minimal. Prestige: none.
</P>
<P>
   Mayne sat in an office. An automated computer system dialed the
numbers for him. One day, Bristol, Conn., popped onto the screen,
ESPN's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That moment was the real low point,'' Mayne said.
</P>
<P>
   The place he aspired to be, flashing in his face. He was
free-lancing for ESPN, badgering ESPN, interviewing with ESPN. In
1994, the relentless pursuit of a job at the cable king resulted in
an anchor's position for an update show on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a gig as host of RPM2night, his checkered career
giving way to the checkered flag three years later on SportsCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``All along, there was something there,'' said Al Jaffe, ESPN's
vice president for production and talent recruitment who saw
Mayne's first audition tape. ``When it's right, you know it. He had
that certain something the camera loved. He's wry, clever,
different. He is someone you want to watch and invite
</P>
<P>
   into your home.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mayne was growing up, you could say the kid had Star Lake
potential. That's where he lived, on the shores of the little lake
east of Interstate 5 on the outskirts of Federal Way.
</P>
<P>
   His journalism teacher at Thomas Jefferson High School said
Mayne was a wonderful athlete, good student and mischievous
teenager.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had that sparkle,'' said Joe Gotchy, who still teaches
social studies at Jefferson. ``You knew that this person had
promise and potential.''
</P>
<P>
   As a prospective broadcaster perhaps, not a negotiator or
handicapper.
</P>
<P>
   In eighth grade, Doran was flipping coins in a game of even-odd
with a much-bigger ninth grader. When Doran won, the freshman
refused to pay him a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiss my ass,'' the ninth grader told Doran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark the spot,'' Mayne piped in, ``you're all butt.''
</P>
<P>
   The ninth-grader responded with two punches, putting Mayne on
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't cure his wise-guy tendencies. On a high-school road
trip to Kelso for a basketball game, Mayne and his buddies pulled
off to the side of the road to relieve themselves, attracting the
local police. He was a minor in possession of everything but his
senses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in jail and the cop wanted to do a strip search,''
Doran said. ``Kenny looked at him and said: `But I hardly know
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   In those formative and occasionally degenerative years, Mayne
received a fine education at Star Lake Elementary, Totem Junior
High, Jefferson High and Longacres, where lessons are costly.
</P>
<P>
   Doran and Mayne would hitchhike to the Renton horse-racing
track, attempting to bet before they were of legal age. By the time
they were 20, they were playing all-night poker games with
Longacres security men at the nearby Doubletree Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the worst gambler of all time,'' Doran said. ``I've
been to the track with him a million times and he just doesn't
win.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one notable exception when everyone profited from
Mayne's mistake. He had been sent to the window with $30 to box
three horses in the exacta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny used the wrong numbers, but it came in and we won
$3,000,'' Doran said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, Mayne is cashing another ticket. He never
made it as a walk-on quarterback at the University of Washington in
Seattle with Warren Moon and Tom Flick already on campus. He shined
at Wenatchee, becoming a community college All-American. But in
another Strip search, Mayne failed to find stardom in Las Vegas,
injuries contributing to his role as a backup quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   He was given a tryout with the Seahawks in 1982 but failed the
team physical because of a previously fractured ankle.
</P>
<P>
   If Kenny Mayne was ever going to call plays again, they would
have to be on television.
</P>
<P>
   Mayne doesn't get back to Seattle with any regularity but was
here last Jan. 16 to celebrate his father's 75th birthday. His mom
died in 1986, and his dad had a rough year and a half, experiencing
a minor heart attack and a stroke. Mayne also has three older
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   He misses his friends and family and the scenery. In a way,
Kenny Mayne is still here, in our living rooms, appearing as more
than a talking head to those at Jefferson High School. In the race
for most famous alum, Mayne still trails but is closing in on Josie
Bissett.
</P>
<P>
   The man who sparked the passion in journalism is now inspired by
Mayne. Gotchy watches his former student every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes me laugh,'' Gotchy said. ``He reminds me that every
student I work with has that promise and potential. You just don't
know where they're going to end up. His story is almost legend
among the older faculty members here. It says that from a very good
public high school, nothing is impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returned last week from vacation, Mayne felt as if he
had been demoted. His SportsCenter times and days and partners had
changed. For two years, he tag-teamed with Dan Patrick as the
deadpan straight man, helping form the No. 1 tandem on the cable
giant.
</P>
<P>
   Now, because Patrick has a radio show, Mayne has been paired
with Trey Wingo. Mayne also does not appear on the Sunday night
SportsCenter show anymore, which bothers him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest show of the week,'' he said. ``It's pretty
exhilarating.''
</P>
<P>
   As careers go, Mayne is still soaring, if not off the charts
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   More accustomed to obscurity, Mayne is somewhat uncomfortable
with celebrity. He is the same person who assembled garbage cans
before discovering the recycling bin. He goes to a movie with his
wife and wears a baseball cap but still sees people staring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like Leonardo DiCaprio, but it's weird,'' Mayne said.
``It's sort of odd how we get calls from old friends. They're
thinking the whole thing is SportsCenter and the ads. With Laura,
all we talk about is family.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time in their eyes, they had one, referring to the lost
twins in the present tense. On what would have been Connor's second
birthday in May 1998, the Maynes went to Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to experience it as if he was still here, like,
here's what we might have been doing,'' Mayne said. ``We took a
couple of his (stuffed) bears with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Reality in Riley finally joined the Maynes last month. If you
ask Laura Mayne, it was an overdue date. As well as a miracle of
sorts. Mayne said that his wife did not think she ovulated during
the month of conception.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be attributed to a religious experience for
non-churchgoers like the Maynes? Perhaps. When Mayne went to
Minnesota to interview Vikings quarterback Randall Cunningham for a
story in ESPN Magazine, the man who let him through the locked door
was the team pastor. He said a prayer for the Maynes.
</P>
<P>
   And the ultrasound bites were flawless _ in the hospital, on the
set. Kenny Mayne had finally gone quadrangular.

WASHINGTON STATE TIES TO ESPN ARE STRONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Linda Cohn, a New Yorker, used to work in Seattle. Bob Stevens,
who grew up in Walla Walla, always wanted to. Today, each has one
of sportscasting's dream jobs: anchor on ESPN's ``SportsCenter.''
And though ESPN's hometown of Bristol, Conn., doesn't match Seattle
for postcard possibilities, neither of them is complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, John Clayton, who still works in Seattle, is a
colleague to both as one of ESPN's resident experts on pro
football.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn, who worked as a sports reporter/anchor at KIRO/7,
Seattle's CBS affiliate, from 1989-92, says her seven years at ESPN
have been ``a great run.'' Lauded by management for her
versatility, Cohn often co-anchors the 11 p.m. (Eastern) edition of
``SportsCenter'' because she's good at working on the fly with
little advance preparation.
</P>
<P>
   The second of four children, Cohn says she was always into
sports, much more so than her only brother. Passions were
basketball and hockey. As a high school senior on Long Island, she
played goalie on the boys' hockey team. She did the same on a
women's club-level squad at the State University of New York at
Oswego.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1981, she began her career in radio, and she
still enjoys doing the occasional piece for ESPN Radio broadcasts.
She joined a Long Island TV station in 1985 but went back to ABC
radio in 1987, becoming the first full-time female sports anchor on
a national radio network.
</P>
<P>
   When KIRO offered her a job in '89, Cohn jumped, and then
wondered if she'd made a mistake when ESPN came calling six months
later. She honored her commitment to KIRO and told ESPN ``no
thanks.'' But when they called again in '92, she accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn says she doesn't remember much about Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always working,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens considers himself ESPN's ``oldest rookie.'' The
44-year-old anchor joined the network in 1996 for the launch of
ESPNEWS, its 24-hour sports news network. Didn't take long before
he moved up to ``SportsCenter'' duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here three months and saw my name show up on the
schedule,'' he said. ``I've played pinch-hitter and utility man
since then.'' In fact, by his count, Stevens had more
``SportsCenter'' appearances last year than any other anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens grew up on a wheat farm in Walla Walla. When his parents
divorced he moved with his mother to California, where he finished
high school. He graduated from the University of Tulsa in 1977 and
spent three more years in Tulsa as sports director of KOTV-TV. He
moved on to WEWS-TV in Cleveland in 1990, where he met his wife,
who hosted a local show on the same station.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who broadcast Little League baseball games when he was
in high school, interviewed for the sports director's job at KOMO,
Seattle's ABC affiliae, a few years ago and thought he had it, but
KOMO went with Eric Johnson instead. His disappointment dissipated
when ESPN called. Happy to be in Bristol, he's also keenly aware of
the impact ESPN has had on sports.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton came to the Puget Sound area from his native Pittsburgh
in 1986 as the Seattle Seahawks/NFL beat writer for the News
Tribune in Tacoma. An alumnus of Duquesne, where he got bitten by
the broadcasting bug, he soon picked up a side gig doing Seahawks
reports on KJR radio. A companion career was born.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, still covering the Hawks for the Tribune, he signed his
first contract with ESPN Radio and was given additional
responsibilities as news gatherer for ESPN's Prime Time Monday show
and a consultant to its Sunday Countdown program.
</P>
<P>
   He left newspapering 1{ years ago to sign on with ESPN The
Magazine and as an on-camera reporter for the Inside the Huddle
segment of Tuesday SportsCenter telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton, who lives in Renton, Wash, with his wife, Patricia,
does his network feeds by satellite on his travels to NFL cities
and training camps throughout the country. In addition to Inside
the Huddle, he appears on NFL Tonight on ESPN2 and, occasionally,
ESPNEWS. Last season, he was host of an NFL talk show on ESPN
Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, as for the John Clayton who's co-host of KJR-AM's Sports
Saturday? That John Clayton?
</P>
<P>
   Same guy.

IN 20 YEARS, ESPN HAS CHANGED THE FACE OF SPORTS BROADCASTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Conn. _ Ten weeks ago, when Tony Hawk turned the first
``900'' in a skateboarding competition, it was not only fitting
that ESPN be there to record the event, it was pretty much
required, dude.
</P>
<P>
   Hawk was competing, after all, in the X (for extreme) Games, an
invention of ESPN, which 20 years ago launched itself into the
cable consciousness with these words from sportscaster Lee Leonard:
``If you're a fan, if you're a fan, what you'll see in the next
minutes, hours and days to follow may convince you you've gone to
sports heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who only remember skateboarding as a playground
activity of the '60s, a ``900'' is boarder-talk for 2{ revolutions
in the air _ a full 900 degrees. To all you throwbacks, as well as
all the sports widows/widowers out there, Leonard's words may seem
a tad overinflated. But to a new generation of athletes, as well as
millions of people who are happy to watch sports programming
twenty-four/seven, Leonard was a prophet. Over the ensuing two
decades, ESPN has done what every entrepreneur dreams: It found a
need and filled it. Along the way, it also changed the way sports
fans get their information.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some will argue that ESPN created the need, that 20
years ago most Americans really had no wish to see the professional
slo-pitch softball world series (ESPN's first live event), or an
installment of pro beach hockey hosted by a bikini babe (one of its
more recent inventions; the game, that is, not the babe).
</P>
<P>
   ESPN anchor Chris Berman disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not have been the sports you wanted to see,
necessarily,'' he said recently, ``... but there's an audience for
all of those, and we believed there were people out there just like
us that wanted to see sports 24 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman, one of the first broadcasters to make humor a regular
part of sports reportage, should know. Tomorrow at 4 p.m. he'll
host a three-hour special on ESPN's 20th anniversary. He's been
there for all but three weeks of those 20 years, and vividly
recalls the early days, such as the time he did play-by-play for a
darts tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever do a replay on darts?'' he asked. ```Ooh, nice wrist
action. Really good!'''
</P>
<P>
   Berman, who remembers when ESPN amounted to three satellite
dishes and 70 employees, is unapologetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper,'' he admitted, ``we looked like a wing and a prayer.
But I will say this: We never put junk on.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong words from a guy who works for a company that now has 25
dishes and 2,100 employees who have to find enough sports-related
stuff _ we didn't say junk _ to fill 24 hours on not one, but five,
cable channels: ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN Classic, ESPNEWS and ESPN
International.
</P>
<P>
   That's only the foreword of the book on ESPN. If there were a
dictionary illustration for ``branding,'' it might well be the ESPN
logo.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there aren't many serious sports nuts who can get through
a day without tuning in ESPN cable or listening to ESPN Radio or
logging on to ESPN.com or leafing through ESPN The Magazine. Heck,
in Baltimore, Chicago and, soon, New York City, they can do it all
and have dinner, too, at ESPN Zone, the latest in themed restaurant
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   This explosion of ESPN's presence has happened mostly in the
'90s, especially after Walt Disney Co.'s 1996 acquisition of
Capital Cities/ABC Inc., which had owned 80 percent of ESPN since
1984. With Disney's deep pockets and marketing savvy, ESPN is the
Microsoft of sports information: No. 1, and a couple of light years
ahead of the competition. But where Microsoft is perceived by many
as arrogant, ESPN is like your best buddy.
</P>
<P>
   It all started with Bill Rasmussen in 1978. Rasmussen, public
relations director of the New England Whalers of the old World
Hockey Association, wanted to build a sports network in
Connecticut. He figured one of the linchpins would be Whalers
telecasts, a sure way to build interest in the team, which had
moved from Boston to Hartford in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The dream eventually expanded to accommodate a national vision
and, bankrolled by the Getty Oil Co., Rasmussen launched the
Entertainment and Sports Programming Network on Sept. 7, 1979, with
the first edition of ``SportsCenter.''
</P>
<P>
   Building credibility is crucial to any television start-up.
ESPN's got a boost when veteran NBC sportscaster Jim Simpson signed
on a week after liftoff. But the real turning point came in March
1980, when ESPN aired the obscure early-round games of the NCAA
basketball tournament, featuring a motormouth analyst named Dick
Vitale.
</P>
<P>
   Fans loved it, and after Simpson taught Vitale the value of
coming up for air _ he had Vitale's microphone cut during one
telecast _ Vitale became the love-him-or-hate-him mainstay of
basketball on ESPN. He was loud, obnoxious, funny and the
antithesis of the traditionally colorless ``color commentator.''
His presence and his patois _ ``it's awesome, bay-bee!'' _ made the
broadcast an event that was sometimes bigger than the game.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are Web sites devoted to getting Vitale off the air,
but others cherish the humorous, self-deprecating,
you-know-as-much-as-we-do style that is the hallmark of ESPN. Some
Web sites offer dictionaries to help decipher Vitale's own patter;
some pay tribute to Berman and the hundreds of nicknames he has
bestowed on athletes, such as Bert ``Be Home'' Blyleven and Roberto
``Remember The'' Alomar; others focus on the inventive ways
``SportsCenter'' anchors describe home runs, such as Dan Patrick's
``it's deep and I don't think it's playable'' and Stuart Scott's
``boo-yah!''
</P>
<P>
   In Vitale-speak, ESPN has made ``prime-time players'' of several
anchors. Berman, Patrick, Scott and Kenny Mayne are among fan
favorites still drawing a paycheck in Bristol, which is a hundred
miles from New York, a hundred miles from Boston, and across the
street from the world's skinniest skyscraper, which Otis Elevator
Co. uses to crash-test its products.
</P>
<P>
   Others have left the semirural charms of central Connecticut for
bigger bucks and higher profiles, notably Craig Kilborn, who jumped
to Comedy Central and is now hosting his own late-night talk show
on CBS, and the celebrated Keith Olbermann, who left ESPN to join
MSNBC, then left MSNBC to join Fox Sports Net, Rupert Murdoch's
ESPN wannabe.
</P>
<P>
   Al Jaffe, vice president of talent negotiation and production
recruitment at ESPN, says there's no requirement that a
``SportsCenter'' anchor be a comedian. The majority, in fact, are
pretty straight shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the heart of everything,'' Jaffe said, ``is sports
knowledge. There isn't one anchor here who doesn't know sports
really well.''
</P>
<P>
   But they also have more than a passing interest in literature,
history, pop culture, whatever, and can salt their sports reports
with esoterica pulled right out of left field. They do go overboard
at times. Movie buff Rich Eisen recently performed a spoof of ``The
Blair Witch Project'' to spotlight the Chicago Bears' quarterback
woes (``The Which Bear Project''). And Scott, one of ESPN's most
creative anchors, sometimes seems to forget he's doing a sports
show, not a comedy routine.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe says management neither encourages nor discourages the
shticky stuff. Rather, it stresses the avoidance of ``cookie
cutter'' journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I don't want is the 40-regular, off-the-rack style,''
Jaffe said. ``When we're hiring, the question John Walsh always
asks is, `Are they smart?'''
</P>
<P>
   John Walsh is senior vice president and executive editor of
ESPN. A relative newcomer _ he came aboard in 1990 _ Walsh spent
much of his career in print journalism, including tours at Rolling
Stone, the Washington Post, U.S. News &AMP; World Report and Inside
Sports.
</P>
<P>
   He has overseen ESPN's expansion this decade, always aware that
good television starts with good writing. ESPN anchors write their
own material, and anchor applicants have to write a mock show so
Walsh can see if they're good writers or simply good readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can judge it by grammar,'' Walsh said, ``by the way they
choose their sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh chooses his sentences carefully when describing ESPN's
impact on sports journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's presumptuous of me to talk about it,'' he said. But he
does remember going to a meeting of New England sports editors once
and being amazed at how many said they used ``SportsCenter'' as a
guide for the next day's sports pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed it,'' Walsh said. ``It was unfathomable. I was
the last guy to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh is probably being modest, because he tends to agree with
Jaffe's contention that ``we are still the sports network of
record. Sports fans are afraid not to watch us.''
</P>
<P>
   That goes double for local sportscasters. ESPN has so changed
the sports landscape that the late sports reports on local TV
rarely provide complete, league-wide scores. They focus on the home
teams, figuring that viewers have already gotten their national
information from ESPN or a competitor like CNN/SI or Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Johnson, an associate professor in the Edward R. Murrow
School of Communications at Washington State University, considers
ESPN the sports equivalent of CNN. Just as we've become accustomed
to turning to CNN when national or international news breaks, he
said, we expect ESPN to be on top of the big sports story.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything is going to happen in sports,'' Johnson said,
``you pretty well know ESPN is going to have it.'' The corollary,
he said, is that ``local stations know they'd better cover local
stories because that's how they can distinguish themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN programming is so pervasive that athletes can't help but
notice. ``SportsCenter,'' ESPN's flagship program of daily
highlights, is sometimes on the air as often as 12 hours a day _
three hours live and the rest on tape. Along with ``Jerry
Springer,'' it is a favorite in locker rooms around the country
because it's human nature to see if you've made the highlight reel.
</P>
<P>
   This has led critics to suggest that ESPN is changing the way
team sports are played, and some ESPN reporters are sensitive to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It concerns me,'' anchor Dan Patrick admitted. ``It concerns
me that we value dunks, that if you can dunk you're a great player.
That's not the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, Patrick decreed that one edition of
``SportsCenter'' be dunk-free. He said production assistants
grumbled, but they managed to comply until the final highlight,
when a dunk sneaked in because it's just one of those automatic
things that people don't even think about when putting together
highlight clips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were apologizing to the viewers because we showed a dunk,''
Patrick recalled with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   But the awareness has stayed with him, even if Dick Glover,
ESPN's executive vice president of programming, doesn't entirely
agree that ESPN might be showing youngsters an unseemly sort of
behavior by focusing, say, on Shawn Kemp's histrionics after a
dramatic dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Glover says ESPN would be roundly criticized if it didn't show
the complete truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In point of fact,'' he said of this chicken-and-egg issue,
``we wish we had the power that people sometimes think we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most visible sign of ESPN's influence is the ABC
television series ``Sports Night,'' which Aaron Sorkin created
because he got hooked on ``SportsCenter'' while holed up in a hotel
writing the film ``The American President.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin wanted to create something that spoke to him the way the
accessible, intelligent people on ``SportsCenter'' did. He speaks
for sports fanatics across America, skateboarders and non, when he
says, ``I felt like this is a place I'd like to work. This is a
place where I could meet my best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The ESPN empire
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1979 by Bill Rasmussen, ESPN was controlled by the
Getty Oil Co. for the first five years. When Getty merged with
Texaco in 1984, it sold its 85 percent interest to Capital
Cities/ABC Inc., which had bought 15 percent of ESPN earlier that
year. ABC, now a unit of Walt Disney Co., sold a 20 percent
interest in the company to Nabisco, which sold its share to Hearst
Corp. in 1990. The 80/20 split between Disney/ABC and Hearst
continues today.

TAVARES: ANGELS LIKE `A DAY-CARE CENTER'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Angels president Tony Tavares is sticking to his
recent statement that everyone, from general manager Bill Bavasi on
down, will be evaluated at the end of the season and moves will be
made accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake about it, it's the players that will undergo
the most scrutiny. Tavares is like the tough school principal who
will try to expel any student he deems a misfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a day-care center down there, not a ballclub. And
you can quote me on that,'' Tavares said Sunday night as he watched
the Angels fall 8-3 to the New York Yankees at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   If the message wasn't clear already, it certainly is now.
Potential and expectations don't mean much anymore to Tavares. The
lack of performance this season is inexcusable, Tavares said,
regardless of the rash of injuries the team dealt with from the
start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good teams find a way to overcome adversity,'' Tavares said.
``Bad teams make excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had another ``excuse'' Sunday, learning that
scheduled starting pitcher Chuck Finley had a sore back and was
unable to start. He went to the hospital for an MRI instead of
facing the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Finley has any reason to fear the Yankees _ he's
16-9 against them in his career. In Finley's place, Mike Fyhrie,
who has spent most of the season in the minors, made his first
career appearance against New York a short one.
</P>
<P>
   Fyhrie, who was given the start over Ken Hill, was given a 2-0
lead in the first inning but was gone by the end of the third with
the Yankees leading 4-2. Knuckleballer Steve Sparks allowed three
more runs, and Al Levine followed Sparks and garnered the
distinction of giving up the first home run to Darryl Strawberry
since his arrest April 14 on drug and solicitation charges.
</P>
<P>
   All the offense delighted the pro-Yankees crowd of 35,481,
prompting a sarcastic comment from Angels center fielder Jim
Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always tough to play in Yankee Stadium,'' said Edmonds,
who made a diving catch but went 0 for 4 and was limping noticeably
after the game because of a strained right groin. ``It's always bad
when the Yankees are here, but it seems worse than normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, who is platooning with Chili Davis at DH but is not
eligible for postseason play, reached base four times Sunday with
the homer, a double and two walks. Derek Jeter, who began the day
tied with Boston's Nomar Garciaparra as the leading hitter in the
AL, had four hits to raise his batting average to .353.
Garciaparra, however, also had four hits and is hitting .354.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Fyhrie) started out nicely, but you can't make pitches in bad
spots to this lineup,'' Angels interim manager Joe Maddon said.
``When you make a mistake to those hitters, you know you made a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Angels to 52-84, the worst record in the
majors, one-half game behind the Kansas City Royals (53-84). The
Angels remain on pace for a franchise-record 100 losses. They can
avoid the century mark by winning 11 of their final 26 games. But
in their past 26 games, the Angels have won only six times.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels managed only three runs (two earned) off Yankees
starter Ed Yarnall (1-0), who was starting in place of a resting
David Cone. It was the major-league debut for Yarnall, whose name
was mentioned in the Finley trade rumors.

SUCCESS FOR KENNY MAYNE COMES AFTER MANY OBSTACLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be that everything in Kenny Mayne's life was like his
hair _ going everywhere but the intended direction.
</P>
<P>
   Now he sits in a chair on the SportsCenter set, amusing America
with his one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Not that long ago, one of the nation's most recognized faces in
sports journalism was known only as Kenny, the part-timer hired by
Sea-Tac Disposal near Seattle to assemble garbage cans.
</P>
<P>
   Or the reserve quarterback at Nevada-Las Vegas. Or the second
stringer at KSTW, Seattle's UPN affiliate. Or the mop-up guy
peddling MCI. Or the loser at Longacres horse racing track.
</P>
<P>
   If Mayne was on a ladder to success, the rungs kept snapping.
For a while, sea level was a tough climb, even in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In the broadcasting business, for all of the breakups, there is
an occasional breakthrough. Mayne finally had one, ESPN rewarding
his persistence with a job at the highest-rated sports cable
channel in the country.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, this 40-year-old man who should have been enjoying his
popularity and riches, could not. He would have traded the
professional pinnacle for a child to be named later.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mayne household, where Kenny lives with his wife Laura,
it was never known as the birthing process. It was the birthing
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Using his on-air vernacular, the Maynes, after so many
disappointments, finally experienced a ``Yahtzee'' on Aug. 16 when
their little girl, Riley Hope, was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't understate the thickness of emotion,'' Mayne said.
``It's pretty humbling. We were so used to the tragedies that
occurred in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, when the pediatrician came by to check on Riley
Hope, the Maynes were understandably anxious until receiving the
doctor's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lady actually said the word `perfect,''' Mayne said.
``It's what most people get to hear, and we never had.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Laura Mayne gave birth to premature twins. One,
Creighton, was stillborn. The other, Connor, weighed 1 pound, 7
ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, after surviving countless operations and
growing to 7 pounds, Connor's battle ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody fought to live more than this guy,'' Mayne said.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, Laura became pregnant again with a little girl
they planned to call Riley. Mayne found out about it on the same
day he got his new assignment with Dan Patrick. It seemed like all
the karma was finally connecting. Until September, when Laura
miscarried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything came crushing down on us again,'' Mayne said. ``I
didn't know how Laura was ever going to pull through. It was the
next-closest thing to suicidal. I took some time off.''
</P>
<P>
   And then _ as if to reaffirm that life isn't fair, it's a foul
ball in the seats _ Laura lost another baby, a Billy-to-be, last
October.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, when Laura was in her sixth month of
pregnancy, the Maynes were encouraged because they had been told
that every previous problem was unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors,'' Mayne said, ``couldn't come up with anything
but bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what his career was filled with early on.
</P>
<P>
   For the longest time, this could have been a
local-boy-tries-but-never-makes-good story.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1994, when the Federal Way, Wash., product began to appear
on ESPN2, Mayne was like one of the claimers he used to bet on at
Longacres _ a 50-to-1 shot.
</P>
<P>
   Business was down, really down, on Mayne street. In 1986, the
guy you think is so funny now was a weekend sports anchor at KSTW,
doing offbeat bits, eventually clashing with management and
quitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one night (on the air) when he said he felt like he
had a runny nose,'' said Shawn Doran, one of Mayne's lifelong
friends. ``He continued to read the story even though he had blood
all over his hand and blood running down his face. Then he comes
back from a commercial with a wad of toilet paper hanging out his
nose.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving KSTW, Mayne was either trying to find himself, a
job or both. That was when he began talking trash. To pay the bills
for a while, Mayne assembled garbage cans, the big green toters
that you wheel to the curb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was using tools that I had never heard of, like an air-rivet
gun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After there were no more cans to assemble, Mayne needed another
job. So he looked in the classifieds and was hired by a
telemarketing firm. New position: Pre-paid legal insurance
salesman. Pay: minimal. Prestige: none.
</P>
<P>
   Mayne sat in an office. An automated computer system dialed the
numbers for him. One day, Bristol, Conn., popped onto the screen,
ESPN's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That moment was the real low point,'' Mayne said.
</P>
<P>
   The place he aspired to be, flashing in his face. He was
free-lancing for ESPN, badgering ESPN, interviewing with ESPN. In
1994, the relentless pursuit of a job at the cable king resulted in
an anchor's position for an update show on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a gig as host of RPM2night, his checkered career
giving way to the checkered flag three years later on SportsCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``All along, there was something there,'' said Al Jaffe, ESPN's
vice president for production and talent recruitment who saw
Mayne's first audition tape. ``When it's right, you know it. He had
that certain something the camera loved. He's wry, clever,
different. He is someone you want to watch and invite
</P>
<P>
   into your home.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mayne was growing up, you could say the kid had Star Lake
potential. That's where he lived, on the shores of the little lake
east of Interstate 5 on the outskirts of Federal Way.
</P>
<P>
   His journalism teacher at Thomas Jefferson High School said
Mayne was a wonderful athlete, good student and mischievous
teenager.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had that sparkle,'' said Joe Gotchy, who still teaches
social studies at Jefferson. ``You knew that this person had
promise and potential.''
</P>
<P>
   As a prospective broadcaster perhaps, not a negotiator or
handicapper.
</P>
<P>
   In eighth grade, Doran was flipping coins in a game of even-odd
with a much-bigger ninth grader. When Doran won, the freshman
refused to pay him a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiss my ass,'' the ninth grader told Doran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark the spot,'' Mayne piped in, ``you're all butt.''
</P>
<P>
   The ninth-grader responded with two punches, putting Mayne on
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't cure his wise-guy tendencies. On a high-school road
trip to Kelso for a basketball game, Mayne and his buddies pulled
off to the side of the road to relieve themselves, attracting the
local police. He was a minor in possession of everything but his
senses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in jail and the cop wanted to do a strip search,''
Doran said. ``Kenny looked at him and said: `But I hardly know
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   In those formative and occasionally degenerative years, Mayne
received a fine education at Star Lake Elementary, Totem Junior
High, Jefferson High and Longacres, where lessons are costly.
</P>
<P>
   Doran and Mayne would hitchhike to the Renton horse-racing
track, attempting to bet before they were of legal age. By the time
they were 20, they were playing all-night poker games with
Longacres security men at the nearby Doubletree Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the worst gambler of all time,'' Doran said. ``I've
been to the track with him a million times and he just doesn't
win.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one notable exception when everyone profited from
Mayne's mistake. He had been sent to the window with $30 to box
three horses in the exacta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny used the wrong numbers, but it came in and we won
$3,000,'' Doran said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, Mayne is cashing another ticket. He never
made it as a walk-on quarterback at the University of Washington in
Seattle with Warren Moon and Tom Flick already on campus. He shined
at Wenatchee, becoming a community college All-American. But in
another Strip search, Mayne failed to find stardom in Las Vegas,
injuries contributing to his role as a backup quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   He was given a tryout with the Seahawks in 1982 but failed the
team physical because of a previously fractured ankle.
</P>
<P>
   If Kenny Mayne was ever going to call plays again, they would
have to be on television.
</P>
<P>
   Mayne doesn't get back to Seattle with any regularity but was
here last Jan. 16 to celebrate his father's 75th birthday. His mom
died in 1986, and his dad had a rough year and a half, experiencing
a minor heart attack and a stroke. Mayne also has three older
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   He misses his friends and family and the scenery. In a way,
Kenny Mayne is still here, in our living rooms, appearing as more
than a talking head to those at Jefferson High School. In the race
for most famous alum, Mayne still trails but is closing in on Josie
Bissett.
</P>
<P>
   The man who sparked the passion in journalism is now inspired by
Mayne. Gotchy watches his former student every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes me laugh,'' Gotchy said. ``He reminds me that every
student I work with has that promise and potential. You just don't
know where they're going to end up. His story is almost legend
among the older faculty members here. It says that from a very good
public high school, nothing is impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returned last week from vacation, Mayne felt as if he
had been demoted. His SportsCenter times and days and partners had
changed. For two years, he tag-teamed with Dan Patrick as the
deadpan straight man, helping form the No. 1 tandem on the cable
giant.
</P>
<P>
   Now, because Patrick has a radio show, Mayne has been paired
with Trey Wingo. Mayne also does not appear on the Sunday night
SportsCenter show anymore, which bothers him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest show of the week,'' he said. ``It's pretty
exhilarating.''
</P>
<P>
   As careers go, Mayne is still soaring, if not off the charts
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   More accustomed to obscurity, Mayne is somewhat uncomfortable
with celebrity. He is the same person who assembled garbage cans
before discovering the recycling bin. He goes to a movie with his
wife and wears a baseball cap but still sees people staring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like Leonardo DiCaprio, but it's weird,'' Mayne said.
``It's sort of odd how we get calls from old friends. They're
thinking the whole thing is SportsCenter and the ads. With Laura,
all we talk about is family.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time in their eyes, they had one, referring to the lost
twins in the present tense. On what would have been Connor's second
birthday in May 1998, the Maynes went to Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to experience it as if he was still here, like,
here's what we might have been doing,'' Mayne said. ``We took a
couple of his (stuffed) bears with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Reality in Riley finally joined the Maynes last month. If you
ask Laura Mayne, it was an overdue date. As well as a miracle of
sorts. Mayne said that his wife did not think she ovulated during
the month of conception.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be attributed to a religious experience for
non-churchgoers like the Maynes? Perhaps. When Mayne went to
Minnesota to interview Vikings quarterback Randall Cunningham for a
story in ESPN Magazine, the man who let him through the locked door
was the team pastor. He said a prayer for the Maynes.
</P>
<P>
   And the ultrasound bites were flawless _ in the hospital, on the
set. Kenny Mayne had finally gone quadrangular.

WASHINGTON STATE TIES TO ESPN ARE STRONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Linda Cohn, a New Yorker, used to work in Seattle. Bob Stevens,
who grew up in Walla Walla, always wanted to. Today, each has one
of sportscasting's dream jobs: anchor on ESPN's ``SportsCenter.''
And though ESPN's hometown of Bristol, Conn., doesn't match Seattle
for postcard possibilities, neither of them is complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, John Clayton, who still works in Seattle, is a
colleague to both as one of ESPN's resident experts on pro
football.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn, who worked as a sports reporter/anchor at KIRO/7,
Seattle's CBS affiliate, from 1989-92, says her seven years at ESPN
have been ``a great run.'' Lauded by management for her
versatility, Cohn often co-anchors the 11 p.m. (Eastern) edition of
``SportsCenter'' because she's good at working on the fly with
little advance preparation.
</P>
<P>
   The second of four children, Cohn says she was always into
sports, much more so than her only brother. Passions were
basketball and hockey. As a high school senior on Long Island, she
played goalie on the boys' hockey team. She did the same on a
women's club-level squad at the State University of New York at
Oswego.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1981, she began her career in radio, and she
still enjoys doing the occasional piece for ESPN Radio broadcasts.
She joined a Long Island TV station in 1985 but went back to ABC
radio in 1987, becoming the first full-time female sports anchor on
a national radio network.
</P>
<P>
   When KIRO offered her a job in '89, Cohn jumped, and then
wondered if she'd made a mistake when ESPN came calling six months
later. She honored her commitment to KIRO and told ESPN ``no
thanks.'' But when they called again in '92, she accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn says she doesn't remember much about Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always working,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens considers himself ESPN's ``oldest rookie.'' The
44-year-old anchor joined the network in 1996 for the launch of
ESPNEWS, its 24-hour sports news network. Didn't take long before
he moved up to ``SportsCenter'' duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here three months and saw my name show up on the
schedule,'' he said. ``I've played pinch-hitter and utility man
since then.'' In fact, by his count, Stevens had more
``SportsCenter'' appearances last year than any other anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens grew up on a wheat farm in Walla Walla. When his parents
divorced he moved with his mother to California, where he finished
high school. He graduated from the University of Tulsa in 1977 and
spent three more years in Tulsa as sports director of KOTV-TV. He
moved on to WEWS-TV in Cleveland in 1990, where he met his wife,
who hosted a local show on the same station.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who broadcast Little League baseball games when he was
in high school, interviewed for the sports director's job at KOMO,
Seattle's ABC affiliae, a few years ago and thought he had it, but
KOMO went with Eric Johnson instead. His disappointment dissipated
when ESPN called. Happy to be in Bristol, he's also keenly aware of
the impact ESPN has had on sports.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton came to the Puget Sound area from his native Pittsburgh
in 1986 as the Seattle Seahawks/NFL beat writer for the News
Tribune in Tacoma. An alumnus of Duquesne, where he got bitten by
the broadcasting bug, he soon picked up a side gig doing Seahawks
reports on KJR radio. A companion career was born.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, still covering the Hawks for the Tribune, he signed his
first contract with ESPN Radio and was given additional
responsibilities as news gatherer for ESPN's Prime Time Monday show
and a consultant to its Sunday Countdown program.
</P>
<P>
   He left newspapering 1{ years ago to sign on with ESPN The
Magazine and as an on-camera reporter for the Inside the Huddle
segment of Tuesday SportsCenter telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton, who lives in Renton, Wash, with his wife, Patricia,
does his network feeds by satellite on his travels to NFL cities
and training camps throughout the country. In addition to Inside
the Huddle, he appears on NFL Tonight on ESPN2 and, occasionally,
ESPNEWS. Last season, he was host of an NFL talk show on ESPN
Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, as for the John Clayton who's co-host of KJR-AM's Sports
Saturday? That John Clayton?
</P>
<P>
   Same guy.

   SEATTLE _ The roof opened. The roof closed. The roof caved.
</P>
<P>
   Symptomatic of a season with little top side to it, the Mariners
kept the rain out but couldn't keep Jason Varitek in. The result
was another late-inning bullpen blowup and a 9-7 defeat to the
Boston Red Sox Sunday before 44,019 fans at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   Five hundred million dollars has brought comfort from the
elements, but inadequate protection with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek, the Mariners' No. 1 draft pick in 1994 and
pennant-drive trade bait two years ago, launched two home runs for
the Red Sox, the latter a three-run jolt off reliever Jose Paniagua
that erased a 6-4 deficit and fueled a five-run eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Falling to 68-68 and 8{ games behind Boston in the wild card
race, the Mariners close out their four-game set against the Red
Sox today with a holiday matchup at 1:30.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the home club was treated to a Safeco first _ roof
closure midway through a ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   Under cloudy skies and the threat of rain, the retractable
ceiling covered the field during batting practice, was opened for
the first pitch and shut a second time once a rain squall was
unleashed during the top of the third inning. Sunshine couldn't
nudge it open a second time. Still, the huge steel contraption went
back and forth so much it could have passed for a waterfront street
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little different,'' said Mariners first baseman Ryan
Jackson. ``I never had experienced that before. That's the
convenience of having it. The weird thing is when it was closed, it
was nice outside. They couldn't seem to get it together there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor could his baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners let home runs by Ken Griffey Jr., Alex Rodriguez
and Edgar Martinez go to waste, and a potential 15th victory for
rookie pitcher Freddy Garcia slip away. All because they couldn't
register the final five outs in timely fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty tough loss, especially because we came from
behind to take a nice lead and we took it out of our own hands,''
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   After an easy 1-2-3 seventh inning for Paniagua, the
right-hander bottomed out in the eighth. American League batting
leader Nomar Garciaparra led off with a single to right, one of his
four hits. A fly-out later, Jon Nunnally laced another single to
right, putting runners on first and third. Varitek then drove an
0-1 fastball over the left-field fence for his 15th homer and
second multi-homer game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Safeco Field, this was nothing new. The blown save was
the 16th for the Mariners, and eighth for Paniagua (6-11) in 11
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Red Sox save was credited to reliever Derek
Lowe, who accompanied Varitek from Seattle to the Red Sox in the
ill-fated 1997 trade for reliever Heathcliff Slocumb. As Boston
inches closer to the playoffs, the two former Mariners have played
vital roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things are happening right, that's all,'' said Varitek,
whose second-inning solo homer off Garcia was his first in 118
at-bats. ``I was thinking about trying to get the ball to the
outfield to get us one run closer. (Paniagua) got the ball over the
plate and I was able to get it out of the yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Varitek also prevented a Mariners run in the fifth when he
effectively blocked the plate from David Bell, who was trying to
score on a fly ball. Leaping over the catcher, Bell apparently
missed the plate as well and was tagged out as he walked to the
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the Mariners couldn't argue the final outcome.
There were no ready excuses for the bullpen meltdown, a regular
occurrence in the past few seasons. However, manager Lou Piniella
did take a moment in the fifth to question the mound work of
Boston's John Wasdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like every time Wasdin went to his belt buckle, the
ball sank pretty well,'' the manager said sarcastically, raising
the possibility Wasdin might have been scuffing the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Summoned for a conference, the umpires took no action. Case
closed. Roof closed. And, as far as any Mariner progress, road
closed.

MARTINEZ ENTERS RACE FOR BATTING TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The American League batting race has been like a
lonesome highway this season. For long stretches, the leaders have
gone miles without encountering anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   They might want to peek in the rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   That blur on the horizon is Edgar Martinez, his foot pushing
hard on the accelerator. Over the past month, the Mariners
designated hitter has come out of nowhere to challenge for his
third batting crown.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 2, Martinez was hitting .309, trailing then-leader Derek
Jeter of the Yankees by 51 points, well out of the AL's top 10.
Entering Sunday's game, he was fourth in the league at .339, just
10 points behind Boston's Nomar Garciaparra _ the closest he's been
this year to the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a month to go,'' Martinez said. ``I know I'm getting
closer. There's a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Martinez went 1-for-3 while Garciaparra was 4-for-5,
with both players homering. The splurge upped Garciaparra's average
to .354, 15 points higher than his Mariners counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra shrugged when asked about the batting title, which
would be his first, insisting it doesn't concern him. But he paid
homage to Martinez, saying, ``He's always been an unbelievable
hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Aug. 2, Martinez has hit .422 (47-for-112), collecting
five three-hit games and going hitless in just five games.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, he has zipped past a handful of guys, leaving just
Garciaparra, Jeter and the Yankees' Bernie Williams ahead of him.
And he's done it without leaning on the horn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of the way Edgar is: He works hard, he produces
every day and he does it quietly,'' catcher Dan Wilson said. ``You
do those things and pretty soon you're creeping up on a batting
title. I wouldn't doubt he would do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates remember when Martinez was hitting around the .280
level earlier in the season, thinking that wouldn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew he was going to go something like 40-for-45,'' Tom
Lampkin said. ``That's what's so amazing about him. He's going to
get (his hits). If not early, then later. He's going to bunch hits
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was the AL batting champ in 1992, hitting .343, and in
'95, finishing at .356. One more crown and he becomes the 10th
player to lead the AL three or more times. Those in this select
group: Ty Cobb, 12 (1907-'19); Rod Carew, 7 (1969, '72-'75,
'77-'78); Ted Williams, 6 (1941-'42, '47-'48, '57-'58); Wade Boggs,
5 (1983, '85-'88); Harry Heilmann, 4 (1921, '23, '25, '27); George
Brett, 3 (1976, 1980, 1990); Nap Lajoie, 3 (1901, '03-'04); Tony
Oliva, 3 (1964-'65, '71); and Carl Yastrzemski, 3 (1963, '67-'68).
</P>
<P>
   Martinez says he doesn't consciously keep track of the batting
race, but often sees listings posted on the Safeco Field scoreboard
and peruses them with passing interest.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates are cognizant of the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't help him any by not getting Nomar out,'' pitcher Paul
Abbott cracked, referring to a home run he gave up to Garciaparra
on Saturday. Abbott was not alone. The Red Sox shortstop homered
off Freddy Garcia Sunday, giving him three homers in three games
against the Mariners over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has hit .322 or better in his previous four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``All batting titles are special,'' he said. ``I can tell you
'95 was a lot of fun. We didn't have a chance to think about it. We
were so into the pennant race, personal stats became secondary.
When you're way out of it, that's when you think about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, if I'm close, it will be exciting the last
week.''

years,'' Bean said recently, ``I felt as though I had one foot in

no one wants to play with. By Rick Lyman.

<P>
   SHAKESPEARE-DISCO (New York) _ Puck is gliding on roller skates
through a rather misty haze that fills the dance floor, making
mischief, as Puck does, with the passions of Tytania, Sander and
Dimitri. This isn't fairyland, but rather theater, and it's done to
the pounding beat of such '70s dance hits as ``Disco Inferno.''

I CONFESS; I PAID NO ATTENTION TO ESPN DURING ITS START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story drifted through the sports department about some cable
outfit back East that was going to do a 24-hour sports network,
even though it had almost no major sports contracts, or even local
sports to fill time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' I said to someone in the office, ``is an idea that's
so dead a cat wouldn't eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, go ahead and laugh at me now. But remember, I said the
same thing about Microsoft and Amazon.com. So there.
</P>
<P>
   I paid no attention to ESPN during its start _ hey, in '79 I was
trying to get over the death of Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols by
converting to the Bee Gees. Maybe you can appreciate the
distraction.
</P>
<P>
   But by the spring of 1980, the NCAA men's basketball tournament
was about to fire up again, the year after the epic championship
match between Michigan State's Magic Johnson and Indiana State's
Larry Bird gave college hoops such an adrenaline spike.
</P>
<P>
   That spring was also when the Seattle SuperSonics were defending
their NBA championship and Bird and Johnson had been through
Seattle for the first time as pro rookies. Basketball hereabouts
was large.
</P>
<P>
   It would be fun to reveal that during a time of high hoops
interest ESPN showed me some great NBA national coverage that would
be useful in comparing with the champion Sonics. But ESPN didn't
televise the NBA. Nor did ESPN televise the Final Four, which
remains to this day the province of the broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   It would be fun to say I enjoyed ESPN's telecast of the early
rounds of the tournament, which I had never seen before. While
there was some entertainment there, I couldn't get over this one
monumentally annoying color analyst, who shouted every sentence and
closed them all with ``bay-bee!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I thought, it's a rookie network that has to let everyone
try out. That clown won't make the first cut.
</P>
<P>
   What I did find helpful and amusing that spring was an ESPN
telecast, or maybe it was a long highlight, that few others might
remember _ the finals of the National Invitation Tournament, which
back then had a little fizz because the NCAA hadn't yet expanded
its field all the way to the Van Allen radiation belt.
</P>
<P>
   In this game was a skinny 7-foot-4 freshman who brought the ball
up the floor, shot from outside and ran with the grace of someone a
foot shorter. He had 15 points and 15 rebounds, leading Virginia to
a 58-55 win over Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, I had never heard of Ralph Sampson. After that TV
flash, I figured I had seen athletic genius in its obscure genesis.
For a young sportswriter, this was cool, because I knew something
most of my colleagues and rivals didn't. Those things were coins of
my new professional realm.
</P>
<P>
   Bad break, however, for feline diets everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't know was the wise guys had already discovered
ESPN. What I came to learn over the past 20 years is that there are
no more Sampson-like coins, because ESPN has made sure nothing is
obscure.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone under 30, it's probably hard to believe that someone
of Sampson's extraordinary talents was once a regional secret.
Today, of course, all of America would know about a gifted 7-foot-4
freshman down to his junior prom date.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this is good or bad is a matter for social
anthropologists. But it's hard to deny that a well-done, 24-hour
sports channel has transformed the sporting landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes alter their games to create a highlight worthy of
national telecast. Teams change schedules and routines to
accommodate ESPN attention. Media types track its coverage to shape
their own work. New sports plot how their games will show on ESPN.
And ESPN can invent its own events, the X Games, and not be shamed
into surrendering the silliness.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that ESPN's 20th anniversary today is a sufficient
cultural touchstone to draw A-1 of this newspaper is testimony to
its reach and influence _ not to mention a slow news day.
</P>
<P>
   Without ESPN bringing sports to the sports nation, would:
</P>
<P>
   _Anyone have heard of the Big East Conference?
</P>
<P>
   _Shawn Kemp have grabbed his crotch after a dunk?
</P>
<P>
   _Dick Vitale be anything but a vacuum-cleaner salesman with a
limp, having had his foot crushed in doorways endless times?
</P>
<P>
   _Bert Blyleven be known more for the Chris Berman-bestowed
middle name ``Be Home By'' instead of a stalwart pitching career?
</P>
<P>
   _Drunken college kids spend a fair chunk of the semester
gyrating behind ESPN's live remote talking-head set on game days so
they could show mom and dad back home what a rotten investment that
tuition money was?
</P>
<P>
   _Stuart Scott have taken smug hipness to frontiers unknown even
to Pat O'Brien?
</P>
<P>
   _Big-time sailing still be interesting only to wealthy elites
after a camera in 1987 was fixed on the mast of an America's Cup
yacht while it was being blasted by the Indian Ocean?
</P>
<P>
   _Lame rock songs by Gary Glitter become annoying national sports
anthems?
</P>
<P>
   _The scoring signal of the weird-hatted official in Aussie-rules
football be considered the funniest gesture in worldwide sports?
</P>
<P>
   _Postgame interviews in clubhouses and locker rooms be
interrupted by athletes craning to see themselves on
``SportsCenter''?
</P>
<P>
   _Baseball have suffered one of its greatest indignities when its
September stretch-drive coverage was bumped to ESPN2 in order to
telecast NFL games, which draw three and four times the Sunday
audience?
</P>
<P>
   _Sports anchors everywhere feel compelled to twist metaphors
beyond recognition, a task normally reserved for columnists who do
that sort of overreaching for a living?
</P>
<P>
   _Anyone watch Berman grow over the 20 years and recognize that
his chins are as rings to trees?
</P>
<P>
   The answers are all no. Maybe this ESPN thing will catch fire,
after all.

VARITEK NEXT GENERATION OF CATCHER 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Jason Varitek is every manager's answered prayer: a
tough, switch-hitting catcher who wants to play every day. Of all
the deals that Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette has made,
perhaps his best is the swindle of Seattle that yielded Varitek and
Derek Lowe for Gas-can Heathcliffe Slocumb.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Varitek and Lowe for Slocumb. In Boston lore,
it's moving up there alongside Dennis Johnson for Rick Robey, and
Cam Neely for Barry Pederson.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek Sunday caught his 120th game, only one fewer than Most
Valuable Player candidate Pudge Rodriguez of Texas. In a
come-from-behind 9-7 victory over the Mariners, Boston's lumberjack
backstop hit a pair of homers and saved a run when he blocked the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs are obvious. Varitek hit a solo shot to right-center
on a 3-2 pitch to cut Seattle's lead to 5-3 in the fourth inning.
The bigger blow came in the eighth when Boston's new star cranked a
three-run shot (No. 15 for the year) to give the Sox a 7-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Blocking the plate is something more subtle, and Varitek does it
well. On a Friday night at Fenway in May against the Angels, he
saved a run when he made Matt Walbeck miss the dish. Sunday,
Varitek denied Seattle's David Bell.
</P>
<P>
   With the Sox trailing, 5-4, in the fifth, Alex Rodriguez hit
what looked like a certain sacrifice fly to left. Troy O'Leary made
the catch, but Bell tagged at third and was significantly ahead of
O'Leary's throw. Varitek stuck out his left foot and Bell _
eschewing any kind of slide _ stepped on the catcher's foot instead
of the plate. Bell kept running all the way to the Seattle on-deck
circle and Varitek chased him and tagged him near the box seats.
Too bad we were spared the sight of a rundown between the on-deck
circle and home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been tough if he ran like Jacque Jones,'' said
Varitek with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the most focused players I've seen in a long
time,'' said Boston manager Jimy Williams. ``He certainly had a
great day today, not only with the home runs but blocking the
plate. There is no stat for that.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some stats that indicate Varitek, a 27-year-old
second-year player, is moving into the elite class of American
League catchers. He may not be Carlton Fisk, but he's moving up on
Rich Gedman. Varitek leads all AL backstops in total chances and
doubles (33). Rodriguez is the only AL catcher with more homers.
</P>
<P>
   So what about it, Dan? When you suckered Seattle with
Heathcliffe, did you know what you were getting in Varitek?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was drafted three times,'' deadpanned the Duke. ``He was
well-scouted as an amateur player. At the time of the trade (July
31, 1997), Jason still hadn't really established himself in
professional ball. He went to the Winter Instructional League in
'97, then, to his credit, made our club out of spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   Varitek shared the catching duties with Scott Hatteberg in 1998.
He hit .253 with seven homers in 86 games. They were still sharing
the job before Hatteberg hurt his elbow this spring. Now Varitek is
very much No. 1, and it shows in the trainer's room. After Sunday's
win, he wore ice packs on his back, right shoulder, and right knee.
He doesn't want to come out of a game, or a series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tough,'' said teammate Mike Stanley, a former catcher.
``That's the No. 1 thing you've got to be. Guys try to run you over
and you get hit with foul tips. There's so many different things,
mentally and physically. He's strong-willed.''
</P>
<P>
   And strong-bodied.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got barrel kegs for legs,'' noted Stanley. ``No one's
gonna run him over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All you got to do is check those thighs out,'' added the
manager. ``He's got great trunks.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra, who has homered in all three games at Safeco,
teamed with Varitek at Georgia Tech and at the 1992 Olympic Games
in Barcelona. ``Jason's done a tremendous job for us this year,''
said Nomie. ``Catching all those games? That's unbelievable. He's
really been a big part of our game. He's definitely an intelligent
ballplayer and he's worked extremely hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Bret Saberagen, who has seen a catcher or two in his day,
compares Varitek to a young Todd Hundley. ``Like Todd, when Jason
first came up, he was so focused on his catching that his batting
average suffered. Jason's a great receiver, and as he learns more,
his batting average is going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   What else is there to know? Varitek was born in Michigan, made
it to the Little League World Series, and played high school ball
in Florida. He doesn't like to bring much attention to himself.
When veteran Rod Beck joined the Red Sox, Varitek gave away No. 47
because that's the number Beck always had worn. So now Varitek is
No. 33 in your program. Every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, every day,'' he said. ``We're in this thing to win, now.
Just that gets you through.''

BRUINS' BOURQUE A CLASS ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Mass. _ If you didn't look at his face and only
watched him skate around on the first day of the Bruins' training
camp Sunday, it'd be easy to conclude 38-year-old Ray Bourque was a
28-year-old veteran instead. The experience is there, the
efficiency of motion, the block of granite of a body. He continues
to defy time and age.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque always has been happy to lead by example. However, when
it comes to the young players who have matured into seasoned
competitors, Bourque has taken an active role as a mentor.
</P>
<P>
   He was side by side with Gord Kluzak when the No. 1 overall pick
in 1982 broke into the league before injuries ended Kluzak's career
prematurely. He helped Don Sweeney gain the recognition he
deserved. He ushered 18-year-old Kyle McLaren into the league his
first year. The last couple of seasons, his pupil has been Hal
Gill, who is out of camp at the moment in a contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   As stellar as Bourque's career has been, he said he takes just
as much pride in acting as a teacher to some very willing pupils.
It looks as if two prime candidates this year will be 19-year-old
defensemen Jonathan Girard and 20-year-old Nick Boynton, with whom
Bourque was paired Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy doing that, and I'm enjoying their progress,'' said
Bourque. ``I played a little bit with Boynton, and he seems to have
some pretty good composure. He had a great year in junior; they won
the Memorial Cup and he was the MVP, so he has to be doing
something right.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque knows Girard even better. Girard spent the summer
working with the same trainer Bourque uses _ Ben Leduc _ and
coupled with the fact that Girard spent a little bit of time with
Boston early last season before being sent back to his junior team
in the Quebec League, Bourque believes he'll come into this year
much better prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did Ben's program all summer, and he was tested three times
and he's in great shape,'' said Bourque, who added that team scout
Daniel Dore comes from the same area in Quebec as Leduc and put
Girard together with him. ``He's a great athlete, very strong. He's
very serious how he goes about his business. He's very dedicated.
Ben had a lot of fun working with him. He's got all the tools. One
thing he's got to do is stay with it. He has a tendency at times to
get a little relaxed. He's intense, but he needs to keep that
intensity constant, and if he does that, he's going to stay here.
He's got it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngsters who come to camp have grown up watching Bourque.
Many, like Girard, weren't even born when Bourque first started
playing, so Bourque said he tries to put them at ease. Some are
more apt to seek his counsel than others, and there are varying
degrees of intimidation when dealing with a player of Bourque's
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he gets a lot of queries from the young players,
Bourque smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the person,'' he said. ``A guy might take a
little while to get comfortable around me, especially the first
year, but I try to go up to them early and try to point out a few
things to look for. As we go on, I keep doing that, and they'll
come to me and ask me about certain things. We're lucky, too, to
have a guy like (assistant coach Jacques Laperriere) who's so good
with the defensemen. He covers so much about the position that all
you have to do is kind of feed off him, and a lot of times you're
repeating what Lappy has been telling them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque said he's enjoyed every playing partner he's had, and
they've all been important for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a blast with Gordie Kluzak,'' he said. ``We have a
pretty special relationship. Donny has gone on to be super solid
and overachieving. Because of his size and his heart, he's played
great. Kyle came in as an 18-year-old, and making the team and my
playing with him for the first year and him being a big part of the
club was great. Same thing with Hal. He was a big guy and they
loved his reach and all that, but they didn't know if he was going
to be able to play at this level. Then you've got Jaromir Jagr and
all those guys talking about him being the toughest guy to play
against. That's quite a feat after only a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Bourque's career will come to an end. He is signed
through this season and reiterated Sunday he won't make a decision
on whether to extend it beyond that until after he plays it out.
</P>
<P>
   With the retirement of players such as Wayne Gretzky, Dale
Hunter, Dino Ciccarelli, and Craig Ludwig in Bourque's age group,
it hits home how remarkable Bourque's career run has been,
especially since at the age of 38, he was a finalist for the Norris
Trophy last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that way for quite a while now,'' said Bourque. ``I
know that I'm very fortunate and lucky to still be playing. I still
feel I'm at a good level. I'm not the player I was 10 years ago,
but I'm still able to be real productive and to be a part of this
team. I know I'm very fortunate to still enjoy what I do for a
living. When you see those guys retire, you just know your turn and
your number is coming up. I'm not looking past this year. I'll play
this year and see how it goes and how I feel, but I know there's
not all that much time left.''
</P>
<P>
   Time ticks on, and so does Bourque with Season No. 21 on deck.

VARITEK HOMERS KEEP RED SOX AFLOAT 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-MARINERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Yes, it's true, Jimy Williams admitted Sunday
afternoon. Even as his Red Sox were rallying behind Jason Varitek's
three-run home run during a five-run eighth inning that carried
them over the Seattle Mariners, 9-7, his mind was elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a nice win for us, a really nice win to come back,''
Williams said, ``but yeah, I was watching (the scoreboard) out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   That was more than his left fielder, Troy O'Leary, could say on
an inside-out afternoon at Safeco Field, which began with the roof
opening for the first pitch and closing when rain came in the
bottom of the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't look today, but yeah, everybody looks,'' said
O'Leary, who made two tumbling catches and threw out a runner at
home plate. ``Who won today?''
</P>
<P>
   Among the three teams contending for the wild-card spot in the
American League, only the Red Sox. While the A's fell to the Tigers
in Oakland and the Blue Jays were losing in Kansas City, the Sox
slew Seattle on the strength of Varitek's two home runs, four hits
by Nomar Garciaparra, including his third home run in three games,
and 6 2/3 innings of solid relief work by the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   With 25 games left, the Sox lead the A's by two games, the Blue
Jays by four and they also assured themselves of no worse than a
split of this four-game series with the Mariners, who had home runs
from twin terrors Ken Griffey (his 42d, tying him with Texas's
Rafael Palmeiro for the AL lead) and Alex Rodriguez (No. 35) but
could not hold the 5-2 lead they took against ineffective starter
Mark Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   While O'Leary did his part, he saw no reason for an assembly
around his locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about me,'' he said. ``This is about 'tek. He won
the game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Varitek, the catcher who once belonged to the Mariners but was
bounced to the other coast along with Derek Lowe for Heathcliff
Slocumb, the Human Angioplasty, ended a string of 118 at-bats
without a home run with his pair Sunday. He also blocked the plate
in the fifth inning to keep David Bell from scoring after he tagged
and raced homeward on Rodriguez's sinking liner nabbed by O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, who came up throwing, said he didn't think he had a
chance at doubling up Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I slid for a long time,'' O'Leary said. ``I don't
know what happened at home plate. I still don't know what happened.
All I know is I was running off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever John Wasdin, who was backing up the plate, saw exactly
what took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tripped over Jason's foot,'' Wasdin said. ``I kept saying,
`He didn't touch the plate, he didn't touch the plate,' because the
umpire (Dale Scott) never made a call. He just looked at Jason, who
might already have known it.''
</P>
<P>
   Varitek sped after Bell and tagged him out steps away from the
Mariners' dugout, which ended 2 2/3 innings of scoreless work by
Wasdin, who came under scrutiny from Seattle manager Lou Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept saying something about my belt, my belt,'' Wasdin
said. ``He was probably thinking, `That guy doesn't have anything
that moves like that,' after I threw a pitch that moved a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella went to Scott, who consulted with crew chief Al Clark
but never subjected Wasdin to a search.
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin was amused by the whole business. ``If they want to think
I was cheating, let them think that,'' he said, ``but that was kind
of weird. Maybe he liked my belt buckle. I bought it at Nordstrom's
on sale.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox scored two runs in the first but found Seattle starter
Freddy Garcia, a 14-game winner, to be no bargain thereafter. But
Varitek led off the fourth with a home run that made it 5-3,
Garciaparra homered (No. 21) to make it 5-4 in the fifth, and
though Seattle answered with Edgar Martinez's home run off Rich
Garces in the sixth to make it 6-4, Varitek would weigh in once
more in the eighth, this time against reliever Jose Paniagua.
</P>
<P>
   Singles by Garciaparra and designated hitter Jon Nunnally,
making his first start since his callup from Pawtucket, preceded
Varitek's blast into the right-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``His first home run was a line drive that if it had been a foot
lower would have been caught by the second baseman but was gone
when it came off his bat,'' Wasdin said. ``The second one, they
tried to pitch him up and in, but Jason got on top of the ball. Jay
(Buhner, the right fielder) didn't move. He killed that ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox added two more runs on Wilton Veras's single, Damon
Buford's double and a base hit by Jose Offerman. Derek Lowe, loser
of the 2-1 heartbreaker that opened this series, gave up a run in
the ninth on Griffey's opposite-field double, but thrust his fist
after striking out Rodriguez for his 11th save, preserving Garces's
fourth win.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, of course, came with Varitek in the trade for Slocumb,
when both were still in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, it's not like either one of us were mainstays here,''
Lowe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trades are trades. We could have both fizzled out and been
done, and it would have been a good trade for them. But he's the
starting catcher, I'm the part-time closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trades are crazy. You never know.''

PATRIOTS CAN BEAT TUNA WITHOUT THE HYPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ This week will be a fitness fanatic's dream
and a fisherman's delight.
</P>
<P>
   It's Tuna Week.
</P>
<P>
   Six days from now, New England's football team journeys to a
swamp known as the Meadowlands to meet the New York Jets in Tuna
Bowl V, the semiannual confrontation between the Ghost of Christmas
Past and the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   It is a football game whose size knows no bounds. If it were a
park it would be Yellowstone, not Fenway. If it were a building it
would be the Sears Tower, not the Prudential Center. If it were a
western it would be ``The Big Valley,'' not ``Bonanza.''
</P>
<P>
   It is BIG beyond big, a game like no other until the next time
they meet, in Tuna Bowl VI come Nov. 15 on ``Monday Night
Football,'' although in this case it will be MONDAY! NIGHT!
FOOTBALL!
</P>
<P>
   They are already gearing up their cliches for this event in both
places, preparing to talk about how it's just another game and it's
only one of 16 and, win or lose, it won't mean a thing if you don't
win the next Sunday, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity to get off on a great note,'' Patriots
coach Pete Carroll said Sunday of Tuna Bowl V. ``It's a chance to
take a full stride right from the get-go.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure it is. That's why Tennessee opened its season against
Wyoming instead of Florida State. It's why Florida played Western
Michigan instead of Michigan. It's why Arizona thought it had an
opportunity to get off on the right foot when it opened against
Penn State until it played the game.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, it's never a great opportunity for anything but
trouble to open your season against a great team, but this being
the NFL, that's the approach you're supposed to take faced with
such a situation. Ignore the obvious. Take a tip from our Commander
in Chief: ``Deny, deny, deny!''
</P>
<P>
   They will do that in Foxborough and down on Long Island all week
even though it's so far from the truth it's no longer even funny.
That will be especially true here in New England, where the
Patriots are 1-3 against Bill Parcells since the Tuna swam
downstream to become the Big Kahuna as well as the Tuna on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, truth be told, the Patriots are really 1-3 with
an asterisk because had John Hall not had a 29-yard field goal
attempt blocked in Tuna Bowl I by Mike Jones with 16 seconds to
play in regulation, New England would be 0-4 since Tuna was taken
off the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, each loss has been bigger than the previous one, from a
24-19 defeat in Tuna Bowl II two years ago to last year's 24-14 and
then 31-10 defeats. That makes for an aggregate score of 103-70 and
increasing margins of defeat that began at 5, then doubled to 10,
then more than doubled again to 21. If this continues, the Patriots
not only will lose Tuna Bowl V, they'll lose it by 42 points.
</P>
<P>
   One has to assume the latter will not be the case Sunday when
these evenly matched teams square off, but nothing that was done in
the past few days _ either by addition or subtraction _ will change
what is to come.
</P>
<P>
   No departed players such as Sedrick Shaw or Damon Denson (who
were half of the Tuna Ransom the Jets paid in draft picks to Bob
Kraft to allow Parcells to skip town) will make a difference. Nor
will incoming ones such as nose tackle Bob Kuberski, a career
backup at Green Bay and Atlanta whose arrival Sunday was heralded
by some as if he were Curly Culp, even though it was closer to
importing Curley Howard.
</P>
<P>
   No, when they kick it off in Tuna Bowl V, all that will really
count is whether or not Pete Carroll can convince his players that
this game isn't about the Tuna at all.
</P>
<P>
   Several departed Patriots acknowledged after leaving town that
the team had in the past gotten too bound up in devouring the Tuna
and not focused enough on simply doing what it does _ which,
frankly, is playing pretty well on the days when it concentrates on
football and nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   On those days, the team Carroll picked Sunday can beat the
Dolphins as well as the Tunas, so the problem he will face all week
is not so much how to beat the Jets or even how to beat Parcells.
The problem will be how to make sure his team doesn't beat itself
by wanting too badly to prove that the Tuna is not the shark he
seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put things in perspective, everybody's going to talk about
this game off the charts and all,'' Carroll conceded Sunday. ``We
gotta go get it and it's a critical opportunity for us to cash in
on, but next week (the Colts) is just as important. Hopefully we'll
keep it in a good perspective and keep a good head about it and
play our best football.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think there's any question that's out there (that
his team in the past has gotten too keyed up for the Jets game).
You can go beyond where you need to go. You can get caught up in
the hype. So it's important that we're mature about it, handle it
well, and know that it's an immediate thing and just have fun with
it and the fans have fun with it and we go about our business doing
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we do in our line of business is personal. We take
it all personal in all areas. But you can take it too far. Football
needs to remain No. 1 and winning No. 1, and anything personal has
got to be (left) in your back pocket for this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it does, because in Tuna Bowls I-IV it hasn't been left
there and the result was that the Tuna put them in his back pocket.
</P>
<P>
   There is but one way they can reverse that Sunday. The way to do
it is not to talk about how this is not Tuna Bowl V and not to talk
about how it isn't any different from any other game, but rather to
know it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   It is a football game. A big football game, to be sure. One of
the biggest of the year, because the psychological impact of
allowing ever-doubling losing margins to continue could be fatal to
the hopes of this new team in this new year. Yet it is just a game.
Still just one of 16.
</P>
<P>
   Just a game the Patriots can win if they look at it that way but
probably cannot win if they do what the rest of us will do this
week and turn it into another Tuna Bowl.

PATRIOTS ADD EXCITEMENT WHILE SUBTRACTING 15 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ With a team that too often finds itself in
emotional valleys so deep it can't fight its way out for entire
games, the Patriots coaching staff has been looking for a few
energetic souls to add some peaks to the equation.
</P>
<P>
   And so it wasn't shocking to see both seventh-round draft picks,
the magic act of Michael Bishop and Sean Morey, on the team's
53-man roster (plus supplemental draft pick J'Juan Cherry), which
Sunday was finalized, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop's presence on the roster was never in question as the
third quarterback, but Morey's was as the sixth receiver. The
Patriots have gone with five receivers in the past, but the team is
now gun-shy after losing most of its receiving corps to injuries
last year. So six were kept, and Morey will be used on cover teams
to add sparks and energy.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots resisted trading one of their veteran receivers
Sunday, just as they turned deaf ears on offers for Terry Glenn on
draft day. The team tried to make a deal for a linebacker, but all
the ones who were available were too expensive, including
Philadelphia's William Thomas, who will earn $2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   There was no real suspense, though the Patriots did part with
third-year offensive guard Damon Denson, heading the list of the 15
given their walking papers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Denson, who was one of the Bill Parcells compensation
picks and who started four games at left guard last year, the
Patriots also let go of sixth-round pick Marcus Washington, though
it appears that if the safety isn't claimed on waivers he'll wind
up on New England's practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   Another cut who could wind up on the squad is Garrett Johnson,
the rookie free agent defensive tackle from Illinois whose fate was
sealed when the Patriots acquired veteran Bob Kuberski. Johnson was
impressive throughout camp, but the team elected to go with eight
defensive linemen, with veteran Sterling Palmer the surprise among
the eight kept.
</P>
<P>
   The team also went heavy on linebackers, keeping eight,
including Ted Johnson. He was not placed on the injured reserve
list, meaning the team believes he can return from his ruptured
biceps tendon. The Patriots cut Billerica's Dana Cottrell and kept
backups Ron Merkerson, Bernard Russ, Vernon Crawford, and Marty
Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Also cut were linebacker Aaron Adams, tight ends Jamie Bowers
and Henry Lusk, cornerback Jayson Bray, defensive end Willie Cohens
(two sacks in the exhibition season), safety Kadar Hamilton (a big
32-yard interception return in the Carolina game), cornerback Corey
Ivy, wide receiver Anthony Ladd, defensive end Tim Martin,
defensive tackle Jon McCall, and defensive tackle Leonta Rheams, a
fourth-round pick two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The roster:
</P>
<P>
   QUARTERBACK (3): Drew Bledsoe, John Friesz, and Michael Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it was going to be from the start. Bishop may be
the guy who plays if Bledsoe gets hurt for a long period of time,
but Friesz will go in if Bledsoe needs to shake off a minor injury.
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING BACKS (6): Kevin Faulk, Terry Allen, Chris Floyd, Tony
Carter, Harold Shaw, and Lamont Warren.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said Faulk and Allen will share the load, while Shaw
made it as a special teams player and possible change-of-pace
runner. Warren is the third-down back.
</P>
<P>
   WIDE RECEIVERS (6): Terry Glenn, Shawn Jefferson, Troy Brown,
Tony Simmons, Vincent Brisby, and Sean Morey.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem like too many, but the Patriots realize there's some
fragility in this group and they don't want to be calling on
40-year-old Henry Ellard to bail them out at midseason. Morey has a
chance to be a Wayne Chrebet type, and his brilliant 47-yard
reception in the fourth quarter of the Carolina game sealed his
spot.
</P>
<P>
   TIGHT ENDS (3): Ben Coates, Rod Rutledge, and Mike Bartrum.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, Lusk or Bowers would have been kept as a
third tight end, but the Patriots went heavy on linebackers, so
Bartrum becomes a receiver as well as the long-snapper. Lusk's
dismissal also enabled the Patriots to pay Kuberski the veteran
minimum of $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSIVE LINE (9): Bruce Armstrong, Max Lane, Damien Woody,
Todd Rucci, Zefross Moss, Heath Irwin, Jason Andersen, Derrick
Fletcher, and Ed Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Denson just didn't do anything to push the starting guards,
while Irwin did. Ellis won a reprieve, but if the Patriots need a
roster spot, he seems to be on the cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE LINE (8): Willie McGinest, Chad Eaton, Henry Thomas,
Brandon Mitchell, Chris Sullivan, Bob Kuberski, Sterling Palmer,
and Greg Spires.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots kept Palmer hoping he can be their Ferric Collons:
Stop the run and maybe be a decent pass rusher if his health holds
up. Spires is a good situational pass rusher and can reduce
McGinest's reps.
</P>
<P>
   LINEBACKERS (8): Tedy Bruschi, Andy Katzenmoyer, Chris Slade,
Ted Johnson, Vernon Crawford, Bernard Russ, Ron Merkerson, and
Marty Moore.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of quality, the Patriots went with quantity. If
Katzenmoyer and Moore are hurt for the Jets game, it may fall to
Russ and Merkerson in the middle. So many were kept because so many
are getting hurt.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE BACKS (9): Ty Law, Steve Israel, Lawyer Milloy, Chris
Carter, Tebucky Jones, Kato Serwanga, Larry Whigham, Tony George,
and J'Juan Cherry.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots don't have to count Cherry, a supplemental draft
pick out of Arizona State, for two weeks after the final roster is
set. There's still some concern about the nickel package, an area
the Patriots will continue to tinker with.
</P>
<P>
   KICKERS (2): Adam Vinatieri and Lee Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials were not available for comment on the final cuts.

SHAKEUP IN STORE FOR REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The campaign has started in earnest. Six
games remain in the Revolution's fourth Major League Soccer season,
and what occurs in the next few weeks likely will determine the
direction of the team for next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution will remain in the playoff race through games
against Kansas City Tuesday and at Miami Saturday. And if they can
rally as they did in the final six games of last year, they have a
legitimate chance of remaining in contention to the end, and also
of keeping the status quo for next season.
</P>
<P>
   During last September and October, many current members of the
team solidified their positions with effective and purposeful
performances. This is what they will need to do again to convince
management not to make major changes.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Revolution continue to falter as they did in a 5-1
loss to Tampa Bay Saturday, there surely will be an overhaul of the
team. The Revolution, and most of the players, will need a fresh
start.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is difficult to imagine the Revolution succeeding in the
next month. Not only do they carry the burden of having failed to
win in regulation time since July 4, they also simply do not have
enough substance in their game on which to fall back in difficult
times.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will they ever become a consistent, organized team without a
strong central defense. Imad Baba (groin) could make his season
debut Tuesday, and Leonel Alvarez (right quadriceps) could return
Saturday, but until the Revolution solve their problems in the
back, they will not win.
</P>
<P>
   Player-coach Walter Zenga had the right idea when he was placed
in charge last year. The foundation of the team needed to be
rebuilt, and Zenga started with the back line.
</P>
<P>
   If the Revolution could hold the fort in the back and the rest
of the team could be committed to defending en masse, they could
establish an identity. This pragmatic approach should have kept the
Revolution from the devastating blowouts that destroyed their
confidence last season.
</P>
<P>
   But Zenga overestimated the abilities and the resourcefulness of
his players. Zenga also might have overestimated his own coaching
prowess and his ability to inspire loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Once Dan Calichman began struggling with injuries in June, the
Revolution's difficulties accelerated. Soccer teams simply cannot
succeed without a strong central defense. The foundation of the
best MLS teams is experienced, quality central defenders. This does
not mean they need to be bruising, tough guys, because the position
also requires finesse and speed, and duties can be executed with
elegance. And though these defenders are usually the ones who
administer punishment, they are also vulnerable _ so it is a good
idea to stock up on them.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga had hoped to bring Giuseppe Bergomi to the Revolution to
bolster the defense. But if Zenga does not return next season,
there is little chance of Bergomi arriving. And unless the
Revolution can recruit a player with some of Bergomi's qualities,
they certainly will be in trouble again next year.

ALMOST FINISHED AFTER THESE STARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ So much for fresh starts. For Lou Holtz, Tommy Bowden,
and Gary Barnett, the excitement of new jobs and new challenges
gave way to the harsh reality of game time over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   All three high-profile coaches, who took on new challenges at
different schools, opened their season Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   All three saw their teams lose.
</P>
<P>
   Not much was expected of Bowden, coming off an unbeaten season
at Tulane and having to reconstruct the program at Clemson, or
Holtz, who is at the University of South Carolina after a two-year
post-Notre Dame hiatus with CBS.
</P>
<P>
   And not much happened. South Carolina was washed out by its own
mistakes, the remnants of Hurricane Dennis, and a North Carolina
State team that is a surprising 2-0 after its 10-0 win over the
Gamecocks.
</P>
<P>
   Some Clemson fans feared the worst when they saw the Tigers were
hosting a tougher-than-many-people-realize Marshall team in their
home opener. They got it, as Marshall pulled out a 13-10 win.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst debut by far was Barnett's return to Colorado,
where he had cut his coaching teeth a decade ago as an assistant on
Bill McCartney's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Much was expected of Barnett, who coined the phrase ``Return to
Dominance'' in the preseason, hoping to spur the Buffaloes back to
the days when they were a national power.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Colorado proved it is not even the best team in its
own state as Colorado State pounded the Buffs, 41-14. The game was
marred at the end by an incident between unruly fans and police who
determined they needed to be quelled with tear gas and pepper
spray.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to blame me and you've got to blame my players,''
said Barnett. ``I know it's probably commonplace for us to stand
here and say we'll move on to the next game, but it won't be that
easy. We have to find out why this happened. This is going to
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   How bad was it? Colorado, which entered the game ranked 14th in
the Associated Press poll, trailed, 28-0, at halftime and never
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still hoping that I wake up and it's Saturday morning and
we're still in the hotel,'' lamented Colorado safety Robbie
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz's debut at South Carolina was not much better. Try this:
South Carolina was inside the North Carolina State 35 eight times
and came up with nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, looking every bit his 62 years after the game, talked
about a lot of things, including the torrential rains that pelted
the 51,500 fans who chose to spend Saturday night at Carter-Finley
Stadium in Raleigh. ``We just haven't had a lot of practice playing
in the rain,'' said Holtz. ``We haven't had much rain this summer.
And the few times it did, we had lightning, so we had to go inside.
We're not fast enough to dodge lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   Or North Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Clemson, 85,000 fans came to Death Valley expecting a
revival of the program led by Bowden, son of Florida State's Bobby
Bowden, and coming off a 12-0 season at Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, my friend. Marshall took care of business early.
Clemson missed three field goals, including a potentially tying
34-yarder with 10 seconds left, and Marshall, a Division 1-AA
program only a few years ago, handed Clemson its first home-opener
loss since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Two other returning coaches did make successful debuts. Former
Southern Cal coach John Robinson won his opener at Nevada-Las
Vegas, beating North Texas Thursday night, while former University
of Miami coach Dennis Erickson won his opener at Oregon State,
topping Nevada Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was good news, bad news for siblings of Patriots. Patriots
quarterback Drew Bledsoe's younger brother Adam was one of the
victims of the Colorado State pounding. He and starting Colorado QB
Mike Moschetti were sacked nine times and combined for four
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   That was the bad news. The good news?
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Terrence Edwards caught 10 passes for 196 yards and two
touchdowns in Georgia's 38-7 rout of Utah State in its opener.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards is the younger brother of Patriots running back Robert
Edwards, whose career with New England may be over after he
sustained a career-threatening knee injury in a flag football game
during last season's Pro Bowl festivities in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Edwards, who recently bought a house in Athens, near
where he is doing his rehabilitation on the Georgia campus, was on
hand to watch his brother's college debut.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a warning for Top 25 teams. Beware of Sonny Lubick's
Colorado State squad. Although the Rams have seldom been in the Top
25 during Lubick's tenure, his Colorado State teams are 9-8 against
Top 25 competition . . . Nice to see Texas bounce back from last
week's embarrassing upset loss at home to North Carolina State. The
Longhorns took their frustrations out on Stanford in a 69-17
victory. Naturally, someone had a criticism of the Longhorns
attack, which featured a superb performance by sophomore
quarterback Major Applewhite (17 of 27, 353 yards, 3 TDs),
suggesting that Texas's running game needed some work. Said
second-year Texas coach Mack Brown, ``If we score 69 points, I
won't worry about the run. We'll worry about that later.'' Since
Texas plays Rutgers next week, Brown shouldn't have too much to
worry about. The other Longhorn highlight of the evening was
hotshot freshman QB Chris Simms, who threw his first collegiate
touchdown pass. Simms's father, Phil, the former New York Giants
signal-caller, was in the stands cheering.

   Stupid Prediction of the Week: Hawaii Gov. Ben Cayetano
predicting that the Rainbows, 27-point underdogs to Southern
California, and a team that hasn't won a game since 1997, would
upset the Trojans. Final score: USC 62, Hawaii 7 . . . Virginia
Tech, which had been temporarily shunted aside in the Big East
picture because of all of the publicity generated by Miami's win
over Ohio State last week, made its debut Saturday night against
James Madison. As expected, the Hokies rolled to a 47-0 triumph.
And, as predicted by many, redshirt freshman quarterback Michael
Vick had a spectacular debut, running for three touchdowns before
being knocked out of the game in a dive into the end zone. Vick
gave Hokies coach Frank Beamer and the fans in Blacksburg a scare
when trainers worked on him for several minutes after he flipped
over a tackler and landed on his ankle. X-rays were negative,
however, and Vick says he will be ready to play against
Alabama-Birmingham next Saturday.

<P>
   Penn State coach Joe Paterno continued his two-quarterback
system in a 70-24 win over Akron, using starter Kevin Thompson and
junior Rashard Casey. Paterno never has been a two-QB guy, but he
is willing to go along with the plan for now. ``Both looked pretty
good and they have no problems with it,'' said Paterno. ``I'm not
trying to create a problem for myself, but I think both are
handling it well.'' Paterno probably can afford to experiment
another week since the Lions face Pittsburgh, but then comes a game
at Miami, which will be anything but easy . . . Part of Boston
College's opening success in its 30-29 win over Baylor can be
attributed to conditioning. For the last two years, most of the
Eagles have remained on campus during the summer, engaging in a
strenuous conditioning program. Eagles coach Tom O'Brien believes
conditioning was a factor in the win. ``Being able to stay on
campus the past two summers has helped, no question,'' he said
Sunday as he savored the victory.

VENUS WILLIAMS CATCHES A BREAK 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She lasted through a hotter than hot start by Mary
Joe Fernandez. She lasted through _ and caught a break from _ three
rain delays. She took full advantage of a slip that felled
Fernandez and left her opponent with a strained right quadriceps.
</P>
<P>
   And not long after they turned on the lights in Arthur Ashe
Stadium at the request of several loud fans, No. 3 seed Venus
Williams rolled into the US Open quarterfinals after turning around
Sunday's match against Fernandez, 2-6, 6-1, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is on a collision course with No. 1 seed Martina
Hingis, who beat No. 10 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, 6-4, 7-5. Just two
obstacles stand in the way of that Williams-Hingis semifinal:
Williams must get past Barbara Schett and Hingis past Anke Huber.
No. 12 seed Schett crushed Elena Likhovtseva, 6-0, 6-1, and Huber
upset No. 15 seed Amelie Mauresmo, 6-4, 6-4, to reach her first
quarterfinal in a major.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis made it an even dozen straight wins over Sanchez Vicario.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, the 1997 champ, and Sanchez Vicario, the winner in 1994,
were headed for a second-set tiebreaker. But Hingis put away a
short ball and then watched a Sanchez Vicario shot go wide, making
it 15-40 and match point. Hingis nailed a forehand winner, and it
was over.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis beat Sanchez Vicario, 6-1, 6-1, in Canada last month and
knew she would be in for a tougher match on a bigger stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't underestimate anybody, especially right now,''
Hingis said. ``Not here.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 7 seed Todd Martin got his own breaks against Magnus
Larsson, winning the third-round match when Larsson retired with a
bad knee after Martin won the first set, 6-3. Martin knew Larsson
was hurting, but he still was caught off guard when his opponent
came over and shook his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, when he came up to shake my hand I was a little
surprised, because, you know, when someone is really ailing, it's
usually a bit more one-sided than one squeaky break,'' said Martin.
</P>
<P>
   In another third-rounder, No. 9 seed Greg Rusedski, the
runner-up at the US Pro at Longwood, knocked out Chris Woodruff of
Knoxville, Tenn., 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The day's play was delayed by rain (more is expected Monday),
which raised havoc with the schedule. Hingis's meeting with Sanchez
Vicario became a night match, as did several men's matches.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez had Williams moving all over the court in the early
part of their match. Fernandez broke Williams the first three times
she served and grabbed the opening set.
</P>
<P>
   Then the match turned. In the first game of the second set,
Williams was in a 15-40 hole,giving Fernandez three break points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went for a lob on one,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 6 feet 1 inch, went up and drilled a winner on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me why I would have lobbed her,'' Fernandez said.
``That was definitely a big game, because then I would have gone to
the other side with the wind. A couple games like that, and you
start thinking, `Gee, if I don't start playing better or winning
these games, I'm going to be in a big hole.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, she was.
</P>
<P>
   Williams broke Fernandez, and it was 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   At deuce in the next game, a light rain began to fall.
Fernandez, chasing a shot on the baseline, slipped and landed on
the court and sat there for a couple of minutes, hurting, and
taking stock of her situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how many body parts I hurt,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   The players took what turned into a 90-minute rain break, and
when they came back, Fernandez was tightly taped. Williams quickly
took control of the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just started to move me a lot more, obviously,'' Fernandez
said. ``I think my balls were landing a little bit shorter, so it
gave her the opportunity to dictate play a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I started playing more consistently, stopped missing a lot,''
Williams said. ``Once you start doing that, you aren't giving so
many points away.''
</P>
<P>
   Huber survived her own rain delay _ and a case of nerves _ on
the way to beating Mauresmo.
</P>
<P>
   She had Mauresmo down, love-40, for the match when the No. 15
seed escaped the first match point. Then a round of showers led to
a quick break. When they came back out, Mauresmo held on for that
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very tight,'' Huber said. ``I was getting really
nervous. I said to myself when it was raining, `Come on, keep
quiet, concentrate, take it easy.' Somehow I couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   She then held serve for the match.

MARTIN VOLUNTEERS HIS OPINION 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-MARTIN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While such starving, destitute golf players as Tiger
Woods and David Duval hope somehow to subsist during their
miserably underpaid Ryder Cup weekend in Boston toiling for the
USA, a well-compensated tennis player named Todd Martin believes
everybody's got it all wrong. Including his Davis Cup employer, the
US Tennis Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody should be paid to play for his
country,'' Martin is saying after a semi-free ride into the US Open
fourth round Sunday. ``That means me and my teammates, too. The
honor . . . the privilege . . . that's enough. I'd really like to
see guys be proud to represent their country, and leave it at
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who'd labored nine sets in winning his first two matches
and expected to be severely tested by the lofty Swede, Magnus
Larsson, needed only 36 minutes. Loftier by two inches at 6 feet 6
inches, Martin came in shorter head-to-head (2-4). But Larsson
surrendered on losing a 6-3 set, unable to continue on a wobbly
knee, and the subtitled St. Elsewhere Open limped on, also claiming
Mary Joe Fernandez for an illustrious list of wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Rock-hard courts and a loonily overlong season are an unkind
combination for those depending on their bodies to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   In this golden age of greed, Martin may seem loony himself in
setting forth his radically unfashionable feelings about sporting
volunteerism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm an idealist, and that most of the guys disagree
with me,'' he says, sitting on a table in the trainers' room. ``But
I think the $25,000 additional the USTA contributes to a charity of
our choice is sufficient. That's fine. And some expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   He sounds like somebody out of the ``ask not what your country
can do for you, ask what you can do for your country'' 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   For quite a while, the USTA has paid its Davis Cuppers and its
female Fed Cuppers handsomely, although for some seemingly
embarrassed reason, the USTA tries to keep it secret, as though
amateurism were still in effect. The tennis players do a lot better
financially than the disgruntled US Ryder Cuppers, who may arrive
at The Country Club by bus or hitch-hiking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problem paying our teams, and paying them well,''
says Rick Fermon, the USTA's executive director. But then he
refuses to say how much. I can imagine thousands of USTA members
and financial donors would be interested to know the amounts
lavished on millionaires to wear the red-white-blue. They are pros.
They get paid, and the figures should be public. Probably the USTA
can afford it, since the current Open will net $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   It is known that the US team, defeated, 4-1, by Australia at
Longwood Cricket Club in Brookline in July, got at least $50,000
for each player for the weekend, and also that the USTA was
prepared to pay Pete Sampras a million bucks for the season not
long ago. Sampras turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   The German Tennis Federation hired Boris Becker and Michael
Stich for a million apiece a few years ago, but that didn't buy the
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In a postmortem on that lost weekend at Longwood, Martin agrees
that the US didn't put its best sneakered feet forward. ``The
singles lineup should have had Pete. Pete and I or Pete and Jim
(Courier). But Pete wasn't comfortable with it. He wouldn't play
anything but doubles, and the rest of the guys sort of agreed with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   He declines to knock the failed leadership, captain Tom
Gullikson, whose job is understandably shaky. Leading candidates
appear to be the telecaster Brothers McEnroe, John and Patrick, and
Harold Solomon, presently coaching Jennifer Capriati.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll play for anybody, and I have complete faith in
Gullikson,'' Martin says.
</P>
<P>
   I guess I'm as outdated as Martin in believing, as he does, that
athletes should receive no more than room, board, carfare, and the
charitable contributions for the priceless opportunity to flaunt
the stars and stripes. However, I must confess having accepted cash
for the same myself, $90 monthly as a US Army corporal, and I
concede it was a bad deal for the country.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Todd, how naive can we be?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I know we all hope Les Miserables of the Links can
get what they consider a square deal. Or will Tiger and the gang
have to pack their own lunches before going to work at The Country
Club? Don't worry. I know a couple of club members who've promised
to provide peanut butter sandwiches and chocolate chip cookies for
our side.

`SIXTH SENSE' SCARING UP BIG MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``The Sixth Sense'' continued its supernatural
late-summer performance at the nation's multiplexes, easily posting
its fifth consecutive victory with an impressive $21 million at
2,775 theaters for Friday-Sunday amid a moderate Labor Day weekend
overall at the box office, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend reflected the ongoing strength of the summer's box
office, which has posted its second straight record with a final
Memorial Day-Labor Day gross of more than $2.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than 12 percent above the 1998 record and has been
driven by a wide array of mass appeal films, highlighted by ``Star
Wars: Episode I,'' ``Austin Powers, The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' ``Big
Daddy,'' ``Tarzan,'' and ``The Sixth Sense,'' all of which grossed
more than $160 million each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sense,'' boosting its take 5 percent from last weekend, became
the first film since ``Titanic'' to win five straight weekends. The
Disney release also smashed the four-day Labor Day record of $17.2
million, set six years ago by ``The Fugitive,'' and will likely
take in another $5 million or so today.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Sixth Sense' has become the movie that everyone wants to
see before the summer's over,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of
the Reel Source tracking service. ``It's phenomenal for a film to
do this in its fifth weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixth Sense'' has now grossed $168 million in 31 days, making
it the 49th highest domestic performer ever. Bucksbaum said the
Bruce Willis vehicle could lead next weekend despite competition
from openings of supernatural thrillers _ MGM's ``Stigmata'' and
Artisan's ``Stir of Echoes'' _ and eventually become the 15th film
to gross $250 million domestically.
</P>
<P>
   Industry tracker Arthur Rockwell said the key to the success of
``Sixth Sense'' has been to appeal to all audiences. ``When you can
cross over, that's when you rake it in,'' he added. ``Word of mouth
on this movie has been incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixth Sense'' elevated what would have been an ordinary Labor
Day weekend to well above average as it outgrossed the combined
total of the next three films _ Paramount's fifth weekend of
``Runaway Bride'' with $6.7 million at 3,013 theaters, Disney's
second weekend of ``The 13th Warrior'' with $6.1 million at 2,312
sites and Universal's fourth weekend of ``Bowfinger'' with $5.6
million at 2,704 locations. The overall Friday-Sunday total hit $83
million, up 25 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the hoopla over ``Sixth Sense'' and ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' ``Runaway Bride'' has become a solid late-summer smash
with grosses hitting $133.5million, making it 95th on the all-time
list and the second biggest Julia Roberts movie ever after ``Pretty
Woman'' at $178.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   MGM's fifth weekend of ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' finished
fifth with $4.6 million at 1,978 theaters, edging Warner Bros.'
first weekend of action-thriller ``Chill Factor'' with $4.4 million
at 2,557 sites. The results gave ``Factor'' an unimpressive $5.2
million since it opened Wednesday, reflecting the tough market for
what audiences perceive as second-tier entries in the action genre.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's third weekend of ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' continued to fade
in seventh with $3.6 million at 2,231 sites. The Hugh Grant comedy
has topped $25 million but will fall far short of the $114 million
total from ``Notting Hill,'' which paired Grant and Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Artisan's eighth weekend of ``Blair Witch'' scared up $3 million
at 2,301 sites in eighth to go past $133 million overall. That
edged Miramax's opening of ``Outside Providence'' with $2.8 million
at 1,050 theaters as the prep school comedy failed to generate much
interest despite being promoted as co-written by the Farrelly
brothers, whose ``Something About Mary'' grossed $176 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   USA Films' second weekend of ``The Muse'' finished 10th with $2
million at 1,263 theaters although the second weekends of New
Line's ``The Astronaut's Wife'' and Miramax's ``In Too Deep'' may
move into the weekend's top 10 when today's grosses are included.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said Labor Day tends to be a light holiday for
moviegoing because of the twin distractions of end-of-the-summer
parties and the start of school.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Day also represents the end of the summer season, which
broke last summer's record of $2.58 billion three weeks ago.
Year-to-date business has gone past $5 billion and leads the 1998
pace by 8 percent.

L.A.'S UNION STRENGTH AT 40-YEAR HIGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV AND BETH BARRETT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles has never been known as a labor city
like New York, Chicago or San Francisco. In fact, its history is
marked with anti-labor sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as the nation commemorates Labor Day on Monday, nowhere
else will the celebration be louder than in Los Angeles, where
recent gains have made it one of the most union-active cities in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a banner year for us,'' said Miguel Contreras,
executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation
of Labor, AFL-CIO, an umbrella organization of 324 unions with some
800,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had so many victories this year that it shows Los
Angeles and the rest of the world that the labor movement is
committed to Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year alone, unions have added some 85,000 new
members _ 74,000 of them Los Angeles County home workers. New
members also include 1,600 teaching assistants at University of
California, Los Angeles, 500 Los Angeles County hospital doctors,
500 Metropolitan Transportation Authority workers and 6,000 Los
Angeles school district teachers.
</P>
<P>
   And other organizing drives are under way. Unions recently won
agreements from major firms at Los Angeles International Airport
and elsewhere to have a ``card neutrality'' program where employers
will not pressure workers against the union.
</P>
<P>
   So important is Los Angeles to the labor movement that for the
first time in 30 years, the AFL-CIO is holding its national
convention in the city in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``They chose us intentionally,'' Contreras said. ``When they had
it in Pittsburgh two years ago, they wanted to show an
organizational drive, and they couldn't find any. Here, in Los
Angeles, we were doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   So influential are the unions that the Democratic National
Committee, which only goes to cities with strong labor movements,
will hold its national convention in Los Angeles next year _ even
with a Republican chief executive, Mayor Richard Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the labor movement in Los Angeles and California
seemed near death.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say we were dinosaurs on the verge of extinction,''
Contreras said. ``We no longer mattered as part of the U.S.
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, the portion of American workers belonging to
unions had dropped to 13 percent, down from 35 percent in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Pete Wilson decided to challenge the labor movement with
Proposition 226 _ which would have prohibited unions from making
political donations without getting member approval _ coupled with
his support of initiatives such as Propositions 187 and 209.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those put us in contact with Latino organizations and others
and we worked together,'' Contreras said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mulholland, political director of the California Democratic
Party, said it did more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They painted over the rust,'' Mulholland said. ``Pete Wilson
brought them up to speed. They organized and went on to defeat
Proposition 226 and bring in an initiative increasing the minimum
wage to $5.75 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It raised the labor movement in California to one of the most
effective in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   And the unions were early supporters of Gov. Gray Davis in last
year's election, backing him against better-financed candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has paid off for them handsomely,'' Mulholland said. ``They
have key appointments in the administration and on various
commissions.''
</P>
<P>
   It also has resulted winning back requirements that employers
pay overtime after eight hours of work. In negotiations to create a
special transit zone for L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, one of the key
points has been making sure union workers do not lose any benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete Wilson helped in galvanizing unions,'' said Fabian Nunez,
political director of the county Federation. ``He became the
bogeyman because he was trying to take away so many things such as
OSHA regulation, trying to end prevailing wage.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a long road from the farms of the San Joaquin Valley to
L.A.'s political power circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would always be in a field with a bottle of
water,'' said Contreras, 47.
</P>
<P>
   He learned organizing in those hostile fields as a teen-ager and
during one particularly difficult strike in 1973, he was arrested
18 times for violating injunctions against picketing.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the farm workers union, he came to Los Angeles to
work with the Hotel and Restaurant Workers Union, where he met the
woman who would become his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Elena Durazo now heads that union. Together, they form a
potent team.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their union jobs, Contreras sits as a Riordan
appointee on the Los Angeles Airport Commission, and the mayor
appointed Durazo to the Recreation and Parks Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras described his relationship with the pro-business,
multimillionaire mayor as one of pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor knows we're here and that he has to work with us,''
Contreras said. ``Together, we can accomplish a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to say there haven't been disputes, such as over the recent
battle for a new City Charter.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras proudly shows off a picture in which he and Riordan _
with mock grimaces _ choke each other.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Kelly Martin said Riordan supports many union
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by political savvy and favorable court decisions,
unions have steadily entrenched themselves in government at all
levels in California, reaping salary rewards and some of the
nation's richest benefit packages as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians depend on unions as one of their deepest election
pockets and are reluctant to buck them. So friendly is the
relationship, politicians have led the charge for living wage and
other labor-friendly changes.
</P>
<P>
   Unions have proved again and again to be decisive as perhaps the
most organized of election forces in the city. In the Los Angeles
City Charter Reform Commission election, for instance, they proved
decisive in electing the 15-member panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have won 12 of the last 13 elections in the city and
Legislature,'' Nunez said. The one loss was in the 14th Council
District, where Nick Pacheco, supported by Riordan, won after the
union came late to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest boons to labor power has been something they
originally opposed _ term limits.
</P>
<P>
   Unions originally opposed the concept because they were able to
count on a cadre of political friends they had helped over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they put their money on new politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can marshal a block of voters for one election,'' said
Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Economic Development Corp. of
Los Angeles. ``In a lot of these races, there are so many
candidates, it's hard to tell the players without a scorecard. So
the unions are able to help decide on a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Kyser warned, union gains could have an unintended effect
on the local job market and employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the longer term, you have to look at what will happen to
the businesses generating these jobs,'' Kyser said. ``Will they
move if the costs to operate become too high?''
</P>
<P>
   Kyser also attributed much of the recent union gains to the
state of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it starts to drop, how will that affect unions?'' Kyser
asked. ``No one really knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyser also pointed to the change in union membership from years
past.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, unions were primarily filled with white males
coming from the aerospace and auto industries. Today, aerospace is
dwindling and the auto industry _ which once had plants in the
region _ has all but disappeared from California.
</P>
<P>
   The new union members are younger and represent a more diverse
ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   It is the growing influence of government unions that has
changed the way the labor movement operates, said Joel Kotkin of
Pepperdine University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an Achilles' heel for labor,'' Kotkin said. ``They become
so dominated by public employees that they will have losses where
they have had a traditional link with the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, they are becoming the advocates of an increased
bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Contreras sees no end to the growth of unions in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think conditions are right in Los Angeles,'' Contreras said.
``Two things are happening that resonate with workers. One is the
increasing wage gap between the high- and low-wage earners. And,
second, there is higher job insecurity, particularly in the middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``What unions do is help to create a better middle class.''

for Sunday, Sept. 5, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.

<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   (Moved in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   SMART-GENES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Now that researchers have shown
that mice can be made smarter, a whole world of opportunities opens
up. But there are serious ethical dilemmas involved. In mice,
monkeys and probably humans, nature has engineered a deliberate
fading of memory with age. Scientists have many caveats about
whether tweaking the genetic memory receptor would be helpful in
the more complicated human brain. After all, with too retentive a
memory you might clutter up your mind with all kinds of things
you'd be better off forgetting. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   WORK-HOURS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The much-acclaimed economic
expansion, now entering a record ninth year, may be attributable to
too much work. With the economy booming amid a labor shortage in
much of the country, there's so much work that needs to be done _
finishing that Web page, getting out that legal brief, putting the
final touches on those architectural plans _ that many Americans
are clocking 60-hour weeks. For many Americans, the 40-hour week
has become a fond, and unattainable, memory. A look at the pros and
cons. By Steven Greenhouse. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   AIRLINES-COMFORT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Just about anyone who has
flown in a coach section in recent years thinks that space is
getting more cramped and that airlines have installed narrower
seats and added more rows so they can wring a few more dollars of
profit out of each flight. But while the experience of flying may
indeed be worse than ever, airplane interiors have actually gotten
slightly larger in recent years. Boeing has done extensive
research, interviewing 10,000 people about what they hate most
about flying, and found that passengers tend to blame leg room and
seat width when they are really angry about other things. By
Laurence Zuckerman. (Eds: Will also move in `t' category)
</P>
<P>
   INVESTIGATIONS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Barely weeks after the
independent counsel law died and was bid good riddance, Washington
is astir with calls for a new round of independent investigations
led by special counsels _ on Waco, Democratic fund-raising, Russian
money laundering, etc. But wait a minute: Aggressive outside
investigations were supposed to be out of favor after the nation's
experience with Kenneth Starr's prolonged inquiry. What gives? The
answer is that things are back to normal in Washington now, even if
the legal mechanics have changed. By Stephen Labaton.
</P>
<P>
   TRADEMARKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Boom times have a trademarked
feel. Literally. It is harder and harder to get through the day
without tripping over the ubiquitous little `TM' symbol. Trademarks
flourish in a strong economy, and the boom of the late 1990s has
seen an increase in the trademarking of words, images and sounds by
at least 10 percent annually in three of the last four years. By
Felicity Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   BAD-WRITING-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ 19th century author Sir
Edward Bulwer-Lytton Edward has achieved eponymous infamy as the
patron saint of the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, an annual
competition held by the English department of San Jose State
University. The challenge is simple: ``to compose the opening
sentence to the worst of all possible novels.'' A look at some
examples.
</P>
<P>
   NY-GIULIANI-JUROR-REVIEW (New York) _ One angry man: what's the
verdict when the mayor is also jury foreman? Rudolph Giuliani's
upcoming jury duty raises the question of whether or not it is
desirable to have lawyers, politicians and celebrities serving on
juries. A look at the pros and cons. By David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   DC-URBAN-FOSSILS (Undated) _ Washington's hot asphalt streets
are just the right stuff for turning small objects that drop on
them into instant fossils. By Sarah Boxer. WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-REVIEW (Jakarta) _ Indonesia, the world's fourth
most-populous nation, is deep in a crisis of economics, politics
and national identity. Its leaders and institutions have lost much
of their popular standing and even their legitimacy. The forces
that most overtly held Indonesia together _ the unquestioned grip
of a dictator and the harshness of his military _ have retreated
since the forced resignation 15 months ago of President Suharto. A
country so unsure of its unity that it has made oneness an
obsession is being forced to rediscover the logic of its
nationhood. By Seth Mydans. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   ARMS-CONTROL-REVIEW (Washington) _ By many measures,
international arms control seems to be on the verge of unraveling,
if developments in the U.S. Russia, Iraq, Iran and North Korea,
India and Pakistan are any indication. Why, then, are many arms
control advocates echoing the bullish declaration of former CIA
Director Stansfield Turner, `This is the most opportune moment in
past 40 years for nuclear arms control'? By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   LANDMINES-REVIEW (Washington) _ It has been two years since the
death of Princess Diana gave a last, emotional boost to an
international treaty to ban anti-personnel landmines, then being
feverishly negotiated in Oslo. Some say her efforts to draw
attention to mines may be one of her greatest legacies. But what
kind of legacy is it? Despite a treaty signed by 135 countries to
ban their use, production and stockpiling, antipersonnel landmines
appear to be as popular as ever in fighting wars these days. By
Steven Lee Myers.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; THE EVOLUTION OF JANE &LR;  By Cathleen Schine. Plume, $12.95. This
clever novel uses the principles of natural selection to illuminate
the life of its heroine, a young American woman visiting the
Galapagos Islands. ``The book is a beautifully descriptive
travelogue ... loaded with mini-lectures on natural history,
evolutionary theory and Darwiniana, wrapped around a rollicking
family saga,'' Barbara Kingsolver wrote last year in The New York
Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WE WISH TO INFORM YOU THAT TOMORROW WE WILL BE KILLED WITH OUR
FAMILIES: Stories From Rwanda &LR;  By Philip Gourevitch. Picador USA,
$15. A New Yorker writer chronicles the massacre of as many as
800,000 Tutsis by the Hutu majority in Rwanda in 1994, examining
both the roots and the consequences of a genocidal crime carried
out not by soldiers but by neighbors, co-workers and relatives. His
ghastly account, selected as one of the best books of 1998 by the
editors of The New York Times Book Review, is filled with the
testimony of survivors, participants and witnesses. ``A grim book
this, and a burden on world conscience,'' Wole Soyinka wrote. ``It
closes the habitual avenue of escape _ anonymity _ for collective
atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFRICA: A BIOGRAPHY OF THE CONTINENT &LR; , by John Reader (Vintage,
$17), digs deep into prehistory to track the emergence of Homo
sapiens and Africa's extraordinary diversity of life and terrain,
as well as the modern woes of the sub-Saharan region. Last year the
reviewer Thomas Pakenham called this ``a masterly synthesis of the
geological, climatological and paleontological discoveries of the
last decades.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOLDEN CHILD &LR;  By Penelope Fitzgerald. Mariner/Houghton
Mifflin, $12. In the author's first novel, a stodgy London museum
is thrown into disarray when a wildly popular exhibit of an ancient
African king is found to be possibly fraudulent. The result is ``a
classically plotted British mystery ... leavened with a wicked
sense of rapierlike humor,'' Newgate Callendar wrote in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued another of Fitzgerald's novels,
 &UR; AT FREDDIE'S &LR;  ($12), which takes place at a famous school for
child actors run by a formidable old woman renowned in the London
theatrical world. In 1985 the reviewer Roxana Robinson was
generally unimpressed but called this a ``well-mannered,
well-written'' novel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BASQUIAT: A Quick Killing in Art &LR;  By Phoebe Hoban. Penguin,
$15.95. A magazine journalist traces the hype-saturated rise and
fall of the charismatic painter who went from graffiti artist to
Warhol collaborator and art-world phenom before burning out on
drugs at the age of 27. Last year Patricia Bosworth called this a
``compulsively readable'' biography.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AT THE OWL WOMAN SALOON: Stories &LR;  By Tess Gallagher. Scribner,
$12. The poet's second prose collection is grounded in blue-collar
realism, often involving characters struggling to make do in the
logging camps and faded beauty parlors of the Pacific Northwest. In
1997 the reviewer Sarah Ferguson called these tales ``a bittersweet
mixture of deflated New Age wisdom and tired wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HONOR'S VOICE: The Transformation of Abraham Lincoln &LR;  By
Douglas L. Wilson. Vintage, $15. This understated portrait starts
not with Lincoln's greatness as president but with the sources of
that greatness when he was between the ages of 22 and 33, searching
for identity and finding his way into law and politics. The book
``establishes Wilson as the leading historian of the young and
private Lincoln,'' Gabor Boritt wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ONE HAND CLAPPING &LR;  By Anthony Burgess. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $11.95.
Janet Shirley is a mild-mannered British housewife who is vaulted
into a world of luxury, courtesy of a loving husband with a
photographic memory who parlays his winnings on a television quiz
show into a fortune. Needless to say, it's a mixed blessing. ``Read
this witty and shrewdly joyful novel,'' Richard P. Brickner wrote
in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A WORLD TRANSFORMED &LR;  By George Bush and Brent Scowcroft.
Vintage, $16. The former president and his national security
adviser recount the Bush administration's major foreign-policy
challenges, including the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
Persian Gulf war. Their ``remarkably frank, intelligent'' account
is ``the most important book yet written about the end of the Cold
War,'' Fareed Zakaria wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RIVER WARREN &LR;  By Kent Meyers. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13.
This first novel borrows from ``Our Town'' and ``Rashomon'' in
exploring how the fatal crash of a trucker and his wife shatters
the tranquillity of a Midwestern farming town. The author ``moves
cleanly from the event itself to an insightful inspection of local
life and its discontents,'' James Polk wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEST OF MYLES &LR;  By Flann O'Brien (Myles na Gopaleen). Dalkey
Archive, $13.95. This selection of newspaper columns published in
The Irish Times from 1939 until the author's death in 1966 pokes
fun at everything from Gaelic revivalists to plumbers, and displays
a finely tuned ear for common Dublin speech. In 1968 the reviewer
Benedict Kiely praised the ``humorous, satirical, learned,
grave-faced, crazy writing.''

SACRED OR PROFANE, ODD OR MUNDANE, IT HAS A TRADEMARK 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (Eds: Replace (TM) with superscript trademark symbol)  
 (bl)  
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boom times have a trademarked feel. Literally. It is harder and
harder to get through the day without tripping over the little
``TM'' sign that is the equivalent of a ``No Trespassing _
Violators Will Be Prosecuted'' sign in an empty swath of New
England woods. It is not always clear who owns the property in
question, but it is abundantly clear that you don't. Tread on it at
your risk.
</P>
<P>
   One of the latest signs of TM-ing, as noted by The New York
Observer, popped up at the end of Cindy Adams' gossip column in The
New York Post. After years of signing off with the phrase ``Only in
New York, kids, only in New York,'' Ms. Adams has applied for a
trademark. She has also fenced off the word gossip, at least for
use in perfumes and cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   Trademarks flourish in a strong economy, and the boom of the
late 1990s has seen an increase in the trademarking of words,
images and sounds by at least 10 percent annually in three of the
last four years, according to figures from the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the rate of increase (Increase(TM) was registered by
Enrich Corp. for shampoos and nutritional supplements) is
turbocharged (Turbocharge(TM) is used by U S West Communications
Inc. for its credit-card validation services). If applications
continue at the current pace (Pace(TM) applied for or registered to
more than 250 entities), there will be 25 percent more in 1999 than
1998. One clue to the spike: The words ``dot com'' figure in 222
pending or registered trademarks on the government's trademark data
base.
</P>
<P>
   Trademarks differ from copyrights, which protect works of
creative expression _ books, artwork, music, commuter software and
the like. Businesses or individuals register trademarks to
establish the source of a product or service. It costs $245 to
register a trademark for a single class of goods.
</P>
<P>
   Even trademark is trademarked. Resistance is futile (Paramount
Pictures trademarked that Star Trekism for everything from pinball
machines to wrapping paper). As soon as some phrases catch on, they
get taken. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld may have put Yadda Yadda Yadda
into the vernacular, but Custom Tees Inc., a Connecticut sportswear
company, registered it for clothing and shoes.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication that Seinfeld objects. Comedian Johnny
Carson, however, fought back. It took him 10 years, but a federal
appeals court ruled in 1987 that Here's Johnny Portable Toilets
Inc. had violated the star's ``right of publicity'' and owed him
$31,661.96. During the legal proceedings, Carson trademarked
``Heeere's Johnny.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record (16 trademarks), newspapers, magazines and news
shows have long since protected their features. The ``60 Minutes''
ticking stopwatch is a trademark, as is the slogan of The New York
Times, ``All the News That's Fit to Print,'' and the names of some
of its sections like ``Circuits'' and ``House and Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities like Oprah and Madonna have also registered their
names. Elvis Presley Enterprises, Inc. holds dozens of trademarks.
Still, Diagnostic Hybrids Inc. of Ohio somehow slipped through and
got Elvis for use on, of all things, ``diagnostic preparations for
clinical and medical use.''
</P>
<P>
   The roar of the MGM lion has been trademarked. Even skylines. In
New York, the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building and
Rockefeller Center have all staked claims to their images.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing seems to be sacred. Nearly 500 trademarks on Christmas
(from Papa Noel's Cajun Christmas Cap to Special Christmas Brew
Beer) have been issued or are pending. Nothing seems to be profane.
Six trademark applications have recently been filed for barnyard
words that are unprintable in this newspaper. In the world of
trademarks, there is little shame (only seven trademarks contain
the word shame) and much integrity (the word is part of 279
trademarks).
</P>
<P>
   Mary Donovan, a partner in the law firm of Donovan &AMP; Yee, said,
``Everybody has realized that there is money to be made. While I am
all for protection of one's intellectual proprietary rights, I
think there needs to be some balance so that freedom of expression
isn't squashed.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the balance that U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard
Gesell tried to strike in 1985, when he rejected Lucasfilm Ltd.'s
claim that political commercials sparring over President Ronald
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative would dilute the company's
trademark if allowed to call SDI ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These laws do not reach into the realm of public discourse to
regulate the use of terms used outside the context of trade,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At least, not most places. Maybe only in New York.

ONE ANGRY MAN: WHAT'S THE VERDICT WHEN THE MAYOR IS ALSO JURY
FOREMAN? 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Mayor Rudolph Giuliani swore to serve as jury
foreman in a Manhattan personal injury case last week, he set off
down a path many citizens but few famous folk have trod.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a settlement, Giuliani will spend Tuesday listening to a
final day of tedious, at times tortuous testimony in an intensely
personal personal injury case _ a man's claim that water in a
shower scalded his genitals so badly he has been unable to have sex
with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The six-person jury will then, under the guidance of their
hard-charging foreman, decide whether Oliver Johnson's request for
$7 million in punitive damages from his landlord is justified. If
the jurors rule that it is, they must put a dollar figure on the
pain (and deprivation) Johnson and his wife, Larene, have suffered.
</P>
<P>
   That Giuliani was called is far from noteworthy. Since loopholes
allowing doctors, lawyers and a dozen other professions to avoid
jury duty were eliminated in New York in 1996, an increasing number
of politicians, judges and celebrities have been called. The trend
is occurring elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, Harvey Keitel, Robert DeNiro, Marisa
Tomei and Bernadette Peters, among others, were all called. Gov.
George Pataki was also called, and the state's chief judge, Judith
Kaye, has been called twice.
</P>
<P>
   But of that group, only Keitel and Giuliani were actually
chosen. (The mayor is not alone; other lawyers are empaneled with
him.) Though no definitive studies have been done, legal experts
say the mayor's pioneering service will provide anecdotal evidence
to a continuing debate about the wisdom of choosing politicians,
celebrities and particularly lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Trial lawyers have long shied away from choosing celebrities,
politicians, judges or lawyers as jurors lest they unduly influence
the others. A study conducted for the state court system last year
found that 61 percent of lawyers believed their colleagues would
have an undue influence. But in other studies non-lawyers said they
give lawyers no more credence during deliberations than other
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Sonya Hamlin, a Manhattan jury consultant, predicted that
Giuliani will have tremendous authority as foreman. ``They could
turn to the mayor,'' she said, ``and ask, `What would be the impact
on the city?'''
</P>
<P>
   But others downplayed the mayor's impact. Vincent Homenick,
chief clerk of the Manhattan Jury Division, said anecdotally that
the judges and lawyers who served have not have enormous sway over
their peers. ``They're New Yorkers,'' he said, referring to other
jurors. ``It takes a lot for them to be overwhelmed by anything.''
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer, though, did go too far. A Manhattan judge ruled in
June 1998 that Ralph Gant, a lawyer serving as a juror in a civil
trial regarding control of a rent-controlled apartment, gave his
fellow jurors an incorrect legal definition during deliberations.
State Supreme Court Justice Shirley Werner Kornreich threw out the
verdict and ordered a new trial. A special committee has since
recommended that judges instruct jurors not to ask for or accept
legal definitions from lawyers serving on the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Some worry, too, that Giuliani, a likely U.S. Senate candidate,
who relishes the opportunity to express his views on civic duty and
the law among other topics, might use the case to make a political
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamlin believes politics played a role in both sides'
decision to pick the mayor as foreman. ``The plaintiff's lawyers
imagine that he feels he needs to make friends in Harlem,'' said
Ms. Hamlin. ``The people who work for the landlord think he is a
conservative and he would want to prevent lots of suits like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Ms. Hamlin is right and whether Giuliani adds to or
detracts from the process _ all will be revealed this week.

who relishes the opportunity to express his views on civic duty and
the law among other topics, might use the case to make a political
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamlin believes politics played a role in both sides'
decision to pick the mayor as foreman. ``The plaintiff's lawyers
imagine that he feels he needs to make friends in Harlem,'' said
Ms. Hamlin. ``The people who work for the landlord think he is a
conservative and he would want to prevent lots of suits like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Ms. Hamlin is right and whether Giuliani adds to or
detracts from the process _ all will be revealed this week.

CRAMPED? YOU'RE A BIT FLIGHTY

<P>
   Just about anyone who has flown in the coach section of a
commercial airplane in recent years comes away convinced that space
is getting more cramped. No one appears to doubt that airlines have
installed narrower seats and added more rows so they can wring a
few more dollars of profit out of each flight.
</P>
<P>
   But while the experience of flying, especially in economy class,
may indeed be worse than ever, the industry insists it is not
because the plane is smaller. The fact is, airplane interiors have
actually gotten slightly larger in recent years, seats in coach in
most cases are a little wider, and there may even be more leg room
than there was 10 or 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Impossible? Yet true, say the airlines, seat makers and airplane
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, what constitutes a bad flight is of intense
interest to airlines and airplane makers. Boeing Co., which
produces most of the world's passengers jets, has done extensive
research, interviewing 10,000 people about what they hate most
about flying. What Boeing found is that passengers tend to blame
leg room and seat width when they are really angry about other
things.
</P>
<P>
   According to Boeing's research, two factors above all others
determine whether a flight is enjoyable, especially when traveling
relatively short distances: One is whether the plane arrives on
time, and the other is whether or not there is a person in the
adjacent seat. If your flight is late and there's somebody in the
seat next to you impinging on your sense of personal space, you're
more likely to also complain about other things, real or imagined.
(On long-range flights, more than 5,000 miles, comfort becomes a
much greater priority.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When a short-range flight is late, people said the coffee was
cold, the meal was cold, the seats were lumpy,'' said Klaus Brauer,
the Boeing executive leading the research about passenger comfort.
``Every phenomenon you can think of gets influenced by the halo
effect of the reliability of the flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may help explain why there have been so many complaints of
late about the airlines. This year through August, delays were up
nearly 20 percent compared with the same period in 1998, according
to the Federal Aviation Administration. During the summer, when
thunderstorms and the introduction of new radar screens at some
air-traffic control centers caused further slowdowns, they rose 36
percent compared with last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Airline executives have been complaining that the long-outmoded
and mismanaged air traffic control system is seizing up under the
strain of greater traffic. Improvements are still years away.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, thanks to a strong economy and powerful
computers that allow airlines to precisely gauge ticket demand,
more seats than ever are being filled on any given flight. In 1988,
the average jet took off with 62.5 percent of its seats occupied.
By the end of last year, the average had jumped to 71 percent,
according to the Air Transport Association in Washington. In
practice, that means most flights during peak hours are more than
90 percent full.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the traffic on the way to the airport, the long walk
to the gate, the fight to board the plane, the dearth of palatable
food during the flight, and you get some pretty unhappy
associations with flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airplane used to be the respite from a lot of these
things,'' said David Stempler, president of the Air Travelers
Association, an advocacy group. ``There were plenty of flights
where you could find extra room to spread out. Now, that extra room
isn't there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, improvements in technology have increased the range
of smaller planes. The Boeing 737 used to be able to fly only as
far as Denver from New York. But the newly redesigned models can
now make it from New York to Seattle, a six-hour trip during which
comfort, rather than on-time performance, becomes a greater
priority as the minutes tick by.
</P>
<P>
   But the dimensions of the seats themselves have not shrunk. The
width of a coach seat on Boeing's single-aisle 737 and 757, which
have the same fuselage, was about 17 inches until about 10 years
ago, when it was expanded to 17.2 inches, Boeing said.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus Industrie of Europe, now Boeing's only rival, likes to
brag that the fuselage of its single-aisle A-320 jets is 7 inches
wider than the 737. But most airlines still use seats of the same
dimensions, using the extra space for a wider aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Because comfort is more important on long flights, economy seats
on wide-body airplanes are slightly larger: 18 inches on a 767 and
18.5 inches on a 777. And of course, the more you pay for a seat
the more space you get. Business-class seats are now usually 20 or
21 inches wide; first-class seats in large planes are 22 or 23
inches across.
</P>
<P>
   And while it is true that in the last 15 years many airlines
have reduced the so-called seat pitch, or the distance between your
seat and the seat in front of you, the actual amount of leg room
has not diminished, said Brauer, the creature comfort expert at
Boeing. He said the older seat backs were about 4.5 half inches
thicker than today's, so even though seat pitch has declined by
about 3 inches, there's a little more leg room.
</P>
<P>
   But even if it is true that the airplanes have not shrunk, are
not passengers getting larger? Most studies do show that Americans
in all age categories have gotten heavier. But Brauer said the
scientific literature suggests that people have not grown as much
as the media suggest. In any case, he added, the expansion in the
width of seats on narrow-body planes by 0.2 of an inch and by 1.5
inches on the newest wide-bodies ``is far in excess of the
percentage growth of the species over the period.''
</P>
<P>
   Brauer also said people tend to judge the size of an interior
space at eye level. As a result, about 12 years ago, Boeing widened
the 737 cabin by 1 inch on each side. On its newer planes it molds
ceiling panels and positions lights to make it appear that the
cabin is larger than it really is.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines are also doing their part to try to make their
airplanes more comfortable. Together the nation's two largest
carriers _ United Airlines and American Airlines _ plan to spend
$900 million to outfit their fleets with new interiors over the
next few years. Many of the new coach seats will be equipped with
the amenities now found in business class, like foot rests,
adjustable lumbar supports and adjustable head rests.
</P>
<P>
   But they won't be any wider. Brauer, who likes to carry around a
tape measure, pointed out that even though most office chairs and
train and theater seats are no wider than 17 inches, they do not
seem to inspire the same amount of collective resentment as
airplane seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Seattle Opera House has 17.2-inch seats,'' he said, ``and
we sit there for years and years.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The much-acclaimed economic expansion, now in its ninth year,
has blessed Americans with a cornucopia of good things _ rising
incomes, the lowest jobless rate in three decades and stock prices
going through the roof. Many Americans have used the good times to
renovate their kitchens or take that trip to Tuscany, but others
are still finding the boom a lot less satisfying than might be
expected.
</P>
<P>
   For many Americans this Labor Day, the sentiment seems to be,
we're earning more, but enjoying it less.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple: too much work. With the economy going like
gangbusters and with a labor shortage in much of the country, many
Americans are reluctantly clocking 60-hour weeks to do the
mountains of work that need to be done _ designing that Web page,
getting out that legal brief, finishing those architectural
renderings. For many Americans, the 40-hour week has become a fond
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Juliet Schor, the Harvard professor who wrote the 1992 book
``The Overworked American'' (Basic Books), said in an interview
that if she were to write a sequel it might be called ``The Even
More Overworked American.'' Indeed, a new study by the
International Labor Organization found that the number of hours
Americans work each year has climbed skyward while working hours in
most other industrial countries are falling.
</P>
<P>
   This trend has given Americans the dubious distinction of moving
into first place in the number of hours worked each year (1,966),
surpassing even the Japanese by about 70 hours. On average,
Americans work 350 hours more per year (that's almost nine full
work weeks) than Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things going on,'' said Schor. ``Americans
are working harder, which is common when the economy is doing well.
And a lot of today's jobs require longer hours: management jobs,
professionals working long hours at firms because that's what it
takes to succeed in these firms. Some people are working harder
because there's a lot of money to be made at the moment. But for a
lot of people, excessive working time is a major problem.''
</P>
<P>
   This explosion in hours worked has some little-understood pros
and some well-known cons. On the positive side, it has helped keep
the United States at the head of the pack in productivity.
America's economy produces more value per worker per year than any
other nation's, enabling the United States to enjoy living
standards that make most of the world envious.
</P>
<P>
   In a subtle way, the boom in working hours has also helped keep
inflation down. Millions of salaried Americans _ software
designers, lawyers, factory managers _ are clocking 50- , 60- and
70-hour work weeks even though on paper they officially work just
40 hours. These workers often do not put in for overtime pay, and
the result is that they are making a quiet, below-the-radar
contribution to the economy. If a Web site designer puts in a
70-hour week, but is officially working only 40 hours, that helps
raise the important gauge of productivity per hour. This,
economists say, has contributed to the recent rise in the nation's
productivity rate, up 2 percent last year from a sluggish 1 percent
per year over the previous two decades. This boost, also fueled by
heavy corporate investment in computers, has enabled American
industry to keep profits high without having to resort to raising
prices.
</P>
<P>
   But talk to a few workers who just punched out after a 12-hour
day, and they'll tell you that 60-hour weeks have their downside as
well. Auto workers, telephone workers and others are howling about
too much overtime, with many workers being forced to put in 15 or
20 extra hours a week. In recent months, many labor negotiations
have grown heated over union demands to eliminate mandatory
overtime _ something many corporations are loath to do when the 4.2
percent jobless rate makes it hard to find new workers.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder that recent surveys show many Americans
complaining that they do not have enough time to spend with their
families. Schor expressed surprise that in a recent poll more than
20 percent of Americans said they would happily accept lower
incomes in exchange for working fewer hours. Even as many
stressed-out workers are deliberately reducing their hours, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics has found that 19 percent of Americans
report working more than 49 hours a week, up from 16 percent in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very significant group, roughly a third of the labor force,
is working more hours than they want,'' said Schor. ``They are
feeling high levels of time pressure and stress. They feel their
job interferes with their family life.'' She said stress is being
experienced in particular by baby boom workers.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the biggest reason for workers feeling overextended,
economists say, is that in many families the parents, taken
together, are working longer hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, has
found that together, parents in middle-class families work 3,335
hours per year on average, up from 3,200 a decade ago and just over
3,000 hours two decades ago. That's an increase of eight weeks of
work per year since 1979. The main reason for the surge, economists
say, is not so much that men are working longer hours, but that
women are _ in large part to keep family incomes climbing while
hourly wages, after accounting for inflation, have largely
stagnated for the past 25 years. Millions of women who used to work
part time have moved into full-time jobs.

job interferes with their family life.'' She said stress is being
experienced in particular by baby boom workers.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the biggest reason for workers feeling overextended,
economists say, is that in many families the parents, taken
together, are working longer hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, has
found that together, parents in middle-class families work 3,335
hours per year on average, up from 3,200 a decade ago and just over
3,000 hours two decades ago. That's an increase of eight weeks of
work per year since 1979. The main reason for the surge, economists
say, is not so much that men are working longer hours, but that
women are _ in large part to keep family incomes climbing while
hourly wages, after accounting for inflation, have largely
stagnated for the past 25 years. Millions of women who used to work
part time have moved into full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the economic gains in the current economic recovery
comes from people working more hours, rather than higher hourly
wages,'' said Lawrence Mishel, vice president of the Economic
Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The overtime boom has created another source of tensions. Many
corporate executives are unhappy about dishing out millions of
dollars each week in time-and-a-half pay for overtime. As a result
many companies are doing an end run around overtime laws by, for
example, hiring thousands of workers as independent contractors who
do not have to be paid time-and-a-half for every hour they work
over 40.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists and economists see several factors behind the
longer work week. The economy is shifting from manufacturing to
services, and service workers do not watch the clock the way that
manufacturing workers do. Many companies, notably software makers,
now emphasize ``project'' work. Corporate culture demands
completing projects by a deadline, often requiring workers to put
in 90-hour weeks to finish, say, the latest CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists question whether Americans are working more
hours per week, saying the statistics rely too much on workers' own
accounts. Many economists also say it has grown harder to measure
how many hours people work because of the explosion of beepers and
cell phones as well as computers and faxes at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, you go to a social gathering and you see a lot of
people wearing beepers, and at a baseball game you see all these
people with their cell phones, in many cases still connected to
work,'' said Alan Krueger, a Princeton University labor economist.
``It's gotten far more difficult to measure where work ends and
leisure begins.''

THE HIDDEN TRAPS IN FOOLING MOTHER NATURE

   Now that researchers have shown that mice can be made smarter, a
whole world of opportunities opens up. Those long-neglected
inventors of smarter mousetraps will at last get their calls
returned. Smarter cats will be needed. And everyone will have a
list of humans who might benefit, starting perhaps with the
baseball umpires or, in the case of most evolutionists, with the
Kansas Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant as it may be to contemplate a smarter world, there are
serious quandaries in enhancing human abilities, as well as in
trying to raise the intelligence of animals, possibilities raised
last week by Princeton biologist Joe Tsien and his colleagues when
they announced they had developed a genetically smarter strain of
mice.
</P>
<P>
   In mice, monkeys and probably humans, nature has engineered a
deliberate fading of memory with age. The brain cell receptor that
helps associate two events _ the basic mechanism of memory _ is
made of components that change over a life span, making the
receptor less efficient in older animals. It is this process that
was counteracted in Tsien's mice. He genetically engineered the
mice so that their brain cells produced more copies of the youthful
component of the memory receptor, thus enhancing its performance.
</P>
<P>
   The receptor was souped up in brain cells throughout the mice's
forebrain and hippocampus, a brain module that helps mice remember
places (and humans to recall places and faces). The altered mice
did better than normal mice on six standard tests of rodent
intellectual performance, like remembering where to find a hidden
platform when dropped into a bucket of murky water, or recognizing
new objects. Because the improvement was consistent in all the
tests, for which the mice had to use many different areas of the
brain, Tsien concluded that in improving the basic mechanism of
memory he had also enhanced the mice's learning ability and general
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Tsien and other scientists are far from sure that tweaking the
memory receptor would be similarly helpful in the more complicated
human brain. After all, with too retentive a memory you might
clutter up your mind with all kinds of things you'd be better off
forgetting. Still, scientists agree that the receptor is a
promising place for intelligence enhancement to start.
</P>
<P>
   But would the improvement of human acumen dangerously flout
nature's wisdom? After all, intelligence is so precious for
survival that surely nature makes every animal as smart as possible
without transgressing some pivotal balance.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't seem to be the case, however, at least with
laboratory mice. Tsien's strains are smarter than their normal
cousins, without any visible drawback. And behaviorally, modern man
is so new a species _ 50,000 years is the blink of an eye in
evolutionary time _ that perhaps the forces of natural selection
have scarcely had the chance to make the most of the human brain's
capacities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, genetic engineers must surely pause at the fact that
nature has designed memory to become less retentive with age. The
danger of tampering with this system is that the brain's memory
storage room could quickly be overwhelmed if learning were to
continue at the same rate in adult life as in youth, suggests Dr.
Charles Stevens, a neurobiologist at the Salk Institute in La
Jolla, Calif. He believes the brain's capacity, vast as it is, must
have limits. The human brain has 100 billion neurons, and each
neuron makes about 1,000 connections with other neurons, giving a
potential 100 trillion units of memory. ``So there is enormous
storage capacity, but we don't know how much we need,'' Stevens
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the limit of that storage capacity is never reached in a
human lifetime, the increasing access time needed to scan a growing
store of knowledge may be one reason why nature arranges for
information to be acquired more slowly once the youthful thirst for
knowledge has passed. What a powerful threat to deploy against
one's children _ learn it or lose it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the risk of running out of space on one's mental hard
drive, the temptation to try to enhance intelligence by promoting
the youthful form of the memory receptor will doubtless prove
irresistible. Drugs might be developed to target the nerve cell
system that Tsien altered by genetic means. Gene therapy could one
day supply smart genes to an embryo _ or even to adults, since the
hippocampus is one of the few areas of the brain that generates new
cells throughout adult life.
</P>
<P>
   Three categories of people might benefit: the medically ill, the
elderly and everybody else. Ethicists see no problem in trying to
treat memory deficits in patients with brain diseases, which would
be no different from any other medical intervention. Helping older
people remember better is also likely to be uncontroversial,
``because in our culture we see old age as something like a disease
rather than as natural life process,'' said Dr. Victoria Sharpe, a
bioethicist at the Hastings Center in Garrison, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A drug to enhance the intelligence of healthy individuals sounds
great for job interviews or quiz programs. But if the smart pill
were costly, it could worsen social inequities. And such a drug
could easily be abused by parents. ``I think we will have to think
through our social policies very carefully so we don't get into an
enhancement race among parents and don't in effect develop a new
kind of child abuse,'' said Dr. Leroy Walters, director of the
Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University.

application of genetic techniques'' to raise the intelligence of a
child with very low IQ scores, because that could be regarded as
remedial, but enhancing the IQ of someone at or above the mean
would be much more controversial, in his view.
</P>
<P>
   The ethical implications extend beyond humans. Well before
anyone tries to increase human intelligence, the technique will be
tested in monkeys or chimpanzees. A smarter chimp might help answer
the enduring question of whether animals are conscious or whether
consciousness is only attained by brains with the capacity for
language. But how much smarter can chimpanzees get before they
merit, or even demand, special rights?
</P>
<P>
   ``Say we produce a chimp that is more intelligent than people,''
said Sharpe. ``I think we would probably just try to enslave it
rather than welcome it into the human community. It may be a
cynical view but I don't think we are very good at according moral
status to nonhumans.''
</P>
<P>
   Pioneers like Tsien are eager to explore the new possibilities
created by genetic engineering. Nature may be wise, but it often
doesn't act in the individual's best interest, he notes. The body's
cells don't have to rust and wear out like cars: they could renew
themselves indefinitely. Since nature lets us die, Tsien believes,
it may also have neglected to make humans as smart as they can be .
</P>
<P>
   He finds it hard to understand the recent flurry of apprehension
about human cloning, because a clone, being an exact genetic copy,
adds nothing new to the world. But making an individual more
intelligent would be novel and interesting. ``Everyone wants to be
smart,'' he said.

ARMS CONTROL IS DYING. UNLESS IT'S REVIVING. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By many measures, international arms control seems
to be on the verge of unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   A global treaty banning all nuclear testing is bottled up in the
U.S. Senate. Another pact to reduce the atomic arsenals of Russia
and the United States is stalled in the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, Iran and North Korea are racing to build new biological,
chemical, nuclear weapons or long-range missiles, U.S. intelligence
analysts say. Finally worn down by Iraqi noncooperation, the United
Nations has dismantled its efforts even to monitor Iraq's
terror-weapons programs. And India and Pakistan are menacing each
other with nuclear-tipped missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're heading downhill,'' said Michael Krepon, president of
the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington, a group that researches
arms control and international security. ``All of the major fault
lines of nuclear danger are growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Why then are many arms control advocates echoing the bullish
declaration of Adm. Stansfield Turner, a past director of Central
Intelligence: ``This is the most opportune moment in the past 40
years for nuclear arms control''?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is simple: Russia, which is still the only country
that can claim parity with America's own nuclear arsenal, has
serious reasons for wanting to cut back its stock of warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's strategic forces are declining fast and Moscow lacks
the money to pay for new systems. It badly wants a new strategic
arms reduction agreement, Start 3, that could take both countries
down to 1,500 long-range nuclear warheads from more than 6,000
currently; from the Russian point of view, that would at least
allow Russia to keep even with the United States despite all its
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of such a deal argue that it would have advantages
for the United States as well: It would shrink the nuclear
stockpile of the country that still harbors the single biggest
threat to U.S. security, and from which U.S. security officials
fear that terrorists may even now be shopping for nuclear material.
</P>
<P>
   And with instability engulfing Russia, including growing public
cynicism toward the government, rising corruption with allegations
of Russian laundering of billions of dollars through the Bank of
New York and the economy shakier than ever, time may be running
short to strike a bold new arms deal before both countries hold
presidential elections next year, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a way to secure extremely deep cuts, and make them
verifiable and irreversible,'' said Krepon. ``In return for doing
Russia that favor, which is a favor to ourselves, we can get a
number of things we want.''
</P>
<P>
   But the administration is proceeding gingerly, still insisting
that Russia's communist-dominated parliament first ratify the Start
2 treaty, which brings both nations' strategic forces to 3,000 to
3,500 warheads, before seriously negotiating any follow-up pact to
further reduce the weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the Cold War is over, the logic of nuclear arms
control has detractors. The Pentagon and many conservatives fear
that dipping much lower than 3,000 warheads would jeopardize the
U.S. nuclear advantage over the rest of the world, and encourage
other countries to seek the status of first-tier atomic powers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Washington's insistence that the Russian parliament
act on Start 2 may have backfired, angering many Russian lawmakers
who complain of U.S. coercion. ``They are trying to portray us as a
country unwilling to divest itself of nuclear arms, a kind of
nuclear monster that does not want to disarm,'' Roman Popkovich,
chairman of the defense committee of Russia's lower house of
parliament, said in August.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another hurdle is the strained relationship between Moscow
and Washington, frayed most recently by the air war in Kosovo.
``Things are at such a low level of credibility with Russia right
now,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. ``A lot of work has to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the
administration's top Russia expert, plans to fly to Moscow this
week to try to smooth out differences in advance of a more
important meeting in Washington on Sept. 17 with Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Georgi Mamedev.
</P>
<P>
   Against long odds, Talbott is trying to broker a deal to modify
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to allow the United States
to build a limited national defense against long-range missile
attacks _ in exchange, perhaps, for a Start 3 agreement. Russia has
long opposed such a shield, fearing it could lead to a broader
``Star Wars'' space-based defensive system.
</P>
<P>
   But missile defenses are a top foreign-policy priority of Senate
Republicans like Jesse Helms of North Carolina, whose Foreign
Relations Committee is likely to hold the nuclear-test ban treaty
hostage until President Clinton submits two other treaties that
Helms wants to kill, including amendments to the ABM Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's deliberate approach illustrates a shift in
the politics of arms control, which became the lifeblood of U.S.
foreign policy during the last half of the Cold War, arms control
advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a few years ago that Clinton presided over the
extension of a treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and
signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Those accomplishments
capped an astonishing 10-year period for U.S. arms control policy
that included landmark strategic arms reductions treaties
negotiated by President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, arms control advocates say, has lost the momentum
created in during his first term. Gone is the initiative of
president's first four years, they say, replaced by drift and a
reluctance to challenge Senate conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very timid approach and time is running out,'' said
Spurgeon Keeny, president of the Arms Control Association, a
research and advocacy group. ``They've had a failed policy in
dealing effectively with the Senate, because of a feeling that a
confrontation on this would hurt the rest of their domestic
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   If the administration is to pull off one more arms control
victory in its waning months, it can expect little or no help from
Senate Republicans, who are moving away from the arms control
legacy of the Bush and Reagan administrations, to push for national
missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to unnecessarily antagonize the Russians, but
they are not the Soviet Union,'' said Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., a
member of the Foreign Relations Committee. ``They're not the threat
they once were. The threat is more dispersed now.''

   1. WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT MAO? On October 1, China will mark 50
years since Mao proclaimed the People's Republic before cheering
throngs in Tiananmen Square. In the best Communist fashion,
betraying a mix of pride and insecurity, China is giving Beijing a
virtual makeover in preparation. The big day will feature a
minutely orchestrated parade of 140,000 -- everything from Young
Pioneers in red bandannas to China's latest ballistic missiles. The
marchers will pass under the giant painting of Mao that perennially
hangs over Tiananmen, facing toward the mausoleum where the Great
Helmsman's embalmed body is displayed. But an unflinching look at
the half century of Communist Party rule is the last thing today's
leaders want. By Erik Eckholm. From The New York Times Magazine.
1,800 words.
_________________________________________________________________
2. THE SINGER SOLUTION TO WORLD POVERTY Do you like foie gras? Own
a Bugatti? Plan to buy a new TV set even though your old one still
works? Then, according to this controversial Australian ethicist,
you are helping to starve the world's children. By Peter Singer.
From The New York Times Magazine. 2,500 words.
_________________________________________________________________
3. BEWITCHED, BOTHERED AND BEWILDERED The U.N. Security Council has
suffered a disastrous year : ignored by NATO, defied by Iraq, and
hamstrung by great power vetoes. Here's how to fix it. By Richard
Butler. From Foreign Affairs magazine. 1,500 words.
_________________________________________________________________
4. FROM MEDICAL TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE :
</P>
<P>
   (a) CHALLENGING WOMEN TO WALK FOR HEALTHIER HEARTS Women do not
need to jog, much less run marathons, to reduce their chances of
heart disease. A new survey of more than 72,000 women shows that
those who either walked briskly for a minimum of three hours a
week, or who exercised vigorously at least 90 minutes a week, had a
30 to 40 per cent reduction in their risk of heart disease. By
Alisha Berger. 525 words.
</P>
<P>
   (b) IN PURSUIT OF AUTOIMMUNE WORM CURE There is a downside to
modern hygiene : children in relatively wormfree industrialized
countries have a much greater tendency to grow up into adults with
autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,
lupus and inflammatory bowel disease than their Third World
counterparts, whose immune systems are constantly exposed to
potential pathogens. By Andy Newman. 1,100 words.
_________________________________________________________________
5. GENETICALLY ALTERED FOOD WON'T CONQUER HUNGER Peter Rosset,
director of the Institute for Food and Development Policy and
co-author of ``World Hunger : Twelve Myths,'' argues that
genetically altered foods are not essential, despite our efforts to
feed the world. New York Times Op-Ed. 800 words.
_________________________________________________________________
6. FROM PROSPECT MAGAZINE (N/A U.K.)
</P>
<P>
   (a) INFERTILITY AND THE NEW BABIES New reproductive technology
is offering childless couples an alternative to adoption. But what
are the consequences for children who are not genetically related
to both their parents? By Katharine Quarmby. 1,800 words.
</P>
<P>
   (b) THE BRAND IS IT John Kay looks at why modern advertisements
contain no information. 800 words.
_________________________________________________________________
7. FROM NEW SCIENTIST MAGAZINE (N/A Australia, Brazil, New Zealand)
</P>
<P>
   (a) ALL IN THE MIND Is it ethical for surgeons to cut patients
open and sew them up without doing anything? By Philip Cohen. 1,000
words. (b) FLIGHT INTO DANGER So you think a jet plane is the
safest way to get where you want to go? That isn't necessarily
true. The fact that air travel is growing while the accident rate
is stable means that a decade from now, twice as many people could
be killed in air crashes. By Andrew Weir. 1,000 words. (c) SEASON
TO TASTE Campaigners hope that compulsory labelling will curb
Europe's unhealthy lust for salt. By Debora MacKenzie. 1,000 words.
(d) SOLITARY KILLERS Up to five metres high, they can strike when
the water is perfectly calm. Freak waves are threatening Europe's
coastline and our demand for high-speed ferries could be to blame.
By Mick Hamer. 1,500 words. (e) WINGING IT What if birds evolved
feathery forearms not for soaring through the air but for pouncing
on prey from a great height? A new theory flies in the face of
convention. By Graham Taylor. 1,500 words.

</P>
<P>
   As a national credo, displayed on banners and placards, it
sounds simple enough.
</P>
<P>
   But in this scattered archipelago of 13,000 islands, roiling
with an untamed mix of cultures, ethnic groups, histories,
rivalries, gods and spoken tongues, it begins to seem almost
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   These days, some people say it is.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation with well
over 200 million people, is deep in a crisis of economics, politics
and national identity. Its leaders and institutions have lost much
of their popular standing and legitimacy. The forces that most
overtly held Indonesia together _ the grip of a dictator and the
harshness of his military _ have retreated since the forced
resignation 15 months ago of Suharto as president.
</P>
<P>
   A country so unsure of its unity that it has made oneness an
obsession is being forced to rediscover the logic of its
nationhood. The challenge as it steps gingerly into an era of
democracy is to want to be a nation.
</P>
<P>
   The violence that ravaged the former Portuguese colony of East
Timor last week as it was voting for independence from Indonesia
came as a reminder to the outside world of the diversity and
tenuousness of this scattered nation. Perhaps the fears it has
aroused _ of centrifugal forces that could pull Indonesia apart _
are exaggerated. Still, it points up the counterproductiveness of
enforced union.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to have an Indonesia in which the constituent
parts sit happily together as a republic and not because they are
held together by bayonets, you are going to have to have a system
where the constituent parts come together because they want to be
together,'' said James Dunn, a former Australian diplomat who is an
expert on Indonesia. ``Since the founding of Indonesia, the
military has seen itself as the guardian of national integrity. In
a democracy national integrity has to be held together by the
national will.''
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of this, the post-Suharto government _ which is
still taking shape _ is exploring ways to devolve some economic and
political control to the provinces. An extreme possibility, one
that would demand a constitutional amendment, would be to shift
power into a federal structure.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian rule has sometimes been likened to a colonial
structure, with the dominant Javanese on their relatively small
island asserting their rule over the larger and more resource-rich
outer islands. A fairer distribution of the national wealth along
with greater political empowerment could go a long way toward
mollifying Indonesia's restive provinces.
</P>
<P>
   But the loosening of a grip always carries the risk of loss of
control. After 32 years of Suharto's policy of enforced national
harmony, the vacuum created by his departure and the humbling of
the military has been quickly filled by all the repressed passions
of political, religious and ethnic differences that strain
Indonesia's fabric.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, separatist movements have been energized in
several areas, highlighted by East Timor, which Indonesia invaded
in 1975 but which never accepted integration as the country's 27th
province.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta _ and particularly in
the military _ fear that freedom for East Timor could be the start
of a process of national disintegration. Other analysts point to
that territory's unique place as a national afterthought and argue
that a line can be drawn between East Timor and the rest of
Indonesia. It is the only part of the country to have been
colonized by the Portuguese rather than by the Dutch and it is the
only part to have been been dragged into union by invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The most potentially destabilizing separatist movement is in the
strongly Islamic, natural gas-rich province of Aceh, where the loss
of life this year has been far greater than in East Timor. A former
Islamic kingdom with its own proud past, Aceh is an integral part
of Indonesia's history and self-definition and its loss could deal
a severe blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very worried,'' a senior Western diplomat said. ``If
Aceh begins to take off, they will really have problems with the
integrity of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   A smaller, less unified separatist movement has flared in the
remote mountains of Irian Jaya, whose primitive people are as
strange and exotic to residents of modern Jakarta as they are to
New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Vicious bloodletting has also continued in the Moluccas (the
former Spice Islands that first attracted traders to the
archipelago) and in West Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. But
these eruptions, for the moment at least, have more to do with
local feuds, and with Jakarta's inability to impose order, than
with serious separatist threats.
</P>
<P>
   Though they may not pull the nation apart, the declarations of
individuality by the separatists offer a reminder that Indonesia is
an artificial geographical conglomeration inherited from its Dutch
colonizers.
</P>
<P>
   The elegant, taciturn princes of Java seem to have little in
common with the otherworldly dancers of Hindu Bali, the long-eared
Dayak tribesmen of Borneo, the seagoing pirates of the Spice
Islands or the Chinese traders who control the country's ports and
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   What brings them all together as Indonesians?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is an idea, as in other big, diverse countries like
India and the United States,'' said James Clad, a professor of
Southeast Asian studies at Georgetown University. ``It is an idea
of an archipelagic country, a concept that goes back to pre-Islamic
times.''

   The idea of Indonesia as a union of islands took firm root
during the struggle for independence _ which was proclaimed in 1945
_ and flourished under the founding president, Sukarno. His

differences were crushed whenever they asserted themselves too
strongly.

   This fear of the power of diversity may have been one of
Suharto's most destructive legacies. Its melange of identities

the revolutionary 1928 student oath, a sort of Pledge of Allegiance

   When Snoopy isn't out stalking the Red Baron, he can usually be
found atop his doghouse tapping out a novel that invariably begins,
``It was a dark and stormy night.'' What most people don't realize
is that those words are actually the first sentence of the 1830
novel ``Paul Clifford'' by the eminent Victorian Sir Edward
Bulwer-Lytton. Since 1982, Sir Edward has achieved eponymous infamy
as the patron saint of the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, an annual
competition held by the English department of San Jose State
University. The challenge is simple: ``to compose the opening
sentence to the worst of all possible novels.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulwer-Lytton contest, open to anyone, now attracts
thousands of entries from around the world, competing not only for
the top prize _ $250, a ``pittance,'' the sponsors acknowledge _
but for dubious honors in such genres as romance and fantasy. Here
is a selection from this year's winners and also-rans, announced
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   _ By THOMAS VINCIGUERRA
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Overall
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the gathering gloom of a late-October afternoon, along
the greasy, cracked paving-stones slick from the sputum of the sky,
Stanley Ruddlethorp wearily trudged up the hill from the cemetery
where his wife, sister, brother, and three children were all
buried, and forced open the door of his decaying house, blissfully
unaware of the catastrophe that was soon to devastate his life.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Dr. David Chuter, Kingston, Surrey, England
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Romance
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil made their skin glisten as their bodies moved in slow
synchronous rhythm on the beach, the water gently flowing up around
their legs, birds floating in the surf accompanying their moans
with songs of pain and despair, otter and seal carcasses washing
ashore around them, and it frightened her and exhilarated her at
the same time that their love under the open sky might be
discovered by a Sierra Club cleanup volunteer.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Robert Chappell, Blanchardville, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Science Fiction
</P>
<P>
   ``The remaining astronauts strung out on the long tether could
only wonder at a universe full of eerie contrasts _ brilliant stars
against the velvety blackness of space, the hot flare of their
comrade's meteoric plunge into the atmosphere against the cool-blue
ocean below, the man's frenzied screams on the radio as he was
roasted by the heat of re-entry against the icy calm voice of
mission control as they grilled the astronaut on the far end of the
tether, and how hilarious it had all seemed when he first yelled
``Crack the whip!'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Roger Strong, Winnipeg, Manitoba
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Purple Prose
</P>
<P>
   ``Rain _ violent torrents of it, rain like fetid water from a
God-sized pot of pasta strained through a sky-wide colander, rain
as Noah knew it, flaying the shuddering trees, whipping the
whitecapped waters, violating the sodden firmament, purging purity
and filth alike from the land, rain without mercy, without
surcease, incontinent rain, turning to intermittent showers
overnight with partial clearing Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   _ David Hirsch, Seattle
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Adventure
</P>
<P>
   ``The woods held danger at every dark, haunting corner, and
Indiana Jones decided it was too risky to continue; he had already
been attacked by a mound of fire ants, had a brush with poison ivy,
and faced a terrifying encounter with the Forest Ranger's vicious
beagle, Muffin.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Christine Sullivan, Melbourne, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Vile Puns
</P>
<P>
   ``Forced by rising costs and lagging demand to make their
leading product out of a cheaper metal, Hoosier Love, Inc. found
that a special treatment process was needed to clean and coat their
Indy 500 memento, a tiny fake-jewel-studded replica of an
Offenhauser engine on a jeweler's chain, to protect it from the
corrosive effect of chlorine, a process that appeared in the ISO
9000 Manufacturer's Manual under the title, ``The Dechloration of
Indy Pendants.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Tom Rohde, Minneapolis
</P>
<P>
   Winner: `Dark and Stormy' Division
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Independent Counsel emerged each night from the
adjourned closed-door proceedings, reporters assessed how zealously
he was currently prosecuting from his facial expression, which on
one night might be that familiar affably light smile, while on
another night it could be a menacingly dark scowl; and so, as our
story begins, they surmised he was playing hardball, for it was a
dark-Ken Starr-mien night.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ronald Snow, Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The Also-Rans
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up in the overall category:
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the regal bearing of a TV weatherman, his hair
twinkling like the crystals in Ivana Trump's chandelier, his teeth
white and snappy like high-starch boxers, his jaw strong and sharp
as a Canadian high-pressure system, and an El Nino just itching to
wreak havoc in her trailer park.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Elayne Roman, West Caldwell, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dishonorable mention'' (third place) in the romance category:
</P>
<P>
   ``Maggie had become so very attached to Butch these last few
years, not so much like a remora on the side of a shark, nor even
handcuffs in the night, but almost, but not quite, like an
inoperable, yet benign, tumor, crenulating and bifurcating in the
love-struck center of his brain.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Vance Atkins, Seattle
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up in the ``dark and stormy night'' category:
</P>
<P>
   ```Just look, ya bloomin' idiot,'' Eleanor
Rugglesby-Bobsyeruncle, the world-famous cockney art collector,
screamed at her assistant, Ivan Ivanovich, illegitimate son of the
Secret Czar, Ivanovichi, ``ya packed me priceless Don Quixote
paintin' in with a sack of bloody Spam, it was the darn cans tore
me knight!'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Allan D. Burrows, Mississauga, Ontario
</P>
<P>
   A miscellaneous dishonorable mention:
</P>
<P>
   ``Night was a mere threat on the quivering lip of the sky and
the golden tongue of the sun still licked the recesses of the
bridle path, when suddenly, an unnatural shriek emanated from the
dark throat of the forest, causing stiff fingers of fear to march
firmly down the spine of the motionless maiden.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Annette O'Neill, Pacifica, Calif. &QR;
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the first line from a putative novel, ``A Tale of
Two Statisticians'':
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the best of times; it wasn't the worst of times; it
was the times you'd get if you arranged all possible times
(including even fictional times in which the nights were usually
dark and stormy) in order from worst to best on the real number
line from 0.0 inclusive to 1.0 exclusive and then used a really
good uniform random number generator to pick a value in that range
thus choosing the corresponding times _ that's the times it was.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Dale Dellutri, Libertyville, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Postscript: A ``lyttony'' with more tortured constructs is
available at the Bulwer-Lytton Web site, www.bulwer-lytton.com.
Penguin has also published five collections of dross from the
competition, including ``Bride of It Was a Dark and Stormy Night.''

DIANA'S DUBIOUS LEGACY: LAND MINE BAN HAS TROUBLE GETTING OFF THE
GROUND

   WASHINGTON _ It has been two years since the death of Diana,
Princess of Wales, gave a last, emotional boost to an international
treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines, then being feverishly
negotiated in Oslo. Many say her efforts to draw attention to the
fiendish effects of mines before her death may be one of her
greatest legacies.
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of legacy is it?
</P>
<P>
   Despite a treaty signed by 135 countries to ban their use,
production and stockpiling, anti-personnel land mines appear to be
as popular as ever in fighting wars these days.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav troops planted thousands of them during 18 months of
civil war in Kosovo. So did the ethnic Albanian rebels they were
fighting. Russia has acknowledged using them in recent weeks
against Islamic insurgents in the southern province of Dagestan
(and apologized to neighboring Georgia for accidentally dropping
some of them from aircraft into Georgian territory).
</P>
<P>
   Their use has been reported in the recent flareups between India
and Pakistan and between Eritrea and Ethiopia, as well as in civil
wars in Turkey, Colombia, Congo, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey completed last April, the International Campaign to
Ban Land Mines, which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, reported that
governments or rebel groups in at least 13 countries had used mines
in the 15 months after the treaty was signed, though before it
officially went into force. Among those were three that signed the
treaty banning them: Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Angola, the country
Diana made the focus of her own anti-mine crusade.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, despite the campaign's publicity, several major
countries still refuse to adopt the treaty, including the United
States, Russia and China, most of the nations in the Middle East
and many in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little disheartening,'' said Marissa Vitagliano, the
coordinator of the U.S. Campaign to Ban Land Mines.
</P>
<P>
   She and other supporters of a ban say it is far too soon to
write off the treaty as a failure. On the contrary, they point to
progress that has been made, especially in reducing the worldwide
production of mines and their availability in the international
arms market, according to arms control monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Fowler, the deputy chief of the U.N.'s Mine Action Service
in New York, noted that the countries that have signed on to a ban
have destroyed 14 million mines that had been stockpiled when the
treaty was written two years ago. Even countries that have so far
refused to sign the treaty _ including the United States and Russia
_ have pledged to stop exporting mines and to stop making certain
kinds altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the treaty's greatest impact has been on public
perception. Reports of mines now evoke images of legless veterans,
of maimed children, of Diana in protective gear walking near a
minefield in Angola.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many, many mines were used in the Persian Gulf war, but no one
thought about it,'' Ms. Fowler said. ``Everybody is aware that
mines were used in Kosovo. The treaty is setting a new
international standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as events have shown, a standard is one thing, the
eradication of mines another.
</P>
<P>
   Mines are cheap and durable and deadly. In Yugoslavia, which has
not signed the treaty, Serbian troops heavily mined the routes
along the mountainous borders with Albania and Macedonia that the
Kosovo Liberation Army used to get in and out of the province; that
forced the guerrillas into areas that exposed them to Yugoslav
fire. Serbian police also used mines to booby-trap ransacked
Albanian homes to keep refugees from returning home. (Many returned
anyway, and died as a result.)
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for discouragement is the weakness of the treaty
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty _ the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,
Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on
Their Destruction _ went into effect March 1, 1999, six months
after the 40th nation ratified it, but it has little force.
</P>
<P>
   There is no governing organization to oversee it and no
mechanism to punish those who violate it. It essentially relies on
member states to monitor themselves and honestly report on what
stockpiles they have and the efforts they are making to destroy
them.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters hope that global peer pressure will gradually force
nations to comply. ``You don't expect everybody to stop using mines
overnight,'' said Caleb Rossiter, an analyst now conducting a study
on mine strategy in Korea for the Vietnam Veterans of America.
``Treaties like this take a long time to sink in.''
</P>
<P>
   There is universal agreement among the treaty's supporters that
the biggest obstacle to that is the fact that the United States
won't sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite once advocating a ban, President Clinton bowed to
pressure from Pentagon commanders opposed to the treaty's
restrictions. They insist they need the most common type of land
mines _ those left buried in the ground _ to protect South Korea
from North Korea. They also want to keep using ``smart''
anti-personnel mines, sophisticated devices that self-destruct
after a time, to shield larger anti-tank mines, which are not
prohibited by the treaty since the weight of a human is not enough
to trigger them.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has pledged to sign the treaty in the future
_ but only after the Pentagon develops alternatives to mines, a
process critics say has moved slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody questions the fact that we would be much
further along if the United States was not only a participant in
the treaty, but an active one,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
one of the most ardent advocates of a ban.
</P>
<P>
   Without U.S. support, Leahy added, ``a lot of countries will
say, `Why should we sign when the United States, the most powerful
country on earth, says it's not strong enough to give up land
mines?'''

   And the Hippo Begat the Whale
</P>
<P>
   How did nature ever get the idea of making a whale? Biologists
have found the answer by analyzing the DNA of whales and their
nearest terrestrial relatives, the artiodactyls, or even-toed
ungulates.
</P>
<P>
   Once there was an ancestral artiodactyl, this Just So story
goes, but its descendants did not get along with the bad-tempered
camel, which split off from the rest to become a separate species.
</P>
<P>
   The pig and peccary family was the next to depart, according to
the evidence of their genes, followed by giraffes and the deer
family.
</P>
<P>
   That left the hippo, a creature so aquatic that it gives birth
underwater. Sooner or later some hippos ventured down their river
estuary to the open sea, shed their hind limbs and shaped their
forelimbs into flippers.
</P>
<P>
   That, my children, is how nature fashioned the whale, and if you
don't believe it, you may consult the learned article by Dr.
Norihiko Okada and colleagues in this month's Proceedings of the

   Cars for the Credit-Challenged
</P>
<P>
   Detroit car dealer Mel Farr doesn't mind leasing used cars to
people with bad credit, as long as they don't mind driving around
with a gizmo on the dashboard that keeps their cars from starting
if they miss a payment.
</P>
<P>
   Those who lease from Farr must pay up weekly in order to get a
code to punch into the device on the dashboard. Anyone who is late
paying can still drive around, but once they turn the car off,
they'll find it won't start again.
</P>
<P>
   With lobbying help from the Rev. Jesse Jackson and financial
help from Wall Street, Farr, a former Detroit Lions football
player, said he was helping those who otherwise couldn't afford a
car. Critics, including Ralph Nader, worry that the devices could
prove unsafe, and said the interest rates of up to 25 percent take
advantage of the desperate. Farr counters that the high prices
reflect his risk.

   Israelis and Palestinians Agree to Agree
</P>
<P>
   After shuttling between both sides, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright announced that Israel and the Palestinians had concluded
an agreement to implement the land-for-peace accord they reached
nearly a year ago at the Wye River resort in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which provides for more Israeli redeployments
from the West Bank, set a deadline of early next year for the
parties to create a framework for final negotiations and of next
September for a final settlement. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has expressed hope that negotiations will also resume with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Among the final sticking points was the question of how many
Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails. Also,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had wanted the right to declare a
Palestinian state, but the Israelis were opposed to any
``unilateral action.''
</P>
<P>
   Deaths on a Roller Coaster
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey state investigators removed four cars from a roller
coaster in Ocean City to determine why a woman and her daughter
died on the ride. The woman, Kimberly Baily, 39, of Pomona, N.Y.,
and her daughter Jessica, 8, were at Gillian's Wonderland Pier when
the car they were riding slipped backward down a steep incline,
made a 90-degree turn and ejected them. There have been six deaths
on rides at American amusement parks so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   A Beef Over Burger King
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to relish the idea of the humble Whopper
innocently entangled in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no laughing matter to the parties involved, and
least of all to Burger King International, which somehow did not
realize that, through an Israeli franchise holder, it had opened a
restaurant in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King officials said the Israeli franchise holder misled
them into thinking the settlement, Maale Adumim, was located in
Israel, and company officials apparently never consulted a map.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after Arab-American protests, the company ordered the
Burger King name removed. The franchise holder refused. And now the
Burger King of Maale Adumim has become another contested fact on
the ground in the disputed territories.

   A Teachers' Strike in Detroit
</P>
<P>
   Teachers in Detroit's public schools went on strike, refusing to
work without a contract. That left 178,000 students on an extended
summer vacation, and many of their parents scrambling to find child
care.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement may prove slow in coming. Rank-and-file teachers
took a harder line than their Detroit Federation of Teachers,
rejecting the union leadership's recommendation to go back to work
with a 10-day bargaining extension.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are concerned that a new school board is not taking
their views into account as it struggles to improve student
performance in a district where half the students don't graduate
from high school.
</P>
<P>
   They also object to being paid less than their suburban
counterparts. So far, many parents in this union town are
supporting the teachers.

   Fewer Applications For Medical School
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is sure why, but the number of people applying to medical
schools in the United States is slipping. A study published in the
Journal of the American Medical Association reported a 12 percent
drop since 1996 in applications to the 125 schools accredited by
the American Medical Association. But there is still no shortage of
candidates. The 41,004 applicants last year vied for 16,000 spots.

   Those who lease from Farr must pay up weekly in order to get a
code to punch into the device on the dashboard. Anyone who is late
paying can still drive around, but once they turn the car off,
they'll find it won't start again.
</P>
<P>
   With lobbying help from the Rev. Jesse Jackson and financial
help from Wall Street, Farr, a former Detroit Lions football
player, said he was helping those who otherwise couldn't afford a
car. Critics, including Ralph Nader, worry that the devices could
prove unsafe, and said the interest rates of up to 25 percent take
advantage of the desperate. Farr counters that the high prices
reflect his risk.

   Israelis and Palestinians Agree to Agree
</P>
<P>
   After shuttling between both sides, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright announced that Israel and the Palestinians had concluded
an agreement to implement the land-for-peace accord they reached
nearly a year ago at the Wye River resort in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which provides for more Israeli redeployments
from the West Bank, set a deadline of early next year for the
parties to create a framework for final negotiations and of next
September for a final settlement. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has expressed hope that negotiations will also resume with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Among the final sticking points was the question of how many
Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails. Also,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had wanted the right to declare a
Palestinian state, but the Israelis were opposed to any
``unilateral action.''

   Deaths on a Roller Coaster
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey state investigators removed four cars from a roller
coaster in Ocean City to determine why a woman and her daughter
died on the ride. The woman, Kimberly Baily, 39, of Pomona, N.Y.,
and her daughter Jessica, 8, were at Gillian's Wonderland Pier when
the car they were riding slipped backward down a steep incline,
made a 90-degree turn and ejected them. There have been six deaths
on rides at American amusement parks so far this year.

   A Beef Over Burger King
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to relish the idea of the humble Whopper
innocently entangled in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no laughing matter to the parties involved, and
least of all to Burger King International, which somehow did not
realize that, through an Israeli franchise holder, it had opened a
restaurant in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King officials said the Israeli franchise holder misled
them into thinking the settlement, Maale Adumim, was located in
Israel, and company officials apparently never consulted a map.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after Arab-American protests, the company ordered the
Burger King name removed. The franchise holder refused. And now the
Burger King of Maale Adumim has become another contested fact on
the ground in the disputed territories.

   A Teachers' Strike in Detroit
</P>
<P>
   Teachers in Detroit's public schools went on strike, refusing to
work without a contract. That left 178,000 students on an extended
summer vacation, and many of their parents scrambling to find child
care.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement may prove slow in coming. Rank-and-file teachers
took a harder line than their Detroit Federation of Teachers,
rejecting the union leadership's recommendation to go back to work
with a 10-day bargaining extension.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are concerned that a new school board is not taking
their views into account as it struggles to improve student
performance in a district where half the students don't graduate
from high school.
</P>
<P>
   They also object to being paid less than their suburban
counterparts. So far, many parents in this union town are
supporting the teachers.

   Fewer Applications For Medical School
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is sure why, but the number of people applying to medical
schools in the United States is slipping. A study published in the
Journal of the American Medical Association reported a 12 percent
drop since 1996 in applications to the 125 schools accredited by
the American Medical Association. But there is still no shortage of
candidates. The 41,004 applicants last year vied for 16,000 spots.

   Big Drop in AIDS Deaths Begins to Slow
</P>
<P>
   The substantial decline in AIDS deaths that began after newer
combinations of drugs were introduced nearly four years ago has
slowed _ to 20 percent from 1997 to 1998 compared to 42 percent
from 1996 to 1997, federal health officials reported. The newer
therapies are benefiting many people infected with the AIDS virus,
but have led many others to think that drugs alone will wipe out
AIDS, experts said. They urged renewed efforts at prevention to
overcome the complacency.

   Retiring the Beanie Babies

   In what toy industry experts say may be a publicity stunt, Ty

</P>
<P>
   No one really believes that Beanies Babies will go the way of
the pet rock.
</P>
<P>
   The company may have made the announcement to drum up sales for
a product that has lost some of its appeal as youngsters have moved
on to other toys, such as Pokemon. The announcement created a
frenzy on Web site chat rooms and left customers confused. The
company, which has been known to ignore customers and retailers (Ty
even has an unlisted phone number), has declined to comment on the

   Chardonnay's Shameful Past
</P>
<P>
   The long arm of DNA that reached back into Thomas Jefferson's
family history has drawn attention to another scandalous liaison,
but this time in the family history of the chardonnay, one of the
world's best-known grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Using a DNA fingerprinting technique, geneticists at the
University of California, Davis, have shown that chardonnay is not
a kind of pinot, as believed by some experts, but rather is a cross
between pinot and gouais blanc.
</P>
<P>
   The pairing is surprising because pinot is a highly regarded
grape but gouais, common in the Middle Ages, became so despised
that it is no longer cultivated in France. The geneticists
discovered that 15 other French wines are also the progeny of the
pinot-gouais liaison, including gamay, the grape from which
beaujolais is made, and melon, the source of muscadet.

   Bush Outlines Plan To Fine Failing School

</P>
<P>
   Bush excoriated most federal education programs as ineffective,

He said schools should be controlled by local boards, but insisted
on federally mandated testing of children.

<P>
   Bush refused to use the word ``voucher,'' but said federal money
should be taken from public schools where children perform poorly
and given to parents to use at private or other schools. ``Public
funds must be spent on things that work,'' he said.

AFTER WACO: DEJA VU _ AN OUTSIDE COUNSEL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Barely weeks after the independent counsel law died
and was bid good riddance by everyone from President Clinton to
Kenneth Starr, Washington is astir with calls for a new round of
independent investigations.
</P>
<P>
   On controversial matters like the 1993 government raid on the
compound of the Branch Davidian sect in Waco, Democratic
fund-raising, and the possible diversion and laundering of
international relief money by the Russians, the administration's
critics have renewed demands for special counsels.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute: Aggressive outside investigations were
supposed to be out of favor after the nation's experience with
Starr's prolonged Whitewater inquiry, which encompassed the
president's sex life and led to his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   What gives?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that things are back to normal in Washington now,
even if the legal mechanics have changed.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law was supposed to take politics out of
investigations of the government, but didn't. It gave power to a
three-judge panel to appoint and oversee independent counsels,
taking from the Executive Branch the power of investigating itself.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Whitewater inquiry and other investigations of the
Clinton administration, the law became a popular target of
criticism. Democrats claimed it was being used for partisan ends,
while Republicans said the White House and its allies had resorted
to political attacks to taint legitimate inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   So the law was scrapped, and now the American tradition of
outside inquiries continues, with the risk of political taint at
least as strong as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure over disclosures that the FBI had withheld
evidence of the use of incendiary grenades in the Waco siege,
Attorney General Janet Reno on Friday announced her intention to
appoint an independent lawyer to re-examine the government's
handling of the Branch Davidians. The inquiry would not directly
involve the same kind of independent counsel that has been used to
investigate Clinton and members of his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of the type of investigation, calls for
independent inquiries even after the expiration of the law were
entirely predictable, say former prosecutors and officials. The
Justice Department's credibility is at a new low after the Waco
disclosures, on the heels of its failure to get to the bottom of
the campaign finance questions. ``There is a lack of confidence
over the ability of the Justice Department to do its job,'' said
Paul Curran, a special counsel during the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   While Reno made greater use of the independent counsel law than
any other attorney general since its enactment after the Watergate
scandal, she was besieged by critics urging its wider use, and
seemed relieved by its lapse this year. In its place, she issued
new rules giving her broad discretion over the appointment of
outside counsels.
</P>
<P>
   The rules do nothing to resolve the problem of an outside
counsel's autonomy. To be credible, an outside prosecutor should
generally not be accountable to another member of the Executive
Branch, like the president or one of his appointees. But in being
unaccountable, a prosecutor may abuse his power and become
partisan, as Democrats have charged lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is always going to be there,'' said Terry
Eastland, who was a Justice Department official in the Reagan
administration and who has long been critical of the law. ``It
always has been there from the beginning and it is embedded in the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   President Ulysses S. Grant had the dubious distinction of
appointing and then dismissing the nation's first outside
prosecutor. The lawyer, John B. Henderson, was named to examine the
relationship between the administration and what became known as
the St. Louis Whiskey Ring, a group of Midwestern liquor distillers
and federal revenue agents who cheated the government out of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let no guilty man escape!'' Grant exclaimed as he opened the
investigation in 1875. But Henderson was dismissed after his
inquiry focused on Orville E. Babcock, the president's private
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Harry Truman were among those
who later appointed outside counsels. And one of Truman's attorneys
general also fired an outside prosecutor, after that prosecutor
decided to investigate the Justice Department. Truman, shaken by
that decision, promptly replaced his attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   But the most infamous incident was the Saturday Night Massacre
in 1973, when President Richard M. Nixon dismissed the special
Watergate prosecutor, Archibald Cox, named by his Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   That action ultimately led to the adoption of the independent
counsel law. But, as is obvious today, it did little to quell the
political controversies surrounding sensitive government
investigations.

   There's more than one approach to Washington. There is the high
road. There is the low road. And there is what's stuck in the road.
Washington's hot asphalt streets happen to be just the right stuff
for turning the gleaming treasures that drop on them into instant
fossils.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, it isn't exactly the Great Rift Valley. The treasures
mashed into the streets tend to be the homely remnants of advanced
capitalist society: watch-strap buckles, combs and runaway baby
socks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when it comes to modern fossilization, the conditions
don't get much better than this. The asphalt in Washington is hot
and impressionable. The traffic is relentless. And the roads are
seldom repaved, which means an urban fossil has a good chance of
lasting a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Crowley, a staff photographer for The New York Times who
has made a hobby of documenting the city's flattened refuse, says
he regularly passes fossils he photographed years ago, including a
coffee stirrer from McDonald's pressed into I Street and an old
spoon planted on 16th Street that still clearly says ``Stainless
Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the laws of fossilization is that the things that get
mired in the streets tend to be common objects. In other words, the
plastic comb and the family of pull-tabs from a six-pack represent
thousands more like them.
</P>
<P>
   So surely there must be signs of government crushed somewhere in
the streets. Alas, a tiny charm of the Capitol is the sole
governmental fossil, unless you count that plastic stirrer from
McDonald's, which could have been dropped by the president.
</P>
<P>
   But beware: overinterpretation is a hazard of archaeology. If
you think that little piece of plastic left after a car accident
looks like the Washington Monument, or you're imagining that the
hood ornament resembles something in the Air and Space Museum,
maybe you've been in Washington a little too long.

McDonald's, which could have been dropped by the president.

<P>
   But beware: overinterpretation is a hazard of archaeology. If
you think that little piece of plastic left after a car accident
looks like the Washington Monument, or you're imagining that the
hood ornament resembles something in the Air and Space Museum,
maybe you've been in Washington a little too long.

 (Includes a color slide of Martin Lawrence in a scene from the
upcoming film ``Blue Streak.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Martin Lawrence can't catch a break.
 &HT;    A major star with a long-running television show and several hit
films under his belt, Lawrence has been plagued by legal problems
that threatened to derail his career and health scares that nearly
claimed his life.
 &HT;    Los Angeles police arrested him in 1996 for carrying a loaded
gun, shouting obscenities and biting an officer.
 &HT;    Months later, he was back in cuffs for attempting to board an
airplane with a nine-millimeter pistol.
 &HT;    In late 1997, Tisha Campbell, Lawrence's co-star on the
television sitcom ``Martin,'' sued the funnyman for battery and
sexual harassment.
 &HT;    More recently, the tabloids have focused on Lawrence's battles
with his ex-wife over custody of their three-year-old daughter.
 &HT;    Finally, in mid-August, Lawrence collapsed from heat stroke
while working himself into shape for an upcoming film.
 &HT;    The 34-year-old comic remains in ``serious, but guarded''
condition at the Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand
Oaks, Cal.
 &HT;    Just a couple of weeks before the latest incident, a noticeably
nervous but game Lawrence faced the press to promote his new movie
``Blue Streak.''
 &HT;    The action-comedy, which opens nationwide on Sept. 17, casts
Martin as Miles Logan, a thief who attempts to recover a
$20-million dollar diamond he'd hidden years earlier in an
unfinished building.
 &HT;    Now, the building has been finished, and serves as headquarters
for the officers of Precinct 37 in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    To find the diamond, Logan poses as a cop.
 &HT;    He fits right in.
 &HT;    Martin, interestingly, did little research.
 &HT;    ``I just had to keep my mind focused on being a thief, so I
really didn't have to research being a cop,'' he says. ``I just had
to be a good thief.''
 &HT;    And...
 &HT;    ``I was never a thief,'' Martin says, smiling. ``I stole one
Chunky when I was a little kid. And I took it back. It had a bite
out of it, but I took it back. I took a bite out of crime.''
 &HT;    Why?
 &HT;    ``It was just my conscience,'' he says.
 &HT;    Although he's been arrested a couple of times, Lawrence has also
talked his way out of situations. A bemused grin crosses his face
as he recounts one instance:
 &HT;    ``The police let me go a little early one time when they
arrested me,'' he says. ``I had some tears in my eyes. I had two
tears right here.''
 &HT;    He points to his over-sized eyes.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't acting,'' Martin says. ``I was serious. I said, `Hey
man, I'm not supposed to be here,' and they let me go. That was
cool.''
 &HT;    At the time of this conversation, Martin insisted that
everything in his life was cool.
 &HT;    He had completed ``Blue Streak,'' he enjoyed the support of his
family and friends, and he was gearing up for his next project, a
comedy called ``Big Mama's House.''
 &HT;    ``I'm having fun,'' he says. ``I'm just enjoying learning how to
not take certain things in life so seriously. I'm just trying to
have fun and enjoy (life) and respect myself as well as others.''
 &HT;    The pressures of stardom clearly got to Lawrence in the past,
however. He doesn't deny it.
 &HT;    ``I think you always have pressures,'' he says somberly. ``This
is just such a big industry. It's been going on since the
(beginning) of time.
 &HT;    ``So, it puts pressure on people. That's part of growing,
learning how to deal with those pressures and having the right
outlets.''
 &HT;    Lawrence grew up in Maryland, surrounded by his mother,
grandmother, three sisters and an older brother. He discovered
early on that he could make people laugh, and after eliciting
laughs during an open mike night at a local comedy club, headed to
New York City to give the city's club scene a shot.
 &HT;    An appearance on ``Star Search'' in 1987 led to a recurring role
on ``What's Happening Now!' an update of ``What's Happening?''
 &HT;    Lawrence then relocated to Los Angeles, and soon after performed
in an HBO comedy special which led to roles in films including ``Do
the Right Thing'' (1989), ``House Party I'' (1990), `House Party
II'' (1991) and ``Boomerang'' (1992) with Eddie Murphy.
 &HT;    Then came ``Martin,'' a controversial sitcom that cast Lawrence
not only as the lovelorn host of a Detroit radio talk show, but
also as the host's mother, Sheneneh. The series began in 1992 on
Fox and lasted five seasons.
 &HT;    ``We stuck to a regimen of what was real to us, and I think
people felt the energy and saw that we were having fun as well,''
Lawrence says. ``It showed.''
 &HT;    ``It was grueling, but it's worth it when you can get five years
out of it and you know that you've got an audience that's there for
you.''
 &HT;    As Lawrence's star rose, however, his problems increased. And he
found that fame can sometimes be a prison.
 &HT;    ``It can be a pain,'' he says. ``It cuts your privacy,
sometimes. You can't always just get out there like a normal
person. People want autographs. You're always questioned about your
weight or whatever. There's just a certain focus that you have to
have.''
 &HT;    Lawrence lost that focus several times, but his fans stayed
loyal.
 &HT;    ``They just say, `Martin, we can't wait to see you back out,'''
he says. ```We love what you do and damn them articles that dog
you!'''
 &HT;    Just before his latest crisis, Lawrence appeared to be on the
mend, dealing with his demons, shunning drugs and concentrating on
his career.
 &HT;    And during an interview, he spoke lovingly of his young
daughter.
 &HT;    ``I look at (her) as truly a blessing,'' he says. ``That's what
allows me to work as hard as I do, to take these dual characters
and things like that.
 &HT;    ``They're all to make a better way for her. I thank God for
helping me be in the position to do that.''
 &HT;    Lawrence once dreamed of achieving star status equal to that of
Eddie Murphy, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis.
 &HT;    But his continuing, high-profile problems could become an
obstacle to his grand ambitions.
 &HT;    As Lawrence himself admitted prior to the latest headlines:
``You can get the money that you want if you work hard enough ...
but there's a lot that goes with it. There's more to it than you
may think.''

 (Includes a color slide of actor Kevin Costner in the film ``For
Love of the Game.'') 
 &HT;     By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Kevin Costner is weeping.
 &HT;    Sitting on a hotel bed with his head in his hands, his body
shaken by sobs, he hunches over and shakes with grief.
 &HT;    Sandy blonde hair an unkept mess, handsome face beet red _ it's
not the kind of pose most ``A-list'' movie stars strike very often.
 &HT;    Not on-screen, and rarely in a $70 million movie.
 &HT;    For the love of a game called acting, Costner insists that
director Sam Raimi let him fall apart in his new baseball movie
``For Love of the Game.''
 &HT;    The crying jag happens after Costner pitches a perfect game. It
should be the most joyous moment in the character's life, but
Costner plays a loner sequestered in his hotel room, and it's a
hollow victory.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't easy for me to cry on screen,'' Costner says over
breakfast at the Regency Hotel in New York City. He looks
strikingly handsome in a beige Armani suit, and his blue eyes stare
like laser beams when he discusses his craft.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't even written that I would cry in the scene. I just
said to Sam, `I have this idea: let the cameras roll and don't stop
me.' Then I sat down on the hotel bed and cried. Everyone was a
little shocked and taken back.''
 &HT;    Costner is no stranger to a moment like this one. In many ways,
he is like his character, a man who appears to have it all. A
superstar millionaire with all the trappings of success, he has
mansions and cars and a slew of Oscars on his mantle.
 &HT;    ``There are still many days when I feel very alone. And I
shouldn't be alone,'' says Costner, a father of three who has been
divorced for six years from his longtime wife and high-school
sweetheart Cindy Costner.
 &HT;    ``I think we forget that actors are just people,'' Costner says.
``You know, I didn't suddenly just exist on this planet as a star.
I started out as a poor kid who grew up in Compton, California,
where getting a new pair of shoes was a big deal because we
couldn't afford it. Later on, I was a gawky teenager. I was just
another face without a name.''
 &HT;    He shrugs.
 &HT;    ``My life still isn't perfect. I still have problems. I get up
in the morning like any other father thinking, `How will my kids do
in school today?' I struggle with mundane issues: ``Do I let my
daughter go to this party? Who's driving the f---ing car? I want to
see this boy. I don't want you in the car with him.'
 &HT;    ``I have to deal with everyday concerns,'' Costner adds, ``and I
think that puts me on a level playing field with everyone else.''
 &HT;    He is back on the baseball field in his new movie ``For Love of
the Game'' opening Sept. 17. In the film, Costner plays an aging
superstar baseball pitcher who, during the course of one final
game, mulls over his life, his love and his losses.
 &HT;    The movie is a final chapter in what the actor dubs ``my sports
trilogy'' after ``Field of Dreams'' (1989) and ``Bull Durham''
(1988).
 &HT;    ``I've been asked if I'm afraid to go back to such familiar
territory as baseball. My answer is simple,'' Costner says. ``I
don't really have fears about what people are going to think about
any movie. If I try to anticipate how any movie will be received or
categorized, I think I'd just be paralyzed.''
 &HT;    Costner's return to the baseball diamond gave him a chance to
brush up on his throwing skills: at the height of his game, Costner
could pitch a speedball at 85 miles per hour.
 &HT;    ``I've heard that I could play for a minor league team,''
Costner says, smiling. ``The truth is I can't pitch 85 miles an
hour consistently. There were many days where I'd do 15 pitches and
then go have arm iced down from the pain.''
 &HT;    Also painful were stories Costner read about battles with his
director over control of the film.
 &HT;    ``We discussed this movie. But that happens on every film,''
Costner counters. ``I know the way I feel about movies, which is
really pure. I don't allow anybody tinkering with them for
commercial reasons. I don't like it. It could be a really good
friend and I just won't allow it. Maybe that's the trouble with
me.''
 &HT;    Costner has had other troubles with the media. He felt hostility
from the press when Premiere magazine listed his perks on ``For
Love of the Game,'' including what they claimed was a $4,500 a week
personal trainer.
 &HT;    Always up front, Costner doesn't skip a beat:
 &HT;    ``I don't think anyone would argue that I needed a good trainer
to do a sports movie,'' he says, evenly. ``I could barely get
through the f------ day when my arm hurt. But the flipside is that
I don't have a trainer on my next movie `13 Days' which is about
the Cuban missile crisis.
 &HT;    ``Listen,'' he implores. ``There is a lot of money tossed around
on movie sets. I'm not going to get into the details of it. But I'd
like to say that if I want a private plane to take me somewhere, I
take my own G3 plane. I pay for it. I don't live a lifestyle that's
out of line.''
 &HT;    Costner has worked hard for his G3.
 &HT;    He worked in marketing for about ten minutes, and decided to try
his hand at an acting career.
 &HT;    It didn't happen overnight:
 &HT;    He had one speaking line in ``Frances'' (1982), and his role as
a corpse in the opening credits of ``The Big Chill'' (1983) landed
on the editing-room floor.
 &HT;    He fared better in ``Silverado'' (1985), ``The Untouchables
(1987), ``No Way Out'' (1987), ``Field of Dreams'' (1989) and ``The
Bodyguard'' (1992).
 &HT;    By the end of the 1980s, Costner was one of the best-liked and
highest-paid leading men in Hollywood.
 &HT;    His ``Dances With Wolves'' (1990), which he starred in and
directed, earned seven Academy Awards, including best director and
best picture.
 &HT;    Then, Costner hit choppy waters with the much-lambasted
``Waterworld,'' which he acted in and also produced in 1995.
Critics were also unsympathetic toward his work as actor and
director on the futuristic parable ``The Postman'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``I don't look back and have regrets,'' he insists. ``I wanted
to make these movies. I'm proud of these movies. I hope they find
their audience someday.''
 &HT;    Costner says it will all shake out in the mix.
 &HT;    ``Look at Gary Cooper and Steve McQueen, who weren't really
appreciated as actors: Gary was thought of as being wooden and kind
of goofy. The press wrote mean things about Steve.
 &HT;    ``But now we think of them as legends. It's funny. I identify
with them because both have said they didn't really enjoy fame when
they were going through it.''
 &HT;    Above all, Costner says he will follow his own path.
 &HT;    ``I don't kowtow to conventional wisdom,'' he adds. ``I try to
be straight with people, including the media. On a movie set, if
you get a no, you get it from me and not an agent or a manager.
 &HT;    ``A lot of people don't have their fingerprints on the things
they do. They have other people do it ... That's not my way.''

LAID-BACK AND DRAWLING: A WISER TOM PETTY EASES ON DOWN THE ROAD

 (Includes a color slide of singer Tom Petty) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Despite his northern Florida drawl and laid-back demeanor,
there's a discernible ebullience in Tom Petty's voice as he talks
about the current state of his music and his band.
 &HT;    ``It's an exciting time to be in the Heartbreakers,'' says the
46-year-old singer, songwriter and guitarist, who started playing
with the Heartbreakers in 1971 in Gainesville, Fla., when the group
was known as Mudcrutch.
 &HT;    ``I think that right now it's actually better than I ever
counted on it being ... It's great to be improving this many years
along the line, with the band.
 &HT;    ``Usually when a band's been around this long, it's just sort of
paying lip service to itself.
 &HT;    ``But I think our music is actually improving. It's getting
easier to do. It's not nearly the chore it's been. Those are nice
things to have happen.''
 &HT;    Among other nice things happening in Petty's life are the strong
sales for the group's latest album, ``Echo,'' which debuted at No.
10 on the Billboard chart after selling more than 81,000 copies in
its first week of release in April.
 &HT;    And Petty's observations about the creative state of the band
are certainly borne out on the record, which includes all-out
rockers (``Free Girl Now,'' ``I Don't Wanna Fight,'' ``About to
Give Out'') as well as moodier fare (``Lonesome Sundown,'' ``Rhino
Skin'' and ``Echo.'')
 &HT;    The record includes 15 sinewy, tightly-performed songs which
convey a sense of looseness and space within the parameters of
their careful arrangements.
 &HT;    The album is a testament to the resilience and allegiance Petty
and the Heartbreakers now feel toward one another.
 &HT;    It was just a decade ago that Petty recorded his first solo
album, the multimillion-selling ``Full Moon Fever.''
 &HT;    Its success seemed to herald a period of creativity without the
Heartbreakers. The band had cause to worry, and fans wondered
whether real heartbreak might be in store for the unit,
particularly in light of angry statements to the press made by
Heartbreakers drummer Stan Lynch after he had split from the band.
 &HT;    ``There may have been some concern ... that I was drifting away,
but I wasn't, really,'' says the Los Angeles-based Petty, the
divorced father of two daughters, ages 24 and 17.
 &HT;    ``I've always felt like a member of the band, and I think they
treated me like a member of the band,'' Petty adds.
 &HT;    During the past 10 years, however, Petty has alternated between
Heartbreakers albums (``Into the Great Wide Open,'' 1991 and
``She's the One,'' 1996) solo projects (``Wildflowers,'' 1994) and
occasional work with the Traveling Wilburys, the ad hoc supergroup
that features Bob Dylan, George Harrison and Jeff Lynne.
 &HT;    Petty says the wizened quartet, which originally included the
late Roy Orbison, may come out of retirement and put together
another album in 2000.
 &HT;    The outside projects, in fact, actually outsold his albums with
the Heartbreakers, save for a 1993 ``Greatest Hits'' set.
 &HT;    But with ``Echo,'' there's a palpable sense of reconnection, and
Petty now says he's through with solo albums.
 &HT;    ``I think in 25 years together, you're going to go through some
hills and valleys, you know,'' he explains, citing other tensions
that arose when the band began to experience success with hits such
as ``Breakdown,'' ``Refugee,'' ``The Waiting'' and ``You Got
Lucky.''
 &HT;    ``We became sort of victims of our own success in some way, in
that when we did play it was usually in a giant place ... with all
these expectations and preconceptions people had,'' Petty recalls.
 &HT;    The antidote to stadium tours came in the form of a 20-show
residency at San Francisco's fabled Fillmore Auditorium in early
1997.
 &HT;    There, the Heartbreakers tinkered with set lists, playing
seldom-heard album cuts and spontaneously performing cover songs.
 &HT;    It was great fun, Petty says, allowing the musicians to play as
a unit again and ``reconnect with something.''
 &HT;    ``We felt like we had a really good rock 'n' roll band, and we
were kind of glad to be in it.''
 &HT;    Instilled with that spirit, Petty and the Heartbreakers _
guitarist Mike Campbell, bassist Howie Epstein and keyboardist
Benmont Tench, plus cohorts Steve Ferrone on drums and Scott
Thurston on guitar and bass _ set to work on ``Echo.''
 &HT;    The original idea, Petty says, was to have the material
well-prepared ``so we wouldn't have to overdub much and we could
concentrate on live takes.''
 &HT;    Campbell, who collaborated with Petty on both of the solo
albums, handled the engineering. But Petty eventually brought in
co-producer Rick Rubin when the sessions required a more
disciplined approach.
 &HT;    ``It felt very informal,'' Petty says, ``and it was usually
pretty productive.''
 &HT;    So productive, in fact, that some songs, such as ``Swingin',''
were made up on the spot.
 &HT;    ``That just came to me while we were working on something
else,'' remembers Petty.
 &HT;    ``I kind of came up with these chords and just started to play
them, and the band fell in on it and I just improvised the lyric.
 &HT;    ``When we played it back, we were all kind of surprised at how
good a song it was. So we listened back to it one more time,
straightened out this or that, and then we did one more take and
that was the record _ before we hardly knew the song.''
 &HT;    The band has been on the road since mid-June, playing plenty of
hits and even pulling out long-discarded favorites such as ``Don't
Do Me Like That.''
 &HT;    But the freedom to experiment that the Heartbreakers felt during
their Fillmore shows has also been present.
 &HT;    ``We've gotten used to not playing the same show night after
night,'' Petty explains.
 &HT;    ``I hope some of that feeling comes along with it, some of that
freedom to explore. I've seen people that have been around a long
time, and they just fall into routine and self-parody.
 &HT;    ``That's just not where we want to wind up. We really believe in
this music, this rock 'n' roll music that we're playing. And we
want to keep it fresh and avoid any sort of routine to it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the Japanese have exported many inventions to beguile
American children, it's only since last fall that they've offered a
product equally intriguing to parents: something that sends 3- to
11-year-olds bounding out of bed at the crack of dawn, bright-eyed,
energetic and eager to start the day.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a high-tech alarm clock.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``Pokemon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon'' (pronounced POH-kay-mahn), which is short for
``pocket monster,'' finished the 1998-99 season as the No. 1
children's show in the United States, both in syndication and on
the networks.
</P>
<P>
   (Its Saturday broadcast had earned an impressive 22 share among
viewers ages 6 to 11.)
</P>
<P>
   The animated series concerns the quest to capture all 150
species (that's 150, and counting) of pocket monsters, which range
from fuzzy and cute to things that look like escaped mutants from
``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kids' WB, part of the network, which now owns the exclusive
rights to show ``Pokemon'' in this country, is doing everything
possible to make sure these odd critters remain tops in children's
minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focusing on what kids like the best: the creatures,
their evolution, the depth of the whole world,'' said Donna L.
Friedman, senior vice president of Kids' WB.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman vows to stay on top of the game, in the face of the
recent arrival on the Fox network of what looks like a blatant
imitation: ``Digimon,'' a Japanese animated series about, yes,
evolving digital monsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the No. 1 franchise with `Pokemon,' and the formula
for creating such a phenomenon is so far unknown to man or
producer,'' Friedman said serenely.
</P>
<P>
   ``So although many people will try to copy 'Pokemon's' success,
it will not be easy to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon'' has achieved its hit status in appropriately
Zen-like fashion: without displays of bloodshed or weaponry, or
even sophisticated animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an assumption that you can't grab kids unless
you're ultraviolent or ultra edgy,'' said Alfred Kahn, chairman and
chief executive officer of 4 Kids Entertainment, the New York
company whose various divisions produce, distribute and license
``Pokemon'' outside of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't. It's clever, and it's got a terrifically in-depth
story line.''
</P>
<P>
   The story revolves around Ash Ketchum, a 10-year-old training as
a Pokemon master.
</P>
<P>
   His education doesn't involve martial arts but a kind of mixture
of the Boy Scouts and safari hunting: aspiring pokemon masters tame
wild pokemon and collect badges that indicate their level of skill.
</P>
<P>
   (Ash's pokemon sidekick, Pikachu, who resembles a cross between
a koala bear and a chipmunk, is definitely at the cuddly end of the
pocket-monster spectrum.)
</P>
<P>
   The goal of pokemon trainers is expressed by the series's tag
line: ``Gotta catch 'em all!''
</P>
<P>
   A trainer usually captures a pokemon by sending one of his own
pocket monsters (they're not, by the way, pocket-size) into a
match.
</P>
<P>
   Although these battles involve the pokemon's special powers,
which range from electric to psychic, there's no gore.
</P>
<P>
   As for the trainers, they're likely to shake hands and offer one
another fighting tips at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon'' started as a video game for the hand-held Nintendo
Game Boy. But even though the series mirrors the game, that's not
the only key to its success.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the cartoon series ``Super Mario Brothers'' also came
from Nintendo and was far from a runaway hit.
</P>
<P>
   ```Pokemon' is like a soap opera for kids; the story never
ends,'' said Norman Grossfeld, president of 4 Kids Productions, the
corporate division that produces the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different from other shows, where the bad guy gets
battled and then it's over. Here, if you miss a show, you feel
you've missed something.''
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, where the series is about to enter its third season,
50 percent of children watch it, Grossfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon'' is also a hit in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
It entered the British, Mexican and Latin American markets this
spring and will hit most of the rest of Europe next month.
</P>
<P>
   Amy B. Jordan, a senior research investigator at the
Philadelphia offices of the Annenberg Public Policy Center, which
studies children's television, attributes the success of
``Pokemon'' to its savvy incorporation of many aspects of other hot
children's properties.
</P>
<P>
   It offers the morphing qualities of ``Power Rangers,'' the
concept of animal nurturing that has fostered children's hits since
``Lassie'' and ``Rin Tin Tin'' and the collectability of Beanie
Babies (with ``Pokemon'' toys and trading cards, children can
``catch 'em all'' along with Ash and his friends Brock and Misty).
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of series-related merchandise has been
especially helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have lots of products, and particularly products in
other media, you set up this kind of symbiotic relationship,''
Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   But although the ``Pokemon'' merchandise has fast become a
billion-dollar industry, the television program is only now
approaching profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend probably close to six figures a show,'' Mr. Kahn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the expense goes into Westernizing ``Pokemon.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the characters, as in most animi (the popular term for
Japanese animation), look generically Caucasian, the dialogue and
setting are steeped in Japanese culture.
</P>
<P>
   The American producers go through each episode frame by frame,
adapting the tone and remaking some of the characters'
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   James, one of the two human villains, is more flamboyant and
foppish than his slightly malevolent Japanese counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   He and Jessie, his female partner, have a catlike pokemon,
Meowth, who's a bit of a philosopher in Japan; here it speaks
Brooklynese, calling to mind Danny DeVito in one of his more
buffoonish bad-guy roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals and physical humor of each episode are the same, but
word for word we change it,'' Grossfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   With all this time and money going into ``Pokemon,'' is it
high-quality entertainment?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not say that `Pokemon' is particularly enriching for
children,'' Jordan says. ``But on the other hand, I don't worry
about it as much as, say, `Beast Wars,' `Batman' or `X-Men,''' all
animated series that she said emphasized violence.
</P>
<P>
   And while Jordan does see some favorable aspects to ``Pokemon''
_ the games and cards encourage reading and problem solving _ she's
not sure it has staying power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be peaking now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not if the producers can help it.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-September, Kids' WB is going to push the permanent
broadcast schedule to 12 times a week, seeking viewers before
school, after school and on weekends with a mix of old and new
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   A CD of ``Pokemon'' songs was recently released, and new Pokemon
Nintendo games are on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this a feature film (``Mewtwo Strikes Back,'' in
November), and you have a full-scale Pokemon attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a huge audience that is just getting into
it,'' Friedman says. ``A lot of kids who haven't seen it yet will
be able to have their own Pokemon training now, right from the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Gotta catch 'em all.

 (Includes a color slide of Martin Lawrence in a scene from the
upcoming film ``Blue Streak.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Martin Lawrence can't catch a break.
 &HT;    A major star with a long-running television show and several hit
films under his belt, Lawrence has been plagued by legal problems
that threatened to derail his career and health scares that nearly
claimed his life.
 &HT;    Los Angeles police arrested him in 1996 for carrying a loaded
gun, shouting obscenities and biting an officer.
 &HT;    Months later, he was back in cuffs for attempting to board an
airplane with a nine-millimeter pistol.
 &HT;    In late 1997, Tisha Campbell, Lawrence's co-star on the
television sitcom ``Martin,'' sued the funnyman for battery and
sexual harassment.
 &HT;    More recently, the tabloids have focused on Lawrence's battles
with his ex-wife over custody of their three-year-old daughter.
 &HT;    Finally, in mid-August, Lawrence collapsed from heat stroke
while working himself into shape for an upcoming film.
 &HT;    The 34-year-old comic remains in ``serious, but guarded''
condition at the Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand
Oaks, Cal.
 &HT;    Just a couple of weeks before the latest incident, a noticeably
nervous but game Lawrence faced the press to promote his new movie
``Blue Streak.''
 &HT;    The action-comedy, which opens nationwide on Sept. 17, casts
Martin as Miles Logan, a thief who attempts to recover a
$20-million dollar diamond he'd hidden years earlier in an
unfinished building.
 &HT;    Now, the building has been finished, and serves as headquarters
for the officers of Precinct 37 in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    To find the diamond, Logan poses as a cop.
 &HT;    He fits right in.
 &HT;    Martin, interestingly, did little research.
 &HT;    ``I just had to keep my mind focused on being a thief, so I
really didn't have to research being a cop,'' he says. ``I just had
to be a good thief.''
 &HT;    And...
 &HT;    ``I was never a thief,'' Martin says, smiling. ``I stole one
Chunky when I was a little kid. And I took it back. It had a bite
out of it, but I took it back. I took a bite out of crime.''
 &HT;    Why?
 &HT;    ``It was just my conscience,'' he says.
 &HT;    Although he's been arrested a couple of times, Lawrence has also
talked his way out of situations. A bemused grin crosses his face
as he recounts one instance:
 &HT;    ``The police let me go a little early one time when they
arrested me,'' he says. ``I had some tears in my eyes. I had two
tears right here.''
 &HT;    He points to his over-sized eyes.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't acting,'' Martin says. ``I was serious. I said, `Hey
man, I'm not supposed to be here,' and they let me go. That was
cool.''
 &HT;    At the time of this conversation, Martin insisted that
everything in his life was cool.
 &HT;    He had completed ``Blue Streak,'' he enjoyed the support of his
family and friends, and he was gearing up for his next project, a
comedy called ``Big Mama's House.''
 &HT;    ``I'm having fun,'' he says. ``I'm just enjoying learning how to
not take certain things in life so seriously. I'm just trying to
have fun and enjoy (life) and respect myself as well as others.''
 &HT;    The pressures of stardom clearly got to Lawrence in the past,
however. He doesn't deny it.
 &HT;    ``I think you always have pressures,'' he says somberly. ``This
is just such a big industry. It's been going on since the
(beginning) of time.
 &HT;    ``So, it puts pressure on people. That's part of growing,
learning how to deal with those pressures and having the right
outlets.''
 &HT;    Lawrence grew up in Maryland, surrounded by his mother,
grandmother, three sisters and an older brother. He discovered
early on that he could make people laugh, and after eliciting
laughs during an open mike night at a local comedy club, headed to
New York City to give the city's club scene a shot.
 &HT;    An appearance on ``Star Search'' in 1987 led to a recurring role
on ``What's Happening Now!' an update of ``What's Happening?''
 &HT;    Lawrence then relocated to Los Angeles, and soon after performed
in an HBO comedy special which led to roles in films including ``Do
the Right Thing'' (1989), ``House Party I'' (1990), `House Party
II'' (1991) and ``Boomerang'' (1992) with Eddie Murphy.
 &HT;    Then came ``Martin,'' a controversial sitcom that cast Lawrence
not only as the lovelorn host of a Detroit radio talk show, but
also as the host's mother, Sheneneh. The series began in 1992 on
Fox and lasted five seasons.
 &HT;    ``We stuck to a regimen of what was real to us, and I think
people felt the energy and saw that we were having fun as well,''
Lawrence says. ``It showed.''
 &HT;    ``It was grueling, but it's worth it when you can get five years
out of it and you know that you've got an audience that's there for
you.''
 &HT;    As Lawrence's star rose, however, his problems increased. And he
found that fame can sometimes be a prison.
 &HT;    ``It can be a pain,'' he says. ``It cuts your privacy,
sometimes. You can't always just get out there like a normal
person. People want autographs. You're always questioned about your
weight or whatever. There's just a certain focus that you have to
have.''
 &HT;    Lawrence lost that focus several times, but his fans stayed
loyal.
 &HT;    ``They just say, `Martin, we can't wait to see you back out,'''
he says. ```We love what you do and damn them articles that dog
you!'''
 &HT;    Just before his latest crisis, Lawrence appeared to be on the
mend, dealing with his demons, shunning drugs and concentrating on
his career.
 &HT;    And during an interview, he spoke lovingly of his young
daughter.
 &HT;    ``I look at (her) as truly a blessing,'' he says. ``That's what
allows me to work as hard as I do, to take these dual characters
and things like that.
 &HT;    ``They're all to make a better way for her. I thank God for
helping me be in the position to do that.''
 &HT;    Lawrence once dreamed of achieving star status equal to that of
Eddie Murphy, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis.
 &HT;    But his continuing, high-profile problems could become an
obstacle to his grand ambitions.
 &HT;    As Lawrence himself admitted prior to the latest headlines:
``You can get the money that you want if you work hard enough ...
but there's a lot that goes with it. There's more to it than you
may think.''

 (Includes a color slide of actor Kevin Costner in the film ``For
Love of the Game.'') 
 &HT;     By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Kevin Costner is weeping.
 &HT;    Sitting on a hotel bed with his head in his hands, his body
shaken by sobs, he hunches over and shakes with grief.
 &HT;    Sandy blonde hair an unkept mess, handsome face beet red _ it's
not the kind of pose most ``A-list'' movie stars strike very often.
 &HT;    Not on-screen, and rarely in a $70 million movie.
 &HT;    For the love of a game called acting, Costner insists that
director Sam Raimi let him fall apart in his new baseball movie
``For Love of the Game.''
 &HT;    The crying jag happens after Costner pitches a perfect game. It
should be the most joyous moment in the character's life, but
Costner plays a loner sequestered in his hotel room, and it's a
hollow victory.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't easy for me to cry on screen,'' Costner says over
breakfast at the Regency Hotel in New York City. He looks
strikingly handsome in a beige Armani suit, and his blue eyes stare
like laser beams when he discusses his craft.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't even written that I would cry in the scene. I just
said to Sam, `I have this idea: let the cameras roll and don't stop
me.' Then I sat down on the hotel bed and cried. Everyone was a
little shocked and taken back.''
 &HT;    Costner is no stranger to a moment like this one. In many ways,
he is like his character, a man who appears to have it all. A
superstar millionaire with all the trappings of success, he has
mansions and cars and a slew of Oscars on his mantle.
 &HT;    ``There are still many days when I feel very alone. And I
shouldn't be alone,'' says Costner, a father of three who has been
divorced for six years from his longtime wife and high-school
sweetheart Cindy Costner.
 &HT;    ``I think we forget that actors are just people,'' Costner says.
``You know, I didn't suddenly just exist on this planet as a star.
I started out as a poor kid who grew up in Compton, California,
where getting a new pair of shoes was a big deal because we
couldn't afford it. Later on, I was a gawky teenager. I was just
another face without a name.''
 &HT;    He shrugs.
 &HT;    ``My life still isn't perfect. I still have problems. I get up
in the morning like any other father thinking, `How will my kids do
in school today?' I struggle with mundane issues: ``Do I let my
daughter go to this party? Who's driving the f---ing car? I want to
see this boy. I don't want you in the car with him.'
 &HT;    ``I have to deal with everyday concerns,'' Costner adds, ``and I
think that puts me on a level playing field with everyone else.''
 &HT;    He is back on the baseball field in his new movie ``For Love of
the Game'' opening Sept. 17. In the film, Costner plays an aging
superstar baseball pitcher who, during the course of one final
game, mulls over his life, his love and his losses.
 &HT;    The movie is a final chapter in what the actor dubs ``my sports
trilogy'' after ``Field of Dreams'' (1989) and ``Bull Durham''
(1988).
 &HT;    ``I've been asked if I'm afraid to go back to such familiar
territory as baseball. My answer is simple,'' Costner says. ``I
don't really have fears about what people are going to think about
any movie. If I try to anticipate how any movie will be received or
categorized, I think I'd just be paralyzed.''
 &HT;    Costner's return to the baseball diamond gave him a chance to
brush up on his throwing skills: at the height of his game, Costner
could pitch a speedball at 85 miles per hour.
 &HT;    ``I've heard that I could play for a minor league team,''
Costner says, smiling. ``The truth is I can't pitch 85 miles an
hour consistently. There were many days where I'd do 15 pitches and
then go have arm iced down from the pain.''
 &HT;    Also painful were stories Costner read about battles with his
director over control of the film.
 &HT;    ``We discussed this movie. But that happens on every film,''
Costner counters. ``I know the way I feel about movies, which is
really pure. I don't allow anybody tinkering with them for
commercial reasons. I don't like it. It could be a really good
friend and I just won't allow it. Maybe that's the trouble with
me.''
 &HT;    Costner has had other troubles with the media. He felt hostility
from the press when Premiere magazine listed his perks on ``For
Love of the Game,'' including what they claimed was a $4,500 a week
personal trainer.
 &HT;    Always up front, Costner doesn't skip a beat:
 &HT;    ``I don't think anyone would argue that I needed a good trainer
to do a sports movie,'' he says, evenly. ``I could barely get
through the f------ day when my arm hurt. But the flipside is that
I don't have a trainer on my next movie `13 Days' which is about
the Cuban missile crisis.
 &HT;    ``Listen,'' he implores. ``There is a lot of money tossed around
on movie sets. I'm not going to get into the details of it. But I'd
like to say that if I want a private plane to take me somewhere, I
take my own G3 plane. I pay for it. I don't live a lifestyle that's
out of line.''
 &HT;    Costner has worked hard for his G3.
 &HT;    He worked in marketing for about ten minutes, and decided to try
his hand at an acting career.
 &HT;    It didn't happen overnight:
 &HT;    He had one speaking line in ``Frances'' (1982), and his role as
a corpse in the opening credits of ``The Big Chill'' (1983) landed
on the editing-room floor.
 &HT;    He fared better in ``Silverado'' (1985), ``The Untouchables
(1987), ``No Way Out'' (1987), ``Field of Dreams'' (1989) and ``The
Bodyguard'' (1992).
 &HT;    By the end of the 1980s, Costner was one of the best-liked and
highest-paid leading men in Hollywood.
 &HT;    His ``Dances With Wolves'' (1990), which he starred in and
directed, earned seven Academy Awards, including best director and
best picture.
 &HT;    Then, Costner hit choppy waters with the much-lambasted
``Waterworld,'' which he acted in and also produced in 1995.
Critics were also unsympathetic toward his work as actor and
director on the futuristic parable ``The Postman'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``I don't look back and have regrets,'' he insists. ``I wanted
to make these movies. I'm proud of these movies. I hope they find
their audience someday.''
 &HT;    Costner says it will all shake out in the mix.
 &HT;    ``Look at Gary Cooper and Steve McQueen, who weren't really
appreciated as actors: Gary was thought of as being wooden and kind
of goofy. The press wrote mean things about Steve.
 &HT;    ``But now we think of them as legends. It's funny. I identify
with them because both have said they didn't really enjoy fame when
they were going through it.''
 &HT;    Above all, Costner says he will follow his own path.
 &HT;    ``I don't kowtow to conventional wisdom,'' he adds. ``I try to
be straight with people, including the media. On a movie set, if
you get a no, you get it from me and not an agent or a manager.
 &HT;    ``A lot of people don't have their fingerprints on the things
they do. They have other people do it ... That's not my way.''

 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Despite his northern Florida drawl and laid-back demeanor,
there's a discernible ebullience in Tom Petty's voice as he talks
about the current state of his music and his band.
 &HT;    ``It's an exciting time to be in the Heartbreakers,'' says the
46-year-old singer, songwriter and guitarist, who started playing
with the Heartbreakers in 1971 in Gainesville, Fla., when the group
was known as Mudcrutch.
 &HT;    ``I think that right now it's actually better than I ever
counted on it being ... It's great to be improving this many years
along the line, with the band.
 &HT;    ``Usually when a band's been around this long, it's just sort of
paying lip service to itself.
 &HT;    ``But I think our music is actually improving. It's getting
easier to do. It's not nearly the chore it's been. Those are nice
things to have happen.''
 &HT;    Among other nice things happening in Petty's life are the strong
sales for the group's latest album, ``Echo,'' which debuted at No.
10 on the Billboard chart after selling more than 81,000 copies in
its first week of release in April.
 &HT;    And Petty's observations about the creative state of the band
are certainly borne out on the record, which includes all-out
rockers (``Free Girl Now,'' ``I Don't Wanna Fight,'' ``About to
Give Out'') as well as moodier fare (``Lonesome Sundown,'' ``Rhino
Skin'' and ``Echo.'')
 &HT;    The record includes 15 sinewy, tightly-performed songs which
convey a sense of looseness and space within the parameters of
their careful arrangements.
 &HT;    The album is a testament to the resilience and allegiance Petty
and the Heartbreakers now feel toward one another.
 &HT;    It was just a decade ago that Petty recorded his first solo
album, the multimillion-selling ``Full Moon Fever.''
 &HT;    Its success seemed to herald a period of creativity without the
Heartbreakers. The band had cause to worry, and fans wondered
whether real heartbreak might be in store for the unit,
particularly in light of angry statements to the press made by
Heartbreakers drummer Stan Lynch after he had split from the band.
 &HT;    ``There may have been some concern ... that I was drifting away,
but I wasn't, really,'' says the Los Angeles-based Petty, the
divorced father of two daughters, ages 24 and 17.
 &HT;    ``I've always felt like a member of the band, and I think they
treated me like a member of the band,'' Petty adds.
 &HT;    During the past 10 years, however, Petty has alternated between
Heartbreakers albums (``Into the Great Wide Open,'' 1991 and
``She's the One,'' 1996) solo projects (``Wildflowers,'' 1994) and
occasional work with the Traveling Wilburys, the ad hoc supergroup
that features Bob Dylan, George Harrison and Jeff Lynne.
 &HT;    Petty says the wizened quartet, which originally included the
late Roy Orbison, may come out of retirement and put together
another album in 2000.
 &HT;    The outside projects, in fact, actually outsold his albums with
the Heartbreakers, save for a 1993 ``Greatest Hits'' set.
 &HT;    But with ``Echo,'' there's a palpable sense of reconnection, and
Petty now says he's through with solo albums.
 &HT;    ``I think in 25 years together, you're going to go through some
hills and valleys, you know,'' he explains, citing other tensions
that arose when the band began to experience success with hits such
as ``Breakdown,'' ``Refugee,'' ``The Waiting'' and ``You Got
Lucky.''
 &HT;    ``We became sort of victims of our own success in some way, in
that when we did play it was usually in a giant place ... with all
these expectations and preconceptions people had,'' Petty recalls.
 &HT;    The antidote to stadium tours came in the form of a 20-show
residency at San Francisco's fabled Fillmore Auditorium in early
1997.
 &HT;    There, the Heartbreakers tinkered with set lists, playing
seldom-heard album cuts and spontaneously performing cover songs.
 &HT;    It was great fun, Petty says, allowing the musicians to play as
a unit again and ``reconnect with something.''
 &HT;    ``We felt like we had a really good rock 'n' roll band, and we
were kind of glad to be in it.''
 &HT;    Instilled with that spirit, Petty and the Heartbreakers _
guitarist Mike Campbell, bassist Howie Epstein and keyboardist
Benmont Tench, plus cohorts Steve Ferrone on drums and Scott
Thurston on guitar and bass _ set to work on ``Echo.''
 &HT;    The original idea, Petty says, was to have the material
well-prepared ``so we wouldn't have to overdub much and we could
concentrate on live takes.''
 &HT;    Campbell, who collaborated with Petty on both of the solo
albums, handled the engineering. But Petty eventually brought in
co-producer Rick Rubin when the sessions required a more
disciplined approach.
 &HT;    ``It felt very informal,'' Petty says, ``and it was usually
pretty productive.''
 &HT;    So productive, in fact, that some songs, such as ``Swingin',''
were made up on the spot.
 &HT;    ``That just came to me while we were working on something
else,'' remembers Petty.
 &HT;    ``I kind of came up with these chords and just started to play
them, and the band fell in on it and I just improvised the lyric.
 &HT;    ``When we played it back, we were all kind of surprised at how
good a song it was. So we listened back to it one more time,
straightened out this or that, and then we did one more take and
that was the record _ before we hardly knew the song.''
 &HT;    The band has been on the road since mid-June, playing plenty of
hits and even pulling out long-discarded favorites such as ``Don't
Do Me Like That.''
 &HT;    But the freedom to experiment that the Heartbreakers felt during
their Fillmore shows has also been present.
 &HT;    ``We've gotten used to not playing the same show night after
night,'' Petty explains.
 &HT;    ``I hope some of that feeling comes along with it, some of that
freedom to explore. I've seen people that have been around a long
time, and they just fall into routine and self-parody.
 &HT;    ``That's just not where we want to wind up. We really believe in
this music, this rock 'n' roll music that we're playing. And we
want to keep it fresh and avoid any sort of routine to it.''

JAPANESE POCKET MONSTERS TAKE OVER AMERICA'S YOUNG

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of animated Pokemon characters) 
 By LAUREL GRAEBER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the Japanese have exported many inventions to beguile
American children, it's only since last fall that they've offered a
product equally intriguing to parents: something that sends 3- to
11-year-olds bounding out of bed at the crack of dawn, bright-eyed,
energetic and eager to start the day.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a high-tech alarm clock.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``Pokemon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon'' (pronounced POH-kay-mahn), which is short for
``pocket monster,'' finished the 1998-99 season as the No. 1
children's show in the United States, both in syndication and on
the networks.
</P>
<P>
   (Its Saturday broadcast had earned an impressive 22 share among
viewers ages 6 to 11.)
</P>
<P>
   The animated series concerns the quest to capture all 150
species (that's 150, and counting) of pocket monsters, which range
from fuzzy and cute to things that look like escaped mutants from
``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kids' WB, part of the network, which now owns the exclusive
rights to show ``Pokemon'' in this country, is doing everything
possible to make sure these odd critters remain tops in children's
minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focusing on what kids like the best: the creatures,
their evolution, the depth of the whole world,'' said Donna L.
Friedman, senior vice president of Kids' WB.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman vows to stay on top of the game, in the face of the
recent arrival on the Fox network of what looks like a blatant
imitation: ``Digimon,'' a Japanese animated series about, yes,
evolving digital monsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the No. 1 franchise with `Pokemon,' and the formula
for creating such a phenomenon is so far unknown to man or
producer,'' Friedman said serenely.
</P>
<P>
   ``So although many people will try to copy 'Pokemon's' success,
it will not be easy to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon'' has achieved its hit status in appropriately
Zen-like fashion: without displays of bloodshed or weaponry, or
even sophisticated animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an assumption that you can't grab kids unless
you're ultraviolent or ultra edgy,'' said Alfred Kahn, chairman and
chief executive officer of 4 Kids Entertainment, the New York
company whose various divisions produce, distribute and license
``Pokemon'' outside of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't. It's clever, and it's got a terrifically in-depth
story line.''
</P>
<P>
   The story revolves around Ash Ketchum, a 10-year-old training as
a Pokemon master.
</P>
<P>
   His education doesn't involve martial arts but a kind of mixture
of the Boy Scouts and safari hunting: aspiring pokemon masters tame
wild pokemon and collect badges that indicate their level of skill.
</P>
<P>
   (Ash's pokemon sidekick, Pikachu, who resembles a cross between
a koala bear and a chipmunk, is definitely at the cuddly end of the
pocket-monster spectrum.)
</P>
<P>
   The goal of pokemon trainers is expressed by the series's tag
line: ``Gotta catch 'em all!''
</P>
<P>
   A trainer usually captures a pokemon by sending one of his own
pocket monsters (they're not, by the way, pocket-size) into a
match.
</P>
<P>
   Although these battles involve the pokemon's special powers,
which range from electric to psychic, there's no gore.
</P>
<P>
   As for the trainers, they're likely to shake hands and offer one
another fighting tips at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon'' started as a video game for the hand-held Nintendo
Game Boy. But even though the series mirrors the game, that's not
the only key to its success.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the cartoon series ``Super Mario Brothers'' also came
from Nintendo and was far from a runaway hit.
</P>
<P>
   ```Pokemon' is like a soap opera for kids; the story never
ends,'' said Norman Grossfeld, president of 4 Kids Productions, the
corporate division that produces the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different from other shows, where the bad guy gets
battled and then it's over. Here, if you miss a show, you feel
you've missed something.''
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, where the series is about to enter its third season,
50 percent of children watch it, Grossfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon'' is also a hit in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
It entered the British, Mexican and Latin American markets this
spring and will hit most of the rest of Europe next month.
</P>
<P>
   Amy B. Jordan, a senior research investigator at the
Philadelphia offices of the Annenberg Public Policy Center, which
studies children's television, attributes the success of
``Pokemon'' to its savvy incorporation of many aspects of other hot
children's properties.
</P>
<P>
   It offers the morphing qualities of ``Power Rangers,'' the
concept of animal nurturing that has fostered children's hits since
``Lassie'' and ``Rin Tin Tin'' and the collectability of Beanie
Babies (with ``Pokemon'' toys and trading cards, children can
``catch 'em all'' along with Ash and his friends Brock and Misty).
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of series-related merchandise has been
especially helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have lots of products, and particularly products in
other media, you set up this kind of symbiotic relationship,''
Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   But although the ``Pokemon'' merchandise has fast become a
billion-dollar industry, the television program is only now
approaching profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend probably close to six figures a show,'' Mr. Kahn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the expense goes into Westernizing ``Pokemon.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the characters, as in most animi (the popular term for
Japanese animation), look generically Caucasian, the dialogue and
setting are steeped in Japanese culture.
</P>
<P>
   The American producers go through each episode frame by frame,
adapting the tone and remaking some of the characters'
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   James, one of the two human villains, is more flamboyant and
foppish than his slightly malevolent Japanese counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   He and Jessie, his female partner, have a catlike pokemon,
Meowth, who's a bit of a philosopher in Japan; here it speaks
Brooklynese, calling to mind Danny DeVito in one of his more
buffoonish bad-guy roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals and physical humor of each episode are the same, but
word for word we change it,'' Grossfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   With all this time and money going into ``Pokemon,'' is it
high-quality entertainment?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not say that `Pokemon' is particularly enriching for
children,'' Jordan says. ``But on the other hand, I don't worry
about it as much as, say, `Beast Wars,' `Batman' or `X-Men,''' all
animated series that she said emphasized violence.
</P>
<P>
   And while Jordan does see some favorable aspects to ``Pokemon''
_ the games and cards encourage reading and problem solving _ she's
not sure it has staying power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be peaking now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not if the producers can help it.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-September, Kids' WB is going to push the permanent
broadcast schedule to 12 times a week, seeking viewers before
school, after school and on weekends with a mix of old and new
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   A CD of ``Pokemon'' songs was recently released, and new Pokemon
Nintendo games are on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this a feature film (``Mewtwo Strikes Back,'' in
November), and you have a full-scale Pokemon attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a huge audience that is just getting into
it,'' Friedman says. ``A lot of kids who haven't seen it yet will
be able to have their own Pokemon training now, right from the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Gotta catch 'em all.

SEEKING HELP FOR THE DOLLAR SIDE OF DIVORCE

 World rights

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Susan Riffle's 22-year marriage ended, she realized she
needed help. Her attorney suggested she talk to a professional.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who understood money.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of no-fault divorces, a new financial expert has
evolved _ the certified divorce planner. There are 363 such
planners across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Riffle found Iva Hauck Girtman, a certified public accountant
who realized the need for documentation and projections during her
own messy divorce. Girtman, 51, is now a certified divorce planner
in Lakeland, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's been there, done that. She knew what I was going
through,'' says Riffle, a secretary and the mother of three
children. ''She knew how devastated I was and how lost I was to the
financial situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Girtman sorted through the Riffle's finances and worked them
into charts and graphs. She was organized and aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ''She gave me options and explained the options to me,'' Riffle
says. ''Then I would make the choice based on her information and
my attorney's information.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mars, a Bartow, Fla., divorce attorney, says a couple
with a low joint income and no children probably wouldn't need a
divorce planner, although they can be helpful in some divorces.
</P>
<P>
   ''With major divorce cases with tax implications and property
implications, there are just a great deal of financial
complications,'' Mars says. ''And a certified divorce planner would
be very useful in that type of case.''
</P>
<P>
   The planner's financial projections help in the long term as
well as the immediate future, Mars says.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute for Certified Divorce Planners in Boulder, Colo.,
was founded in 1986 by Carol Ann Wilson, a certified financial
planner who made divorce a specialty after counseling many women
who found their divorce settlements less than adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce planner courses, which rotate around the country, are
reserved for people with financial backgrounds _ meaning they must
understand ''defined benefits''and tax calculations. Most are
accountants, certified public accountants and certified financial
planners.
</P>
<P>
   Girtman was a CPA before she had three children. She became a
stay-at-home mom who put her energies into raising her family.
While she still did some work during tax season, her career
essentially was on hold.
</P>
<P>
   But when her marriage of 27 years ended four years ago, Girtman
found herself fighting for an equitable settlement. To help her
case, she graphed disputed credit card charges over five years to
show a consistent pattern of spending _ using her children's magic
markers to color in the data.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been said divorce is 70 percent finances, 20 percent
emotion and 10 percent legal,'' says Girtman, who has a master's of
business administration from the University of South Florida. ''And
I agree with it. When you think about it, with divorce, what you're
doing is boiling it down to who gets what.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer while surfing the Internet, Girtman learned of the
divorce planner seminars. She took the classes, got her
certification and began using software programs designed to project
proposed divorce settlements into retirement years.
</P>
<P>
   The number-crunching, which is based on conservative inflation
and investment increases, gives couples a better idea of what the
decisions they make today will mean later in life.
</P>
<P>
   ''Equal is not equitable,'' Girtman says.
</P>
<P>
   By that, Girtman means splitting assets down the middle may
sound fair _ but it can penalize the spouse with a lesser income
over time.
</P>
<P>
   Girtman, who charges $100 an hour, helps to make decisions based
on tax implications.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a couple were to split $100,000 in AT&AMP;T stock
and $100,000 in IBM stock, the concern would be the initial stock
cost. If the AT&AMP;T stock had cost $50,000 and the IBM had been
$80,000, then the tax would largely be based on the difference
between the initial cost and profit of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the client would be better served to take the IBM
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Girtman advises a person considering divorce to tuck some money
away first to help with temporary support. A court date can take
months. But, she cautions, never put money over safety if there is
an abusive situation.
</P>
<P>
   She reminds people in the middle of a divorce not to sign
anything without having a professional look over the paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're never going to come out of a divorce with what you went
in with,'' Girtman says. ''There's only one pie to cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, it can get particularly sticky.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, who asked that her name not be used, called on
Girtman during a divorce that involved a considerable amount of
money. A stay-at-home mom with two children, she wanted what she
believed she was entitled to.
</P>
<P>
   She sought the advice of a divorce planner ''not so much to take
advantage of my husband, but so he wouldn't take advantage of me,''
says the former corporate wife. ''Girtman tells me when I'm about
to do something stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is fighting over a big cash settlement. Many times
women want to keep the house to make the split easier on the
children.
</P>
<P>
   But even staying in the lovely, familiar home may have a
downside: Too little cash may be available for a woman supporting a
family if the bulk of the settlement consists of equity in a house.
</P>
<P>
   Girtman helps her clients reduce the sentiment surrounding the
family home to hard, cold fact: ''You can't buy groceries with
it.''

HAIR AND NAIL SALONS MAY SPREAD DEADLY VIRUSES
</HEADLINE>
  By CHARLES DOWNEY 
 c.1999 magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, when a woman sits down to have her fingernails manicured,
probably the last thing on her mind is catching a potentially
deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
   But back in 1965, a medical researcher looking for the source of
hepatitis B for a group of patients traced them all back to a
barber who unintentionally transmitted the virus by shaving them
with the same razor. The barber had used a disinfectant, but the
substance wasn't strong enough to kill all the germs.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are now asking if poorly trained cosmetologists and
barbers using dirty instruments could be unwittingly spreading
diseases such as AIDs, hepatitis B and C and viral infections.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas dermatologist, Shelly A. Sekula, M.D., has closely
looked into the sanitary practices of the cosmetology and barber
industry and found conditions lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Sanitation in nail and hair salons and barber shops is important
because medical researchers say 4 million Americans now have
hepatitis B. But 10 percent of those cases have no known cause.
Many hepatitis B patients later develop cirrhosis, liver failure
and even liver cancer and tragically pass the virus on to others,
including newborns.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers investigating hepatitis C cases say 30 percent of
patients have not shared needles with another illicit drug user _
the chief means of transmission.
</P>
<P>
   So where could the unexplained cases be coming from?
</P>
<P>
   ''Nail and hair salons may be a source of blood-borne as well as
other infectious diseases,'' says Dr. Sekula who practices in
Houston, Texas, and chairs the Legislation Committee for the Texas
Dermatological Society. ''There is good evidence that razors, nail
files, barber's scissors, tattoo needles, and body piercing
instruments are risk factors for transmitting hepatitis B and C.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sekula's interest began when she saw a patient with a
contagious fungal infection on her toes and feet. The patient
remarked that a pedicurist had only given her ''one little cut.''
</P>
<P>
   ''And the red warning flags went up,'' Dr. Sekula says. ''If I
were going into a nail salon, I would look for a photo license of
th operator. I would also ask about sterilization procedures and
would not permit an electric drill to be used on my nails. Nail
drills whir so fast they can easily penetrate the nail and cut
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Phoebe Rich, M.D., president of the Council for Nail
Disorders in Schaumburg, Ill.: ''There is a potential for the
spread of infection if the salon instruments are not properly cared
for.''
</P>
<P>
   The best sterilization methods are steam, ethylene oxide gas,
dry heat and chemical germicides.
</P>
<P>
   Anything that can draw blood _ nail nippers, cuticle scissors,
callus paring blades, reusable and straight razors _ should be
soaked in a chemical germicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, most states only require cosmetologists and barbers
to use a low-level hospital grade disinfectant _ which may or may
not kill all the microorganisms,'' Dr. Sekula says. ''To really be
safe, I suggest bringing your own instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there's another huge safety edge _ wearing latex
gloves _ although cosmetologist rarely use them.
</P>
<P>
   Why? If you sat down in a salon for a manicure or a pedicure and
the technician put on a pair of rubber gloves, you probably might
think she has some contagious condition.
</P>
<P>
   But actually, she would be protecting you from any ailments
suffered by the previous client. Many professionals _ health and
dental workers, emergency teams, firefighters, cops, correctional
officers and others _ routinely wear latex gloves because they are
using a technique known as ''universal precaution.'' That means
limiting the spread of blood diseases by assuming everybody's
blood, bodily fluids and tissues are at all times infectious.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) requires any worker at risk of contracting an infection to
wear gloves,'' Dr. Sekula says. ''But, curiously, OSHA regulations
leave it to employers and the various states to decide if workers
in the cosmetology and barber industries should wear gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a previous client in a salon may have an injury to
the cuticles, a cut in the nail folds or could have bled when
calluses were removed too deeply. A hair cutter could have
accidentally nicked the client. Customers could have had open areas
or cracks in their scalps. Crusts, scale and lice can attach to
combs and brushes and easily transmit infection or infestation to
the next unwitting patron.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a warning that barber scissors and razors contaminated
with blood can pass along the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
was sounded. A medical researcher found hepatitis C could be
transmitted on the straight razors commonly used in barbershops to
trim sideburns and necks. The researcher dunked razors from five
different barber shops into five commonly used sterilizing
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Results? None of the five solutions destroyed hepatitis C, even
thought some were soaked for six hours, 24 hours and seven days.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other research shows hepatitis B can survive outside the body
for seven days or more on chairs, headrests, workbenches,
instruments and tools,'' Dr. Sekula says. ''Hepatitis B is 100
times more contagious than the HIV virus.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta,
Ga., hepatitis B is now the United States' leading cause of liver
transplantation and the second leading cause of cirrhosis, after
alcohol. About 10,000 Americans will contract hepatitis B this year
with that number expected to triple over the next two decades.
Currently, the CDC says hepatitis B costs the United States $700
million yearly in lost work and health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Cuts, nicks and scrapes at the beauty salon or barber shop can
led to other less deadly conditions for both clients and shop
operators. Risks also include warts, bacterial and fungus
infections and reactions to various products and fumes.
</P>
<P>
   But, says Dr. Sekula, ''The risks would be virtually eliminated
if operators used disposable instruments, wore rubber gloves,
employed proper hand washing and used appropriate sterilization
techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   She would also like to see physicians appointed to the governing
boards in every state so the beauty industry could have the latest
health information.

GOV. BUSH AND CANDIDATE BUSH HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone needs to teach GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush
what the First Amendment means. As governor of Texas, he hasn't
paid much attention to free speech rights of Texas demonstrators,
the right to petition, or the religious liberty of those who live
in his state. Now that he seeks the highest elected office in the
land, he should be required to sign up for a course on the U.S.
Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Gov. Bush told the peaceful environmental
protesters demonstrating outside the governor's mansion, that ``the
rules have changed'' and ordered the protesters arrested. The
governor seems to think he can, by fiat, simply hack away ``the
right of the people to peaceably assemble and to petition the
government for a redress of grievances,'' to quote a portion of the
First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The public sidewalk outside the grounds of the Texas governor's
mansion has a long tradition of being a place for rallies, protests
and even press conferences. But in March, Gov. Bush ordered law
enforcement officials to warn protesters that they were subject to
arrest. In April, the police began arresting demonstrators. On at
least four occasions, citizen groups were arrested when they did
not disperse quickly enough to suit state police officers,
according to the American Civil Liberties lawsuit filed on behalf
of the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   These groups were protesting state policies that they think
encourage industrial pollution. They urged the passage of clean air
laws. Their lobbying efforts _ their right to petition the
government to correct the situation _ were abruptly ended by police
action. During this same period, clean air legislation lost by a
slim margin in the Texas Legislature. It is quite possible that the
governor's action stymied protesters' goal to educate Texas
legislators on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the demonstrators were arrested and held overnight and
then released without being charged _ as there was no violation of
any existing Texas law. They weren't blocking access to the
governor's mansion or causing a traffic safety hazard.
</P>
<P>
   More ominously, these demonstrators were warned they would be
arrested and jailed again if they continued in their protest.
Apparently, peaceful expression of opinion and criticism of the
governor's policies is not allowed in Texas _ under the
administration of Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called rule changes that Gov. Bush announced in April
have never been published or made public. They remain secret rules.
Anti-democratic rules. The ACLU complaint states: ``These hidden
rules that essentially give unlimited police discretion to exclude
and arrest critics, when they make criticism public, violate Texas
Constitutional rights to free speech, petition, equal protection,
due process, and freedom from unreasonable seizures.'' Not to
mention a violation of the U.S. Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Candidate Bush, author of ``compassionate conservatism,'' isn't
so compassionate to critics of his state's policies. His secret
rules are obviously designed to intimidate Texas citizens who
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine this man as president of the United States. Criticism of
the federal government is endemic to the American people. It's our
great strength as a nation. We all feel we have a right and even a
duty to debate public policy, proposed legislation and the path our
leaders take. We believe in the right to protest, criticize and
encourage change in polices we think are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The American people can even protest U.S. Supreme Court
decisions on the sidewalk in front of the court building. The same
is true of demonstrators in front of the White House, as long as
they are behind the concrete barricades. Would Bush seek to
``change the rules'' if he were president?
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush pushed for a school voucher law in Texas in his state
address in January. His voucher law would have used taxpayer money
to support religious private schools. Again, a violation of the
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court
has already held that taxpayers cannot be forced to support
religious institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the state Legislature is wiser than Bush and failed
to pass a voucher bill.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 2 in Los Angeles, candidate Bush said that schools
receiving Title I money _ those schools in the poorest
neighborhoods _ should no longer be federally funded if they can't
meet certain standards. The money instead would be given to the
parents to use to send their children to private schools. Private
schools include religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Legislature was wise enough not to buy Gov. Bush's
school voucher plan. And the American people are certainly savvy
enough not to buy candidate Bush's plan, either.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan, instead of trying to improve public schools in
poorer districts, strips Title I federal money from them and from
our children of poverty. It's an illusion foisted on the poor that
the tax dollars they would receive would be sufficient to send
their children to good private schools. In reality, the money they
would receive would be thousands of dollars too little each year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few decades, California has drained money and
resources from its public schools. The result has been to transform
one of the best public school systems in the nation into one of the
worst. Bush's remedy would only repeat California's tragic error
and spread it nationwide. And, let us not forget, it violates the
First Amendment, too.
</P>
<P>
   We should remember, this is the same presidential candidate who
has tried to stop all parodies of him, his candidacy and his
political stances on the World Wide Web. This is the same candidate
who said in a televised news conference, ``There ought to be limits
to freedom.'' His political track record in Texas, though short,
shows that his statement wasn't a gaffe, but truly reveals his
motivations and beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the man who wants to be the leader of the nation
which represents the world's great hope for liberty?

 &HT;    Georgia Tech harnesses technology for learning
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Gregory Abowd walks into a Georgia Tech classroom
to lecture these days, the fewer notes his students take, the
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a typical classroom, an instructor stands at a whiteboard,
speaking to the class and writing furiously,'' he said. ``Students
bury their heads in notebooks, trying to record every word of the
lecture, afraid they may miss something if they interact with the
instructor.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not the drill in Abowd's classes. And if the Tech method
continues to catch on, it may no longer be the routine in many
college classrooms across America.
</P>
<P>
   Abowd and a team of researchers at Tech have developed Classroom
2000, where technology is used to free students from the laborious
task of trying to write down every word of a lecture, so they
instead can participate in classroom discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This class is really helpful,'' said Keesah Green, 21, a
graduate student from Ohio. ``All of the information is available
immediately after class so you can focus more on what is going on
in class.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent Tech survey suggested students' note-taking techniques
were like those of a stenographer, aimed at capturing everything
the professor writes on the whiteboard, and often copying the exact
spoken words.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with electronic whiteboards, audio and video equipment,
computers and sophisticated software to capture the classroom
experience, the exact details of lectures are captured, to be
retrieved later in audio, video or written form. As the instructor
writes on the whiteboard, the information is projected onto a large
screen while simultaneously being input into a computer. Students
can access and review the notes later, at home or elsewhere, via
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of Classroom 2000 is to use existing technology to
aid students and instructors in doing their normal routine,'' said
Abowd, 34, an assistant professor in the College of Computing since
1994. ``I can (stop) people from hanging their heads down while
writing notes. Now they pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Human-Computer Interaction class, the blackboard of the
past has been replaced by a ``whiteboard,'' a giant computer screen
that projects Abowd's slides for the day's lesson. Chalk has gone
the way of the felt-tip pen.
</P>
<P>
   One recent Monday, about 30 students sat in class listening to a
lecture on computer innovators. Important names and dates were
mentioned throughout the lecture, but few of the students jotted
them down.
</P>
<P>
   After a lecture, all the elements are woven together into a set
of Web pages, indexed on the syllabus. A time line provides an
index to the audio, video, slides and Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   While viewing a slide, students can click on the instructor's
annotations to replay the audio and video at the time the note was
written. Students also can replay the entire lecture without any
interruptions, visit Web sites used in class, and conduct word
searches to find specific lecture segments covering a particular
topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is far more advanced than any classroom I have ever been
in,'' said Jennifer Sheridan. ``This is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech will offer 15 classes this semester using Classroom 2000.
All the classes are in the technical sciences _ math, computer
technology and electrical engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Abowd and senior doctoral student Jason Brotherton have built
two Classroom 2000s at Tech, and other institutions are taking
notice. Brotherton just returned from Rhode Island, where he
installed a similar classroom at Brown University. They have set up
two classrooms at Kennesaw State, one at Georgia State and another
at McGill University in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   At Kennesaw, where all the students are commuters, calculus
professor Meghan Burke said about two-thirds of her students are
using the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason that I brought it here is because I wanted a way to
record the notations that I write on the board and have my voice
associated with them,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   Burke doesn't use slides. Her whiteboard is used more like a
traditional blackboard, where she writes out each problem, which is
then fed into the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was called Classroom 2000 because we wanted to look at what
is the classroom of the near future going to look like,'' Burke
said. ``The idea that as a teacher I can walk in the classroom,
start writing and talking, and have that entire experience captured
_ and I haven't done anything different _ is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech spent about $200,000 to set up its classroom, but the price
could be as little as the $15,000 spent at Kennesaw, which already
had some of the infrastructure in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost is going to depend on what you already have,''
Brotherton said. He said Brown University basically had all the
audio and video equipment in place.
</P>
<P>
   Tech's classroom was supported by grants from several sources,
including the National Science Foundation and Tech's Office of
Information Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Because the project is so new, Abowd and Brotherton are still
gathering data about how effective Classroom 2000 can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to figure out what kind of impact that this is
going to have, but there are a lot of possibilities that we haven't
explored yet,'' Abowd said.

 &HT;    Hog's lard and chicken droppings: The stuff homemade cures are
made of
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ According to a crumbling paperback I found in
a box of stuff a neighbor was throwing out (The Standard
Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, F.M. Lupton, New York, November,
1896), baldness is curable. I thought you'd want to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two ounces of spirits of wine,'' the practicioner advises,
``steep two drachms of cantharides (pulverized) for a fortnight or
three weeks shaking it repeatedly during that time. Then filter it,
and rub up one-tenth of the tincture so procured, with nine-tenths
of cold hog's lard. Scent it with a few drops of any kind of
perfume, and rub it well into the head every morning and evening.''
</P>
<P>
   The only obstacles I can see to this cure might be finding a
drachm measure, figuring out what cantharides is so you can
pulverize some, and finding friends who don't mind hanging out with
a guy who smears lard on his head twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   But, there are alternatives. They come in my morning mail.
</P>
<P>
   Generous readers often take the time to share with me a few
hints of their own. I'll pass them on, but I make no guarantees
because it's a little tough to know when someone's pulling my leg
through the mail. You be the judge.
</P>
<P>
   An Illinois reader who apologizes for his broken English because
he's just visiting here from his home on the Baltic, swears his
cure for baldness has worked for half the male population of his
village. (Note: He does not name his hometown or give any clue to
exactly (SET ITAL)where(END ITAL) on the Baltic it might be. For
good reason, I'm sure, because after reading his remedy for hair
loss, I suspect he'd have his passport pulled and be stripped of
membership at the local Baltic equivalent of the Elks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men do not need to lose hair if they take precaution before
it's too late since this cure is not retroactive.'' All they need
do, he suggests, is put on clean socks each morning and fill their
shoes with fresh chicken droppings. He says it works far better if
the person under treatment is active all day like a floorwalker in
a department store rather than a streetcar conductor who just sits
on a stool and clangs his bell. He does suggest avoiding
restaurants and elevators until the cure is complete.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months ago, readers were clamoring for a cure for
the common cold so I thumbed the dog-eared little reference book
and found a few simple remedies based on pine pitch, borax, and
camphor spirits, which I happily shared.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the moment, a reader in Iowa wrote to offer his own:
``When I feel a cold coming on, I have my wife slather Vicks on the
bottoms of my feet. Then she puts some heavy socks on and brings me
the juice of three onions generously laced with peach schnappes in
my favorite cup.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear just who's wearing the heavy socks but the
writer swears that by morning he is sniffle-free.
</P>
<P>
   An Ohio reader thanks me for adding a little ``spice'' to her
life. ``I am 71 years old,'' she writes, ``and do not remember some
of the really old remedies. Every spring my father would talk of my
taking Epsom salts (inwardly). I believe this might have helped
acne, but my memory is not clear. I still use Epsom salts but only
as a soak for minor bites. I am not sure either if I ever really
took it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we used was `sheep dip' for minor cuts, etc. I was
expected to climb only one small tree, and not to take any chances.
There was no time for anyone to take me to the hospital. I never
had a broken bone. I was hurt on the school playground, but there
were never any x-rays considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that after I had scarlet fever all the items I
looked at were burned, including one of my favorite books. The
doctor made house calls then.''
</P>
<P>
   I too remember those days ... and those doctors _ mine brought
Juicy Fruit chewing gum.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, thanks for writing folks, and as a bonus, I have another
tip for you straight from the Cyclopaedia: ``People who chew plenty
of good beef and eschew pork are sensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming next week: A Lesson in Decorating: ``Choose a plain,
smooth red-clay flowerpot. If it is rather stupid-looking, all the
better. . . .''

 &HT;    Dog walkers sniff out the seasons
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Sometimes it takes a dog to sniff out
what's changing around you.
</P>
<P>
   The one I used helped me determine that summer might end. These
results are still inconclusive, but I suspect I'm onto something.
</P>
<P>
   Others use handier tools that smell better and don't chew the
carpet: calendars, planners or their awesome electronic
equivalents. Organized people who are attuned to their surroundings
manage to flip calendar pages over on the very first of the month.
They notice right away when lunch boxes are being stacked at the
supermarket entrance. A lot of us, though, are oblivious to our
surroundings and get our news in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   I get busy and the year slips out from under me. I am guilty of
riding the days the way the dog travels in the car: mouth open,
head out the window, thrilled at the ride but not noticing the
traffic pattern.
</P>
<P>
   This lifestyle is particularly tempting in Florida where the
seasons have been efficiently pared to two: air-conditioning
weather and sleeping weather.
</P>
<P>
   Air-conditioning weather explains itself. Sleeping weather is
so-called because there's something about getting out blankets that
makes folks rest cozier. It's a known fact. Sleeping weather
arrives when the night temperature dips a few notches below 70 for
the first time. Its arrival makes everyone happier. The morning
after, everyone I see looks a little more alert.
</P>
<P>
   We have not entered the sleeping-weather season. Nevertheless,
society seems determined to put an end to summer. We even have a
national holiday devoted to finishing off all thought of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Day has long ago ceased to celebrate anything about
working people except to mark the time of year when they should get
back to work.
</P>
<P>
   I am, by nature, deaf to all calls to go back to work. I never
take Labor Day's hint. This is not without its risks. You risk
missing autumn altogether if you don't look out for it. That's
where the dog comes in.
</P>
<P>
   The dog is an unplanned dog. I am still adjusting to the drill
of walking him in the morning and walking him in the evening. These
short strolls around the block have changed my life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as a dog walker, I have discovered the rhythms of the
neighborhood. Things I previously sensed only vaguely. I know which
houses are up for sale. I know that little kids are getting older.
I am warned by example just what mole crickets can do to a lawn. I
find all the garage sales and bought two fine and large beer mugs
for 50 cents. I am a census taker of loose dogs, barky fenced-in
dogs and dogs with owners who have schedules like mine.
</P>
<P>
   I watch the progress of the night sky's constellations, but only
the big, bright easy ones like Orion and the dipper part of Ursa
Major. On trash day, I know who is remodeling and the identities of
conscientious recyclers. I know which kids hold parties when their
parents are gone.
</P>
<P>
   Dog walkers see all. Dog walkers know all.
</P>
<P>
   If I were not a dog walker, I would ignore Labor Day. I would
still wear my summer jacket with white buttons. I would cruise
through September with a surf-dude's endless-summer grin. Instead,
I walked the dog out into the early morning and felt an unfamiliar
sensation. I was outdoors and I was not hot. It wasn't cool
exactly. But clearly I had stumbled upon a landmark day in the
Florida year _ the first non-hot day.
</P>
<P>
   The first non-hot day doesn't grab you the way a first snowfall
does, but it signals seasonal change with the same finality. The
first non-hot day is falling leaves, the first sprinkle of
instantly melted snow and the smell of the heater kicking on for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   When I feel it, I rush at summer things. I have heard the last
call before closing time and don't need another warning. Because I
am a dog walker, I'm privileged to get this information early,
while there's time to get to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Dog walkers are masters of the seasons. And we are there before
you when the good stuff is still lying around the garage sale.
Don't worry, though, I always leave the popcorn poppers for anyone
who might really need one.

 &HT;    Grape jelly bait lures away raccoons, puts smile on planter's
face
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIGER, Ga. _ My friend Coyl Justice, who grows some of the best
rhododendron and native azalea in North Georgia, couldn't wait to
tell me the news. No, it wasn't about plants; it was about catching
coons with grape jelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look here,'' he said, pointing to his grape arbor, ``my grapes
aren't 50 feet away, but those coons go straight for the jelly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``'Course I don't blame 'em,'' he added with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Justice and his wife Mildred love plants and critters, so
there's no worry about how the raccoons and possums will be treated
after they venture into the wire cage for a toast and jelly snack.
Justice gives them water out of a milk jug and takes them down the
road a few miles from his home. He sets them free in the woods,
careful not to send them off in the direction of his neighbors'
blueberries or grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Justice couldn't wait to share his jelly secret with John and me
because he knows we had our share of ``varmits'' sampling the
grapes last fall at our farm in Tiger. We even had a bear or two. I
told Justice about the ``bear scare'' contraption our electrician
friend Vaughn Ramey rigged up _ a combination of motion lights and
a radio set to blare forth simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   The grape jelly trick, Justice wanted to confess, wasn't his
idea _ and he wasn't advising it for bears. ``Russell Turpin down
at the feed store in Clayton is the one who told me,'' he said.
``'Course everybody already knows about catching groundhogs with
apples, but jelly's something else.''
</P>
<P>
   The groundhogs have attacked the zinnias this year. ``Some of my
neighbors are hoppin' mad about it,'' Justice said. He thinks grape
jelly will lure groundhogs, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Justices, who've lived in the area 40 years, manage Betty's
Creek Tree Farm, a nursery that attracts old timers and newcomers
alike. But their pride and joy is the native azalea and
rhododendron they grow in the greenhouses beside their home. They
sell them at their own smaller Big Creek Nursery, but the joy's in
nurturing them.
</P>
<P>
   Looking over hundreds of seedlings in tiny pots, Justice can't
wait for spring. ``What's exciting is when people come see the
blooms,'' he said. ``To me, it's an accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Mildred remembers when Coyl started growing the native plants
from seed. He'd put them in clear plastic shoe boxes with some peat
moss. Then he'd slide the boxes up on top of the drape cornices in
her dining room. That would get them the right amount of heat and
air to germinate.
</P>
<P>
   The plants are all in greenhouses now, but the Justices still
lift each fragile seedling into its individual pot, using a
toothpick or a nail.
</P>
<P>
   Justice marvels at how everybody seems to want so many plants in
their yard today. ``If you turn around twice,'' he said, ``seems
like you're near covered up with plants.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers when grass was ``a no-no.'' His mama took pride in
sweeping the dirt yard he played in as a kid. She pulled out every
blade of green. But from her he learned to love flowers. She
planted beds of them _ which her husband inevitably cut down. ``All
he cared about was his dogs and chickens, it seemed like,'' Coyl
recalled. ``I watched my mama fret, and I guess it impressed me
what all she went through just to have a few flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justices, whose grandchildren help them run the tree farm,
wouldn't want to do anything else or live anywhere else. Coyl
savors the view of his favorite mountain, ``Pickens Nose.'' The
couple's best friends are those who go to the small Baptist church
nearby, which Coyle says is ``the most lovable place you can
find.'' He's taught a young adult class there ``forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mildred says the young adults never want to leave Justice's
class. ``We've got 'em 17 to 40 now,'' she said with a laugh.
Whatever age, Coyl said, ``It's hard to beat the people up here.''

 &HT;    Koresh's deeds are there to read in the DNA
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Like a flame not controlled, events at Mount
Carmel were a local story that became a national story that became
an international story.
</P>
<P>
   They were events out in the sticks, near Elk, that singed the
city of Waco, and then the city of Washington, and caused people
around the world to have to turn from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   But it all started with a local story.
</P>
<P>
   That story was suspected child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there were more questions about the Branch Davidians _
about weapons, about suspected scam marriages _ but what was
happening to children at Mount Carmel is what caused some former
Davidians to go from audience to audience, including local and
federal law enforcement, and finally this newspaper, to get someone
to take the matter seriously.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't just vague suspicion. It was testimony in a child
custody hearing.
</P>
<P>
   With all the questions about the events at Mount Carmel: Who
fired when? Who fired what? Who started the fire? There is
absolutely no question now about the central issue that drew the
attention of Waco Tribune-Herald reporters Mark England and Darlene
McCormick to the case: child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   David Koresh, claiming that all the world's women were his, was
marking them off by bedding and in several cases impregnating
under-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, maddeningly, commentaries by some of the
best in our business, as with the half-cocked crowd with Internet
connections, contain the assertion that law enforcement had no
evidence of child abuse in February 1993. Maybe it depends on their
definition of abuse, or of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   If it's anecdotal evidence that proves sufficient, Kiri Jewell
provided it.
</P>
<P>
   A Michigan child custody case concerning her was the first time
questions about child abuse by Koresh were raised on the record.
The court removed her from the Branch Davidian community where her
mother remained. Kiri later testified to Congress, as she did on
``Donahue'' and in the press. She said that at age 10 she'd been
molested by Koresh. Not only that, he had shown her and others how
to stick a gun in their mouths if events called for suicide.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the investigation by local state social workers
into suspected child abuse, the state had only that story to rely
on.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, maddeningly, the state's investigation into child abuse
had made no progress when federal authorities got involved at the
request of the McLennan County sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   The feds used illegal weapons as the pretext for a raid that
couldn't have been botched worse. Later they cooked up a pretext of
illegal drugs. It had no apparent merit, but brought military
forces into the equation as the subsequent standoff dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   The ATF blew it. The FBI blew it. But first of all this was a
local story _ an inability or unwillingness by local authorities to
address a clear and present danger: that David Koresh was making
babies with children far too young to give legal consent, much less
understand the term.
</P>
<P>
   Read the DNA and weep. Tests on the fire victims showed that
Koresh had sired between 13 and 15 children, some with under-age
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   An offense worthy of the death penalty? Of course not. Everyone
should have walked out of Mount Carmel alive. Everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Koresh should have, could have, been arrested away from Mount
Carmel on any of the pretexts law enforcement had for its raid in
the first place. Of all the whoppers told, one of the biggest was
the ATF's assertion that Koresh wasn't away from Mount Carmel for
weeks preceding the raid. Absolutely false. A monster lie, quickly
exposed by this newspaper's reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But you know what? Another monster lie is being perpetrated
about the events that should have interested everyone in David
Koresh. The truth is in the DNA.

 &HT;    Videos: Inexpensive, easy-to-use editing technology available
 &HT;    By Goutami Hyma Mikkilineni
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Remember being forced to watch Dad's home videos of
his and Mom's second honeymoon to Hawaii? It wouldn't have been so
bad if you actually got to see the gorgeous volcanoes, sparkling
water and cute surfers instead of Dad's shoes, the back of Mom's
head and all those fuzzy images that came into focus as soon as the
shot changed.
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame Dad. You can't expect him to be a professional
cameraman.
</P>
<P>
   People who are still forcing viewers to sit through shaky
pictures, shots of everyone's shoes and curses from an
inexperienced cameraman may think that Hollywood filmmakers with
high-tech (and high-priced) equipment are the only ones who can
produce a neatly edited video.
</P>
<P>
   With existing technology and a little patience, you can become
an accomplished amateur filmmaker and spare your viewers headaches
and boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, video editing is here for the masses. In fact, many of the
options have been on the market for years. By the time you finish
reading this, you'll have a step-by-step guide on how to edit.
You'll know how much to spend and where you can find the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the notion that editing has to cost a lot of money. The
cheapest and simplest way takes no more than the equipment you
already own: your VCR and video camera. Using this method, you can
cut and rearrange your footage to your liking.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how:
</P>
<P>
   Just as you would record something from broadcast television,
you simply hook the camera to the VCR through the input slot. When
you find the first footage you want to run, hit pause, then get the
recorder ready. Hit record, then press play on the camera. Anyone
who has taped another tape or taped off the television already
knows how to edit this way. It just might not have occurred to you
that you could or should improve the overall look of your home
video.
</P>
<P>
   When you press record, the VCR automatically rewinds a few
seconds on the tape, stops, then begins recording. If you're not
careful, you could tape over the last few seconds of the tape you
are making. To avoid this, after you stop recording, fast forward
just a few seconds. Watch your timer _ 5-6 seconds will suffice.
Then, you can safely record the next section of footage without
taping over the last portion of the videotape. Editing this way
allows you to cut out sections of your home videos that are
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   To take full advantage of this method, take a few extra seconds
of your image when you are shooting with your camcorder. That way,
you have some more options of what to put on your final tape,
without losing precious images.
</P>
<P>
   Also, each shot should at least be 10 seconds long to give you
enough to work with during the editing process. This method also
allows you to choose the order of the footage.
</P>
<P>
   And you have the option of using various source tapes to create
a single new video. If you wanted to compile footage of all of
baby's firsts, you can use old tapes of her first crawl, then add
the tape of her first steps and finally edit in her first words. A
tape of all these events can be a nice holiday gift for the
grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is the easiest way to edit and requires no extra
equipment, it offers the fewest options. You can still create
amateurish home videos this way if the camera operator makes a lot
of mistakes. The biggest drawback is that your viewers will see an
obvious break in your footage at the spots where you cut and added
other footage. Sound editing can be messy, if not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to do a better job, a number of affordable options
are just as simple but allow for a little more human error when it
comes to shooting.
</P>
<P>
   You have two choices: Use special editing boards, or, since you
probably already have a home computer, you may have most of what
you need for the next method of editing.
</P>
<P>
   Since the personal computer has replaced the dog and the diamond
as man and woman's best friend, many people are probably aware that
their PC can help them with their photography and other graphics.
</P>
<P>
   What most people don't know is that computers can also edit
moving-picture photography, i.e., home videos.
</P>
<P>
   Many software packages are out there, available at any large
software store. These programs allow you to feed your videotape
into the computer and do everything from rearranging footage to
adding characters, animation, music and narration as well as using
special effects.
</P>
<P>
   Two programs for PC owners, Video Wave and VideoStudio, are
relatively inexpensive at $100 and allow you all the editing
options various editing boards provide. An added advantage is the
chance to add animation to your tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Apple owners can take advantage of Final Cut, a program modeled
after the AVID program that professionals use. It, too, falls into
a reasonable price range.
</P>
<P>
   In order to use this software, the more memory and speed your
computer has, the better. Although the minimum requirements are a
166-megahertz processor and 16 megabytes of RAM, you really need
more. It's best to have 32 megabytes of RAM and a 200-megahertz
processor. In addition to sufficient hard drive capacity, a special
video card is necessary to feed the video from your VCR or camera
into the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Digital video cameras are causing a stir with camera buyers,
which brings us to new technology for editing. Everything mentioned
has been out there for years, but now camera operators are faced
with a new option.
</P>
<P>
   Digital cameras do have better-quality resolution, and the
footage, after being put through the editing process, comes out
cleaner, says David Armstrong of Wolf Camera video sales. Digital
video is more popular than the high-eight format because it yields
a finished product with the look of film. Professionals are
attracted to digital video because of this quality and its
lower-than-film price tag.
</P>
<P>
   However, high-eight still offers good quality, and editing with
either tape has the same requirements and options. The equipment is
the same. Digital cameras also allow you to take a still picture
from your footage.
</P>
<P>
   For technophobes, or those who don't have adequate computers to
run the programs, other options exist. Editing boards sell for $100
to $1,000 at stores that sell video cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Editing boards sit between your VCR and camera. The board
contains the technology to produce a series of effects that can
alter the footage in the camera before it goes to the final tape.
You can watch the editing process on your TV.
</P>
<P>
   Editing boards come in different varieties.
</P>
<P>
   A character generator allows you to write titles, dates and
other symbols onto a screen. You can even add film credits to your
home video. The board looks just like a computer keyboard and is
just as easy to use. The catch: All it does is add numbers, letters
and symbols in various colors and fonts to your footage, and it's
pretty expensive for just that (around $799 by Videonics or $200 by
Sima).
</P>
<P>
   Special effects generators are a more useful type of editing
board because they have a lot of options, not just character
capabilities. Not only can you cut and paste footage as when you
use two VCRs, you can do fades, wipes, slow motion and instant
replays. It is possible to fade the picture and sound into darkness
or bring them both into light.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of options to play around with. Upscale
character generators (like the Videonics MX1 Digital Video Mixer
for $1,000) let you edit from four sources at one time. You can put
a smaller screen within a screen, make small images get bigger,
reverse images, and zoom in and out of images. There are about 250
effects. Also, the quality is as close to professional as you can
get without spending $100,000 or so for equipment.
</P>
<P>
   If the $1,000 price tag is too much for you, don't get
discouraged. Sima makes a special effects generator that will allow
you to do many of the effects that the MX1 does. You can still
fade, do wipes and have dissolves. Pictures within pictures and
smaller images within bigger images are exclusive to the $1,000
price range. But the Sima SFII costs just $200, and your video will
have a professional finish. There are enough effects on the Sima
board to keep the average home videographer busy.
</P>
<P>
   Even more basic than the SFII is the Edit Master by Sima ($149),
which allows you to cut and paste footage as well as add sound.
Keep in mind an editing board is an extra piece of equipment, and
the editing process can be time-consuming..
</P>
<P>
   As you make lists of the equipment that you'd like, don't lose
sight of the fact that the person behind the camera determines the
standard of the video. For some tips, check out Sima Products' Web
site at www.simacorp.com. It offers a section with tips for the
home video maker.
</P>
<P>
   Even for those who merely want to document life with a video
camera, good editing is worthwhile. Your eyes and your audience
will thank you. Who knows, maybe you'll win an Oscar. Just don't
forget to mention me in your acceptance speech.

 &HT;    Preparation, a slow hand needed to handle PC's innards
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sooner or later, with trembling fingers, you'll open
up your PC to work on its innards.
</P>
<P>
   I had a friend _ a physician _ who could deal with
life-and-death situations without a quiver. But the very idea of
taking the top off her PC was so frightening that simply thinking
of such of a thing gave her anxiety dreams.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know when your day will come. Perhaps you'll want to add
memory or swap hard disks or even do something as simple as change
an internal modem. But I promise it will come.
</P>
<P>
   Just as hospitals sometimes guide a patient through the steps
that will take place before an operation, today we'll take a little
tour _ think of it as an insider's view to a computer. Along the
way, you'll learn a few things that will make the process easier
and less frightening.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a single standard way to open the case of your
computer. On those tall skinny tower cases, there's usually an
access plate on the side. On regular desktop cases, the top usually
slides back and off. Check your computer manual to find out how
your PC's case opens.
</P>
<P>
   My first hint sounds painfully simple, but someday you may thank
me for it. When you remove the screws to open the case, put them in
a small container well away from the working area. I don't know how
many computers I've owned, but I can't think of a single one that
survived with a full complement of screws. Sure, I eventually found
them. I knew I had because I could hear the vacuum cleaner rattle
as it sucked them out of the carpet.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing to remember when working inside a computer is
that static electricity _ even in amounts too small to notice _ can
kill memory chips and microprocessor chips. Since many of us keep a
computer in a room with a carpeted floor, it's easy to build up a
static charge. Before you touch anything _ those new memory chips
or the innards of your PC _ touch the chassis to ground yourself.
If you really worry about static electricity (and that isn't a
crazy thing), go to any electronics supply house and ask for a
grounding strap. You wear it on your wrist, and it prevents static
electricity buildup.
</P>
<P>
   Shock of a different kind also is a component killer. That's the
shock that comes when something hits the floor. Dropping a chip or
a card that contains chips won't necessarily ruin it. But it could.
So handle with care.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have the cover off and are ready to install your new
component, you'll notice a strange compulsion almost universal
among those who are new to working on computers. You'll feel an
overwhelming compulsion to rush. To grab the danged thing, shove it
into its proper place and then get the top on ... as if you got
extra points for speed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, once the case is open, review the instructions for
putting in the part. Then _ without touching anything _ take a
close look at where the part will go. If something doesn't make
sense, after seeing where the chip or the card will go, stop right
there. While being inventive and spontaneous may work just fine in
your personal life, it's not such a great idea while working on
gadgets. If you're confused and try to force something, the odds
are that it will break. So, if you're confused before you start,
call tech support for the company that makes the chip or gadget and
get advice now.
</P>
<P>
   For most small upgrades, the task is fairly straightforward. But
there are times _ when replacing a CD-ROM drive, or adding a hard
disk, and certainly when replacing a motherboard _ when you can
forget which connection goes where, or which side of the connector
is up. Sometimes it is a good idea to make a sketch, showing where
the connectors go, before you remove them from the old gadget. Even
if you never refer to the sketch again, just the process of
creating it will help you remember.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember that PCs are complicated beasts but _ as far
as the kind of upgrades the home user might do _ really simple to
work on. Everything snaps together like Lego blocks.

 &HT;    Bypassing the mall an individual cosmetic decision
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Buying makeup would seem to be the one thing you just
cannot do on the Internet. Lipstick with names like Russian Red,
Viva Glam or Sheer Plum may sound enticing, but until you slap a
stripe across your wrist, there's no way of telling if it will make
you look sensual or silly.
</P>
<P>
   Makeup looks different on different people. Once, a very peeved
saleswoman at the Chanel counter at Saks Fifth Avenue practically
reached across the counter to smack my friend Janet because the red
tones absolutely refused to stay red and turned a bizarre shade of
orange when Janet tried them on.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is my friend Linda, who is allergic to certain kinds
of perfume. She can't breathe and her eyes start to water when she
smells certain scents.
</P>
<P>
   These women are not weird. Makeup has an individual look and
feel on everyone who wears it. Cosmetic companies know this and are
trying with some success to develop Web sites that evoke a brand,
an image and a color selection women might actually want to go out
and buy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most sites warn customers what you see isn't always what
you'll get. The colors on the monitor may not be the same colors
you'll find in the mall. Online ordering is available from
companies, but the process is clunky and prices are often higher
than you'd find in many stores. Lipsticks recently for sale online
at one site cost $14 plus tax and shipping but were only $12 plus
tax at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   The main focus for most cosmetic sites is not shopping but
increasing brand awareness and image and teaching consumers about
their products.
</P>
<P>
   A growing trend for makeup sites is to give users an interactive
consultation. The notion of letting customers play with colors
keyed to their skin tone was pioneered by Cover Girl several years
ago. Cover Girl (www.covergirl.com) originally asked users to try
out eye shadows and lipsticks on the virtual faces of supermodels
such as Tyra Banks.
</P>
<P>
   But most women quickly found out that while most anything looks
good on Tyra, the average Web-surfing woman isn't so lucky. To its
credit, Cover Girl's site now lets women choose makeup, not only
according to their coloring, but other factors as well, including
lifestyle and personality.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, the British-based Body Shop (www.bodyshop.com)
devoted most of its Web site to a brand-awareness campaign that
stressed its political activism, detailed the company's
no-animal-testing policy and documented how Body Shop products help
people in Third World countries. It was a great branding strategy
but offered almost no information about its products, let alone
where to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   But the Body Shop site has grown up. While it still touts the
company's environmental and political activities, it now offers the
interactive features Cover Girl uses.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, the Urban Decay site (www.urbandecay.com) was
all about weird poetry, lists of places to kiss and
not-too-realistic representations of its offbeat but very wearable
lipstick, eye shadow and nail polish.
</P>
<P>
   The list of places to kiss is still there, but so are several
key improvements, including detailed text descriptions of what
colors like ``manic depressive,'' ``roach'' and ``AC/DC'' are
supposed to look like. Online ordering is available but stops you
before you enter your credit card number to tease you into buying
something else. While this may work at the makeup counter, it's
just time-consuming and crass on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   With all its drawbacks, shopping online may be the only
alternative for fashion mavens who must have the latest colors no
matter what, but it's the rare woman who wears only one company's
products.
</P>
<P>
   Sites like Eve.com offer a good selection of cult brands like
BeneFit and Philosophy that turn up in all the magazines but are
often hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   With a variety of products, tips and hints, Eve is a good bet if
you know what you want and what you like and just want to stock up
on your favorites.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that makeup aggregators like Eve.com will be the real
Web winners in this difficult online category.

 &HT;    Feedback on `Solitaire' reveals individual players' preferences
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No column I've written since the one years ago
bad-mouthing the Macintosh has drawn so much response as the recent
one about Microsoft's ``Solitaire'' game, and it was delightful.
</P>
<P>
   So delightful, in fact, that I want to share some of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bunny'' scoffed at my disdain for players who turn one card at
a time. ``I challenge you to score 8634/Time 88,'' she boasted.
</P>
<P>
   Score? Bunny, it matters not whether you win or lose, but how
you play the game.
</P>
<P>
   A wonderful woman who persisted in calling herself a ``little
old lady'' didn't even know she had a ``Solitaire'' game in her
computer and wanted to know how to find it. You ought to try typing
out the entire route from the desktop to ``Solitaire.'' It's easy
to do mouse-wise, but the written directions look something like
the procedure for launching an ICBM.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the lady found her ``Solitaire'' game and at last
report was well immersed in it.
</P>
<P>
   A man named George, who at the age of 80 is teaching computers
at a senior center, insists we can do better than Windows
``Solitaire.''
</P>
<P>
   He prefers one which, he says, ``I downloaded four years ago
when it had only 150 games and paid $25 for the program. It has
been upgraded at no additional cost and is now at 300 games. It is
flexible and allows you to select how it is to be played, i.e., you
can elect to take back a move you didn't like. One- or three-card
draws and many more. It keeps track of your play and will tell you
your percent of wins for any of the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs nothing to download, will let you play for 30 days
and then turns you off if you don't send $29 in, but you get a good
try. The name is: `Pretty Good Solitaire' with a Web site at
www.goodsol.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site is most interesting. You can enter your own games,
talk to others interested or get in competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, George, that sounds very good. I haven't looked at it yet,
but there's no reason why someone couldn't make a better solitaire
game than the one Windows provides. Windows does provide many of
the game play variations you describe. But a young fellow of a mere
72 years has the key to my preference:
</P>
<P>
   ``RIGHT ON, JACK!!'' he begins. ``The Windows `Solitaire' has
given me endless hours of enjoyment and I agree with you; the
graphics are great. There is one other solitaire game similar to
this one that I obtained from some software, and the one advantage
is that you only have to click your mouse to move a card to another
pile; but the graphics leave much to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I also like about the Windows version is that it is
large enough for these old eyes to see.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it. We don't have to put our nose to the screen
to tell one card from another.
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur, who must be a youngster since he doesn't provide an age,
reports that, ``I too like Microsoft's `Solitaire.' (Of course, you
can only trust me half the time as I many times turn one card at a
time.) People look at me like I am crazy because I reject `Doom,'
`Quake,' etc., etc. I like the quickness of `Solitaire' _ of
course, it is even quicker when I select the draw-three option and
lose. I have never had a problem running `Solitaire.' I only have
two complaints about Microsoft's `Solitaire': The green background
cannot be easily changed, and moving exposed cards from a pile does
not automatically turn the next card.''
</P>
<P>
   No accounting for taste. It never occurred to me to change the
green background, and games that automatically turn the next card
bother me. It ruins the suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne writes that he's got a problem with the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden it would no longer open. I let it go after a
few attempts. I had to format my system due to various problems.
After I once again entered Windows 98, I thought I could try the
solitaire again. No luck, it would not open even with the system
entered anew. Have you run into any problems such as this with your
system?''
</P>
<P>
   No, but nothing surprises me _ except that reformatting the
drive and re-installing Windows should have cured it. Somebody out
there ought to be able to help, though. If anyone has a solution,
let me know and I'll pass it on to Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have room for all the nice responses, but let me finish
with the brief e-mail from Sue, who sums it up for all of us
computer cabbages:
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the game `Solitaire' because it is a great stress
reliever. I can play a game of `Solitaire' and forget everything
but the game.''

 &HT;    Just a name needed to find long-lost friend
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the average, Americans move once every four years.
The days of staying in one place _ of a real hometown _ seem to be
slipping away. If you're like most folks, you've lost touch with
some people who were once important parts of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Now that more and more of us are online, the Web and the
Internet have become a great people locator. Today we'll look at
some of the ways you can use the Web to find lost friends and
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with an obvious and easy way _ the Web-based
directories for phone numbers and e-mail addresses. Two of my
favorites are Switchboard (www.switchboard.com) and Bigfoot
(www.bigfoot.com). Using either directory is so simple that
directions really aren't required. Just enter the name and as much
address information as you know.
</P>
<P>
   If you know the city, that sure makes things easy, but you can
do searches with just the state and the last name filled. But when
I tried the search without designating a state or first name _ even
with a name as unusual as ``Husted'' _ I got nearly 200 hits. If
your friend is named ``Smith'' or ``Williams'' you'd just be flat
out of luck if you can't at least supply a state.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be able to find telephone numbers and e-mail addresses
using either search engine. Since these lists aren't universal, try
several if the first one doesn't list your friend.
</P>
<P>
   You may get a list of several people with the same name.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you're not sure which person is your friend, you'll need
to send e-mail to all of them, explaining your search. That's a lot
less intrusive than a phone call and is, of course, free.
</P>
<P>
   Another good way to find someone is by using a general purpose
Web search engine. For searches like this, I prefer AltaVista
(www.altavista.com), since it seems to be more thorough than some
of the others. On AltaVista, you'd simply use the name as the
search words. So, if you were looking for me, you could type in
``+Bill +Husted'' ... the plus signs would tell AltaVista that both
words must be found on the page. Not all search engines use the
same methods, but you'll find a help button on any of them that
explains how to set up a search.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in my case, I have a personal Web page and my columns
appear in several newspapers and also on some Web sites. So that
would be an easy search. But even if the person you are searching
for isn't as publicly visible, you'd be surprised at how effective
this search method is at finding someone.
</P>
<P>
   Even if your long-lost friend doesn't have a Web page, chances
are that he or she has left some tracks on the Web. For instance,
some Web pages have guest books that visitors sign; a friend of
your friend may mention them on a Web page; or your friend's
company or school may include the name on a Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Another place to try _ and it's especially helpful when you
don't know the married name of an old friend _ is a Web site called
Classmates.Com. It has compiled lists of school classmates, listed
by the graduation year. Even if your friend isn't listed, you can
correspond with other classmates and perhaps find the name and
address of your friend.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously there are more sophisticated ways to search on the
Web. Most of these more sophisticated search sites charge a fee,
and some are basically detective agencies. We'll leave those sites
for another day.

 &HT;    New niche magazine Sony Style covers what's chic in the world of
high tech
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You know technology has become chic when it gets its
own style magazine. That's what happened with the launch of Sony
Style. The premiere issue features stories about how celebrities
incorporate digital gizmos into their lives. Fashion designer Diane
Von Furstenberg, for example, explains how she designed a ``life
vest'' for the wired woman. The vest includes pockets for a cell
phone, MiniDisc player and camcorder, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Internet Life dedicates its September issue to how people
use the Internet. You'll find articles about the Net's impact on
ordinary people and a discussion of whether blacks and Latinos are
being left behind by the rapid growth of the Web. There are also
snapshots of Web use across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if you could hold every issue of Mad magazine ever
published in the palm of your hand. Well, this is no longer
fantasy. Broderbund has published a collection of the magazines on
seven computer CDs. The set, called ``Totally Mad,'' features 50
years of back issues. The collection is available only for PCs with
Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   The Web is a great place to research your family tree. One of
the better sites for geneaological searches is Ancestry.com. The
site includes a massive index of some 240 million names. There are
also more than 1,600 searchable archives from a host of public
archives. This depth of resources comes at a price: $59.95 a year,
to be precise. But the site also makes a limited amount of its
database free. You'll find the site at www

   .ancestry.com.

 &HT;    Plenty of top-quality, discontinued software available for free
on Web
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a wonderful trend under way on the Internet
that you might want to check out. Developers are posting
discontinued commercial Mac software. It's free for the
downloading.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't shareware. It's stuff like WordPerfect, at one time
the leading contender to Word.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that these programs are no longer supported, so
you can't expect any technical help. Nor will there be any
upgrades. You'll have to live with the programs' bugs and glitches.
</P>
<P>
   That said, much of what's available is a great deal. Take
WordPerfect, which Corel has decided to no longer develop for the
Mac. That's a shame, because this was a very good word processor.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can have this program for free. It offers 90 percent of
the features you'll find in Word.
</P>
<P>
   WordPerfect has such automated features as sentence
capitalization and correction of common misspellings. It also has
strong layout and design features. You'll find WordPerfect at
www.corel.com/products/macintosh/wpmac35/packfreedownload.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Another free word processor available online is version 4.1.6 of
Nisus Writer.
</P>
<P>
   Nisus Writer is a bit more obscure than WordPerfect, but it's
still an excellent program. Nisus Writer includes features still
incorporated in any word processor, Mac or PC. You'll find this
program at www.nisus.com/news/pr/980925.asp.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Nisus Writer doesn't have is an outliner. Now you can
find a great one for free. It's called More and, although it was
discontinued several years ago, many observers still consider the
program the best of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   More was developed by famed programmer Dave Winer, who has
regained the rights and posted the program online. You'll find More
3.1 at www.outliners
</P>
<P>
   .com/more31.html.
</P>
<P>
   More, Nisus Writer and WordPerfect are just a few examples of
what you can now find online. There are plenty of other programs
out there.

just a few years ago. Parents, educators and merchants say the

retail world this fall is the new line of clothing by hot designer
Tommy Hilfiger aimed specifically at girls 6 to 12 that is, by all
accounts, evaporating off store shelves. Donna Karan's
fashion-forward kids line, now a year old, is also going like

 &HT;    Site offers boorish men a way to say `I'm sorry'
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Are you cursed with a tendency toward moronic behavior
in your relationships and an inability to explain yourself out of
predicaments?
</P>
<P>
   A site called Mark's Apology Note Generator, net.indra.com
</P>
<P>
   /(tilde)karma/formletter.html, is a kind of do-it yourself
doghouse-extraction letter-creator geared toward idiotic men.
</P>
<P>
   Using multiple-choice phrases on pull-down menus, the site
creates an apology letter that can be e-mailed to a wife or
girlfriend for free. (Warning: Skip the link to the women's site.
The language is offensive, and content is meager in comparison.)
</P>
<P>
   The site is included in the September issue of Yahoo Internet
Life magazine's roundup of Incredibly Useful Sites.
</P>
<P>
   The cover story takes an interesting look at how Americans use
the Internet. The story includes a feature on the Web habits of
``regular'' people, including a Pez collector, a biker and a sports
fan.
</P>
<P>
   The story is sprinkled with interesting statistics: half of 1
percent of people who visit Web sites actually click on the
advertisements, and Wednesday is the day most people shop online.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Of the 100.9 million Americans with Internet access, 52
percent are male and 48 percent are female, 80 percent are
Caucasian and 68 percent are older than 40.
</P>
<P>
   America ranks fifth in the world by number of users per capita.
Iceland leads the pack with 320.9 users per 1,000, followed by
Finland, Norway and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Latin-flavored music rumbas onto Web
</P>
<P>
   First came the Summer of Ricky. Now Latin music is staking a
solid claim on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.eritmo.com, will be available to the public
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It features live chats with Latin musicians, fan clubs and pages
devoted to the artists.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the evolving crossover appeal of Latin music,
highlighted by the success of Ricky Martin's CD this summer, the
site's content will be available in English, Spanish and, later
this year, Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and board members include Roland Hernandez, chairman
of Telemundo Group; Michael H. Jordan, former chairman of CBS
Television; and Derek Reisfield, former president of new media for
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Reisfield helped create CBS MarketWatch.com and CBS
SportsLine.com.
</P>
<P>
   The site will be divided into six areas: news; music, which will
include samples and songs that can be downloaded; fans, which will
include links to fan-club sites; chat; concerts, which will include
live Webcasts for concerts, reviews, video archives, schedules and
the ability to buy concert tickets; and videos.
</P>
<P>
   The site will be free to visitors. It will make money from
advertising, promotions and by selling music, merchandise and
concert tickets.

   Camcorder fits in your palm
</P>
<P>
   Sharp Electronics' new digital camcorder fits in your palm and
sells for less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The VL-SD20U comes with a 3-inch color LCD screen. The device is
6.4 inches wide, 3.8 inches high and 2.9 inches deep and weighs
1.21 pounds without its battery pack and cassette.
</P>
<P>
   The camcorder also has a feature, called Digital Gamma
Brightness Correction, that darkens the background light of any
image and makes the subject brighter.
</P>
<P>
   The image screen has 660,000 CCD pixels and up to 50 lines of
clear image reproduction. It also lets the user capture still
images and transfer them to a PC, TV or VCR.
</P>
<P>
   The camcorder has an optional PC Connection kit, which sells for
$129, that lets users transfer images to a PC to edit, process and
customize. The connection package includes PixLab Browser software,
PhotoSuite 8.0 and a cable. The PhotoSuite software lets you
manipulate the images using more than 20 filters.

   High-tech Holidays
</P>
<P>
   During the next two weeks, Jews across the world will celebrate
their High Holidays. Rosh Hashana is a two-day holiday for the
Jewish New Year beginning Friday. The following week, on Sept. 19,
beginning at sundown Jews will fast on Yom Kippur, the Day of
Atonement. On this day, Jews ask forgiveness for wrongdoings and
think about ways to improve. Click around the Jewish Children's
Learning Resource Web site at www.akhlah.com to learn about the
traditions and blessings for these holidays. You'll also find facts
on Israel, Hebrew words and coloring pages. _ Anne Y. Meyers

 &HT;    Time running out on Beanies
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Breathe deeply, and don't panic. We have some bad
news.
</P>
<P>
   The company that makes Beanie Babies announced last week it's
retiring the entire line of stuffed toys on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   But there is some good news. Toy industry experts don't believe
Ty Inc. will stop producing the profitable toys completely. ``The
backlash from Beanie collectors, people who really invested a lot
to build their collections, would be huge,'' said Chris Byrne, a
consultant and editor of the Toy Report.
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested that the message posted on the company's
Internet site is a marketing gimmick to raise prices of the older
Beanies and prepare buyers for a new line.
</P>
<P>
   Photographers cleared in Princess Diana's death
</P>
<P>
   A French judge dismissed charges against photographers and a
press motorcyclist in the death of Princess Diana two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Princess Diana was killed in a car crash in a Paris
traffic tunnel Aug. 31, 1997. Her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and the
driver, Henri Paul, also were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the accident was blamed on photographers who were
chasing Diana's car at high speeds hoping to get pictures of her
with her new boyfriend. The shots could be sold for a very high
price to publications. The photographers acknowledge tailing Diana,
but said they did not cause the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled the accident was due to the driver of the car
being under the influence of alcohol and drugs, which prevented him
from controlling the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Internet, pop culture drive new dictionary
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find the word ``bogart'' (``to hog something'') in
your dictionary at school, tell your teacher you want the Encarta
World English Dictionary (St. Martins Press, $50 hardback, $19.95
CD-ROM). It's the first new English-language dictionary to be
published in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   More than 320 scholars in 20 nations toiled for the last three
years to produce it. The Encarta is unusual because it's not an
updated version of an earlier edition.
</P>
<P>
   Encarta was written to address the effect the Internet has had
on the English language.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet has expanded, so has English. It's the language
of 85 percent of the sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Because people from different countries have different English
words for things, talking via the Internet can get confusing. For
example, in South African English the word for stoplight is
``robot.'' The Encarta dictionary can help people understand the
different meanings.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: I parked on the University of Texas campus in
a reserved lot the other night. I received a $50 ticket! Do I have
to pay this? What can they do? _ C.E.
</P>
<P>
   A: Not much if you are not a student, faculty member or relative
of either. If you have a connection, they will track you down. You
can appeal the ticket within 12 calendar days. Call 471-PARK for
details. Your unpaid ticket and accrued late charges remain in the
UT computer. Ticketed again? You could be towed. Yikes! Parking on
campus is a competitive sport. Odds of finding a place with a C
(commuter student) permit are slim, since 7,000 permits are sold
for 3,525 parking spaces. Staff members do not have it much easier.
For the 3,000 A (staff ) permits sold there are 1,550 spaces. Too
bad you are not a faculty member because 1,900 F (faculty) permits
are sold for 1,560 spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My oldest daughter was born in Houston on Aug. 2, 1943. A
real big hurricane blew in there on July 27. I cannot find the name
for it. _ A.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: You cannot remember the name of this hurricane because in
1943 hurricanes had numbers, not names. The National Hurricane
Center began naming hurricanes in 1950 with the international
phonetic alphabet (Abel, Baker, Charlie, etc). In 1953 the United
States broke away from that convention and used women's names.
After an attack of gender consciousness, the United States began
using men's and women's names in 1979. The July 27, 1943, hurricane
was simply known as ``hurricane No. 1.'' Q: In the movie, ``Stolen
Women, Captured Hearts,'' a young Indian man played the part of
Chata. Can you tell me who he is, his age, what tribe he's from,
what other movies he's been in? Was he the one in ``Cry of the
White Wolf?'' _ Ruth Quinn
</P>
<P>
   A: You have seen Rodney A. Grant in both movies. Born in 1959,
Grant is of the Omaha Tribe and has been in movies since 1989.
Perhaps you spotted him as one of People magazine's 50 most
beautiful people in the world (1991). Grant also appeared in
``Dances with Wolves'' (1990), and this year's ``Wild Wild West.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been explaining to my daughter the easiest way to tell
what is a fruit and what is a vegetable is fruits have seeds and
vegetables do not. However, my wife says that is not true. A bet is
riding on this. _ Mark Moravits
</P>
<P>
   A: You win. Botanist Jerry Brand at the University of Texas says
a fruit is a matured plant ovary _ seeds surrounded by parent plant
tissue. ``Vegetative'' plant parts include only leaves, stems and
roots, so in a botanical world a vegetable embodies only food
derived from one of those plant components. Under these definitions
an eggplant is a fruit, as are tomatoes and pumpkins. Surprised?
Your grocer may disagree, but botanically the fruit/vegetable line
is not based on how a food is eaten, but from what part of a plant
it is derived and how it is constructed. Q: I heard from an elderly
Irish cousin who included two questions in his letter: ``How are
things in `Glocca Morra'? Is the weeping willow still there?'' I
have no idea what this meant.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rosalind Brinkley
</P>
<P>
   A: This ``Finian's Rainbow'' song is about a fictional location,
the figment of Finian McLonergan's imagination in the musical. The
song lyrics are by E.Y. Harburg; music, Burton Lane. McLonergan
pines for his homeland. Order the sheet music from Alpha Music on
29th Street. ``How are things in Glocca Morra? Is that willow tree
still weeping there? Does that laddie with the twinklin' eye/Come
whistlin' by and does he walk away, Sad and dreamy there not to see
me there?''
</P>
<P>
   Q: One of the television commercials for Draeger Ford shows a
little ``creature'' running down the road yelling. What is that
little animal? _ A.E.
</P>
<P>
   A: The creature is an Australian frilled lizard; the other
animals are meerkats. The Australian frilled lizard, part of the
dragon family, is a sun-lover and the reptile emblem of Australia.
Active during the day, these lizards dart quickly on their hind
legs. Meerkats, members of the mongoose family, dine on scorpions
and crickets. Q: I read you in the Omaha World-Herald. My first
great-grandchild will be born soon. I would like to have a star
named after him. _ F.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Reconsider this idea. Buy a share of stock instead. Only the
International Astronomical Union officially names stars. Commercial
ventures suggesting otherwise are selling you a place on a list of
star names and a nice piece of paper. (Well, it worked for the
Scarecrow in ``The Wizard of Oz.'') According to the IAU, most star
names are actually numbers and positions in the sky, with the
exception of a few bright stars with traditional Arabic names. Q:
I'm curious about how people kept diapers on babies before there
were safety pins. After all, babies have always been leaky. Haven't
had any luck researching this burning issue. _ G. Reed
</P>
<P>
   A: Before safety pins there were straight pins _ a bit risky but
functional. Straight pins go back to 3000 B.C., when they were
fashioned of iron, bone or fish spines. This fashion staple (How
else could togas stay in place?) was eventually replaced by
buttons. The more practical answer to the diaper dilemma, says
Pioneer Farm's Eve Williams, was swaddling. Babies were wrapped
carefully head to toe for many reasons _ warmth (no covers kicked
off during cold frontier nights), immobility (easy to watch a
little bundle) and efficiency (no need to stop and change the
tykes). The strips of cloth were changed every 24 hours or so.
(Yuck!) Wet cloths were simply hung to dry (water for washing was
scarce). Diaper rash anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Put on your baseball cap. Why and when did the home team
change their dugout from the third base side to the first base side
of the field? Also, what is a bench coach?
</P>
<P>
   _ Connie B.
</P>
<P>
   A: The location of the home team dugout is pure team preference,
say the research wizards at the Baseball Hall of Fame in
Cooperstown, N.Y. Some owners prefer to see the team _ therefore
the dugout faces the owner's box. Others place the visiting team
dugout in the one that receives the most sunlight. Could be the
first base line; could be third. Some teams, such as the Los
Angeles Dodgers, have always placed the home team dugout on the
third base side. A bench coach is an assistant, a sous chef, a
manager-in-waiting. This coach assists the manager from the bench
(hence the name).

star names and a nice piece of paper. (Well, it worked for the
Scarecrow in ``The Wizard of Oz.'') According to the IAU, most star
names are actually numbers and positions in the sky, with the
exception of a few bright stars with traditional Arabic names. Q:
I'm curious about how people kept diapers on babies before there
were safety pins. After all, babies have always been leaky. Haven't
had any luck researching this burning issue. _ G. Reed
</P>
<P>
   A: Before safety pins there were straight pins _ a bit risky but
functional. Straight pins go back to 3000 B.C., when they were
fashioned of iron, bone or fish spines. This fashion staple (How
else could togas stay in place?) was eventually replaced by
buttons. The more practical answer to the diaper dilemma, says
Pioneer Farm's Eve Williams, was swaddling. Babies were wrapped
carefully head to toe for many reasons _ warmth (no covers kicked
off during cold frontier nights), immobility (easy to watch a
little bundle) and efficiency (no need to stop and change the
tykes). The strips of cloth were changed every 24 hours or so.
(Yuck!) Wet cloths were simply hung to dry (water for washing was
scarce). Diaper rash anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Put on your baseball cap. Why and when did the home team
change their dugout from the third base side to the first base side
of the field? Also, what is a bench coach?
</P>
<P>
   _ Connie B.
</P>
<P>
   A: The location of the home team dugout is pure team preference,
say the research wizards at the Baseball Hall of Fame in
Cooperstown, N.Y. Some owners prefer to see the team _ therefore
the dugout faces the owner's box. Others place the visiting team
dugout in the one that receives the most sunlight. Could be the
first base line; could be third. Some teams, such as the Los
Angeles Dodgers, have always placed the home team dugout on the
third base side. A bench coach is an assistant, a sous chef, a
manager-in-waiting. This coach assists the manager from the bench
(hence the name).

 &HT;    Little League heroes having Major League fun
 &HT;    By Russell Frank
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine you've been playing Little League baseball in
front of a few moms and dads _ and then suddenly you're stepping up
to the plate before a crowd of 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine reporters, photographers and autograph hounds gathering
around as if you were a Major Leaguer like Chipper Jones or Derek
Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   That's what eight teams of 11- and 12-year-olds did two weeks
ago when they competed in the Little League World Series in
Williamsport, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The players, who came from around the world, faced intense
competition, both at the series and in the playoffs leading up to
it. These eight teams were the best of the 7,000 teams that make up
the Little League system.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pressure, there was still fun to be had. And lots of
kids to meet.
</P>
<P>
   All eight teams stayed in a dorm-like hotel, where they could
challenge each other to table tennis and video games or play in the
pool.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Gaynor, a pitcher from the Toms River, N.J., team, said he
joked around in the dorm room with his friends and watched a
teammate impersonate the Taco Bell Chihuahua until 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Phenix City, Ala., team lived on the floor below the Osaka,
Japan, team for the week. Phenix City lost to Osaka 5-0 in the
championship game, but they learned a lot from their new friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw them in the dorms, I didn't think they were
ever going to talk to us,'' said Phenix City first baseman Brandon
Monk. ``Now I know the Japanese words for `hi,' `good evening' and
`stupid.''' (All very useful when you're a kid!)
</P>
<P>
   The two teams also went head to head for the table tennis
championship. Phenix City won that round.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there was lots of action on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Six Phenix City kids hit home runs in the playoffs. Outfielders
Kyle Tidwell hit a grand slam to beat the Midwestern champion team
5-4, and William Gaston III celebrated his 13th birthday with the
first two home runs of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Osaka's second baseman, Shinichiro Oki, lit up when he speared a
line drive. And all the teams were impressed when the Japanese
players tipped their helmets to the umpires when they came up to
bat.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican pitcher Jose Casanova, the winner in his team's
first game against Osaka, learned the thrill of being asked for his
autograph, as did many of the other boys.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the final game, the friendly rivals from Alabama and
Japan took time to wish each other luck. With some coaxing from the
Little League's chipmunk-like mascot, Dugout, a few players from
each team came on the field to dance behind home plate. When the
music ended, the shaking and dancing turned into an exhibition of
hugging and high-fiving, with the two managers even getting into
the act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always preached that fun is in the winning,'' said Phenix
City coach Tony Rasmus. ``But this has changed my outlook a little
bit.''

 &HT;    Proposed bill gives new hope to grandparents
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Imagine losing your son in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine all you have left of him are his 1-year-old twins, a boy
and a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that you have babysat for the twins since birth, and you
feel as close to them as your own children.
</P>
<P>
   Then imagine that your daughter-in-law remarries and won't let
you see the kids. Imagine being told that, under Ohio law, you have
no right to see your grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine all that, and you have some idea how it feels to be
53-year-old Linda Flory of Clearcreek Twp., Ohio. ``I just want to
see my grandkids,'' Flory says of her fight for visitation rights
with the grandchildren she hasn't seen in 19 months. ``At least,
the kids will know some day I cared enough to fight and that I
wanted to be part of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   A grandmother herself, Ohio State Rep. Barbara Pringle
(D-Cleveland) says she ``can't even imagine that happening to me.''
She has introduced House Bill 236, which would give grandparents
visitation rights except when it's not in the best interests of the
child.
</P>
<P>
   The bill stipulates that a step-parent's adoption of a child
doesn't terminate a grandparent's or close relative's right to
visit the child. The bill covers not only cases like Flory's, in
which the parent has died, but also cases of separation and
divorce. (Exceptions would be when the relationship between the
natural parent and the child is terminated before the adoption.)
</P>
<P>
   A quilt bearing the inscription, ``Grandchildren complete life's
circle of love,'' hangs in the living room of Flory's rural Warren
County home. Crocheted onto the quilt are the names of her 11
grandchildren, including the twins. Their photos are all over the
house, along with those of their late father, Darin Long. But Flory
has not seen her grandchildren since Feb. 22, 1998. (She remembers
the date without a second's hesitation.)
</P>
<P>
   Flory's nightmare began nearly two years earlier, the night of
March 12, 1996. It was 12: 37 a.m. Darin and Bryan Long were less
than a mile from their mother's home when Darin's Ford Escort went
off the road and hit a tree at 10323 Paragon Road in Washington
Twp.
</P>
<P>
   Darin died at the scene; Bryan, who was Careflighted to Miami
Valley Hospital, recovered from his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The twins provided Flory's only consolation, the living link
with the son who had a ``smile that was from ear to ear.'' Hundreds
turned out for the funeral of the 25-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Darin's twins continued to be an important part of Flory's life
until her former daughter-in-law remarried in December 1997, and
her new husband adopted the twins. The visits dwindled and then
stopped altogether. The Montgomery County Juvenile Court granted
Flory visitation rights, but an appeals court overturned that
decision in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandparents and grandchildren need to be together,'' Flory
says. ``I was such a major portion of their lives. I loved and took
care of them like they were my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Tammy Garland, 35, has supported her mother in her
battle to see the twins. ``This is my family, too,'' she says.
``This is all we have left of my brother. He loved his kids, and
he'd want us to be a part of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wagner, the attorney for the twins' mother, said his
client hasn't alleged any misconduct on the part of Flory or her
family. He defended his client's right to establish a new life.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of House Bill 236 use similar arguments. Adoption by a
step-parent creates a new family unit, they say, and parents alone
should have the right to determine who spends time with their
children.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a letter from Garland, State Rep. Cheryl Winkler,
R-Cincinnati, said she opposed the bill. When children are adopted
by a step-parent, she wrote,''...mandating the maintenance with a
relationship with relatives from the first marriage would be
disruptive to the building of the new family structure.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not disruptive for children to be torn away from
relatives they have known and loved? It's not disruptive when the
kid turns 16 and starts asking questions?
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Pringle doesn't get it. ``I can't understand how this
would be in the best interest of the child,'' she says. ``It's not
bad enough you lost your mother or your father; then you're torn
away from the family you have left. They loved that person and
suddenly (they're) not allowed to see them again. It's just not
right.''
</P>
<P>
   She talks about the grandparents in northern Ohio who raised
their grandchild for several years after their daughter died in
childbirth from a cerebral hemorrhage. The father remarried and
reclaimed the child _ and refused to allow the grandparents to
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a child has the right to know his heritage and his
grandparents,'' Pringle says. ``He has a right to know about his
mom, the kind of person she was, and things she liked. Otherwise, a
part of his life, part of his history, part of his culture is
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Flory case, Pringle says, ``These children have lost not
only lost their father but any connection to their father. No
matter how good a father the new one is, the child still has the
right to know about his father. The only way to know that is to
know his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the family's hopes are pinned on House Bill 236. On the hope
that Ohio lawmakers will realize it's not in a child's best
interest to erase half of his history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is telling me I can't be a grandma,'' Flory says.
</P>
<P>
   No lawyer in the world can make her believe that.
</P>

   SCI-TSIEN-MOUSE (Undated) _ A Scientist-at-Work profile: The
world has been frenetically beating on the door of Joe Z. Tsien,
the biologist who announced last week he had created a smarter
strain of mouse. Within this enveloping chaos, Tsien has spun
around himself a small bubble of protective serenity. He calmly
describes the remarkable journey that led him from Wu Shi, a small
town near Shanghai, to the position of having made a significant,
maybe decisive, contribution to understanding the nature of memory.
By Nicholas Wade. (2000 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo (NYT3).
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ELECTRON-BONDS (Undated) _ Of the roughly 20 million
chemical substances scientists have catalogued, nearly all are
assemblages of atoms linked together by electronic bonds. The quest
to understand these tiny bonds _ the very glue of material
existence _ is the heart of chemical science. A step in this quest
was reported last week with the publication of the sharpest direct
images ever made of electronic bonds, known as orbitals. The shapes
revealed by these images _ doughnut-like rings, dumbbell-shaped
lobes and arrays suggestive of butterfly wings _ confirmed
theoretical predictions of what these bonds should look like in the
particular molecule under study. By Malcolm W. Browne. (1050 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DIABETES (Undated) _ With rates of diabetes soaring, experts
are studying patterns of prevention in people genetically
predisposed to the disease, and looking a ways to control
cardiovascular problems in people who already have diabetes. By
Denise Grady. (1800 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo (NYT4).
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NEANDERTHALS (Undated) _ Based on detailed examination of
bone fragments from remains of Neanderthals found in Croatia,
scientists have determined that over all they were a healthy lot.
By John Noble Wilford. (400 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CREATIVITY (Undated) _ Scientists trying to program
creativity discovered that when they fed a formula into a computer,
it generated advertising concepts judged more original and
appealing than equivalent advertisements spawned by a group of
humans. The program demonstrates what many creative people know
intuitively: that the land of the imagination is a country like any
other, with laws, rituals and a tireless police corps that must be
obeyed if one hopes to retain citizenship there. By Natalie Angier.
(1640 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items of the
way bees spread the word about food sources, how traffic moves, a
test of Cassini camers and the potency of catnip. By Henry
Fountain. (750 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column. Coffee
lovers take heed: For the sake of your health, you might consider
switching at least some of those daily cups of java for tea. Not
herbal tea but ``real'' tea _ green tea, black tea, Chinese tea,
fruit-flavored tea, with or without caffeine, lemon, milk or sugar.
As long as the leaves come from the plant Camellia sinensis, tea
will contain potent antioxidant chemicals that have been linked to
protection against major diseases like cancer and heart disease.
Even the caffeine in tea may be somewhat beneficial, emerging
evidence suggests. By Jane E. Brody. (1350 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DNA-VACCINE (Undated) _ Scientists at Stanford University
have found that a simple solution of DNA and water applied to the
skin of mice can induce an immune response comparable to one from
traditional intramuscular injection. The DNA vaccine was apparently
taken up through the hair follicles of the mice; nude mice (mice
without hair) did not show the same reaction. By Anne Eisenberg.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AIDS-INDIANS (Undated) _ Some health experts say they fear
that AIDS is about to explode among the 500 Indian tribes in the
United States. Last year on the Navajo reservation, AIDS cases grew
by 25 percent, health officials there said. By David France. (1000
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-WAKEBOARDING (Undated) _ Wakeboarding is the fastest
growing water sport, requiring skills similar to surfing,
skateboarding or snowboarding, combined with elements of water
skiing while being pulled behind a boat with a rope tow. By Julie
Walsh. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WEIGHT-LOSS Ads for two new diet supplements promise quick
and efficient weight loss without exercise. Experts say there may
be some small amount of fat absorption, but very small. By Liz
Neporent. (625 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Night eating syndrome afflicts an estimated 3.8 million
Americans and now is being linked to a vicious cycle of seratonin.
(350 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ No one is talking about a cure, or even any improvement in the
very near future, but researchers are reporting some promising
progress in the field of lupus, a serious autoimmune disease
affecting about 1.5 million people in the United States. (280
words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A new study from the American Psychological Association last
month indicates that under some circumstances otherwise reasonable
adults may adopt the karmic explanation of illness that what goes
around comes around and the an illness might be a punishment for
misdeeds. (255 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PAIN (Undated) _ Researchers at the University of
California/San Francisco think that in the case of an inflamed
joint, that ache may be the body's way of telling its most
aggressive defenders, ``Enough already, you're hurting me!'' By
John O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: Since I seldom

AMERICA GOES UPSCALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Wal-Mart is installing cappuccino bars. Oprah is
hawking haute literature. TV is fine, but Bose home theater is very
much the dream screen.
</P>
<P>
   The sport utility vehicle has trumped the station wagon.
Wolfgang Puck has his own TV dinners at Fry's. Phoenix Art Museum
ads are nestled between Britney Spears and Cher on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   There are dog-biscuit bakeries, Ralph Lauren restaurants and
concierges at apartment complexes. Even cigar bars, chic home decor
at Target and brand-name water.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the pretty little picture? Right under our upturned
noses, America is going decidedly upscale.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in American economic history, there is what
cultural analyst David Frum has dubbed a ``mass upper class,'' and
popular taste is leaning toward the ritzy, glitzy and generally
costly _ or imitations of same.
</P>
<P>
   It is the offspring of the indulgence that comes with a record
economy, record media saturation and record available credit.
</P>
<P>
   It's also just a simple '90s way of thinking, a cultural melange
that we're going to pin on Martha Stewart. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The fashion bomb
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Long the bastion of the East Coast elite, Martha was the darling
of proper domestic tranquillity. Her name was a lifestyle, her
ideas sublime. She was inaccessible and nearly impossible to mimic.
(Turns out, few people are still sewing their own linen sheets
these days.)
</P>
<P>
   But Martha was a force. Slowly, there were specialty books _ on
weddings, on dinner parties, on the holidays. There was a pretty
magazine, ``Martha Stewart Living,'' followed by a television
program filmed at her oh-so-perfect Connecticut estate. But
Martha's world still seemed reserved for the elite and the fussy
until April 1997, when she dropped a bomb, fashioned out of yards
and yards of pretty pastel sheets and towels, onto mainstream
American retail. All of a sudden, Martha was at K-Mart, and average
America was hip. East Coast elite was accessible. Better yet, it
was cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Her empire caught fire. She bought her magazine from Time
Warner, launched an upscale, expensive mail-order catalog, started
a Web site and a line of paints and, this fall, will introduce a
series of fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Target (affectionately called Tar-ZHAY by
tongue-in-cheek bargain hunters) gave downscaling the upscale a
try. The retail monster rolled out a home-decor line by famed
architect Michael Graves, the genius behind things as wildly
different and aesthetically amazing as the Walt Disney Swan Hotel
in Orlando and an addition to the Whitney Museum &UR; in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to appeal to a more design-savvy customer,'' says
Target Vice President Ron Johnson, the man behind Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the Michael Graves toaster _ a sleek, curvy, hip little
number _ began flying off the shelves. Turns out, Americans really
liked the idea that more could be had for less, and the mass upper
class expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Target, by the way, now advertises in ``Martha Stewart Living.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, not to be left out in the glitz category, began
testing upscale coffee bars in select Midwestern locations.
According to Melissa Brown, a company spokeswoman, that idea has
been successful and might just fly nationwide. (Wal-Mocha,
anyone?) &QL; 
We'll even pay for oxygen
</P>
<P>
   And this is only on the discount-chain level. Upscale wants to
fill your coffee cup and hold it in its cupholder, especially if
you are driving to Barnes &AMP; Noble. It wants to own your remote
control and your home appliances. It has its eye on entire cities.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai, the vehicle line renowned for its cheapness, recently
revamped its image into something attractive and desirable. Places
such as oxygen bars have been seeping into the culture, suggesting
that Americans are ready to pay for nearly anything au courant, no
matter if the expense is frivolous and otherwise free. Even the 25
vent cup of coffee is resigned to the $2.25 double-tall latte from
Starbucks, an example that Rommie Davis, a trend-spotting shopping
professional from Los Angeles, finds quite telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starbucks gives you style and cachet, and it's accessible to
anyone,'' she says. ``Americans are allowing themselves these
little luxuries and taking pleasure in doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Those little luxuries are also transferring to a cerebral level.
As America is increasingly steeped in highbrow culture, some of the
previously elite-only tastes are starting to work their way into
the average American mind, (and onto the tongue, as in the case of
Puck's new mainstream frozen TV dinners.)
</P>
<P>
   Think of Oprah's Book Club: Literary fiction, a genre once
ignored by mass culture, has been canonized by a TV personality.
Even the bookstore, once a small fixture in a mall, has turned into
multiple large businesses built on the megaplex concept. (They have
pricey coffee there, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Our cultural icons have also taken a turn for prosperity. No
longer are we content to watch the cast of ``Cheers'' struggle in a
dingy bar. Now, we prefer to tune in to ``Frasier'' and his antics
at his luxury digs. (And when the scripts force Frasier out of
work, ratings plummet. A successful society wants successful
counterparts.)
</P>
<P>
   Upscaling is even happening in whole cities. Las Vegas, long the
land of the $1.99 family buffet, has morphed into a fine-dining
destination with world-class restaurant art collections and the
world's second Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, a place of grunge and rain, is being cited as a city
that has finally ``arrived'' due to the addition of a new symphony
hall and a baseball stadium to its skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Chandler is experiencing record prosperity. Previously
thought of as a sleepy, smallish suburb, Chandler is now home to
day spas and, soon enough, Arizona's second Nordstrom. Never mind
that just a year ago we were convinced that with just one Nordstrom
shoe department, the entire Valley would live happily ever after. &QL; 
 &QL; 
An eclectic America
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to Michael Kammen, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and
renowned Cornell University historian, this downscale-goes-upscale
and vice-versa phenomenon is a product of our melting-pot culture
melting even more and is simply a way of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become far more eclectic,'' he says, and no longer feel
defined by social class, taste levels and economic means.
</P>
<P>
   Just look to our leadership, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Clinton's (presidential) inauguration, the music was by
Fleetwood Mac,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   An arena conventionally marked by power and prestige was brought
down to a mass level; the anointing of the leader of the free world
became a rock concert, on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   This upscaling is very much a recent thing. With a dutiful nod
to the '80s, the decade of excess, those years were marked by a
vast disparity. Yes, that was when we birthed the Lexus and when
jeans without designer labels became unworthy of the ranch. That
decade paved the way for the way we live today: Starbucks would
have starved if America hadn't bonded with brands. However, it was
also when the mass middle class was anything but upscale. People
were either drenched in money or they were late on the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the word ``upscale'' was not introduced to a
dictionary until 1966. Similarly, ``lifestyle'' was not added until
1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were synonyms, and it's not as though no one thought
about it, but the fact that people were presenting themselves to
communities in a particular way, were concerned about having
watched a certain program, et cetera, was very new,'' Kammen says.
</P>
<P>
   He cites a chart published in ``Life'' magazine on April 11,
1949, as the turning point, the day that ``The Grapes of Wrath''
and ``The Great Gatsby'' began to edge together and American taste
levels began to blur.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Which Are You?'' the piece was a graph sectioned off by
labels: ``highbrow,'' ``upper-middle brow,'' ``lowbrow,'' etc. Next
to each level of brow-being was a list of icons that defined that
socioeconomic status. For example, a highbrow person would listen
to Lizst and a lowbrow person would be a fan of folk. The
categories ranged from libations to reading, food to furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The article) set off a huge rage,'' said Kammen, who reprints
it in his recent book, ``American Culture, American Tastes.'' ``It
became a favorite parlor game. People would sit around and say,
`Which are you?'
</P>
<P>
   ``The huge irony is that when that chart appeared, that was the
peak of explicit public recognition, that was exactly the moment in
time when taste levels began to blur,'' says Kammen, citing the
paperback revolution as one of the catalysts.
</P>
<P>
   That era was the first time classics were mass-marketed and
available in more affordable, lower-quality forms. &QL; 
 &QL; 
`I want' vs. `I need'
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, the blur has really taken off partly because of the
abundance of money (``it's the economy, stupid''), partly because
of record media saturation and partly due to the ease by which
credit is obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Juliet B. Schor, author of ``The Overspent American,'' says that
watching TV for an extra five hours a week, or two sitcoms per
night, raises one's yearly expenditures by about $1,000. Kammen
says that makes only too much sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This society is being literally bludgeoned to death to be more
consumer-oriented,'' he says. ``At a time when many Americans have
felt more prosperous, advertisers have been very astute in trying
to make available a huge variety of products that people find
attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   This spending spree has its dangers, however.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Davis, the shopping expert, seriously doubts that we
are always getting more for our money. Starbucks, in her opinion,
doesn't have that much on Folgers.
</P>
<P>
   Second, ``There is this illusion of more disposable income, but
we still have people paying 17 percent interest on credit cards
because they can't afford what they bought,'' Kammen says.
``Advertisers are creating the `I wants' and Americans are thinking
`I need.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's that whole keeping-up-with the-Joneses mentality.
</P>
<P>
   This nation of big spenders is leaving a smaller cash-poor
demographic in a cloud of grocery receipts, bills and unfulfilled
want lists. As pinpointed in 1997 by the Census Bureau, a great
socioeconomic divide is emerging through this economy; the rich are
getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer. Affluent America
and anguished America have turned against each other and are
quickly marching in very different directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who cannot afford or even
contemplate upscaling their tastes,'' Kammen says. ``For them,
shopping at Wal-Mart is a necessity. Just figuring out which of
this month's bills must go unpaid is a part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet they are not ignorant of the prosperity that surrounds and
nearly plagues them. They see it on TV in ``Frasier's'' apartment
and ``Ally McBeal's`` hip new digs, hear it on the radio, and watch
it walking down the aisles at Wal-Mart, where they are no longer
the most targeted demographic. It's almost as if corporate America
is simply turning its head.
</P>
<P>
   So, Kammen says, they justify.
</P>
<P>
   ``When asked if they envy the lifestyle of the people on TV,
they say no,'' he says. ``Because what they see on TV or movies in
relation to prosperous living is dysfunctional families, not to
suggest there are no dysfunctional families among them, but they
tend to be churchgoing, less materialistic, and they know what they
can't afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``They work out a rationale for why they don't want or need it,
and say, `We are a close family, we have each other.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Kammen says, through all of this prosperity, all of
this blur, the reality is that the upscaling of America will
continue to assert itself on poor people and push them out of the
little worlds they've created for themselves. The direction they
will go is simply further back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amidst all of this affluence, at least 20 to 25 percent of the
country is just making it, and the middle class is going deeply
into debt,'' he says. ``A run of prosperity for a decade is an
unprecedented phenomenon, and there is bound to be a correction
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's going to hurt the underclass very severly, especially
minorities and women: They're less likely to be hired, and single
moms have tough trade-off choices to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, his hypothesis is becoming increasingly apparent. As
always, the smaller ethnic demographics are getting a smaller piece
of the prosperity pie. There are very few upscale magazines
targeted to minorities. This fall, there will not be any minority
characters in lead roles on network TV. There are not upscale
Mexican restaurants; rather, they're billed as places to eat great
for less. Martha Stewart's pastels aren't made to appeal to bright
Hispanic neighborhoods. Soul food is not represented in Vegas' new
Bellagio hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In the Latino community, that small piece of the pie is Cristina
Saralegui, a talk-show hostess on the Spanish-language TV network
Univision.
</P>
<P>
   She talks about upscale issues, dresses flawlessly and never has
a hair out of place. She has been called a Hispanic Oprah, as
though the label is needed to explain her. It's almost as if she's
made to look like she's marketed to the masses, but only a very
small portion of Hispanics can actually identify with her success.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of cross-cultural comparison also happens in the Black
community. One star for the Black upper-class, TV goddess Barbara
Smith, has been labeled a ``Black Martha Stewart.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, B. Smith, as she is known, will have her own
magazine, ``B. Smith Style,'' but, according to the ``New York
Times,'' the publication's success is hinged on Smith's crossover
appeal : 75 percent of the viewers of her television show, ``B.
Smith, With Style,'' are White.
</P>
<P>
   However, for the most part, and most of the country, these years
will go down as an era of good fortune, good coffee and great TV
dinners.
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget Martha, the real Lady Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Give her your tired and your poor. She will provide them with
great, cheap sheets. &QL;

SIGNING OF MIDEAST TREATY REKINDLES HOPE FOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The signing ceremony in Egypt on Sunday of a pivotal
new agreement laid out a clear path forward for the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, even if a much-tougher road
remains ahead to a final settlement that will include Lebanon and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat signed the document in the Red Sea resort town of
Sharm el Sheikh as Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, King Abdullah
of Jordan, and US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright looked
on, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday we embark on a new road,'' Barak said. ``For the sake
of our mothers and fathers, children and grandchildren, we must
turn the vision of a comprehensive peace into a lasting reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat said, ``We assert, as we always promised, that we respect
and implement our commitments.'' President Clinton hailed the
agreement as ``truly a new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   It came after three days of intense diplomacy in the region by
Albright, who said the agreement ``provides a long-awaited boost
both to the substance and spirit of the search for Middle East
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A great task has been completed,'' she said. ``And an even
larger one remains.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright had met earlier Saturday with the leaders of Lebanon
and Syria in an attempt to restart direct talks between those two
countries and Israel after talks broke down between them more than
three years ago. More mediation will be required for Albright to
achieve that, but observers say Albright is optimistic that the new
momentum in the Israeli-Palestinian track will help reinvigorate
the Syrian and Lebanese diplomatic tracks.
</P>
<P>
   South Lebanon is the last active Arab-Israeli warfront.
Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting there to oust Israel from the
9-mile wide swath of land it occupies along the border. Syria
supports the guerrillas, in part to pressure Israel to return the
Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Six Day
War.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the newly signed agreement is merely a modified
version of the Wye River ``land for security'' deal signed more
than one year ago. It is an agreement to implement a long-overdue
set of requirements that call for further Israeli troop withdrawals
from a further 13 percent of the West Bank and the release of about
350 Palestinian security prisoners from Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
   But in its essence, it is more than a revision of the existing
agreement. The ``Wye II'' agreement marks a crucial turning point,
the end of the interim peace process and the beginning of the
endgame that will determine the final shape of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the agreements set the terms for three Israeli
withdrawals from the West Bank between September and January. It
offers the Palestinians more prisoner releases, clearance to open a
seaport in Gaza, and a ``safe passage'' for Palestinians to travel
between Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   It also calls for Israel and the Palestinians to complete by
Feb. 15 a ``framework agreement'' on the ``final status'' issues,
which remain the most thorny and emotional pieces of the process.
They include the debate over the status of Jerusalem, the fate of
millions of Palestinian refugees, water rights, and the future of
Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   After the signing ceremony, King Abdullah evoked the memory of
his late father, King Hussein, who worked tirelessly to push both
sides to sign the Wye River agreement last fall while he battled
the cancer that claimed his life in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement reminds us all of his spirit, his vision, his
courage, and his commitment to peace, and I hope and pray that we
do not let him down,'' King Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak said that during the previous three years, ``there were
moments of loss of hope and despair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us all vow to turn a new page in the history of this
troubled region. God willing, we shall prevail,'' he said.

 &HT;    ISRAELI SUPREME COURT OUTLAWS PHYSICAL ABUSE, MANY CALL TORTURE,
OF PALESTINIANS
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM In a landmark decision, the Israeli supreme court
Monday outlawed the systematic use of sleep depravation, violent
shakings and other physical abuse of Palestinians under
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   The decision strikes at a widespread tactic born from decades of
Middle East conflict and one of the most criticized aspects of
Israel's democracy. While many countries use even harsher methods
and deny it, Israel has been unique in setting up legal procedures
and attempting to justify what most human rights groups call
torture.
</P>
<P>
   The official Israeli term is ``moderate physical pressure'' and
most Israelis consider it necessary to prevent terrorism.
Immediately after the ruling Monday, politicians said the decision
weakens the country's ability to thwart terror attacks and called
for new laws to circumvent the decision.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that just a day before, car bombs were detonated in
two Israeli cities, though no Israelis died. Prime Minister Ehud
Barak did not issue any statement Monday about whether the
mistreatment would stop or whether the court order would be
enforced. (eds need to check wires on this to update)
</P>
<P>
   ``It may cause real damage to our ability to fight terror,''
Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh told Israel Radio.
``It's very nice to have liberal legislation, maybe it is good in
Scandinavia or Western Europe or North America, but in our part of
the world, where we have fought terrorism so bitterly, such a
verdict is almost completely irrelevant to the world we live in.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the court opinion addressed the ``difficult reality in
which Israel finds herself security wise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although a democracy must often fight with one hand tied
behind its back, it nonetheless has the upper hand,'' the ruling
stated. It added a democracy's rule of law and protection of
liberty ``strengthen its spirit and strength and allows it to
overcome its difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling leaves security officials immune from legal
prosecution if they can show that mistreatment was committed out of
a life-saving necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, human rights activists considered the ruling a major
victory.
</P>
<P>
   They have long disputed the security establishment's assertion
that the physical abuse is used to find ``ticking bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they say the mistreatment is usually used to fish for
information and extract confessions. They note that interrogations
frequently stop during weekends when interrogators get their day's
rest a sign they are not seeking to stop attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, 10 Palestinians have died under interrogation and
thousands have been subject to torture, according to the Israeli
human rights group B'Tselem(cq).
</P>
<P>
   ``What it has become is a whole bureaucracy of torture, a whole
army of bureaucrats and doctors and lawyers,'' said B'Tselem
Executive Director Eitan Felner. ``Finally, the High Court of
Justice said, even in the name of security, there are some things
that cannot be justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Felner said the practice has grown from the ``siege mentality
that Israel developed over the last 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   (Optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   At least since the early 1970s, Israel has used physical
mistreatment against Palestinians there are almost no known cases
of such abuse against a Jewish Israeli.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli law forbids the physical abuse of inmates. But, since
1987, regulations from the prime minister established procedures,
including court oversight, for the abuse to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Monday's ruling, issued in response to an appeal from
six Palestinian victims and four human rights groups, stated that
regulations cannot be used if they go against the country's law.
</P>
<P>
   Often, according to a government commission, security services
have lied to judges about the methods being used. Other times, they
get approval from the courts by arguing that there is an emergency
security need for extreme treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous treatment is violent shaking while an
inmate's hands and feet are cuffed. It leaves them dazed, nauseous
and sometimes with spinal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many inmates are made to squat on the ground while their
hands are cuffed, behind their back at head level. Some are
handcuffed hanging from pipes so they must spend hours on their
toes.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates are frequently hooded for hours or days, forced to stay
awake for days, and subjected to loud music or screaming.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Abd(cq) Al-Ahmar, from Bethlehem, said he was
subjected to interrogations for two months in 1996, after being
arrested for reasons never explained to him. He was never charged,
but was taken to the barbed-wire-enclosed Russian Compound jail in
the heart of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would be shaken for three to five minutes at a time.
Sometimes he passed out and awoke in the infirmary. Sometimes,
security agents would bring a mirror to show him his bloodshot eyes
and ashen face.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't look like yourself,'' he said. ``Sometimes a person
feels like it's three hours they've been shaken.''

   ART-MARKET (New York) _ Like Broadway, baseball and big-game
hunting, the art trade has always had a season. It began in
mid-September, rose to heights each fall and again each spring,
then tailed off at the end of June, when rich collectors headed for
a summer of leisure at their country homes. But not last year, and
especially not this year. By Judith H. Dobrzynski.

   CHINA-THEATER (Beijing) _ Chinese officials have settled on a
stark modern French design for China's new national theater complex
here. The design is a titanium and glass bubble-shaped structure

 &HT;    On The Newsstands: Artist or not, Normal Rockwell's hot
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With an exhibition of his paintings opening at Atlanta's High
Museum in November and traveling to half a dozen major art
galleries, Norman Rockwell, the sometimes corny chronicler of
Americana, is finally getting some respect.
</P>
<P>
   Or is he?
</P>
<P>
   The September issue of ARTnews ($6) explores the controversy
surrounding the artist whose work appeared on 322 Saturday Evening
Post covers. Although he was immensely popular, some critics
contend that he was just an illustrator, not an artist. For New
Criterion editor Hilton Kramer, Rockwell's scheduled exhibition at
New York's Guggenheim Museum is simply evidence of a further
decline in standards.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Rockwell is an artist or not is immaterial, says High
Museum Director Ned Rifkin. ``He is a force.''
</P>
<P>
   Collectors apparently agree. One of Rockwell's paintings, ``The
Watchmaker,'' sold at Sotheby's three years ago for $937,500.
</P>
<P>
   Babes in the woods
</P>
<P>
   Just because you have kids, that's no reason to curtail outdoor
activities such as camping and hiking. Women Outside ($3.95)
interviews four couples about how they incorporate children into
active lifestyles. Because of all the new high-tech gear available,
taking the entire family into the wild has become as easy as, well,
a walk in the woods. There's good news for single women, too.
Several experienced travelers offer tips for safe solo journeys to
Antarctica, Australia, Japan, Chile, British Columbia, Luxembourg
and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled men
</P>
<P>
   In a Newsweek ($3.50) excerpt from her new book, ``Stiffed,''
former Atlanta journalist Susan Faludi explores the woes of the
American male and the pressure to be masculine in a culture that no
longer respects the old codes of manhood. As research for the book,
Faludi spent six years reporting on the Navy's Tailhook scandal,
The Citadel's coed controversy, the sports world, corporate
downsizing and the pornography industry. What she found was a
generation of men who feel betrayed by their fathers and society.
While Tom Brokaw and others praise ``The Greatest Generation'' for
saving the world, the sons of those World War II veterans complain
that their fathers abandoned them emotionally. `` `My father never
taught me how to be a man' was the refrain I heard over and over
again,'' Faludi says.
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock revisited
</P>
<P>
   Still haven't read enough about Woodstock '99? Spin ($2.99)
presents an hour-by-hour account of what really happened at the
three-day festival. By Sunday, the peace-and-love event had
degenerated into ``an anarchic stew of fires, riots, vandalism and
mounds and mounds of trash.'' Also in this issue, Woodstock star
Kid Rock talks about his decade-long journey from crack peddler to
millionaire musician. With his latest record, ``Devil Without a
Cause,'' gone platinum, the king of hick-hop says he still has the
same simple tastes: ``I'm into trailer parks, Pabst Blue Ribbon and
top-shelf mixed drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   A different Rock
</P>
<P>
   Who's the funniest man in America? Time ($3.50) says it's
comedian Chris Rock, and ``Saturday Night Live'' producer Lorne
Michaels agrees. ``There's no one as good,'' he says. Even Woody
Allen says he's exploring the possibility of appearing opposite
Rock in a comedy about sportscasters.

handcuff them and shake them furiously, leaving them dazed and, in
a few cases, dead. These are the methods the Israeli secret service

IN UPSCALE AMERICA, NO LUXURY IS TOO MUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Wal-Mart is installing cappuccino bars. Oprah is
hawking haute literature. TV is fine, but Bose home theater is very
much the dream screen.
</P>
<P>
   The sport utility vehicle has trumped the station wagon.
Wolfgang Puck has his own TV dinners at Fry's. Phoenix Art Museum
ads are nestled between Britney Spears and Cher on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   There are dog-biscuit bakeries, Ralph Lauren restaurants and
concierges at apartment complexes. Even cigar bars, chic home decor
at Target and brand-name water.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the pretty little picture? Right under our upturned
noses, America is going decidedly upscale.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in American economic history, there is what
cultural analyst David Frum has dubbed a ``mass upper class,'' and
popular taste is leaning toward the ritzy, glitzy and generally
costly _ or imitations of same.
</P>
<P>
   It is the offspring of the indulgence that comes with a record
economy, record media saturation and record available credit.
</P>
<P>
   It's also just a simple '90s way of thinking, a cultural melange
that we're going to pin on Martha Stewart. &QL; 
(at)j  &QL; 
The fashion bomb
</P>
<P>
   (at)j  &QL; 
Long the bastion of the East Coast elite, Martha was the darling of
proper domestic tranquillity. Her name was a lifestyle, her ideas
sublime. She was inaccessible and nearly impossible to mimic.
(Turns out, few people are still sewing their own linen sheets
these days.)
</P>
<P>
   But Martha was a force. Slowly, there were specialty books _ on
weddings, on dinner parties, on the holidays. There was a pretty
magazine, ``Martha Stewart Living,'' followed by a television
program filmed at her oh-so-perfect Connecticut estate. But
Martha's world still seemed reserved for the elite and the fussy
until April 1997, when she dropped a bomb, fashioned out of yards
and yards of pretty pastel sheets and towels, onto mainstream
American retail. All of a sudden, Martha was at K-Mart, and average
America was hip. East Coast elite was accessible. Better yet, it
was cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Her empire caught fire. She bought her magazine from Time
Warner, launched an upscale, expensive mail-order catalog, started
a Web site and a line of paints and, this fall, will introduce a
series of fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Target (affectionately called Tar-ZHAY by
tongue-in-cheek bargain hunters) gave downscaling the upscale a
try. The retail monster rolled out a home-decor line by famed
architect Michael Graves, the genius behind things as wildly
different and aesthetically amazing as the Walt Disney Swan Hotel
in Orlando and an addition to the Whitney Museum &UR; in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to appeal to a more design-savvy customer,'' says
Target Vice President Ron Johnson, the man behind Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the Michael Graves toaster _ a sleek, curvy, hip little
number _ began flying off the shelves. Turns out, Americans really
liked the idea that more could be had for less, and the mass upper
class expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Target, by the way, now advertises in ``Martha Stewart Living.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, not to be left out in the glitz category, began
testing upscale coffee bars in select Midwestern locations.
According to Melissa Brown, a company spokeswoman, that idea has
been successful and might just fly nationwide. (Wal-Mocha,
anyone?) &QL; 
(at)j  &QL; 
We'll even pay for oxygen
</P>
<P>
   (at)j  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And this is only on the discount-chain level. Upscale wants to
fill your coffee cup and hold it in its cupholder, especially if
you are driving to Barnes &AMP; Noble. It wants to own your remote
control and your home appliances. It has its eye on entire cities.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai, the vehicle line re nowned for its cheapness, recently
revamped its image into something attractive and desirable. Places
such as oxygen bars have been seeping into the culture, suggesting
that Americans are ready to pay for nearly anything au courant, no
matter if the expense is frivolous and otherwise free. Even the 25
cent cup of coffee is resigned to the $2.25 double-tall latte from
Starbucks, an example that Rommie Davis, a trend-spotting shopping
professional from Los Angeles, finds quite telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starbucks gives you style and cachet, and it's accessible to
anyone,'' she says. ``Americans are allowing themselves these
little luxuries and taking pleasure in doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Those little luxuries are also transferring to a cerebral level.
As America is increasingly steeped in highbrow culture, some of the
previously elite-only tastes are starting to work their way into
the average American mind, (and onto the tongue, as in the case of
Puck's new mainstream frozen TV dinners.)
</P>
<P>
   Think of Oprah's Book Club: Literary fiction, a genre once
ignored by mass culture, has been canonized by a TV personality.
Even the bookstore, once a small fixture in a mall, has turned into
multiple large businesses built on the megaplex concept. (They have
pricey coffee there, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Our cultural icons have also taken a turn for prosperity. No
longer are we content to watch the cast of ``Cheers'' struggle in a
dingy bar. Now, we prefer to tune in to ``Frasier'' and his antics
at his luxury digs. (And when the scripts force Frasier out of
work, ratings plummet. A successful society wants successful
counterparts.)
</P>
<P>
   Upscaling is even happening in whole cities. Las Vegas, long the
land of the $1.99 family buffet, has morphed into a fine-dining
destination with world-class restaurant art collections and the
world's second Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, a place of grunge and rain, is being cited as a city
that has finally ``arrived'' due to the addition of a new symphony
hall and a baseball stadium to its skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Chandler is experiencing record prosperity. Previously
thought of as a sleepy, smallish suburb, Chandler is now home to
day spas and, soon enough, Arizona's second Nordstrom. Never mind
that just a year ago we were convinced that with just one Nordstrom
shoe department, the entire Valley would live happily ever after. &QL; 
(at)j  &QL; 
An eclectic America
</P>
<P>
   (at)j  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to Michael Kammen, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and
renowned Cornell University historian, this downscale-goes-upscale
and vice-versa phenomenon is a product of our melting-pot culture
melting even more and is simply a way of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become far more eclectic,'' he says, and no longer feel
defined by social class, taste levels and economic means.
</P>
<P>
   Just look to our leadership, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Clinton's (presidential) inauguration, the music was by
Fleetwood Mac,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   An arena conventionally marked by power and prestige was brought
down to a mass level; the anointing of the leader of the free world
became a rock concert, on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   This upscaling is very much a recent thing. With a dutiful nod
to the '80s, the decade of excess, those years were marked by a
vast disparity. Yes, that was when we birthed the Lexus and when
jeans without designer labels became unworthy of the ranch. That
decade paved the way for the way we live today: Starbucks would
have starved if America hadn't bonded with brands. However, it was
also when the mass middle class was anything but upscale. People
were either drenched in money or they were late on the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the word ``upscale'' was not introduced to a
dictionary until 1966. Similarly, ``lifestyle'' was not added until
1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were synonyms, and it's not as though no one thought
about it, but the fact that people were presenting themselves to
communities in a particular way, were concerned about having
watched a certain program, et cetera, was very new,'' Kammen says.
</P>
<P>
   He cites a chart published in ``Life'' magazine on April 11,
1949, as the turning point, the day that ``The Grapes of Wrath''
and ``The Great Gatsby'' began to edge together and American taste
levels began to blur.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Which Are You?'' the piece was a graph sectioned off by
labels: ``highbrow,'' ``upper-middle brow,'' ``lowbrow,'' etc. Next
to each level of brow-being was a list of icons that defined that
socioeconomic status. For example, a highbrow person would listen
to Lizst and a lowbrow person would be a fan of folk. The
categories ranged from libations to reading, food to furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The article) set off a huge rage,'' said Kammen, who reprints
it in his recent book, ``American Culture, American Tastes.'' ``It
became a favorite parlor game. People would sit around and say,
`Which are you?'
</P>
<P>
   ``The huge irony is that when that chart appeared, that was the
peak of explicit public recognition, that was exactly the moment in
time when taste levels began to blur,'' says Kammen, citing the
paperback revolution as one of the catalysts.
</P>
<P>
   That era was the first time classics were mass-marketed and
available in more affordable, lower-quality forms. &QL; 
(at)j  &QL; 
`I want' vs. `I need'
</P>
<P>
   (at)j  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, the blur has really taken off partly because of the
abundance of money (``it's the economy, stupid''), partly because
of record media saturation and partly due to the ease by which
credit is obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Juliet B. Schor, author of ``The Overspent American,'' says that
watching TV for an extra five hours a week, or two sitcoms per
night, raises one's yearly expenditures by about $1,000. Kammen
says that makes only too much sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This society is being literally bludgeoned to death to be more
consumer-oriented,'' he says. ``At a time when many Americans have
felt more prosperous, advertisers have been very astute in trying
to make available a huge variety of products that people find
attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   This spending spree has its dangers, however.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Davis, the shopping expert, seriously doubts that we
are always getting more for our money. Starbucks, in her opinion,
doesn't have that much on Folgers.
</P>
<P>
   Second, ``There is this illusion of more disposable income, but
we still have people paying 17 percent interest on credit cards
because they can't afford what they bought,'' Kammen says.
``Advertisers are creating the `I wants' and Americans are thinking
`I need.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's that whole keeping-up-with the-Joneses mentality.
</P>
<P>
   This nation of big spenders is leaving a smaller cash-poor
demographic in a cloud of grocery receipts, bills and unfulfilled
want lists. As pinpointed in 1997 by the Census Bureau, a great
socioeconomic divide is emerging through this economy; the rich are
getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer. Affluent America
and anguished America have turned against each other and are
quickly marching in very different directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who cannot afford or even
contemplate upscaling their tastes,'' Kammen says. ``For them,
shopping at Wal-Mart is a necessity. Just figuring out which of
this month's bills must go unpaid is a part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet they are not ignorant of the prosperity that surrounds and
nearly plagues them. They see it on TV in ``Frasier's'' apartment
and ``Ally'' ``McBea''l's hip new digs, hear it on the radio, and
watch it walking down the aisles at Wal-Mart, where they are no
longer the most targeted demographic. It's almost as if corporate
America is simply turning its head.
</P>
<P>
   So, Kammen says, they justify.
</P>
<P>
   ``When asked if they envy the lifestyle of the people on TV,
they say no,'' he says. ``Because what they see on TV or movies in
relation to prosperous living is dysfunctional families, not to
suggest there are no dysfunctional families among them, but they
tend to be churchgoing, less materialistic, and they know what they
can't afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``They work out a rationale for why they don't want or need it,
and say, `We are a close family, we have each other.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Kammen says, through all of this prosperity, all of
this blur, the reality is that the upscaling of America will
continue to assert itself on poor people and push them out of the
little worlds they've created for themselves. The direction they
will go is simply further back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amidst all of this affluence, at least 20 to 25 percent of the
country is just making it, and the middle class is going deeply
into debt,'' he says. ``A run of prosperity for a decade is an
unprecedented phenomenon, and there is bound to be a correction
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's going to hurt the underclass very severly, especially
minorities and women: They're less likely to be hired, and single
moms have tough trade-off choices to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, his hypothesis is becoming increasingly apparent. As
always, the smaller ethnic demographics are getting a smaller piece
of the prosperity pie. There are very few upscale magazines
targeted to minorities. This fall, there will not be any minority
characters in lead roles on network TV. There are not upscale
Mexican restaurants; rather, they're billed as places to eat great
for less. Martha Stewart's pastels aren't made to appeal to bright
Hispanic neighborhoods. Soul food is not represented in Vegas' new
Bellagio hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In the Latino community, that small piece of the pie is Cristina
Saralegui, a talk-show hostess on the Spanish-language TV network
Univision.
</P>
<P>
   She talks about upscale issues, dresses flawlessly and never has
a hair out of place. She has been called a Hispanic Oprah, as
though the label is needed to explain her. It's almost as if she's
made to look like she's marketed to the masses, but only a very
small portion of Hispanics can actually identify with her success.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of cross-cultural comparison also happens in the Black
community. One star for the Black upper-class, TV goddess Barbara
Smith, has been labeled a ``Black Martha Stewart.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, B. Smith, as she is known, will have her own
magazine, ``B.'' ``Smith Style,'' but, according to the ``New York
Times,'' the publication's success is hinged on Smith's crossover
appeal: 75 percent of the viewers of her television show, ``B.
Smith, With Style,'' are White.
</P>
<P>
   However, for the most part, and most of the country, these years
will go down as an era of good fortune, good coffee and great TV
dinners.
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget Martha, the real Lady Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Give her your tired and your poor. She will provide them with
great, cheap sheets. &QL;

IN UPSCALE AMERICA, NO LUXURY IS TOO MUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Wal-Mart is installing cappuccino bars. Oprah is
hawking haute literature. TV is fine, but Bose home theater is very
much the dream screen.
</P>
<P>
   The sport utility vehicle has trumped the station wagon.
Wolfgang Puck has his own TV dinners at Fry's. Phoenix Art Museum
ads are nestled between Britney Spears and Cher on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   There are dog-biscuit bakeries, Ralph Lauren restaurants and
concierges at apartment complexes. Even cigar bars, chic home decor
at Target and brand-name water.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the pretty little picture? Right under our upturned
noses, America is going decidedly upscale.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in American economic history, there is what
cultural analyst David Frum has dubbed a ``mass upper class,'' and
popular taste is leaning toward the ritzy, glitzy and generally
costly _ or imitations of same.
</P>
<P>
   It is the offspring of the indulgence that comes with a record
economy, record media saturation and record available credit.
</P>
<P>
   It's also just a simple '90s way of thinking, a cultural melange
that we're going to pin on Martha Stewart. &QL; 
(at)j  &QL; 
The fashion bomb
</P>
<P>
   (at)j  &QL; 
Long the bastion of the East Coast elite, Martha was the darling of
proper domestic tranquillity. Her name was a lifestyle, her ideas
sublime. She was inaccessible and nearly impossible to mimic.
(Turns out, few people are still sewing their own linen sheets
these days.)
</P>
<P>
   But Martha was a force. Slowly, there were specialty books _ on
weddings, on dinner parties, on the holidays. There was a pretty
magazine, ``Martha Stewart Living,'' followed by a television
program filmed at her oh-so-perfect Connecticut estate. But
Martha's world still seemed reserved for the elite and the fussy
until April 1997, when she dropped a bomb, fashioned out of yards
and yards of pretty pastel sheets and towels, onto mainstream
American retail. All of a sudden, Martha was at K-Mart, and average
America was hip. East Coast elite was accessible. Better yet, it
was cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Her empire caught fire. She bought her magazine from Time
Warner, launched an upscale, expensive mail-order catalog, started
a Web site and a line of paints and, this fall, will introduce a
series of fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Target (affectionately called Tar-ZHAY by
tongue-in-cheek bargain hunters) gave downscaling the upscale a
try. The retail monster rolled out a home-decor line by famed
architect Michael Graves, the genius behind things as wildly
different and aesthetically amazing as the Walt Disney Swan Hotel
in Orlando and an addition to the Whitney Museum &UR; in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to appeal to a more design-savvy customer,'' says
Target Vice President Ron Johnson, the man behind Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the Michael Graves toaster _ a sleek, curvy, hip little
number _ began flying off the shelves. Turns out, Americans really
liked the idea that more could be had for less, and the mass upper
class expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Target, by the way, now advertises in ``Martha Stewart Living.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, not to be left out in the glitz category, began
testing upscale coffee bars in select Midwestern locations.
According to Melissa Brown, a company spokeswoman, that idea has
been successful and might just fly nationwide. (Wal-Mocha,
anyone?) &QL; 
(at)j  &QL; 
We'll even pay for oxygen
</P>
<P>
   (at)j  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And this is only on the discount-chain level. Upscale wants to
fill your coffee cup and hold it in its cupholder, especially if
you are driving to Barnes &AMP; Noble. It wants to own your remote
control and your home appliances. It has its eye on entire cities.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai, the vehicle line re nowned for its cheapness, recently
revamped its image into something attractive and desirable. Places
such as oxygen bars have been seeping into the culture, suggesting
that Americans are ready to pay for nearly anything au courant, no
matter if the expense is frivolous and otherwise free. Even the 25
cent cup of coffee is resigned to the $2.25 double-tall latte from
Starbucks, an example that Rommie Davis, a trend-spotting shopping
professional from Los Angeles, finds quite telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starbucks gives you style and cachet, and it's accessible to
anyone,'' she says. ``Americans are allowing themselves these
little luxuries and taking pleasure in doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Those little luxuries are also transferring to a cerebral level.
As America is increasingly steeped in highbrow culture, some of the
previously elite-only tastes are starting to work their way into
the average American mind, (and onto the tongue, as in the case of
Puck's new mainstream frozen TV dinners.)
</P>
<P>
   Think of Oprah's Book Club: Literary fiction, a genre once
ignored by mass culture, has been canonized by a TV personality.
Even the bookstore, once a small fixture in a mall, has turned into
multiple large businesses built on the megaplex concept. (They have
pricey coffee there, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Our cultural icons have also taken a turn for prosperity. No
longer are we content to watch the cast of ``Cheers'' struggle in a
dingy bar. Now, we prefer to tune in to ``Frasier'' and his antics
at his luxury digs. (And when the scripts force Frasier out of
work, ratings plummet. A successful society wants successful
counterparts.)
</P>
<P>
   Upscaling is even happening in whole cities. Las Vegas, long the
land of the $1.99 family buffet, has morphed into a fine-dining
destination with world-class restaurant art collections and the
world's second Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, a place of grunge and rain, is being cited as a city
that has finally ``arrived'' due to the addition of a new symphony
hall and a baseball stadium to its skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Chandler is experiencing record prosperity. Previously
thought of as a sleepy, smallish suburb, Chandler is now home to
day spas and, soon enough, Arizona's second Nordstrom. Never mind
that just a year ago we were convinced that with just one Nordstrom
shoe department, the entire Valley would live happily ever after. &QL; 
(at)j  &QL; 
An eclectic America
</P>
<P>
   (at)j  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to Michael Kammen, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and
renowned Cornell University historian, this downscale-goes-upscale
and vice-versa phenomenon is a product of our melting-pot culture
melting even more and is simply a way of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become far more eclectic,'' he says, and no longer feel
defined by social class, taste levels and economic means.
</P>
<P>
   Just look to our leadership, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Clinton's (presidential) inauguration, the music was by
Fleetwood Mac,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   An arena conventionally marked by power and prestige was brought
down to a mass level; the anointing of the leader of the free world
became a rock concert, on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   This upscaling is very much a recent thing. With a dutiful nod
to the '80s, the decade of excess, those years were marked by a
vast disparity. Yes, that was when we birthed the Lexus and when
jeans without designer labels became unworthy of the ranch. That
decade paved the way for the way we live today: Starbucks would
have starved if America hadn't bonded with brands. However, it was
also when the mass middle class was anything but upscale. People
were either drenched in money or they were late on the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the word ``upscale'' was not introduced to a
dictionary until 1966. Similarly, ``lifestyle'' was not added until
1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were synonyms, and it's not as though no one thought
about it, but the fact that people were presenting themselves to
communities in a particular way, were concerned about having
watched a certain program, et cetera, was very new,'' Kammen says.
</P>
<P>
   He cites a chart published in ``Life'' magazine on April 11,
1949, as the turning point, the day that ``The Grapes of Wrath''
and ``The Great Gatsby'' began to edge together and American taste
levels began to blur.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Which Are You?'' the piece was a graph sectioned off by
labels: ``highbrow,'' ``upper-middle brow,'' ``lowbrow,'' etc. Next
to each level of brow-being was a list of icons that defined that
socioeconomic status. For example, a highbrow person would listen
to Lizst and a lowbrow person would be a fan of folk. The
categories ranged from libations to reading, food to furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The article) set off a huge rage,'' said Kammen, who reprints
it in his recent book, ``American Culture, American Tastes.'' ``It
became a favorite parlor game. People would sit around and say,
`Which are you?'
</P>
<P>
   ``The huge irony is that when that chart appeared, that was the
peak of explicit public recognition, that was exactly the moment in
time when taste levels began to blur,'' says Kammen, citing the
paperback revolution as one of the catalysts.
</P>
<P>
   That era was the first time classics were mass-marketed and
available in more affordable, lower-quality forms. &QL; 
(at)j  &QL; 
`I want' vs. `I need'
</P>
<P>
   (at)j  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, the blur has really taken off partly because of the
abundance of money (``it's the economy, stupid''), partly because
of record media saturation and partly due to the ease by which
credit is obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Juliet B. Schor, author of ``The Overspent American,'' says that

   SCI-TSIEN-MOUSE (Undated) _ A Scientist-at-Work profile: The
world has been frenetically beating on the door of Joe Z. Tsien,
the biologist who announced last week he had created a smarter
strain of mouse. Within this enveloping chaos, Tsien has spun
around himself a small bubble of protective serenity. He calmly
describes the remarkable journey that led him from Wu Shi, a small
town near Shanghai, to the position of having made a significant,
maybe decisive, contribution to understanding the nature of memory.

   SCI-ELECTRON-BONDS (Undated) _ Of the roughly 20 million
chemical substances scientists have catalogued, nearly all are
assemblages of atoms linked together by electronic bonds. The quest
to understand these tiny bonds _ the very glue of material
existence _ is the heart of chemical science. A step in this quest
was reported last week with the publication of the sharpest direct
images ever made of electronic bonds, known as orbitals. The shapes
revealed by these images _ doughnut-like rings, dumbbell-shaped
lobes and arrays suggestive of butterfly wings _ confirmed
theoretical predictions of what these bonds should look like in the
particular molecule under study. By Malcolm W. Browne. (1050 words)

   SCI-DIABETES (Undated) _ With rates of diabetes soaring, experts

   SCI-CREATIVITY (Undated) _ Scientists trying to program
creativity discovered that when they fed a formula into a computer,
it generated advertising concepts judged more original and
appealing than equivalent advertisements spawned by a group of
humans. The program demonstrates what many creative people know
intuitively: that the land of the imagination is a country like any
other, with laws, rituals and a tireless police corps that must be
obeyed if one hopes to retain citizenship there. By Natalie Angier.

   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column. Coffee
lovers take heed: For the sake of your health, you might consider
switching at least some of those daily cups of java for tea. Not
herbal tea but ``real'' tea _ green tea, black tea, Chinese tea,
fruit-flavored tea, with or without caffeine, lemon, milk or sugar.
As long as the leaves come from the plant Camellia sinensis, tea
will contain potent antioxidant chemicals that have been linked to
protection against major diseases like cancer and heart disease.
Even the caffeine in tea may be somewhat beneficial, emerging
evidence suggests. By Jane E. Brody. (1350 words)

   SCI-DNA-VACCINE (Undated) _ Scientists at Stanford University
have found that a simple solution of DNA and water applied to the
skin of mice can induce an immune response comparable to one from
traditional intramuscular injection. The DNA vaccine was apparently
taken up through the hair follicles of the mice; nude mice (mice
without hair) did not show the same reaction. By Anne Eisenberg.

THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY _ THEY'RE ALL MYTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 12)  
(lb) 
(Margalit Fox, an editor of The New York Times Book Review, writes
frequently about language and linguistics. William Safire is on
vacation.) 
 By MARGALIT FOX   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Which of the following beliefs do you hold?
</P>
<P>
   _ There is a single standard variety of American English,
distinguished by level Midwestern pronunciation, correct usage and
logical grammatical agreement.
</P>
<P>
   _ Varieties of English that differ greatly from the standard are
best considered substandard dialects.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the United States, as elsewhere, official encouragement of
more than one language is an impediment to national unity.
</P>
<P>
   All of these beliefs about language are widely accepted. They
are advanced by educators, lawmakers and members of the news media.
They inform public discourse and public policy, including the
controversy over ebonics and successful attempts to curtail
bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   And they are all myths, reflecting widespread popular
misconceptions about how language works.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone has an opinion about language. In perhaps no
other field, scholars who study social attitudes toward language
say, is unscientific folk belief so consistently enshrined in
high-level policy.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if, they say, the federal government seriously
entertained a plan to harvest cheese from the moon. ``People would
never pontificate about a physics issue, because they would
acknowledge that you need to consult an expert,'' says Donna
Christian, the president of the Center for Applied Linguistics, in
Washington. ``But they wouldn't hesitate to pontificate about
language.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, a number of scholars have undertaken
serious study of these grass-roots opinions, a discipline that
Dennis R. Preston, a linguist at Michigan State University, calls
``folk linguistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Examining what ordinary people believe to be true about
language, they say, allows us to identify some of the deeper
impulses beneath the public battles: among them, fear of the
unfamiliar, insistence on language ``standards'' as a way of
preserving the social status quo, and the condemnation of
``substandard'' speech as a coded expression of prejudice against
the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we learn to appreciate diversity,'' Preston says, ``then
the way we talk has to be included.''
</P>
<P>
   Judged on purely linguistic grounds, all languages _ and all
dialects _ have equal merit. All spring from the same human
cognitive faculties; all have the same expressive potential and
operate according to the same kinds of logical rule systems. Why,
then, are some dialects considered substandard?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is simple: Judgments about relative worth _ that
Walter Cronkite speaks ``better'' English than, say, a black
inner-city teen-ager _ are socially determined. ``I can't think of
any situations in the United States where low-prestige groups have
high-prestige language systems,'' says Walt Wolfram, a linguist at
North Carolina State University who is an authority on American
dialects.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how the idea of socially stigmatized language played
out in the ebonics debate, which began at the end of 1996 after the
Oakland, Calif., school board publicly affirmed the variety of
English spoken by the district's black students _ known as
African-American vernacular English, or ebonics _ and acknowledged
its usefulness as a pedagogical tool in the teaching of mainstream
English.
</P>
<P>
   The wording of the Oakland resolution was awkward in places,
leaving it open to misinterpretation, but the linguistic
recommendations at its core were sound. What's more, they were
nothing new. Three decades before, the linguist William Labov
demonstrated in seminal articles, including ``The Logic of
Nonstandard English,'' that African-American English, like all
language varieties, displays its own, perfectly regular systems of
grammatical concord; they are simply different from the ones most
white speakers are accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement from Oakland set off a firestorm.
Commentators, including many African-Americans, excoriated ebonics
as ``broken'' English. The Oakland board appeared to backpedal: A
task force it appointed ultimately released a report in which the
word ``ebonics'' never appeared.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the level of outrage, it helps to tease out the
two folk-linguistic beliefs at the heart of the debate: the myth of
standard English and its corollary, the myth of substandard
English.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans believe that there exists a single standard
dialect _ the one broadcasters use _ kept free of regional and
vernacular encroachments. But in reality, no one such creature
exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you said to anyone, `Here's a room; put the hundred people
in there you think speak the best English,' you'd get people that
speak all different kinds of English,'' the linguist Rosina
Lippi-Green says. ``You'd get Dan Rather, who has a little bit of
Texan; you'd get Peter Jennings, who's Canadian. They wouldn't be
stigmatized varieties of English, but they wouldn't be the same
variety of English.''
</P>
<P>
   But if we allow all these diverse Englishes into the pantheon,
how can we keep out the ones that discomfort us, like
African-American vernacular or working-class Brooklynese? That is
where language myth comes in.
</P>
<P>
   One function of myth, as Lippi-Green points out in her book
``English With an Accent'' (Routledge, 1997), is to provide a
rationale for preserving the existing social order. The myths of
standard and substandard English do just that, permitting those in
power to label others inferior on the basis of their ``broken''
language. ``Nobody speaks `nonstandard' or `substandard'
language,'' Preston explains, ``unless they are regarded as
nonstandard or substandard human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   But in matters of language, the myth of ``good'' vs. ``bad'' is
viscerally ingrained. That is why it seduced even black
commentators, who would have instantly condemned racism in any
other guise. ``Even people who claim not to be prejudiced,''
Preston says, ``believe in the linguistic part of this myth.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly with the myth of national unity. This folk belief,
linguists say, underpinned ballot initiatives like Proposition 227,
which effectively ended bilingual education in California last
year. (A drive to place a similar initiative on the ballot is under
way in Arizona.) In reality, they say, there is no evidence that
civic unity stems from sharing a single national language _ look at
Switzerland, whose three official languages don't seem to have done
it any harm.
</P>
<P>
   Why do language myths endure? They have, Lippi-Green says, a
disturbing utility: ``Right now, it's very hard for people to talk
about race _ they feel they can't say, `I don't like black people;
I don't like Asians.' But they are very comfortable saying, `That
person doesn't speak English to my satisfaction.' So it stands in
for things we'd rather not talk about.''

 &HT;    INTERROGATIONS OF PALESTINIANS USE HOODS, SHAKINGS, SLEEP
DEPRIVATION
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM The worst is the shaking.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates are handcuffed and shackled, then shaken violently. It
goes on repeatedly, each bout lasting about five seconds. Inmates
say they lose sensation in their heads, pass out or throw up.
Later, some complain of damaged vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   Ten inmates have died in interrogation since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The shaking is one of the abuses of Palestinian prisoners
specifically banned Monday by the Israeli supreme court. In an
unprecedented ruling, the court ordered that Israel's secret
service stop using the widespread tactics of physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear if the security officials might find ways to
circumvent the ruling. They say they must be rough in order to find
out about imminent bomb threats. But, human rights activists say
it's more often used to force confessions or conduct fishing
expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   In a Jerusalem office Monday, Nawwaf Al-Qaysi, a 24-year-old
Palestinian from Bethlehem, was shown a clean hood silimar to those
that inmates are kept in for hours. He smiled and said it was not
like the one that he was forced to wear, which reeked of vomit.
</P>
<P>
   He underwent interrogations in 1997 in the Russian Compound
prison, a cluster of non-descript low buildings surrounded by rolls
of barbed wire in downtown Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he was released without charges, but for three
months interrogators tried to get him to sign confessions that he
was a member of a terror group and trained terrorists in using
weapons. He wouldn't confess.
</P>
<P>
   He said they kept him arched over a chair for hours while he
cried and screamed for help. When he asked for relief, his
interrogators asked if that meant he was ready to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always told my interrogator,
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to tell the judge about the methods you are using
against me,''' says Al-Qaysi. ``He would say,
</P>
<P>
   The judge is your enemy, who are you going to complain to?'''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, hundreds
of prisoners face this every year under the captivity of a giant
Israeli interrogation bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   While the official name for it is ``moderate physical
pressure,'' human rights groups call it ``torture.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other names involved. There is the ``frog,'' in which
inmates are forced to crouch for hours with their hands tied behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   There is the ``table press,'' in which inmates are made to squat
on the floor while their hands are pulled up behind their backs and
cuffed at head level to a table top. Interrogators will sit on the
table jam their feet down on the inmates' shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Interrogators also cuff inmates into, or arched backward over,
tiny chairs. Inmates are handcuffed to pipes high on the wall,
requiring them to stand on their toes for hours.
</P>
<P>
   A B'Tselem report displays logs kept by interrogators of just
how long inmates were made to squat or were deprived of sleep.
Doctors occasionally check their health.
</P>
<P>
   B'Tselem also showed that often the interrogations would stop
over the weekends, when interrogators took days off. According to
the group this belies the assertion that the interrogations are
needed to thwart imminent terror attacks.

 &HT;    Eds: corrects time of shaking from minutes to seconds
 &HT;    ISRAELI SUPREME COURT OUTLAWS PHYSICAL ABUSE, MANY CALL TORTURE,
OF PALESTINIANS
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM - In a landmark decision, the Israeli supreme court
Monday outlawed the systematic use of sleep depravation, violent
shakings and other physical abuse of Palestinians under
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   The decision strikes at a widespread tactic born from decades of
Middle East conflict and one of the most criticized aspects of
Israel's democracy. While many countries use even harsher methods
and deny it, Israel has been unique in setting up legal procedures
and attempting to justify what most human rights groups call
torture.
</P>
<P>
   The official Israeli term is ``moderate physical pressure'' and
most Israelis consider it necessary to prevent terrorism.
Immediately after the ruling Monday, politicians said the decision
weakens the country's ability to thwart terror attacks and called
for new laws to circumvent the decision.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that just a day before, car bombs were detonated in
two Israeli cities, though no Israelis died. Prime Minister Ehud
Barak did not issue any statement Monday about whether the
mistreatment would stop or whether the court order would be
enforced. (eds need to check wires on this to update)
</P>
<P>
   ``It may cause real damage to our ability to fight terror,''
Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh told Israel Radio.
``It's very nice to have liberal legislation, maybe it is good in
Scandinavia or Western Europe or North America, but in our part of
the world, where we have fought terrorism so bitterly, such a
verdict is almost completely irrelevant to the world we live in.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the court opinion addressed the ``difficult reality in
which Israel finds herself security wise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although a democracy must often fight with one hand tied
behind its back, it nonetheless has the upper hand,'' the ruling
stated. It added a democracy's rule of law and protection of
liberty ``strengthen its spirit and strength and allows it to
overcome its difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling leaves security officials immune from legal
prosecution if they can show that mistreatment was committed out of
a life-saving necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, human rights activists considered the ruling a major
victory.
</P>
<P>
   They have long disputed the security establishment's assertion
that the physical abuse is used to find ``ticking bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they say the mistreatment is usually used to fish for
information and extract confessions. They note that interrogations
frequently stop during weekends when interrogators get their day's
rest a sign they are not seeking to stop attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, 10 Palestinians have died under interrogation and
thousands have been subject to torture, according to the Israeli
human rights group B'Tselem(cq).
</P>
<P>
   ``What it has become is a whole bureaucracy of torture, a whole
army of bureaucrats and doctors and lawyers,'' said B'Tselem
Executive Director Eitan Felner. ``Finally, the High Court of
Justice said, even in the name of security, there are some things
that cannot be justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Felner said other countries facing terrorism, including the
United States and Great Britain, outlaw torture. But, he said the
practice has grown here out of the ``siege mentality that Israel
developed over the last 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   (Optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   At least since the early 1970s, Israel has used physical
mistreatment against Palestinians the techniques are infrequently
used against Jewish Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli law forbids the physical abuse of inmates. But, since
1987, regulations from the prime minister established procedures,
including court oversight, for the abuse to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Monday's ruling, issued in response to an appeal from
six Palestinian victims and four human rights groups, stated that
regulations cannot be used if they go against the country's law.
</P>
<P>
   Often, according to a government commission, security services
have lied to judges about the methods being used. Other times, they
get approval from the courts by arguing that there is an emergency
security need for extreme treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous treatment is violent shaking while an
inmate's hands and feet are cuffed. It leaves them dazed, nauseous
and sometimes with spinal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many inmates are made to squat on the ground while their
hands are cuffed, behind their back at head level. Some are
handcuffed hanging from pipes so they must spend hours on their
toes.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates are frequently hooded for hours or days, forced to stay
awake for days, and subjected to loud music or screaming.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Abd(cq) Al-Ahmar, from Bethlehem, said he was
subjected to interrogations for two months in 1996, after being
arrested for reasons never explained to him. He was never charged,
but was taken to the barbed-wire-enclosed Russian Compound jail in
the heart of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would be shaken for three to five seconds at a time.
Sometimes he passed out and awoke in the infirmary. Sometimes,
security agents would bring a mirror to show him his bloodshot eyes
and ashen face.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't look like yourself,'' he said. ``Sometimes a person
feels like it's three hours they've been shaken.''

 &HT;    City homers on sports travelers
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta and the South are high scorers when it comes
to drawing sports travelers to the area.
</P>
<P>
   The city tied with Chicago for getting the biggest chunk _ 4
percent _ of the nation's 75.3 million adults who attended
organized sports events in the last five years, according to a
study by the Washington, D.C.-based Travel Industry Association of
America.
</P>
<P>
   For most of those travelers, attending the sporting event was
the primary reason for the trip, the TIA survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Others attended games while in town for conventions, business
meetings or personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Only those visitors who traveled at least 50 miles from home
were included in the survey, which looked at both sports spectators
and participants.
</P>
<P>
   The results brought high-fives from officials at the Atlanta
Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ACVB officials recently invited dozens of journalists to tour
Atlanta, which they billed as ``the sports capital of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were close, and we have a heck of a story to tell,''
said Bill Howard, ACVB vice president of communications and
tourism. ``This simply validates our claim. The story is that
Atlanta has cornered the market in sports business.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite.

   While Atlanta ties Chicago in garnering the biggest share of
overall sports travelers, it ranks somewhat lower when it comes to
the percentage of overall visitors who take in a sporting event
while they are here.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that one out of every 10 visitors to Atlanta
takes in one sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine cities had higher percentages, including Charlotte
with 19 percent; Indianapolis, 17 percent; and Milwaukee, 13
percent. Those metropolitan areas also have smaller number of
visitors than Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can read this as you're doing well, but maybe you can get
the percentage up a little higher,'' said Dexter Koehl, a TIA
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The region also did well. Thirty-nine percent of people across
the nation who traveled for sports events did so to attend an event
in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it has to do a little bit with climate. You have a
much longer season when it's warm and people can participate in
outdoor sports,'' said Koehl. The number of professional teams and
the number of universities in the area also help.
</P>
<P>
   While this is the first year the TIA has released the study, few
doubt the economic benefits of sports in the Atlanta area. When a
big sporting event is held in the area, the big scorer is not
necessarily on the field. Restaurants, hotels and retailers all
stand to benefit.

 &HT;    Prime time gets even younger as youth take center stages in new
series
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here they come, barreling down their high school
hallway, three high school girls, each better-looking and more
stuck-up than the next, cutting through the losers clogging the
hallway, snapping out: ``Move. Move. Move.''
</P>
<P>
   That one scene, in Fox's upcoming be-cruel-to-your-school series
``Manchester Prep,'' nicely sums up the coming onslaught of new
fall TV shows: Get out of the way, geezers. The kids are here.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has there been such a one-time flood of new shows
set in high schools, or about teenagers and their families, as in
the coming fall television season. Six new series focus almost
exclusively on adolescents, three others deal with teenagers
prominently as parts of families, and they join seven returning
shows, from ``Sabrina the Teenage Witch'' and ``Moesha'' to
``Dawson's Creek'' (arguably the show that started this teen
tsunami). That's at least 16 series to make you realize that
television is no longer the ``vast wasteland'' that Newton Minow
famously described in 1961, but a teenage wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   Hearts will be broken, bullies will be fought, cheerleaders will
be envied, angst will be analyzed, parents will be eye-rolled and
``whatevered'' into oblivion, and sex _ talking about it, if not
always doing it _ will be more widespread than Oxy 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``High school is our one universal experience,'' says Thomas
Hine, author of the new book ``The Rise and Fall of the American
Teenager.'' ``Everything else is becoming more diverse, but very
little has changed about high school. More people can identify with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's a school of thought that nobody ever gets over high
school. ``So much of what you experience during that time of life
stays with you,'' says Gina Matthews, co-creator of the new WB
series ``Popular.'' ``It never, ever ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this season, anyway, as prime-time TV keeps getting younger
and younger. A decade ago, one of the most talked-about shows on
television was the Emmy-winning ``thirtysomething.'' Five years ago
this month, ``Friends'' debuted, launching a spate of copycat shows
about single people in their 20s. Now television's aim is squarely
at teens, an audience that was barely served a few years ago with
only a handful of shows such as ``Blossom'' and ``Clarissa Explains
It All.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks are increasingly chronologically challenged,''
says John Rash, senior vice president of the ad-buying firm
Campbell Mithun Espy. ``They're trying to program younger so
they're sampled by an entire generation that's been reared on
cable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time since the baby boom generation that the
mainstream media have really been catering to teens,'' says Hine.
Chalk it up to a couple of factors: Changing demographics and the
emergence of the WB.
</P>
<P>
   There are now about 31 million teenagers (ages 12-19) in the
United States, the largest number there has been since the baby
boom. According to the marketing firm Teen Research Unlimited, they
spend more than $120 billion a year of their own and their
families' money.
</P>
<P>
   The WB was the first network to exploit this phenomenon with
true zeal. Its lineup of shows, including ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer,'' ``7th Heaven,'' ``Felicity'' and, of course, ``Dawson,''
doesn't get a fraction of the audience of heavyweights such as ``60
Minutes'' or ``Frasier.'' But they generate tremendous buzz, and
advertisers love them: The WB's ad sales for the coming season were
up 50 percent this summer, far more than any other network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WB used to be a joke, but now it's taken oh-so-seriously.
We all get it,'' says Leeza Gibbons, who anchored a report about
``Hollywood's Youth Obsession'' on the cable network E! last month.
</P>
<P>
   The recent, parallel explosion of teen-themed feature movies has
fed, and fed off of, television's growing teen-mania. By the end of
this year, the four cast members of ``Dawson'' will have appeared
in 13 movies since the show debuted in early 1998. This spring's
movie ``Cruel Intentions'' starred Sarah Michelle Gellar of
``Buffy,'' Joshua Jackson of ``Dawson'' and Selma Blair of ``Zoe,
Duncan, Jack and Jane,'' all on the WB; then ``Cruel Intentions''
was turned into the upcoming Fox series ``Manchester Prep.''
Jennifer Love Hewitt is both a young movie and TV star; her Fox
spinoff, ``Times of Your Life,'' will get a strong teen turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everything is going the WB's way. ``If you're
selling Viagra, you're not going to do it at the WB,'' jokes CBS
President Leslie Moonves.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason teen shows are successful, and expanding, is
that teenagers are ``early adapters,'' picking up on new things
first. The idea is to then get younger children and adults on the
bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the WB's audience is in the 18-49 age group that
advertisers want most. And Paul Feig, creator of NBC's ``Freaks and
Geeks,'' says his show is aimed at adults with small children who
stay home on Saturday nights and don't have anything to watch. The
show's somewhat rueful nostalgia, harking back to 1980, is
reminiscent of ``The Wonder Years,'' a show that drew more adults
than children.
</P>
<P>
   (Rash, of ad agency Campbell Mithun Espy, says ``Freaks and
Geeks'' is the best of the new teen-themed shows, ``but it's going
to face Nielsen detention unless it gets expelled from its Saturday
night time period.'')
</P>
<P>
   As for preteens who might watch, concerned parents should know
that most of these shows deal pretty frankly in sexuality, although
it's interesting where different shows draw the line on different
topics. Fox's ``Manchester Prep'' has a teenage girl ogling her
nude stepbrother in the shower and later trying to seduce him. But
on ``Freaks and Geeks,'' when the young rebels go outside to a
``smoking patio,'' no one is shown smoking. ``We didn't want to
promote it,'' says Feig. ``You can't help but glamorize it.''
</P>
<P>
   But one area that nearly all of the teen shows will work
relentlessly is the idea of cliques in high schools, of ins and
outs, a subject that can be dealt with lightheartedly or with
seriousness, particularly in the wake of the Columbine High School
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone know what it's like at some point not to fit in,''
says Sarah Michelle Gellar of ``Buffy.'' ``Everyone thinks that
it's only their pain, and that only they feel it. But everyone
feels it on different levels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we're studying is this problem of teenage
alienation, the sense of not being part of the high school
experience, and being excluded,'' says WB Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Kellner. Both ``7th Heaven'' and the new series ``Safe
Harbor'' are planning several episodes about teen alienation; the
idea of being an outsider is central to ``Roswell''; and the
conflicts among various high school cliques are at the core of
``Freaks and Geeks'' and ``Popular.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hine warns that the TV industry may have overdone it.
Teenagers are notoriously difficult to capture for regular viewing.
``This is an audience that's restless, that has a lot of other
things competing for its time,'' he notes. ``Television may be
going off a cliff with this.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds against most new prime-time series are brutal anyway,
even without the oversaturation of a particular trend that Hine
warns against. Many of these new shows are destined to be canceled,
in which case the networks can at least live by the motto that
teenagers like to quote sometimes, if not actually embrace: Live
fast, die young, and leave a good-looking corpse.

``A STAR CALLED HENRY'' &QL; 
By Roddy Doyle (Viking, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You'll forgive us if we cut to the chase: This is one of the
best novels we've read all year, and better than Doyle's previous
books, although they were fine indeed. It's broader, richer than
``Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha,'' and less introspective than the somber
``The Woman Who Walked into Doors.'' Doyle's narrator is Henry
Smart, who tells us the story of the first 20 years of his life. He
begins just before the turn of the century with the meeting of his
parents, a teenage maker of rosary beads and a one-legged bouncer
who turns lowlifes away from a Dublin brothel. They are doomed, and
we know it _ babies arrive sick and die, poverty closes in, and we
see their love fade into the dirt and disease of the Dublin slums.
But before it does, Henry Smart is born, handsome, inexplicably
healthy and full of a promise that is too bright for such a dark
place. By the time he is 5, he is living on the streets, smart but
illiterate, and aware of his own gritty charm. When he is 14, he
takes part in the Easter Rising of 1916, and later becomes a
terrorist for the Irish Republican Army. Through it all, Henry's
savvy, rock-confident voice gathers us in. We know he is telling us
a true story, and yet at the same time spinning a tale _ he
survived childhood, after all, by dazzling and conning the adults
around him. In the end, ``A Star Called Henry'' is not just a novel
about one man but about Ireland itself, from a gifted writer who
knows that misery and laughter are not strangers to one another,
and that even the most rancorous place is not a hell if dreams are
still alive there. This is the first volume of a trilogy that will
take readers through modern Irish history by way of the life of
Henry Smart _ and won't we be glad to see him again. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FOOTBALL'S GREATEST PLAYERS'' &QL; 
(Sporting News, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Make sure when anyone tackles you he remembers
how much it hurts,' '' John Mackey said. ``He lived by that
philosophy and I always followed that advice.'' Mackey was talking
about Jim Brown, the Cleveland Browns' offensive powerhouse from
1957 to 1965 and the man this book calls ``the greatest pure runner
in the history of the NFL.'' Brown is top dog on the list of the
100 best football players of all time, compiled by editors of the
``Sporting News.'' Unlike its counterpart, last year's ``Baseball's
100 Greatest Players,'' this volume doesn't dabble much in the
early days, although the list has Jim Thorpe (at No. 88), Bronko
Nagurski (35), Don Hutson (6) and Otto Graham (7). Among the top 10
are Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Johnny Unitas, Lawrence Taylor and
Dick Butkus. There are photos and a brief overview of each player's
career, and it's all football _ there's only a mention of the
acting career for which Brown left the game at 29, and no notice at
all of O.J. Simpson's retirement activities. Best of all are ``Top
10'' lists (they range from ``Best Players I've Ever Seen'' to
``Defensive Linemen I Admire'' and ``Smartest Quarterbacks'')
solicited from some of the great players themselves, including
Merlin Olsen, Deacon Jones, Charley Taylor, Lance Alworth, Jack Ham
and Troy Aikman. Clear some time before you pick this one up,
because you won't put it down any time soon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE RIGHT SET'' &QL; 
Edited by Caryl Phillips (Vintage, $14) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We began to enjoy this anthology of writings on tennis round
about Page 45, when James Thurber suddenly appeared and described,
delightfully, the 1926 match between France's Suzanne Lenglen and
American Helen Wills, which caught the world's attention at the
time (Thurber's piece is followed by an essay from Wills herself,
which is also great fun). Earlier essays on the history of the game
have interesting titles (``Lawn Tennis: The Sturdy Bastard'') but
are for tennis zealots. For a more general audience, Phillips
includes excerpts from books by John McPhee, Arthur Ashe, Martina
Navratilova, Billie Jean King and Althea Gibson, and writings on
Chris Evert, Jimmy Connors, Boris Becker and Andre Agassi. There's
a section on tennis etiquette, with a preponderance of attention
paid to the nasty demeanor of the young John McEnroe, although
there's a short essay by Martin Amis in which those other bad boys,
Connors and Ilie Nastase, are mentioned. It ends with a few pages
from Alistair Cooke, titled ``My Life with Gabriela Sabatini,''
which are blissfully free of bad manners _ just what tennis should
be. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``WORDS FAIL ME: WHAT EVERYONE WHO WRITES SHOULD KNOW ABOUT
WRITING''By Patricia T. O'Conner (Harcourt Brace, $18.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The best writer may not follow every rule every time,''
O'Conner says, ``but they follow most of them most of the time. And
even if you're a Tolstoy or a Balzac, a Thurber or a McPhee, it
doesn't hurt to learn the rules before you break them.'' O'Conner
was an editor at the ``New York Times Book Review'' before she
wrote her first book, the very popular ``Woe Is I: The
Grammarphobe's Guide to Better English in Plain English.'' Now,
she's a self-described ``grammar maven'' (she's kidding) who
sometimes writes the ``Times' ''``On Language'' column when William
Safire is on vacation. She's obviously following her own advice _
know your audience _ because her approach to words and writing is
as engaging as it is authoritative, and she quotes lots of her
(and, presumably, your) favorite writers. Her justification for
writing this book, oddly enough, is the Internet _ we're all
writing more now that we have laptops and send e-mail, so we need
to brush up our skills. But truly, no hook was necessary. O'Conner
can be our grammar maven any day. &QL;

   ISRAEL-INTERROGATION _ JERUSALEM _ They chain them contorted and
arched over tiny chairs. They deprive them of sleep for days, keep
them under hoods reeking of vomit and sweat. Worst of all, they
handcuff them and shake them furiously, leaving them dazed and, in
a few cases, dead. These are the methods the Israeli secret service
calls ``moderate physical pressure'' in interrogations of
Palestinian prisoners. When the Israeli supreme court ruled Monday
the practice must stop, it did little to please Nawwaf al-Queisi,
who underwent the treatment for three months. WITH PHOTOS. (Kaplow,

   WIRED-CLASSROOM _ ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech has developed Classroom
2000, a completely wired classroom that allows everything the
professor writes and says to be audio and video taped directly into
a webpage for immediate access for students. For example, a student
can click on a word or name the the professor said in class and get
that portion of the class, in text, video and/or audio. This
relieves the students from the burden of taking detailed notes and
allows them to pay more attention in class. (Suggs, Atlanta

accident. Imagine all you have left of him are his 1-year-old
twins, a boy and a girl. Imagine that you have babysat for the
twins since birth, and you feel as close to them as your own
children. Then imagine that your daughter-in-law remarries and
won't let you see the kids. Imagine being told that, under Ohio

would cruise through September with a surf-dude's endless-summer
grin. Instead, I walked the dog out into the early morning and felt

 &HT;    ISRAELI SUPREME COURT OUTLAWS PHYSICAL ABUSE OF PALESTINIANS
 &HT;    (EDS: UPDATES and adds comments by Prime Minister Barek.)
 &HT;    By Larry Kaplow
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a landmark decision, the Israeli Supreme Court
Monday outlawed the systematic use of sleep depravation, violent
shakings and other physical abuse of Palestinians under
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   The decision strikes at a widespread tactic born from decades of
Middle East conflict, and one of the most criticized aspects of
Israel's democracy. While many countries use even harsher methods
and deny it, Israel has been unique in setting up legal procedures
and attempting to justify what most human rights groups call
torture.
</P>
<P>
   The official Israeli term is ``moderate physical pressure'' and
most Israelis consider it necessary to prevent terrorism.
Immediately after the ruling Monday, politicians said the decision
weakens the country's ability to thwart terror attacks and called
for new laws to circumvent the decision.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that just a day before, car bombs were detonated in
two Israeli cities, though no Israelis died.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak said in a statement after the ruling
that he ``respects'' the court's decision but that it will cause
difficulties for the country's security services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may cause real damage to our ability to fight terror,''
Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh told Israel Radio.
``It's very nice to have liberal legislation, maybe it is good in
Scandinavia or Western Europe or North America, but in our part of
the world, where we have fought terrorism so bitterly, such a
verdict is almost completely irrelevant to the world we live in.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the court opinion addressed the ``difficult reality in
which Israel finds herself security wise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although a democracy must often fight with one hand tied
behind its back, it nonetheless has the upper hand,'' the ruling
stated. It added a democracy's rule of law and protection of
liberty ``strengthen its spirit and strength and allows it to
overcome its difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling leaves security officials immune from legal
prosecution if they can show that mistreatment was committed out of
a life-saving necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such a large loophole, human rights activists considered
the ruling a major victory.
</P>
<P>
   They have long disputed the security establishment's assertion
that the physical abuse is used to find ``ticking bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they say the mistreatment is usually used to fish for
information and extract confessions. They note that interrogations
frequently stop during weekends when interrogators get their day's
rest, a sign they are not seeking to stop attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, 10 Palestinians have died under interrogation and
thousands have been subject to torture, according to the Israeli
human rights group B'Tselem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it has become is a whole bureaucracy of torture, a whole
army of bureaucrats and doctors and lawyers,'' said B'Tselem
Executive Director Eitan Felner. ``Finally, the High Court of
Justice said, even in the name of security, there are some things
that cannot be justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Felner said other countries facing terrorism, including the
United States and Great Britain, outlaw torture. But, he said the
practice has grown here out of the ``siege mentality that Israel
developed over the last 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   At least since the early 1970s, Israel has used physical
mistreatment against Palestinians the techniques are infrequently
used against Jewish Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli law forbids the physical abuse of inmates. But, since
1987, regulations from the prime minister established procedures,
including court oversight, for the abuse to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Monday's ruling, issued in response to an appeal from
six Palestinian victims and four human rights groups, stated that
regulations cannot be used if they go against the country's law.
</P>
<P>
   Often, according to a government commission, security services
have lied to judges about the methods being used. Other times, they
get approval from the courts by arguing that there is an emergency
security need for extreme treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous treatment is violent shaking while an
inmate's hands and feet are cuffed. It leaves them dazed, nauseous
and sometimes with spinal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many inmates are made to squat on the ground while their
hands are cuffed, behind their back at head level. Some are
handcuffed hanging from pipes so they must spend hours on their
toes.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates are frequently hooded for hours or days, forced to stay
awake for days, and subjected to loud music or screaming.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Abed al-Ahmar, from Bethlehem, said he was subjected
to interrogations for two months in 1996, after being arrested for
reasons never explained to him. He was never charged, but was taken
to the barbed-wire-enclosed Russian Compound jail in the heart of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would be shaken for three to five seconds at a time.
Sometimes he passed out and awoke in the infirmary. Sometimes,
security agents would bring a mirror to show him his bloodshot eyes
and ashen face.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't look like yourself,'' he said. ``Sometimes a person
feels like it's three hours they've been shaken.''

TRENDS POINT TO REAL, SHORT AND SUBTLE NAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long, brightly colored nails are dust. Real or fake, they have
been filed away, grown out, shed like an old snakeskin.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf through a fashion magazine. Every model and celebrity
featured is sporting natural nails _ nails that since the 1980s
have been found only on professional pianists, or possibly those in
medical professions.
</P>
<P>
   Today's status nails are short. If polished at all, they're
pale. Artificial nails still on hand are so short and subtle it
takes a detective to find them.
</P>
<P>
   Nail purists, who spent years hiding their unadorned nails while
long red talons flashed their way through fashionland, are having
the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Even the ``Fashion Police'' _ a k a columnist Jeannine Stein _
have declared that natural looking nails are in. And when nails are
the professionally applied acrylic variety, they shouldn't extend
more than a quarter of an inch, Stein declares.
</P>
<P>
   The spa that Nordstrom opened in its downtown Seattle store
doesn't offer artificial nails, or even polished nails in
manicures. Spa training director Lise Corriveau says Spa Nordstrom
is dedicated to promoting the health of the natural nail.
</P>
<P>
   Nails are oiled, conditioned and buffed three ways in a $35
manicure that doesn't end with coats of polish. Corriveau says
polish wouldn't adhere properly to nails that have been treated
with oils and a parafin dip.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Vartoughian, a nail guru who's been preaching and
practicing natural nail care in her Hollywood salon since 1969,
says she's seen the natural trend coming for the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   She believes acrylic nails made women more aware of their nails
and nail care. Consumers have become more demanding. It's no longer
about long nails; they want beautifully groomed hands, Vartoughian
says.
</P>
<P>
   Vartoughian's clients keep 32 manicurists booked. Customers are
expected to come in every 10 to 14 days for treatment, and their
nails had better look almost as good as they did when they left the
salon after the last visit. Daily home-maintenance isn't just
expected _ it's demanded.
</P>
<P>
   If a client breaks or tears off a nail, it's to be brought to
the salon where it's repaired without glues. Vartoughian even keeps
a nail bank of real nails for ``transplants.''
</P>
<P>
   Natural may be key, but Vartoughian's a believer in polish to
protect the nails _ two basecoats, two coats of polish, a top coat
then a ``brilliance'' layer to dry and finish the manicure. At
Seattle-area Gene Juarez salons, the natural nail trend has been
growing for about five years. Linda Green, director of nail
services, says artificial nails used to be about two-thirds of
their business. Today 85 percent of their customers are into
natural nails.
</P>
<P>
   Green defines ``natural'' nails as those without enhancements _
no acrylic, fiberglass or silk applied to nails. But polish is a
must. ``A nail should never be without protection,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Reardon, owner of Frenchy's in Madison Park, says
artificial nails were about 70 percent of business three years ago.
Today it's about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Reardon sees several reasons for the trend. ``We're going back
to a simpler, more practical way of looking at beauty. It's also
the Northwest style,'' she says. There's also a shortage of nail
technicians. A manicurist can do two ``natural'' manicures in the
time it takes to do maintenance on one set of fake nails.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding heavy maintenance is another reason nails are going
natural. Nina Ummel, owner of Ummelina Spa in downtown Seattle,
says women just don't have time to handle chipped polish, broken
nails and damage to natural nails.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that damage is simply annoying, some is serious. The
dermatology department at Seattle's Virginia Mason Clinic has seen
cases of fungal infections and contact dermatitis rise with the
popularity of acrylic nails. Even heavy coats of polish put nails
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand until it happens to them,'' says
Sharon Wells, a dermatology nurse. A typical treatment is 12 weeks
on an oral, anti-fungal medication _ an expensive prescription
that's not covered by all insurance companies, Wells says.
</P>
<P>
   And after all that, you have to wait for your nails to grow out
again.
</P>
<P>
   Not all manicures are created equal.
</P>
<P>
   There are plain manicures to remove polish, file, buff,
condition cuticles and re-polish. Prices usually start at about
$15. At some salons, polish is extra. At others, the more
experienced nail technicians cost more.
</P>
<P>
   Spa manicures are another category. Prices for these start at
$20 and go to $35 in the Seattle area. These usually include warm
soaks, heated mitts, oil treatments, possibly a parafin dip for the
hands. At some salons, clients rest on a bed in a treatment room
during the manicure.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes polish is included, and at least one spa doesn't offer
it at all, so it's best to find out what's available when making an
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   And appointments are necessary. Demand still outweighs supply.
So call ahead and specify what kind of services you need.

MONTINI-COLUMN (Undated) - There are moments in baseball that
aren't like anything else in sport because, in those moments,
everything changes and the game isn't about sport anymore but about
life. That's what happened Sunday afternoon in Atlanta when
Diamondback's catcher Kelly Stinnett, batting with two outs in the
top of the ninth inning and his team down by a run, struck out. By
EJ MONTINI. Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
UPSCALE (Phoenix) - Wal-Mart is installing cappuccino bars. Oprah
is hawking haute literature. TV is fine, but Bose home theater is
very much the dream screen. The sport utility vehicle has trumped
the station wagon. Wolfgang Puck has his own TV dinners at Fry's.
Phoenix Art Museum ads are nestled between Britney Spears and Cher
on the radio. There are dog-biscuit bakeries, Ralph Lauren
restaurants and concierges at apartment complexes. Even cigar bars,
chic home decor at Target and brand-name water. Getting the pretty
little picture? Right under our upturned noses, America is going
decidedly upscale. By JAMIEE ROSE. Story moved in the ``K'' and
``L'' catgories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TV-GOODY (Undated) _ Last March, ``60 Minutes II'' broadcast a
heartbreaking story chronicling England's postwar shipment of
10,000 children to Australia, where they were subjected to hunger,
abuse and other horrors in orphanages. In Phoenix, Mike Amphlett
tuned in. Briefly. ``I couldn't watch,'' Amphlett said. ``I just
went over to the kitchen and started gagging. That was it.''
Amphlett, you see, was one of the 10,000, one of those shipped to
Australia to relieve overcrowding in British orphanages. By BILL
GOODYKOONTZ. Story will move in the ``L'' category. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The remnants of Hurricane Dennis will continue to bring showers
and thunderstorms to portions of the Middle Atlantic States and New
England on Tuesday. In the Appalachians, the interaction of the
moisture from Dennis and an approaching cool front will lead to an
area of heavier rain in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Another region of scattered showers and thunderstorms will push
through New England, with some locations receiving as much as 2
inches of rain in tropical downpours. In addition, most of the
Northeast will remain very humid because of the tropical air mass
associated with the remains of Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, a weak jet-stream disturbance will pass over the
Gulf Coast, causing scattered showers and thunderstorms to erupt.
In south Texas, the remnants of a tropical depression that made
landfall in Mexico will bring numerous showers and thunderstorms
with heavy rainfall to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will develop ahead of a potent cyclone
crossing the northern Plains. A cold front extending south from
this low-pressure center marks the leading edge of cooler and drier
air moving to the south from Canada. Farther west, moisture
wrapping around this cyclone will promote abundant clouds and low
conditions in northern sections of Montana.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest will continue to remain sunny and hot with just a
few thunderstorms likely in the higher elevations of New Mexico.
Meanwhile, the Northwest will turn milder as offshore winds descend
the Cascades and become warmer, raising readings across western
Oregon and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Radar Rain Gauge
</P>
<P>
   While official rain gauges are located many miles apart, radar
can act as a giant rain gauge blanketing a large area. When
microwaves emitted by radar encounter raindrops, the amount of
energy returned to the radar site provides an estimate of the
rainfall rate. The relationship between the reflected energy and
the rainfall is a complex one that depends in part upon the size
and density of droplets in the clouds. On Monday some sites in the
east switched their radars in the tropical mode to provide better
estimates of rainfall from clouds comprising the remnants of
Hurricane Dennis.

   CHINA-NUKE (Undated) _ American bomb makers visiting China in
1979 were startled by a series of questions that suggested the
Chinese were hot on the trail of the secret to building a modern
nuclear arsenal, miniaturization. China succeeded in September
1992. Was China's advance the result of espionage, hard work or
some mix of the two? Experts agree that spying occurred, but clash
on what impact it had on Beijing's advance, if any. A review of the
dispute, based on interviews and disclosures of weapon and
intelligence secrets, suggests that the congressional report went
beyond the evidence in asserting that stolen secrets were the main
reason for China's breakthrough. The review also bolsters a point
of agreement among feuding experts: that the federal investigation
focused too soon on the Los Alamos Laboratory and one worker there,
Wen Ho Lee. A Special Report by William J. Broad. (The report has

PERSONAL HEALTH: TEA, THE LATEST HEALTH FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coffee lovers, take heed. For the sake of your health, you might
consider switching at least some of those daily cups of java for
tea. Not herbal tea but ``real'' tea _ green tea, black tea,
Chinese tea, fruit-flavored tea, with or without caffeine, lemon,
milk or sugar.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the leaves come from the plant Camellia sinensis, tea
will contain potent antioxidant chemicals that have been linked to
protection against major diseases like cancer and heart disease.
Even the caffeine in tea may be somewhat beneficial, emerging
evidence suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of tea in Japan and China may partly explain why
heart disease rates are so much lower in the Far East than in
Western countries.
</P>
<P>
   There are three types of real tea: green, black and oolong.
Green tea, which is most popular in Japan and China, has in recent
years found a small but growing following here as word about its
potential health benefits has leaked out. It is the least processed
of all the teas, made by quickly steaming or heating the leaves of
Camellia sinensis.
</P>
<P>
   Black tea, by far the most popular in Western countries and
India, is prepared by exposing tea leaves to air. That exposure
causes oxidation, which turns them a deep brown and intensifies
their flavor. The leaves are then crushed. According to Dr. Gary
Beecher, food chemist with the U &UR; .S.  &LR; Department of Agriculture,
black tea contains as much of the protective chemicals as green
tea, though the form may differ.
</P>
<P>
   Oolong is between the two: more processed than green tea but
less so than black tea. It is exposed to heat, light and crushing
for less time than black tea.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal teas, on the other hand, come from a wide variety of
plants other than the tea plant and may include roots and flowers
as well as leaves. Most herbal teas do not possess the antioxidant
properties of real tea, although they may contain certain other
biologically active compounds. A few also contain caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to common belief, green tea has as much caffeine as
black tea, though all teas have less caffeine than drip-brewed
coffee. A typical eight-ounce cup of tea prepared from one tea bag
brewed for three to five minutes contains 40 milligrams of
caffeine, compared with 100 milligrams in a cup of brewed coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The caffeine content of tea can range from 20 to 90 milligrams a
cup, depending on the blend of tea leaves, method of preparation
and length of brewing time, whereas a cup of coffee may contain
from 60 to 180 milligrams of caffeine. Decaffeinated tea, like
decaffeinated coffee, has about 4 milligrams of caffeine per cup.
</P>
<P>
   Instant teas and prepared iced teas, which can be purchased with
or without caffeine, may be too highly processed to contain much of
the protective chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1990s researchers exploring the health effects of
tea have gradually accumulated highly suggestive, though not
definitive, evidence for tea's ability to prevent or ameliorate
several common serious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the presumed health effects are related to polyphenols,
chemicals that act as antioxidants, preventing cell damage caused
by highly reactive molecules called free radicals. The polyphenols
in tea, especially green tea, are more potent antioxidants than
well-known antioxidants like vitamins C and E, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of evidence for tea's health benefits comes from
studies in animals that were treated with amounts of tea
polyphenols equivalent to what might be consumed by a regular tea
drinker.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a study published in April, a research team from
Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine added green tea
polyphenols to the drinking water of 18 mice and none to the water
of 18 other mice. All the animals were then injected with a
substance that causes a condition like rheumatoid arthritis in
people. Of the group that got the polyphenols, only eight developed
arthritis; in the group that got plain water, all but one developed
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to cancer, several dozen animal studies indicate
that the polyphenols and related compounds in tea are protective,
especially against cancers of the oral cavity and digestive tract.
Tea chemicals are believed to act by preventing damage to DNA that
could result in a loss of control over cell growth.
</P>
<P>
   According to cancer researchers at Rutgers University College of
Pharmacy, ``Tea is one of the few agents that can inhibit
carcinogenesis at the initiation, promotion and progression
stages.'' However, they added, it is not yet known how effective
tea can be in preventing human cancer, what dose is most effective
or what is the best way to administer the active compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Studies in people have yielded inconsistent results, in part
because in some studies other factors may have entered into the
picture to distort the findings, like the heat of the tea and the
use of tobacco or alcohol. In one well-designed study conducted in
Beijing, China, among 59 patients with precancerous mouth lesions,
those treated for six months with capsules of oxidized green tea
polyphenols experienced a decrease in the size of the lesions; in
the untreated group, the lesions got larger.
</P>
<P>
   A study of more than 35,000 postmenopausal women in Iowa
suggested that women who drank two or more cups of tea daily were
less likely to develop cancers of the digestive tract and urinary
tract. However, no protection was found against other cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a study in the Netherlands among 58,000 men and 62,000
women found no link between tea drinking and a reduced risk of
cancers of the lung, breast or colon. However, in a study in
laboratory mice and rats, Dr. Fung-Lung Chung of the American
Health Foundation found that both green and black tea and caffeine
given in drinking water protected the animals against lung cancer
caused by a major carcinogen in tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Another study in mice showed that both green and black tea
inhibited the growth of both malignant and nonmalignant skin
tumors. And a study in rats conducted by Dr. Roderick H. Dashwood
of Oregon State University showed that both green and black tea
inhibited the formation of precancerous lesions in the colon.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to heart disease and stroke, a study of 1,330
Chinese men found a significantly lower level of serum cholesterol
and triglycerides among those who drank more than 10 cups of green
tea a day.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies in Western countries have indicated that tea
drinkers may be less likely to develop heart disease and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   A Harvard study by Dr. Howard Sesso indicated that people who
drank one or more cups of black tea a day were half as likely to
suffer a heart attack as those who did not drink tea, regardless of
other risk factors for heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   However, much more research is needed to sort out the effects of
tea on blood vessel diseases as well as cancer. For example, in a
study of 880 Japanese men, researchers found that heavy tea
drinkers were also likely to eat more fruits and vegetables, which
may account for or contribute to their lower risk of heart disease
and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the evidence to date is sufficiently suggestive to prompt
the National Cancer Institute to conduct studies of the capacity of
the biologically active chemicals in green and black tea to curb
the development of cancer in people at high risk for developing
cancers of the colon, lung, esophagus and skin.
</P>
<P>
   And Japanese researchers have suggested that the ability of
green tea and its chemicals to inhibit a substance called tumor
necrosis factor-alpha may make it useful in treating a wide range
of health problems that include Crohn's disease, multiple
sclerosis, malaria and sepsis as well as rheumatoid arthritis.

   NUTRITION: When Refrigerator Raiders Lose Control
</P>
<P>
   Everyone gets the late-night munchies now and then, whether for
rocky road ice cream or a Dagwood sandwich of salami, pickles and
deli Swiss on rye.
</P>
<P>
   For some, however, nighttime kitchen raids are frequent,
uncontrollable and distressing.
</P>
<P>
   Night eating syndrome was first identified in 1955, but now it
is being studied in greater depth. In an article in The Journal of
the American Medical Association last month, researchers at the
University of Pennsylvania reported on the results of a study of 10
obese people who exhibited typical signs of night eating syndrome:
lack of morning appetite, evening overeating and insomnia. They
were compared with 10 people who were matched for age, sex and
weight, but did not have problems with nighttime eating.
</P>
<P>
   For the estimated 3.8 million Americans afflicted with the
disorder, the drive to eat at night tends to undermine even the
most earnest daytime weight-loss efforts. And no wonder: on
average, the study found, night eaters consumed fully 56 percent of
their entire intake of calories during these nighttime episodes.
They also tended to eat more often during the day than people in a
control group and to wake up nearly 10 times as often each night.
Finally, more than half of all waking episodes were associated with
some form of food intake.
</P>
<P>
   Just how these episodes might be controlled is still a mystery,
but the lead researcher, Dr. Grethe Stoa Birketvedt, said a
possible treatment might be suggested by the fact that sufferers
typically consume carbohydrate-rich foods at night.
</P>
<P>
   High carbohydrate intake increases serotonin production, which
in turn facilitates sleep. This suggests a vicious cycle in which
sufferers effectively wake up to eat so they can sleep. Controlling
serotonin levels might provide one solution.
</P>
<P>
   Tinkering with night eaters' day menus to prevent carbohydrate
cravings at night may be another. ``It is tempting to speculate if
this is a result of the composition of the diet that these night
eaters have,'' Dr. Birketvedt said, ``but this requires further
studies.''

   IN THE LAB: Promising Progress in Lupus Research
</P>
<P>
   No one is talking about a cure, or even any improvement in the
very near future, but researchers are reporting some promising
progress in the field of lupus, a serious autoimmune disease
affecting about 1.5 million people in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the University of Texas say they have identified
four genes that can halt the now incurable, potentially fatal
disease. They published their findings in the current issue of
Immunity.
</P>
<P>
   In people with lupus, the body loses its ability to tell the
difference between its own cells and those of invaders like
viruses. As a result, antibodies begin attacking healthy cells and
organs, causing damage in the joints, lungs, kidneys and nerves.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Dr. Edward K. Wakeland, the lead author of the
study, reported finding the genes that cause lupus through three
biological ``pathways.'' Wakeland and his colleagues at the
Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas Center for Immunology found
that at least two of the genes had to be present for lupus to
occur.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest study, which used mice bred to have the disease,
Wakeland found four ``suppressor'' genes that, when present in the
mice, seemed to stop lupus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were mice that didn't even get sick,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More work is being done to identify the suppressor genes and how
they work. If that is successful, scientists will try to develop a
drug that mimics the mechanism at the genetic level. But it will
take time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being very optimistic,'' Wakeland said, ``I imagine it would
be five years before there would be a drug that would be
available.''

   CONSEQUENCES: Seeing Illness as Retribution for Misdeeds
</P>
<P>
   ``Immanent Justice'' may sound like the title of a Jackie Chan
movie, but it is the name developmental psychologists use for a
widely held, if erroneous, assumption: that illness can be a
punishment for bad behavior.
</P>
<P>
   A new study reported at the annual meeting of the American
Psychological Association last month indicates that under some
circumstances otherwise reasonable adults may adopt this karmic
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Two researchers at Ohio State University presented 239 college
students with the story of a man described as a liar and a cheat
who contracts a ``mysterious, deadly illness.'' Depending on how
the story was presented, the researchers found that 19 percent to
44 percent of the participants agreed with the idea that the man's
illness might be a punishment for his misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The highest level of agreement came when the interviewer
amplified the tale with a familiar retributive expression _ ``what
goes around comes around'' _ and added a minor character who seemed
to reinforce the link between behavior and illness.
</P>
<P>
   One of the researchers, Lakshi Raman, a graduate student in
psychology, suggested that the study showed that people might
``fall back on unscientific reasoning when rational explanations
aren't readily available.''
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps their belief is just wishful thinking.

   Bees Buzzing With Data
</P>
<P>
   When a honeybee finds a good source of food, it quickly alerts
its hive mates as to what it is and where to find it. With the
honeybee's cousin the bumblebee, however, foraging has been
considered an every-bee-for-itself affair. Bumblebees were thought
to guard information about food sources, like a New Yorker who has
discovered a great hole-in-the-wall restaurant and doesn't want it
to get overrun.
</P>
<P>
   But new research by scientists from the University of Wuerzburg
in Germany shows that bumblebees aren't that tight-lipped. By
carefully controlling which insects in a nest were able to search
for food and what they were able to find, the researchers
discovered that a returning bumblebee tells its mates about the
type of flower it found. It just doesn't reveal the location.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the researchers found, a successful forager can hardly
contain itself. Upon returning, it spends several minutes bouncing
around the nest, excitedly buzzing its wings from time to time so
that the other bees can detect the odor of the particular flower
species it visited.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, writing in the journal Nature, suggest that it
might not be worthwhile for bumblebees to share information about
location. Honeybees can take up to an hour to decide on which of
several reported food locations to visit. Bumblebees, which live in
smaller colonies and thus have fewer foragers, may not have the
luxury of dawdling. So once it knows the type of flower that is
available, a bumblebee may be able to use its innate searching
skills to find it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Not So Fast
</P>
<P>
   Highway driving sometimes just isn't fair. On a congested road,
for instance, it always seems like it's the cars in the other lane
that are moving faster.
</P>
<P>
   But that may only be an illusion, say a team of researchers from
the United States and Canada who studied the phenomenon using
computer simulations and video recordings of highway traffic.
</P>
<P>
   On a congested road, two lanes of traffic may have the same
average speed, although the actual speed of each car will vary over
time. Cars that are going faster tend to be farther apart, while
slower cars tend to be closer together. So a driver tends to pass a
bunch of slower moving cars relatively quickly, while it takes
longer for a group of faster cars to pass the driver.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, whose work was reported in Nature, suggest that
this time difference is what makes the driver think the other lane
is faster; the driver is spending more time being passed than
passing.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors are probably at work as well, the researchers say.
Because drivers look forward rather than backward, slower cars that
are passed are out of sight, and thus out of mind, sooner than cars
that are passing. And psychologically, being passed may have more
impact than passing; the losses may outweigh the gains in the
driver's mind. Whatever the reason, the researchers note, it seldom
pays to change lanes.
</P>
<P>
   A Close-up of Cassini
</P>
<P>
   Largely forgotten amid all the hubbub surrounding the near-Earth
approach last month of the Cassini spacecraft was the fact that the
flyby gave the mission's operators the first chance to test the
cameras that will be used when the probe reaches Jupiter and
Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   Cassini came within 700 miles of Earth as part of a plan to use
the planet's gravity to boost the spacecraft's speed for the long
trip to Jupiter, which it will approach at the end of next year,
and to Saturn, where it is due in 2004. Some people were concerned
that if the trajectory was off, the spacecraft could have been
incinerated over the Pacific Ocean, dispersing the on-board
plutonium (used to generate power) into the atmosphere. That didn't
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Cassini scientists and engineers took advantage of the approach
to try out the cameras, aiming them at the Moon. The two cameras,
one a wide-angle model, the other a narrow-angle one, worked
perfectly, the mission operators said.
</P>
<P>
   Images can be seen on the Web, at photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov.

<P>
   New Roach Repellant
</P>
<P>
   It's not just for cats anymore. Researchers from Iowa State
University have discovered that cockroaches, too, have a thing
about catnip, as some old household bug remedies claimed. Unlike
cats, though, which will keep coming back to a catnip toy that
drives them crazy, roaches will scramble to get away from the
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said that their work might eventually lead to
the development of new bug repellents. But as even they
acknowledged, most people don't want cockroaches to go away, they
want them dead.

   Mosquito Meals
</P>
<P>
   Q. Since I seldom see mosquitoes in daylight, can I avoid bites
by going out only in the sunshine?
</P>
<P>
   A. Unfortunately, no. There are many species of mosquitoes,
perhaps 3,000 worldwide, 150 in the United States and more than
five dozen in New Jersey alone, according to the Associated
Executives of Mosquito Control Work in New Jersey. The females,
which seek a blood meal in order to produce eggs, have many
different kinds of feeding habits.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the mosquitoes that carry disease are most active
in twilight periods at dawn and dusk, even they may be roused to
bite if their resting places are invaded in the bright daytime.
Others may feed all day.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, which
is associated with the transmission of dengue, eastern equine
encephalitis and dog heartworm, is a very aggressive daytime biter,
with peaks in early morning and late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In the dark ricefield mosquito, Psorophora columbiae, which in
large numbers has been reported to kill livestock, the females are
furious biters, day or night. Luckily they prefer the blood of
cattle to that of humans.
</P>
<P>
   Aedes trivittatus, while not a major disease carrier, is a
severe nuisance, because it attacks in swarms, its bite is more
irritating to humans than that of many other mosquitoes, and it
does not hesitate to bite in bright sunlight when its haunts are
invaded.

VACCINES MAY SOON HAVE PUNCH BUT NO OUCH

   Vaccinations may one day be simply a matter of a quick shower _
or maybe just a shampoo.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at Stanford University have found that a simple
solution of DNA and water applied to the skin of mice can induce an
immune response against the hepatitis B virus. The response is
comparable to that from traditional injection into the muscle, the
research shows.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA vaccine was apparently taken up through the hair
follicles of the mice; the mice without hair (what scientists call
nude mice) did not show the same reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``In principle, the DNA solution could be put on a Band-Aid, or
in a spray, or even in shampoo'' said Dr. Paul A. Khavari, leader
of the group reporting the study, which was written by Dr. Hongran
Fan and appears in the September issue of the journal Nature
Biotechnology. ``Anyone could apply it,'' Dr. Khavari added.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, the DNA, which sets off the body's immune response
against hepatitis B, was applied directly to the mouse skin with no
preliminary scraping or chemical hair removal.
</P>
<P>
   It induced an immune response comparable to that of muscular
injection of commercially available hepatitis B vaccine, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exciting development because it shows that DNA
vaccination will get simpler and simpler,'' said Dr. Stephen Albert
Johnston, the director of the Center for Biomedical Inventions at
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and a
pioneer in genetic vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, who was not connected with the research at Stanford,
said: ``We've been injecting common vaccines into the muscle. This
work says that we've been administering vaccines in the wrong
place. Soaking it into the skin is a lot simpler and less
painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists in the rapidly growing field of DNA vaccines are
experimenting with a variety of needle-free methods _ including
nasal sprays, subcutaneous patches and edible vaccines _ to deliver
the genetic material.
</P>
<P>
   DNA vaccines offer many practical advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``DNA is so stable that you can walk around with it in your
pocket for months at room temperature,'' said Khavari, who in
addition to leading the research effort at Stanford is chief of the
dermatology service at the Veterans Affairs Health Care System in
Palo Alto, Calif., and a professor at the Stanford University
School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of need for refrigeration or special medical
personnel makes it very attractive, especially in developing
countries,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage of DNA vaccinations is that in the future a
single DNA cocktail might provide immunity against a number of
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing about DNA vaccines is that the technology to
generate them against multiple different organisms is very
promising,'' said Dr. Dennis Klinman of the Center for Biologic
Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration in
Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Klinman, an expert on DNA vaccines, cautioned that much research
still had to be done. ``We can't know in advance that the same
immune response will be equally protective in different species, or
that different species will mount precisely the same immune
response,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Klinman predicted that once significant progress was made
toward understanding how DNA vaccines induced immune responses in
humans, this technology would be ``harnessed to develop vaccines
against a large number of different pathogens.''
</P>
<P>
   Khavari emphasized the preliminary nature of his findings. ``So
many things work in animal models that don't work in humans,'' he
said. ``We'll have to see if it transfers to human skin, which has
different characteristics than mouse skin in its thickness and hair
follicle density. We are hopeful that it will find some application
in producing inexpensive, painless, effective vaccines.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford University has a licensing agreement with Maxygen, a
biotechnology company in Northern California, to develop the
topical genetic vaccine technology for commercial use.

MAGIC DIET PILL IS CALLED HOCUS-POCUS

   Products promising significant weight loss are nothing new. But
the television infomercials for two new diet supplements, Exercise
in a Bottle and Fat Trapper, are remarkable even in that genre.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisements claim that, taken in concert, the two
supplements, sold by Enforma Natural Products of Los Angeles, take
the place of exercise. In the half-hour infomercial, being shown
widely, the former baseball player Steve Garvey and a nutritionist,
Kendall Carson, tell viewers they can consume fattening foods and
still lose weight simply by taking a few pills every day. (The
regimen costs $35 a month.)
</P>
<P>
   Garvey says in the infomercial that pyruvate, a naturally
occurring enzyme that is the active ingredient in Exercise in a
Bottle, works by ``forcing every cell in your body to work harder
whether you're exercising or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Fat Trapper is a combination of chitin, a fiber derived from
shellfish, and chitosome, a plant fiber. ``It literally traps fat
before it gets into your system,'' Garvey says.
</P>
<P>
   But as with so many weight-loss products, these claims have
trouble standing up under scrutiny. The infomercial has been
attacked by consumer advocates and two district attorneys in
California, who have filed lawsuits accusing Enforma of false
advertising. The company denies the charges. Andrew Grey, its chief
executive, said in an interview, ``We vigorously defend our right
to market this product as we see fit.''
</P>
<P>
   To bolster the claim that pyruvate takes the place of exercise,
the infomercial quotes a University of Pittsburgh study finding
that subjects who took pyruvate supplements for 21 days lost fat at
a rate 48 percent higher, and weight at a rate 38 percent higher,
than nonusers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that claim, Dr. Ronald Stanko, who performed the
study in 1996, replied, ``The information is absolutely on the
level, but I think the way it's being presented is perhaps a bit
misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanko's research looked at obese, bedridden women on
1,000-calorie-a-day diets, hardly normal circumstances for most
dieters. The women in the study were given 36 grams of pyruvate a
day for three weeks; the recommended dosage for Exercise in a
Bottle is just 1 gram. And though the rates of fat and weight loss
are quoted accurately, the subjects who took the pyruvate lost an
average of only 3.52 pounds more than those who did not.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey says Fat Trapper can absorb up to 120 grams of fat. To
demonstrate how the supplement works in the stomach, he pours bacon
grease into a glass of water. When the contents of four Fat Trapper
pills are added to the mix, large blobs of fat form and fall to the
bottom of the glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never mind that oil and water separate naturally,'' said David
Schardt, an associate nutritionist at the Center for Science in the
Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group in Washington. ``This is
a gross distortion of science.'' In reality, he said, the amount of
chitin and chitosome in a daily dose of Fat Trapper can bind bind 3
to 5 grams of fat, the equivalent of a pat of butter.
</P>
<P>
   The few human trials performed on chitin and chitosome seem to
support Schardt's assertions. Two Italian studies concluded that
they may offer a significant but small contribution to weight loss
when combined with a low-calorie diet. Schardt also warned that
long-term use of the supplements might lead to nutritional
deficiencies because they might prevent the body from absorbing
fat-soluble substances like vitamin D and vitamin E.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Enforma Natural Products says it has sold the two
supplements to half a million people this year and is planning a
new infomercial within the next two weeks. Grey, the company's
chief executive, stands behind his company's product and marketing.
``We tell our customers they should no longer have a fear of
restrictive diets, though it is not our intent to imply they can
gorge themselves four meals a day,'' he said. ``The Enforma system
is just that _ a system. Taking everything together is what
produces the greatest effects and benefits.''  &QL;

 Scams Plague Internet

Bill Banks, a 42-year-old financial planner from New Jersey, was in
the market for a new set of golf clubs. Like many of today's wired
consumers, he jumped onto the Internet to check out the best deals.
He now wishes he hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   Banks' foray led him to a small Internet company called Gary
Player Direct Inc., named after the famous golf pro. Impressed with
the look of the Web site and the Gary Player name, Banks placed a
credit card order for $719 in April.
</P>
<P>
   The clubs arrived a few weeks later, but after testing them out
at his local golf course, Banks decided they weren't for him. The
company had promised a 60-day money-back guarantee, so he shipped
the clubs back and waited for his Visa statement to be credited.
Four months later, he's still waiting _ and fuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've phoned their customer service number countless times, but
mostly I've just been hung up on or disconnected,'' he said. ``I
even went back to the Web site and sent them a bunch of e-mails
demanding my money back. I got no response.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks said he feels helpless because he's in New Jersey, and
Gary Player Direct is located on the other side of the country in
San Luis Obispo. ``If this was a traditional retailer, I could go
to the shop and stand in front of them and demand satisfaction,''
he said. ``But in cyberspace, I feel I don't have any control.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks is not alone. As e-commerce sales continue to skyrocket,
more and more consumers are falling prey to dubious business
practices and outright fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The number of online fraud complaints leaped from 1,280 in 1997
to 7,752 last year, according to the Internet Fraud Watch, a
consumer watchdog group in Washington. Susan Grant, who directs the
organization, expects to tally well over 10,000 complaints this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Irate Internet consumers are pouring out of the woodwork. Brad
Clayton, a Portland foundry worker, had a run-in last year with a
Southern California company called Auction-Sales.com Inc., which
sells computer hardware, software and peripherals over the Internet
to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton was looking for a new computer chip and submitted a bid
for $101. The company sent him an e-mail confirming that he had won
the auction and the chip would be sent to him within a month.
</P>
<P>
   The product never arrived. When Clayton phoned to check the
status of his order, he first chatted with a ``very cordial,
well-spoken young lady.'' But as soon as he started asking some
questions about his order, ``she adopted a thick Latin accent and
pretended she didn't understand anything I was saying.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, though, the woman let it slip that Clayton's bid
wasn't high enough. ``Basically, they weren't going to honor the
bid because they felt it was too low, even though they told me I
had won.``
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said the company never debited his credit card account,
but it did cause him severe aggravation as well as several wasted
months. He finally went down to his local computer store and bought
the identical product for just a few dollars more than what he had
originally bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like Little Red Riding Hood being led down the path,''
said Clayton. ``The experience didn't sour me on the Net, but it
made me more selective about who I do business with.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of consumer groups, such as the Internet Fraud Watch
and Better Business Bureau Online, are popping up to educate the
public about the perils of conducting business in cyberspace. For
the most part, these groups believe in the power of the Internet
and the convenience it offers consumers. They just want to make
sure people are aware of the risks and take the proper precautions.
</P>
<P>
   One piece of advice is to question out-of-this-world claims made
on Web sites. ``If it's too good to be true, it probably is,'' said
Pat Wallace, president of the Bay Area chapter of the Better
Business Bureau, based in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The most flagrant piece of Internet fraud Wallace has
encountered was a Web page hosted by a fly-by-night company called
National Research Inc. The site was offering 12,000 free computers
on its site, and all consumers had to do to receive one was send
$20 to a certain post office box in Muskegan, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a pure scam,'' said Wallace. ``They were cashing $20
checks from anyone they could, and then they dropped off the face
of the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Cash and checks are the worst way to purchase goods and services
over the Internet, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
   Grant of Internet Fraud Watch said cash payments allow crooks to
maintain their anonymity. Also, cash, checks or money orders don't
offer the same protection that a credit card does. Once a check or
money order is cashed, there is little to no chance of restitution.
</P>
<P>
   She said credit cards made up a minuscule 8 percent of all
fraudulent transactions reported to her organization, while checks
and money orders made up 38 percent and 33 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the law, if a product never arrives, the consumer
can write the credit card company within 60 days of making the
charge, disputing it,'' said Grant. ``The credit card company can
then remove the charge from the consumer's bill.''
</P>
<P>
   David Wilson is a 72-year-old retiree who got restitution the
old-fashioned way. After ordering _ and returning _ a $400 golf
club from Gary Player Direct, he waited patiently for his refund.
When it never came, he phoned and wrote letters to the company to
no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on a trip to Southern California from his home in
Carmel, he stopped by the company's physical location in San Luis
Obispo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very solicitous and said they were trying to take
care of people in an orderly fashion,`' said Wilson. ``They said I
would get my money back within 10 days, and that actually
happened.``
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was relieved to finally get a refund but got no
satisfaction from the experience. ``They were playing games with
me,'' he said. ``I'm convinced that if I hadn't marched into their
physical office, they'd still be dodging me today.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gary Player Direct has had 250 complaints lodged against
it at the Better Business Bureau office in Santa Barbara. That's
more than any other company in the area, according to Rick Copelan,
the president of that bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Web-based business in particular there seems to be the
potential for trouble,'' said Copelan. ``These companies seem to
have problems delivering the correct merchandise and doing it on
time.''
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Cervantes, interim president and chief executive of Gary
Player Direct, said the company has been going through a very
difficult restructuring and has experienced ``operating problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still some cleaning up we need to do,'' said
Cervantes. ``But we've paid up $5.9 million in refunds and expect
to have the outstanding balance of $1.2 million cleared up within
the next 30 days.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the company plans to relaunch its Web site in the
near future _ possibly under the name  &LR; www.digitalgolf.com &LR;  _ and
add many new features, such as an online golf catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one former employee who asked not to be identified, is
leery of the new plan. ``The company is nothing but a full-on
scam,'' she said, adding that the relaunch of the Web site
represents ``another avenue for ripping people off and getting away
from a name that has a bad rap.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to make Internet shopping less risky for consumers,
the BBB two years ago unveiled an online reliability program. As
part of the program, a representative from the agency visits each
company, no matter how big or small, at its place of business to
determine whether it can indeed deliver on what it promises on the
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to meet the people and ascertain the company has a
real physical presence, and is not just a bunch of screens,'' said
Steve Salter, project director for BBBOnLine.
</P>
<P>
   So far 3,700 companies, such as Lands End, Staples, eBay and
CDNow have received the seal of approval, while several hundred
others have been turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bill Banks said his experience with Gary Player
Direct has taught him a valuable lesson. ``I'm much more wary about
doing business on the Internet,'' he said. ``If it's not a company
I know, I won't shop at its Web site.''

   Late-Season Northwest Trip
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I would like to stretch a November trip to the
Napa Valley for a wedding with a cruise or train trip in the
Northwest, perhaps across Canada. What is available then? _ Sylvia
K. Marzolf, Savannah, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A. Cruises up the Pacific Coast are hard to find by the end of
October, but cruises on some of the major rivers of the Northwest
continue. And scenic train rides are always available. You could
easily travel both on water and by rail.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cruises is a seven-day sailing out of Portland along
the Willamette, Columbia and Snake Rivers on the Queen of the West.
This 163-passenger stern-wheeler has outside cabins only. The
cruise includes entertainment and excursions on the Mount Hood
Scenic Railway, to Mount St. Helens and to the Nez Perce Historical
Park. Rates are $1,489 to $4,065 a person, double occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, the Victoria Clipper, a high-speed catamaran,
offers shorter cruise-and-tour packages to Seattle, Vancouver and
Victoria, British Columbia, with nights spent on shore in a choice
of hotels. A two-night Seattle-Victoria package, for example,
including a cruise, a champagne breakfast, accommodations and a
tour in Victoria, costs $212 to $294 a person.
</P>
<P>
   An agency that can give you more information on these trips and
book them is Sunshine Travel and Cruise, Post Office Box 970, 100
West Second St., The Dalles, Ore. 97058; (800) 578-1479, fax (541)
296-5561.
</P>
<P>
   To see the Northwest by rail, contact Amtrak, (800) 872-7245,
www.amtrak.com, which has a tour division. The railroad's Coast
Starlight runs between Los Angeles and Seattle; you could pick it
up in Martinez, near Oakland, for an overnight trip and wake up in
Oregon. From Seattle, the Cascades route can take you to Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, Via Rail operates trains throughout the Canadian West
and across the country. Two routes are the 725-mile Skeena, between
Jasper, Alberta, and Prince George, British Columbia, and the
Malahat, which traverses Vancouver Island, south and north. And to
really see Canada _ or at least a good chunk of it _ there is the
Canadian, which runs between Vancouver and Toronto, through
Kamloops, Jasper, Edmonton, Saskatoon and Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
   Via Rail, unlike Amtrak, does not arrange tours. Brewster Tours
of Calgary, (800) 661-1152, fax (403) 260-4636, www.brewster.ca, is
an agency that works with Via Rail. Shannon Birnie of Brewster said
that customized tours can be arranged, but that among the package
tours you might consider is the Winter Wonderland, a seven-night
rail-and-bus tour that begins in Vancouver and includes two nights
each in Jasper and Banff, and single nights on the train and in
Lake Louise and Calgary. Rates range from $735 to $891 a person,
double occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to look into a joint promotion of Amtrak and Via
Rail, the North America Rail Pass. In fall and winter, the pass
costs $450 and provides 30 days of economy-class travel (upgrades
are possible) on both railroads. Contact Amtrak or the Via Rail Web
site, www.viarail.ca, for more information.

   Dublin Pub Tours
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I find out about literary pub tours in the fall in
Dublin? _Selma Kleinman, Rockaway Park, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. To raise a toast or two to Dublin's literary heritage, you
should contact Colm Quilligan, the founder of Dublin Literary Pub
Crawl Ltd., at (353-1) 670-5602 or (353-87) 263-0270, or by fax at
(353-1) 670-5603. There is also www.dublinpubcrawl.com, but at last
check, it had information only on the company's Paris Literary
Promenade.
</P>
<P>
   Quilligan said the Dublin tours are offered nightly at 7:30 and
at noon on Sunday from Easter to the end of October, and on
Thursday to Sunday at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at noon the rest of the
year. For two and a half hours, two actors lead the walkers to four
pubs and other sites in Dublin to perform scenes by famous
playwrights and novelists and have fun with a literary quiz (there
are prizes).

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I love endurance sports: marathons, triathlons (even the
grueling Hawaii Ironman competition), bicycle races, swimming
around Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing compares to the feeling that comes at the 23rd mile of a
marathon; the sizzle of Kona's lava fields; the taste, smell and
color of the East River; the calm of Manhattan when pedaling to a
race in the early hours.
</P>
<P>
   But when a knee operation curtailed my running, I decided to try
something exciting and fast-paced, something that relied on power,
coordination and agility more than on tenacity and lung capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Enter wakeboarding.
</P>
<P>
   I had heard about this fast-growing water sport from friends and
had seen the competition on ESPN During gameswakpulwitd scratewak

``Butught. I'ed.urchedoarr, ed d I up. oug thed d toard tur0 dng.
as ng ry.le ard, pt rike.y ups 30 I landed face first in the lake.
(So that's what snowboarders call face plants.)
</P>
<P>
   From the boat, Anderson shouted that I was riding the board too
much like a water ski with my hips facing forward and too much
weight on my back leg. Next time, he said, stand straighter, keep
your shoulders square to the boat, hips turned 90 degrees from the
shoulders. (Not unlike the stance of a snowboarder.)
</P>
<P>
   He also said I needed to stop looking at the water and focus on
the boat or the horizon for balance. ``Ride the edges,'' he told
me. ``Toes to heels, toes to heels.''
</P>
<P>
   The same pattern of getting up, falling, getting up and falling
went on for five or six more runs. Finally, I managed to get the
hang of it and could steer the board. I stayed up for several
minutes, and I even made a toe-side cut off the wake, rolling up on
my toes to make the board turn while facing the wake. But when I
leaned back onto my heels for a backside cut, as soon as I neared
the wake, I caught an edge and fell backward.
</P>
<P>
   Don't mess with the wake, Anderson told me. ``Go over it or stay
away from it, but don't try to ride the lip of it.''
</P>
<P>
   On my first run after lunch, I made it over the wake on my toe
side but couldn't cross back on my heel side. My afternoon runs
would be better because I was more relaxed and I had picked up
several tips from watching the others in my group.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson continued to work with me on a more sideways,
hips-forward stance and rolling from edge to edge of the board.
Several more runs, and several face plants later, I decided that I
had had enough for my first day. I could get up, ride directly
behind the boat and cross the wake in one direction, but I had not
mastered the feeling of ``popping'' effortlessly off the wake.
</P>
<P>
   Falling is part of any board sport, but the overall experience
is addicting, and the learning curve levels off once you find your
balance.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a serious athlete to wakeboard, but it is
easier if you are in good physical condition with strong arms,
quadriceps and back and abdominal muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Getting up on the board puts considerable stress on the biceps,
and holding the tow rope at 20 miles an hour or more strains the
chest muscles, forearms and biceps. Riding the board and turning
side to side uses the muscles in the abdomen and the back. The
muscles in your legs also get a workout.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a wakeboarding run is so exhilarating that you won't
notice how taxing it is, until the next day. I was surprised by how
sore my neck, back, arms and legs were, and how much Advil I had to
take. And I was glad I saved the McTwists, Tootsie Rolls and
Slurpees for the 7-Eleven.

</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-RIGHTS (Jerusalem) _ Israel's Supreme Court today barred
security service interrogators from using physical force, a
landmark ruling hailed by human rights lawyers as a victory against

been used on thousands of Palestinians detained over the years on
suspicion of anti-Israeli activities. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   (Story offered for page one consideration.)

starts new talks in effort to revive flagging peace effort. By
Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   NKOREA-U.S. (Tokyo) _ A curtain-raiser on talks between the
United States and North Korea in Berlin on Tuesday: The first thing
that American diplomats will want to determine is which North Korea
shows up. Will it be the one that threatens to ``mete out merciless
retaliation'' upon its enemies, or will it be the nation of
starving millions that has gradually, grudgingly accepted the
extended hand of international cooperation? By Howard W. French.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (``w'' code)
</P>

fashion-forward kids line, now a year old, is also going like

service with a call to the National Geographic Society, Iridium is
fighting for its life. It may have great, even revolutionary,
technology, but interviews with a broad array of experts suggest
that even the most enlightened restructuring plan may not stave off
liquidation. By David Barboza.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-EURO (London) _ In a sign of strong support for the
single European currency that Britain has yet to adopt, Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook said the euro has shown itself to be a boon
for its 11 member nations. By Alan Cowell.

Mexico that will give bankers here the same instantaneous credit
profiles that bankers in New York and Miami and Los Angeles take

   Figuring the Ideal Time to Sell Your Stocks 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By ARTHUR M. LOUIS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a student, and it has been a year since I started buying
stocks. I read investment books and magazines, listen to and watch
the business news, and have followed each individual stock's
progress before buying. Unfortunately, the stocks I buy often end
up dropping after one or two weeks. All the stocks I own are
well-known, good companies such as Lucent, Cisco, Microsoft and
Merck. Instead of trading them, I have held on, even when they show
a loss, even though I was warned not to get married to any stock. I
need some advice on when to sell. Is there a particular profit or
loss figure that should prompt me to sell? Should I worry about
taxes if I have capital gains?
</P>
<P>
   A: The principal question you pose _ When do I sell? _ is
probably the toughest facing any investor. There is no easy answer.
</P>
<P>
   Many supposed investment experts urge you to ``sell your losers
quickly and let your winners run.'' Along these lines, one commonly
suggested rule of thumb is to dump a stock if it falls 10 percent
below your purchase price. But that can be a terrible blunder if
the 10 percent dip is just part of a normal fluctuation and the
stock is about to come roaring back. Ask some veteran investors how
often that has happened to them.
</P>
<P>
   If a company is financially sound and there isn't any hidden bad
news, a 10 percent dip _ or any dip _ could be an excellent buying
opportunity. Unfortunately, there is no way to know in advance. But
bear in mind that Omaha investor Warren Buffett built his
multibillion-dollar fortune primarily by buying undervalued stocks
that had been scorned by other investors.
</P>
<P>
   You are on the right track when you buy what you consider
``good'' companies _ as distinguished from the horde of dubious,
speculative issues out there. Unless you later learn something that
makes a company seem less good, you might as well hang in there.
The fact that you do a lot of research is certain to help.
</P>
<P>
   As for capital-gains taxes, it is rarely a good idea to make
this a major consideration in deciding whether to sell a stock. If
you think a company is going sour, don't hesitate to sell it simply
because you don't want to pay a capital-gains tax. If the company's
stock indeed heads south, your gain will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Roth IRA Never Closes
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am single and would like to open a Roth individual
retirement account this year. My current salary is $95,000 _ the
highest salary you can have and still contribute a full $2,000 per
year to the account. However, I am interviewing for a new job where
the salary is $125,000, which would make me ineligible to
contribute any money at all. If I don't take the new job until next
year, and open the Roth this year, will I be forced to close the
account when my salary goes up?
</P>
<P>
   A: No.
</P>
<P>
   Once you open a Roth IRA, you can keep it open as long as you
wish. Whatever you previously put in there will continue to earn
money tax-free, no matter what happens to your salary.
</P>
<P>
   However, as you suggest, you won't be allowed to continue making
annual contributions at your higher salary level. For single
people, the maximum allowable contribution phases down from $2,000
per year to zero as salaries rise from $95,000 to $110,000. For
married couples filing joint tax returns, the phaseout occurs
between $150,000 and $160,000.
</P>
<P>
   If your salary declines in the years ahead, putting you back
below the cutoff, you will be permitted to make further
contributions to the Roth. However, you don't really want that to
happen, do you?
</P>
<P>
   Choices in Index Funds
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whenever I hear people mention index mutual funds, I assume
that they're talking about the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, because
it's the one I hear about most often. Are there mutual funds that
invest in the other indexes as well? I would like to expand my
investment mix.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, indeed. There are funds that track just about any index,
among them the Russell 3000 or Wilshire 5000 indexes, which are
much more broadly based than the S&AMP;P 500. There even is a fund _
the Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund _ that pointedly excludes
all S&AMP;P 500 stocks, while including the rest of the stocks in the
Wilshire 5000. For more information, take a look at the excellent
Morningstar Web site at  &LR; www.morningstar.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 index has been a fantastic performer in recent
years, roughly tripling in value since the end of 1994 and handily
outperforming the great majority of actively managed mutual funds.
However, as your question implies, there no guarantee that it will
turn in a superior performance from here on.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to mutual funds, you might want to consider trust
shares keyed to various indexes. They are similar to closed-end
funds and trade just like stocks, and there are lots of them listed
on the American Stock Exchange. Among the most prominent are the
Diamonds Trust, which tracks the Dow Jones industrial average, and
the Nasdaq-100 Shares Trust, which tracks 100 of the largest Nasdaq
stocks, mainly technology issues. (For more information on trust
shares, see the article headlined ``New Nasdaq Trust Off to a Fast
Start'' in The Chronicle's April 6 Business section.)

   SCI-TSIEN-MOUSE (Undated) _ A Scientist-at-Work profile: The
world has been frenetically beating on the door of Joe Z. Tsien,
the biologist who announced last week he had created a smarter
strain of mouse. Within this enveloping chaos, Tsien has spun
around himself a small bubble of protective serenity. He calmly
describes the remarkable journey that led him from Wu Shi, a small
town near Shanghai, to the position of having made a significant,
maybe decisive, contribution to understanding the nature of memory.

was reported last week with the publication of the sharpest direct
images ever made of electronic bonds, known as orbitals. The shapes
revealed by these images _ doughnut-like rings, dumbbell-shaped

 Trading Day Gets Longer

<P>
   &UR; By ARTHUR M. LOUIS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has always borne more than a passing resemblance to
a gambling casino, and the resemblance is growing stronger now that
several brokerage firms have begun letting their retail customers
trade beyond normal stock market hours.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors have enjoyed that privilege for many
years, trading after hours by computer through a dozen or so
self-contained, fully automated electronic communications networks.
The ECNs serve as surrogate markets when the principal markets _
such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq _ are closed.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, individuals have been almost totally excluded
from ECN trading.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, that is changing. In recent years, individual
investors have become a major force on Wall Street, and brokers
have realized that it is in their best interest to cater more to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market has been fueled by individuals with their 401(k)
plans, their individual retirement accounts and their mutual
funds,'' says Muriel Siebert, chief executive of the Muriel Siebert
&AMP; Co. brokerage firm. ``We have to be sure that the public is
treated fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Four brokerage firms _ among them San Francisco's Discover _ now
let their retail customers trade outside the normal stock exchange
hours of 6:30 a.m. to 1 p.m., Pacific time, using ECNs.
</P>
<P>
   Several others _ including San Francisco's Charles Schwab _ have
announced tentative plans to offer this privilege. Still others _
among them Ameritrade, a leading online broker _ have publicly
expressed general interest in after-hours trading but have
announced no specific plans.
</P>
<P>
   Siebert says she is a pioneer in this respect, having made
trading on the Reuters-owned Instinet and another ECN, the
Nasdaq-sponsored Selectnet, available to her firm's retail
customers starting about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Siebert customers can trade for two hours before the
exchanges open at 6:30 a.m. and for two hours after the 1 p.m.
close. However, they must pay higher-than-normal commissions for
this privilege.
</P>
<P>
   It may be only a matter of time (so to speak) before insomniacs
will be able to buy and sell stocks 24 hours a day _ just as people
can buy Keno tickets at any hour in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, which
handle the bulk of trading, say that in theory they favor extending
their hours, and might eventually keep their markets open 24 hours
a day. That would probably eliminate a need for ECNs.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Stock Exchange, which handles about 3 percent of the
nation's stock volume, got the jump on its colossal rivals,
announcing plans to extend its hours to 3:30 p.m. Pacific time,
starting next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Board and Nasdaq point out that, in practice, a 24-hour
market would entail tremendous logistic and personnel problems. For
example, how many Big Board specialists or Nasdaq market-makers
would care to work the lobster shift?
</P>
<P>
   Until the leading exchanges change their schedules, after-hours
trading will continue to be dominated by ECNs.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors commonly use ECNs to trade on surprise
news announcements issued after the exchanges have closed. Many
companies prefer not to roil the markets by issuing their earnings
reports during normal trading hours _ particularly if the earnings
are disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Individual investors who own stock in companies that report good
or bad news after hours have been forced to wait until morning to
get their orders filled _ by which time the prices may have made
huge moves up or down.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, retail customers of Datek Online, Dreyfus
Brokerage and Discover Brokerage all began trading after hours.
</P>
<P>
   Other brokers that have said they probably will offer
after-hours trading include Ameritrade, Donaldson Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, E-Trade, Fidelity Investments, Salomon Smith Barney,
Charles Schwab, Spear Leeds &AMP; Kellogg, Waterhouse and Wit Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab spokeswoman Marta von Loewenfeldt said the firm might
offer trading as late as 2:15 p.m. Pacific time _ 75 minutes after
the markets close _ but that details are still being hashed out. No
launch date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   Menlo Park's E-Trade will let its customers trade as late as
3:30 p.m. over Instinet, probably starting in mid-September,
according to spokesman Patrick DiChiro.
</P>
<P>
   Since August 11, Datek has let its customers trade Nasdaq stocks
as late as 2:15 p.m. Pacific time through its own ECN, called
Island. It says it plans eventually to extend after-hours trading
to 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus and Discover customers have been trading the stocks of
200 large Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange companies since August
25 through a new ECN called MarketXT.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Satow, president of MarketXT and a former lawyer with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, notes that up to 40 percent
of customer orders placed with online brokers come in after the
markets close, rather than during normal trading hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many people who work, that is the most convenient time to
make investment decisions,'' he says. Those people should have the
opportunity to get their orders filled right away, rather than
waiting until morning, he contends.
</P>
<P>
   Trading on the MarketXT system doesn't begin until 3 p.m.
Pacific time _ two hours after the exchanges close. It then
continues until 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Dreyfus and Discover customers can't act promptly
on the company announcements that often stream in shortly after 1
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   That was arranged intentionally to protect customers, says Tom
O'Connell, president of Discover. In after-hours trading, when the
markets are less liquid than during the regular market day, prices
can move very far very fast, potentially causing serious financial
damage to novices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Institutions with their heavy trading cause volatility
problems in early ECN trading,'' he explains. ``Right after the New
York close, you see some of the most volatile trading of the day.
That's not the kind of environment we want to expose our customer
base to.''
</P>
<P>
   By waiting a couple of hours before they can trade again,
individual investors have a chance to ``digest'' news
announcements, O'Connell says. ``Our focus is not on the day trader
or aggressive trader; it is more on the conservative individual.''
</P>
<P>
   MarketXT further insulates investors against volatility by
requiring that they post only limit orders. (Datek's Island ECN
also has imposed this rule.)
</P>
<P>
   With limit orders, investors set a maximum price at which they
will buy a stock, or a minimum price at which they will sell.
``That keeps customers from being rudely surprised by the prices
they pay or get,'' O'Connell says.
</P>
<P>
   MarketXT also is trying to discourage institutions from horning
in on its ECN. It will not accept orders greater than 5,000 shares.
</P>

   Perhaps because it is not designed for aggressive or
institutional traders, MarketXT can claim only light volume thus
far. Satow said it has handled an average of only 150 trades per
day since trading began nearly two weeks ago. The volume will have
to be ``much larger'' before the ECN can earn a profit, he says.
</P>
<P>
   But after-hours trading has the potential to produce massive
volume, says Jim Laird, an electronic-commerce analyst with Yankee
Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a little more time,'' Laird says. ``People
are a bit wary now. Also, I don't think all that many consumers
know that it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   As more and more brokers open up the after-hours market to their
retail customers, he says, hordes of investors may flock to it.

   SCI-TSIEN-MOUSE (Undated) _ A Scientist-at-Work profile: The
world has been frenetically beating on the door of Joe Z. Tsien,
the biologist who announced last week he had created a smarter
strain of mouse. Within this enveloping chaos, Tsien has spun
around himself a small bubble of protective serenity. He calmly
describes the remarkable journey that led him from Wu Shi, a small
town near Shanghai, to the position of having made a significant,
maybe decisive, contribution to understanding the nature of memory.

   SCI-ELECTRON-BONDS (Undated) _ Of the roughly 20 million
chemical substances scientists have catalogued, nearly all are
assemblages of atoms linked together by electronic bonds. The quest
to understand these tiny bonds _ the very glue of material
existence _ is the heart of chemical science. A step in this quest
was reported last week with the publication of the sharpest direct
images ever made of electronic bonds, known as orbitals. The shapes
revealed by these images _ doughnut-like rings, dumbbell-shaped
lobes and arrays suggestive of butterfly wings _ confirmed
theoretical predictions of what these bonds should look like in the
particular molecule under study. By Malcolm W. Browne. (1050 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DIABETES (Undated) _ With rates of diabetes soaring, experts
are studying patterns of prevention in people genetically
predisposed to the disease, and looking a ways to control
cardiovascular problems in people who already have diabetes. By

   SCI-CREATIVITY (Undated) _ Scientists trying to program
creativity discovered that when they fed a formula into a computer,
it generated advertising concepts judged more original and
appealing than equivalent advertisements spawned by a group of
humans. The program demonstrates what many creative people know
intuitively: that the land of the imagination is a country like any
other, with laws, rituals and a tireless police corps that must be
obeyed if one hopes to retain citizenship there. By Natalie Angier.

   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column. Coffee
lovers take heed: For the sake of your health, you might consider
switching at least some of those daily cups of java for tea. Not
herbal tea but ``real'' tea _ green tea, black tea, Chinese tea,
fruit-flavored tea, with or without caffeine, lemon, milk or sugar.
As long as the leaves come from the plant Camellia sinensis, tea
will contain potent antioxidant chemicals that have been linked to
protection against major diseases like cancer and heart disease.
Even the caffeine in tea may be somewhat beneficial, emerging
evidence suggests. By Jane E. Brody. (1350 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DNA-VACCINE (Undated) _ Scientists at Stanford University
have found that a simple solution of DNA and water applied to the
skin of mice can induce an immune response comparable to one from
traditional intramuscular injection. The DNA vaccine was apparently
taken up through the hair follicles of the mice; nude mice (mice
without hair) did not show the same reaction. By Anne Eisenberg.

CHEMISTS ANALYZE THE GLUE OF MATERIAL EXISTENCE

 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the roughly 20 million chemical substances scientists have
catalogd, ranging from simple ones like water to gigantic compounds
like DNA, nearly all are assemblages of atoms linked together by
electronic bonds. The quest to understand these tiny bonds _ the
very glue of material existence _ is the heart of chemical science.
</P>
<P>
   An important step in this quest was reported last week with the
publication by the journal Nature of the sharpest direct images
ever made of electronic bonds (known as orbitals). The shapes
revealed by these images _ doughnutlike rings, dumbbell-shaped
lobes and arrays suggestive of butterfly wings _ confirmed
theoretical predictions of what these bonds should look like in the
molecule under study.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable pictures also contained fresh evidence bearing on
a debate over what kind of bonds may be present in a molecule made
of copper and oxygen atoms.
</P>
<P>
   Future applications of the new imaging technique, chemists said,
may eventually shed light on one of the most intractable mysteries
of solid-state physics: why it is that certain compounds of copper
and oxygen can conduct electricity without resistance at relatively
high temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists predict that these ``high-temperature
superconductors'' will underlie much of the technology of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   The imaging of bonds was achieved by a team of chemists and
physicists at Arizona State University, Tempe, headed by Dr. John
C.H. Spence and Dr. Jian-Min Zuo, and financed by the National
Science Foundation. Their technique, using beams of both X-rays and
electrons to probe molecules, was the first system capable of
imaging both the atoms in a crystal lattice and the electron bonds
holding them together.
</P>
<P>
   It was once thought that an atom was like a miniature solar
system, with planetary electrons orbiting a spherical sunlike
nucleus. But since the development of quantum mechanics in the
1920s, scientists have known that a more realistic way of thinking
about atomic electrons is to plot the regions in space where each
of an atom's electrons is most likely to be found. The shapes and
sizes of these regions, called orbitals, are determined by the
electrons' energies and three other quantum properties.
</P>
<P>
   The all-important orbitals of an atom define how the atom can
bond with other atoms. There are three main types of electronic
bonds. The simplest, the metal-to-metal bond, is thought of as a
sea of loose electrons holding metal atoms together. In another
type of link, the covalent bond, pairs of bonding electrons are
shared by adjoining atoms. In a third kind of chemical link, the
ionic bond, one atom gives up one or more of its electrons to
another atom.
</P>
<P>
   Orbitals have generally been considered more as useful
mathematical representations than as physical reality, but Spence
and his colleagues have shown that orbitals can actually be imaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to emphasize,'' he said in an interview, ``that these
pictures are not computer simulations. They are like photographs:
true images of real objects.''
</P>
<P>
   The orbitals of the electrons arrayed in shells around different
atoms are shaped differently, and their shapes are slightly altered
when they interact with other atoms to become bonds. Detecting the
subtle changes in shape of bonds connecting copper and oxygen
atoms, one of the objects of the Arizona team's investigation,
required extremely sensitive measurement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as difficult as weighing the captain of a ship by
weighing a ship with the captain on it and then subtracting the
weight of the ship,'' Spence said.
</P>
<P>
   The complex technique developed at Arizona State involves the
scattering of X-rays and electrons from atoms arrayed in crystal
lattices. X-rays are scattered mainly by the nuclei of atoms, while
electron beams are scattered mostly by the electronic bonds holding
the crystal together.
</P>
<P>
   The beams do not directly create images of nuclei or bonds. But
as impinging waves of X-rays or electrons recoil from their atomic
targets, they interfere with one another and create complex
patterns of spots. These patterns can be analyzed by computer to
reconstruct images of the nuclei and bonds in the target.
</P>
<P>
   The novelty of the Arizona technique was partly in combining
X-ray ``diffraction'' patterns with patterns formed by scattered
electrons, thereby creating composite images of both the atoms and
the bonds holding them together.
</P>
<P>
   To make the system work, the scientists had to develop methods
for precisely measuring the scattering, rather than by merely
estimating the degree of scattering qualitatively, as had been the
rule in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The copper oxide compound they studied (a cuprite) is not the
same as the copper oxide compounds (cuprates) that conduct
electricity without resistance at temperatures some 140 degrees
Fahrenheit warmer than conventional superconductors, which can only
function in extreme cold near absolute zero.
</P>
<P>
   High-temperature cuprate superconductors show great promise for
high-efficiency motors, transmission lines and many other
applications.
</P>
<P>
   But although the cuprite studied at Arizona is not a
superconductor, it revealed some properties likely to be useful in
understanding cuprate superconductors, Dr. Colin J. Humphries of
Cambridge University, England, wrote in commenting on the work.
</P>
<P>
   It had been believed by most chemists that the bonds between
copper atoms were exclusively of the metal-to-metal type, but two
decades ago Humphries reported having seen hints of covalent
bonding between copper atoms as well. The images produced in
Arizona confirmed this prediction, Spence said; faint links
suggestive of covalent bonds between copper atoms are discernible
in the pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roald Hoffmann of Cornell University, winner of the 1981
Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his theoretical investigation of
electron bonding, expressed skepticism about the purported
copper-to-copper covalent bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the copper atoms are a bit too far apart for such
bonding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm very interested in their experimental technique. It
looks like a very promising way for getting at where the electrons
are in extended materials, and maybe it could be applied to
high-temperature superconductors,'' Hoffmann said.

 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Her brother, an uncle, two aunts, two first cousins
and a nephew: Louise Robinson quickly reels off a list of relatives
with diabetes. Her parents may have had it too, she guesses, since
both died in their 40s from heart attacks, a common complication of
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   A cousin died from the disease in June after suffering its most
dreaded complications, including blindness, kidney failure, heart
attacks and infections in her feet that would have led to
amputations had she lived. The cousin was in her 50s, like Ms.
Robinson, and the two had been close.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people who have seen family members suffer and die
from diabetes, Ms. Robinson has been living with the uneasy sense
that the disease lurks in her genes and sooner or later may catch
up with her.
</P>
<P>
   But about a year ago she learned that for her, the disease might
not be inevitable. Ms. Robinson volunteered for a six-year study in
which researchers are prescribing a drug or diet and exercise to
try to prevent diabetes in people like her who are at high risk for
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The study, the Diabetes Prevention Program, is being conducted
at 27 medical centers around the United States, including St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan and Albert Einstein College
of Medicine in the Bronx. (The study is full, and no centers are
accepting new participants.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Robinson, who lives in Brooklyn, does not mind taking the
45-minute subway ride to St. Luke's-Roosevelt every three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' she said. Her daughter, in her 20s,
wishes she had signed up, too.
</P>
<P>
   The study is one front in an intensifying war on Type 2
diabetes, a progressive, debilitating disease that has been gaining
ground at an alarming rate in recent years _ partly, researchers
say, because of a growing tendency among Americans to inactivity
and weight gain.
</P>
<P>
   Also called ``adult onset'' diabetes because it usually develops
after age 30, it is by far the most common type of diabetes; it has
been diagnosed in more than 9 million Americans, and 5.4 million
more are estimated to have it without knowing it. Treatment costs
exceed $100 billion a year. (Type 1, or juvenile, diabetes, occurs
in younger people and affects about a million Americans. Its causes
are different from those of Type 2.)
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in the journal Circulation, the American Heart
Association and four other public health groups urged doctors to be
more aggressive in treating people with Type 2 diabetes, because
the disease strongly increases their risk of strokes and heart
attacks. People with diabetes usually have high cholesterol and
high blood pressure as well, and tend to be obese and inactive. All
those conditions are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and
all need to be treated along with the diabetes itself, the groups
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the National Institutes of Health announced
that two new studies would be started this year to test more
intensive treatment of those risk factors in people with diabetes
to try to reduce their rates of cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers think the disease is caused by a combination of
genes, not yet identified, but also by lifestyle: In people who are
genetically predisposed, inactivity and weight gain can bring on
the disease, and the risk is heightened with age. And certain
ethnic groups appear to have a strong genetic susceptibility to
Type 2 diabetes, including blacks, Hispanic Americans, American
Indians, Asians and Pacific Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incidence of Type 2 diabetes has skyrocketed,'' said Dr.
Sandra Foo, an endocrinologist working on the diabetes prevention
study at St. Luke's-Roosevelt. ``This was a disease that 50 or 60
years ago was in 50- or 60-year-old people. Now we're starting to
see teen-agers with it. It's very, very concerning. We're seeing a
great deluge of masses of people becoming overweight. We must focus
on prevention. If we don't do something about it, we're going to
have an epidemic on our hands and a national health crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The classic sign of diabetes is an abnormally high blood level
of glucose, a type of sugar. Glucose builds up because diabetics
lack or cannot properly use the hormone insulin, which is made by
the pancreas and helps glucose enter cells all over the body, which
can then use it as fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Without the help of insulin, glucose accumulates in the
bloodstream, where it can damage blood vessels, eventually injuring
the kidneys, eyes and nerves, cutting off circulation to the feet
and legs and raising the risk of heart disease and strokes. People
with Type 2 diabetes produce insulin, but tend to have a condition
called insulin resistance, in which their bodies cannot use it.
</P>
<P>
   The link between diabetes and cardiovascular disease has been
known for a long time, but it has become more of a concern
recently, because research suggests that heart disease is not only
more common among people with diabetes but may also be more severe.
</P>
<P>
   A study of about 18,000 patients published in The Journal of the
American Medical Association in April found that although deaths
from heart disease had declined in the United States in recent
decades, the decline was far less pronounced in people with
diabetes. In nondiabetic men, the decline was 36.4 percent; in
diabetic men, it was only 13.1 percent. And diabetic women actually
had a 23 percent increase in deaths, compared with a 27 percent
drop for women without diabetes. Reasons for the striking
differences are not known.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of data showing that our health system is
failing to take good care of people with diabetes,'' said Dr. Bruce
Zimmerman, president of the American Diabetes Association and an
endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Many
patients need careful treatment to control cholesterol,
triglycerides and blood pressure as well as blood sugar, but, he
said, they do not always get it.
</P>
<P>
   But severe complications can develop even in people who are
treated correctly, suggesting that in some, artery damage may occur
even in the earliest stages of the disease. The realization of that
has heightened the interest in prevention.

</P>
<P>
   Researchers think most cases of Type 2 diabetes begin with
insulin resistance, which is probably a genetic trait that may
occur years before diabetes develops, perhaps during adolescence.
Because the body cannot use insulin efficiently, the pancreas
churns out more and more of it in an effort to keep blood sugar
normal.
</P>
<P>
   That works for a time, but gradually insulin-producing cells in
the pancreas wear out, and blood-sugar levels begin to rise, until
diabetes develops. Weight gain and lack of exercise both make
insulin resistance worse, and high-fat diets may also contribute.
</P>
<P>
   Insulin resistance itself, even without high blood sugar, is
already associated with abnormal blood fats, high blood pressure
and heart disease. The condition can be detected by research
laboratories, but there is no simple test that can be easily
performed as part of a checkup.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 million Americans are estimated to be
insulin-resistant; only a quarter of them go on to become diabetic,
but all are thought to be at increased risk of cardiovascular
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be setting the stage for heart disease early, even
before the glucose goes up,'' Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published in the September issue of the journal
Diabetes, researchers studying people in Sicily reported that they
had identified the first gene ever linked to the form of insulin
resistance that occurs in Type 2 diabetes. The gene directs the
body to produce a protein that can interfere with insulin's ability
to open channels that let glucose enter cells.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ira Goldfine, an author of the study and a professor of
medicine and physiology at the University of California in San
Francisco, said the finding might lead to development of a drug
that could treat insulin resistance by blocking the protein and
letting insulin do its job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the protein would be a very good target for a
pharmaceutical company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that would be a long way off, he said, and it would not work
for all patients, because not everyone with insulin resistance
makes the abnormal protein, and not everyone who makes the protein
is resistant. Other genes must also play a role.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, researchers are trying other ways to prevent
diabetes. The six-year study at St. Luke's-Roosevelt and other
hospitals is comparing the effectiveness of diet and exercise with
that of drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Robinson qualified for two reasons. Somewhat overweight at 5
feet 6 inches and 157 pounds, she also had impaired glucose
tolerance, a common precursor of diabetes: When she was given a
sugary drink, her blood glucose rose abnormally, though not so high
as it would in diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Once accepted into the study, she was assigned at random to a
group that would try intensive changes in diet and exercise to lose
weight and improve glucose tolerance. Although those measures are
used to treat Type 2 diabetes, they have not been tested as a means
of prevention. Other participants were assigned to a group in which
they were given either a placebo or a diabetes drug, metformin,
which can help lower blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Working with a nutritionist, Ms. Robinson set a goal of losing
12 pounds and began walking, stretching and riding an exercise
bicycle. She also reduced the amount of fat in her diet and began
eating more fruits and vegetables and small amounts of lean meat
and poultry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a meat and potatoes and bread person,'' she said. ``A
big steak would make me happy, with French fries. I ate a lot of
pizza and processed meat and red meat. Now I no longer eat those
things. I have no desire for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Within eight months, she had lost the 12 pounds. Later, she
dropped 2 more, and they have stayed off. Others in the study have
struggled with weight loss, however, losing weight and gaining it
back and starting all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look better and I feel better,'' Ms. Robinson said. Her
energy has gone up and her blood pressure, blood sugar and dress
size have all gone down. She does not think she will have any
trouble sticking with the lifestyle changes. ``It's the best thing
that happened to me,'' she said. ``I'm hoping I can avoid diabetes
entirely. If that doesn't work, at least maybe it will be quite a
while before I get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The study will continue until 2002. Dr. Joel Zonszein, an
endocrinologist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine who is
working on the program, said: ``We are looking at the possibility
of delaying the onset of diabetes. I don't think we're going to
abort it entirely, but I think we could delay it, maybe by five or
10 or 20 years.''

SOME STILL OPTIMISTIC ON LEAF SEASON

   TERRYVILLE, Conn. _ The spring and summer drought lowered the
water table enough so that Joyce and Ken Wood could finally dig a
pond they had wanted for years, allowing them to add ice skating to
the hay rides and other attractions they offer at Woods Acres,
their farm here in the Litchfield Hills, in northwestern
Connecticut. But as they surveyed the excavation at sunset
recently, orange and yellow leaves fluttered down from a 50-foot
ash, a good month ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Woods and others throughout New England, New Jersey and
upstate New York are facing a leaf-peeping season that may turn
into branch-peeping in some areas. The arid year has produced
leaves that are smaller, are dropping sooner, and may not have the
right sugars to produce the fiery show that is the center of so
many autumn travel plans.
</P>
<P>
   Late-summer sprinkles restored some hopes for a storybook fall,
but leisurely drives in late August through northwestern
Connecticut showed wilted, mottled maples and oaks, a few with
leaves huddled as forlornly at their trunks as the needles from
Charlie Brown's Christmas tree. Dr. Robert J. Kohut, a plant
pathologist at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at
Cornell University, predicted muddy colors this fall. ``Some trees
are holding their own, but even those leaves aren't
photosynthesizing at the rate they normally would,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents here say they've heard dire predictions before, but
remain confident that no one will be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year it's something with the foliage _ it's too wet or
too dry, or the spring was too cold or it got hot too quickly,''
said Janet L. Serra, executive director of the Litchfield Hills
Visitors Bureau. ``It drives me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's threat to the foliage has thrown uncertainty into a
part of the travel industry that usually is quite dependable.
Innkeepers and tour operators in New England say leaf-peepers tend
to be older people who enjoy the peace after youngsters have gone
back to school, and don't want to worry about summer heat.
</P>
<P>
   David Paul, managing director of VBT Bicycling Vacations in
Bristol, Vt., said that he's gotten a lot of questions, but no
cancellations, from the 600 people he expects on his five-day
bicycling tours through the foliage belts in four states. ``The
trees in the yard of the inn where you're staying may not have the
color,'' Paul said. ``But if you go over a pass, you'll see
something. The curtain doesn't come down on a given day.''
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, Gov. Howard B. Dean has personally shouldered
foliage spin-control duty, trying to reassure potential visitors
that northern New England is wetter than other areas. ``If it rains
too much, the fall colors are great, but people can't get out to
see them,'' he said by telephone. ``We're probably going to have a
dry fall, so I would argue that people will be able to get outside
and enjoy it more.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean was so anxious to reassure leaf-peepers that he revealed
his own secret viewing spot to non-Vermonters for what he said was
the first time. His tip is to take State Route 58, one of the last
two unpaved roads in Vermont, for about 15 miles from Lowell to
Montgomery Center. The huge old-growth oaks and maples reach across
the road to meet each other, forming what Governor Dean called a
tunnel of color.
</P>
<P>
   Other states are issuing reminders that the foliage is just a
backdrop for other rites of fall, including the annual pumpkin
weigh-off in New Milford, Conn., to be held this year on Oct. 9.
(Last year's winner was 907 pounds.) Innkeepers say that although
they are already booked for most weekends in September and October,
they still have openings on weekdays. Marged Higginson, owner of
the Under Mountain Inn in Salisbury, Conn., suggests a trip that
follows the changing leaves from north to south, and she says she
plans to point this year's guests to higher elevations for the most
brilliant colors.
</P>
<P>
   For those determined to find whatever foliage there is, the
Whiteface Mountain Ski Center in Wilmington, N.Y., near Lake
Placid, offers a $7 ride on its chairlift, which rises to 3,676
feet and offers a view for 50 to 75 miles, through Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Woods Acres, Joyce and Ken Wood are gearing up for the
usual crowd of foliage fanatics, who will take horse-drawn carriage
or wagon rides into the woods. For couples, the Woods will pack a
picnic and drop the visitors to enjoy the leaves on their own until
the carriage returns. Groups can finish the night with hot cider in
the great room of the farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, who was born on the farm 52 years ago, still talks
reverently about a process so mysteriously dependable that he says
no drought will stop it. ``You get a little orange here, and a
little red there, and the next day it's fall,'' he said. ``Then in
a few weeks, a wind comes up and takes them all off.''

ROUTE TO CREATIVITY: FOLLOWING BLISS OR DOTS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(th) 
 By NATALIE ANGIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the roster of favorite oxymorons that includes ``jumbo
shrimp,'' ``military intelligence'' and ``healthy tan,'' a new
report proposes a tart addition: ``artistic freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   By the reckoning of three Israeli researchers, nothing imprisons
the mind more thoroughly, nothing stifles inventiveness and
artistry more brutally, than too much freedom, too much wiggle room
for the imagination. Instead, they argue, the real source of
productive creativity may lie in art's supposed bugaboos: rules,
structure, even the occasional editor or two.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay in the current issue of the journal Science, Dr.
Jacob Goldenberg, Dr. David Mazursky and Dr. Sorin Solomon of
Hebrew University in Jerusalem describe an algorithm, or formula,
for creating new advertisements that is surprisingly simple, yet
unnervingly effective.
</P>
<P>
   When they fed the algorithm into a computer, it generated
advertising concepts judged more original and appealing than
equivalent advertisements spawned by a group of humans who were
told, in essence, to ``follow their bliss.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer program demonstrates graphically what many creative
people know intuitively: the land of the imagination is a country
like any other, with laws, rituals and a tireless police corps that
must be obeyed if one hopes to retain citizenship there.
</P>
<P>
   Creativity, by this measure, is not some mystical, inchoate
process, beyond analysis and delineation, but rather is composed of
a series of distinct subroutines, which can be rallied repeatedly
to churn out ideas that seem the opposite of routine.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of creative thinking as amenable to parsing and
replication is both cheering and disheartening: cheering because it
means that just about anybody can learn to do it at least passably
well, and disheartening for showing, once again, that even genius
is so much meat in motion.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the researchers were interested less in
philosophical matters than in practicality, in coming up with
better techniques for stimulating creative thinking. They focused
on advertising as a business that demands chronic novelty.
</P>
<P>
   In their report, they describe experiments in which they
deconstructed renowned advertisements and found that they often
followed specific formulas, which they term templates. One of the
commonest templates they found is the so-called replacement
template.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they considered a Nike ad, in which a group of
firemen are standing around in a rescue pose, looking up as though
someone was about to jump from a burning building into their net.
In lieu of a net is a giant Nike sneaker, with copy boasting of how
the new Nike walking shoes are ``very safe places to land.''
</P>
<P>
   In this advertisement, the sneaker replaces an object whose most
salient characteristic is ``cushioning.'' Indeed, the life net
cushions a person from death itself.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a series for Bally shoes shows various objects that
symbolize freedom _ a beach, clouds in the sky _ in the shape of a
foot, the implication being that the wearing of Bally shoes frees
the wearer from cares, the rat race, bunions.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers then translated principles of the replacement
template into a simple program, and had a computer create concepts
designed to pitch different products. The computer did not generate
real ads with all the visual flourishes, but simply came up with
descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also asked people outside advertising and
untrained in the replacement algorithm or other creativity
techniques, to generate hypothetical ads for the same products.
When shown to judges, both advertising professionals and outsiders,
the advertisements from the computer were invariably ranked higher
in creativity and originality than those from the laypeople. In
fact, the computer's ads were rated with genuine ones from major
magazines, and virtually on par with ones that had won major
awards.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the computer, asked to design a campaign promoting
the coming of the World Cup tennis tournament to Jerusalem,
conceived of the notion of picturing Jerusalem's famed Temple
Mountain mosque with a tennis ball texture. The untrained humans
could come up with nothing more thrilling than an image of
Jerusalem's Old Wall and ad copy announcing the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to hawk the on-time performance of an airline, the
computer program suggested an image of a cuckoo clock, with the
emerging cuckoo in the shape of a plane. A human proposal: a
picture of a family running through the airport while one of the
parents screams: ``Let's run, this airline is right on time.'' (And
no O.J. Simpson in sight!)
</P>
<P>
   Goldenberg and Mazursky, who are in the school of business, and
Solomon, of the physics department, designed the program to counter
a hoary principle in creativity theory that the most original ideas
are born of utter freedom, a shifting of paradigms, a circling of
the square, a streaming of consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they argue, their work on templates indicates that
constraining options and focusing thought in a specific, rigorous
and discerning direction may yield comparatively fresher results.
</P>
<P>
   ``To suspend criticism and think any idea is possible or good
may ultimately be destructive to creativity,'' said Goldenberg. The
researchers emphasized that their work has scant relevance to the
science of artificial intelligence, and that they have no interest
in proving computers to be potentially more creative than humans,
HAL with a beret and ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they are seeking to mimic the way people solve problems
or create ideas, and then describe the process thematically. When
taught the algorithms, they said, lay humans will match and often
outperform the machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans can criticize themselves, and computers can't,'' said
Mazursky. ``As Oscar Wilde said, imagination is imitative _ the
real innovation lies in criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also said that the algorithms they designed for
advertising would not necessarily work outside the domain of
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not studying just creativity, but creativity in
specific contexts,'' said Mazursky.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in the creativity business found the new paper
enlightening and amusing, and said it jibed with the premises of
their approach to changing the mind's light bulb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limits can be powerful motivator,'' said Roger von Oech, a
creativity consultant for businesses and author of a classic in the
field, ``A Whack on the Side of the Head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're given a really tight deadline and a small budget,
you'll probably be more resourceful than if you have a ton of time
and a limitless budget,'' he said. ``Skyscrapers weren't invented
by people with a lot of land, but by those who had to figure out
how to build more offices on tight and incredibly expensive real
estate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Von Oech paraphrased Stephen Sondheim, who said that if someone
asked him to write a song about the sea, he would be at sea
himself; but ask him to write a ballad about a woman in a red dress
in a lounge at three in the morning and falling off the bar stool
in drunken sorrow, and he is inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Von Oech says that in his corporate seminars and training
sessions, he gives his clients very specific tasks. Most of them
are centered on humor, his belief being that, as he puts, ``there's
a close relationship between the ha-ha of humor and the ah-ha of
discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he asks people to come up with offbeat mottoes for
themselves or their companies, and he has stimulated some beauties.
From the Bank of America group: ``Bank of America: Where you're
never alone until you need a loan.'' From Microsoft: ``We're
arrogant, and we should be.''
</P>
<P>
   But other creativity researchers called the new Science paper
something of an artful dodge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't very profound, and it didn't thrill me,'' said Dr.
Mark A. Runco, editor of Creativity Research Journal and a
professor of child and adolescent studies at California State
University in Fullerton. ``For one thing, I'm not sure it was a
fair test. Who are these judges of creativity? People aren't very
good at judging creative ideas. Not even creative people are good
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The poet Goethe, Runco pointed out, thought his study of optics
to be his most important contribution to humanity, but today people
read his poetry, not his science papers. Beethoven judged as his
greatest composition a piece of music that practically nobody
listens to anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it fair to have given the human subjects complete
freedom without any structure or template, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anyone who would think that a completely open
task or environment would be most conducive to creativity,'' Runco
said. Instead, he explained, most researchers in creativity studies
are seeking to understand the balance and interdynamics between
structure and openness.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Wycoff, the founder of Innovation Network, a professional
association of creativity consultants, and author of ``Mind
Mapping,'' believes the key to creativity is ``structure, but
structure with permeability.''
</P>
<P>
   Another essential factor, she said, is energy. ``People are
never out of ideas,'' she said, ``but they may run out of energy.''
And in this arena, alas, the computer will always have us beat.

or wagon rides into the woods. For couples, the Woods will pack a
picnic and drop the visitors to enjoy the leaves on their own until
the carriage returns. Groups can finish the night with hot cider in
the great room of the farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, who was born on the farm 52 years ago, still talks
reverently about a process so mysteriously dependable that he says
no drought will stop it. ``You get a little orange here, and a
little red there, and the next day it's fall,'' he said. ``Then in
a few weeks, a wind comes up and takes them all off.''

ROUTE TO CREATIVITY: FOLLOWING BLISS OR DOTS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(th) 
 By NATALIE ANGIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the roster of favorite oxymorons that includes ``jumbo
shrimp,'' ``military intelligence'' and ``healthy tan,'' a new
report proposes a tart addition: ``artistic freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   By the reckoning of three Israeli researchers, nothing imprisons
the mind more thoroughly, nothing stifles inventiveness and
artistry more brutally, than too much freedom, too much wiggle room
for the imagination. Instead, they argue, the real source of
productive creativity may lie in art's supposed bugaboos: rules,
structure, even the occasional editor or two.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay in the current issue of the journal Science, Dr.
Jacob Goldenberg, Dr. David Mazursky and Dr. Sorin Solomon of
Hebrew University in Jerusalem describe an algorithm, or formula,
for creating new advertisements that is surprisingly simple, yet
unnervingly effective.
</P>
<P>
   When they fed the algorithm into a computer, it generated
advertising concepts judged more original and appealing than
equivalent advertisements spawned by a group of humans who were
told, in essence, to ``follow their bliss.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer program demonstrates graphically what many creative
people know intuitively: the land of the imagination is a country
like any other, with laws, rituals and a tireless police corps that
must be obeyed if one hopes to retain citizenship there.
</P>
<P>
   Creativity, by this measure, is not some mystical, inchoate
process, beyond analysis and delineation, but rather is composed of
a series of distinct subroutines, which can be rallied repeatedly
to churn out ideas that seem the opposite of routine.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of creative thinking as amenable to parsing and
replication is both cheering and disheartening: cheering because it
means that just about anybody can learn to do it at least passably
well, and disheartening for showing, once again, that even genius
is so much meat in motion.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the researchers were interested less in
philosophical matters than in practicality, in coming up with
better techniques for stimulating creative thinking. They focused
on advertising as a business that demands chronic novelty.
</P>
<P>
   In their report, they describe experiments in which they
deconstructed renowned advertisements and found that they often
followed specific formulas, which they term templates. One of the
commonest templates they found is the so-called replacement
template.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they considered a Nike ad, in which a group of
firemen are standing around in a rescue pose, looking up as though
someone was about to jump from a burning building into their net.
In lieu of a net is a giant Nike sneaker, with copy boasting of how
the new Nike walking shoes are ``very safe places to land.''
</P>
<P>
   In this advertisement, the sneaker replaces an object whose most
salient characteristic is ``cushioning.'' Indeed, the life net
cushions a person from death itself.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a series for Bally shoes shows various objects that
symbolize freedom _ a beach, clouds in the sky _ in the shape of a
foot, the implication being that the wearing of Bally shoes frees
the wearer from cares, the rat race, bunions.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers then translated principles of the replacement
template into a simple program, and had a computer create concepts
designed to pitch different products. The computer did not generate
real ads with all the visual flourishes, but simply came up with
descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also asked people outside advertising and
untrained in the replacement algorithm or other creativity
techniques, to generate hypothetical ads for the same products.
When shown to judges, both advertising professionals and outsiders,
the advertisements from the computer were invariably ranked higher
in creativity and originality than those from the laypeople. In
fact, the computer's ads were rated with genuine ones from major
magazines, and virtually on par with ones that had won major
awards.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the computer, asked to design a campaign promoting
the coming of the World Cup tennis tournament to Jerusalem,
conceived of the notion of picturing Jerusalem's famed Temple
Mountain mosque with a tennis ball texture. The untrained humans
could come up with nothing more thrilling than an image of
Jerusalem's Old Wall and ad copy announcing the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to hawk the on-time performance of an airline, the
computer program suggested an image of a cuckoo clock, with the
emerging cuckoo in the shape of a plane. A human proposal: a
picture of a family running through the airport while one of the
parents screams: ``Let's run, this airline is right on time.'' (And
no O.J. Simpson in sight!)
</P>
<P>
   Goldenberg and Mazursky, who are in the school of business, and
Solomon, of the physics department, designed the program to counter
a hoary principle in creativity theory that the most original ideas
are born of utter freedom, a shifting of paradigms, a circling of
the square, a streaming of consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they argue, their work on templates indicates that
constraining options and focusing thought in a specific, rigorous
and discerning direction may yield comparatively fresher results.
</P>
<P>
   ``To suspend criticism and think any idea is possible or good
may ultimately be destructive to creativity,'' said Goldenberg. The
researchers emphasized that their work has scant relevance to the
science of artificial intelligence, and that they have no interest
in proving computers to be potentially more creative than humans,
HAL with a beret and ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they are seeking to mimic the way people solve problems
or create ideas, and then describe the process thematically. When
taught the algorithms, they said, lay humans will match and often
outperform the machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans can criticize themselves, and computers can't,'' said
Mazursky. ``As Oscar Wilde said, imagination is imitative _ the
real innovation lies in criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also said that the algorithms they designed for
advertising would not necessarily work outside the domain of
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not studying just creativity, but creativity in
specific contexts,'' said Mazursky.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in the creativity business found the new paper
enlightening and amusing, and said it jibed with the premises of
their approach to changing the mind's light bulb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limits can be powerful motivator,'' said Roger von Oech, a
creativity consultant for businesses and author of a classic in the
field, ``A Whack on the Side of the Head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're given a really tight deadline and a small budget,
you'll probably be more resourceful than if you have a ton of time
and a limitless budget,'' he said. ``Skyscrapers weren't invented
by people with a lot of land, but by those who had to figure out
how to build more offices on tight and incredibly expensive real
estate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Von Oech paraphrased Stephen Sondheim, who said that if someone
asked him to write a song about the sea, he would be at sea
himself; but ask him to write a ballad about a woman in a red dress
in a lounge at three in the morning and falling off the bar stool
in drunken sorrow, and he is inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Von Oech says that in his corporate seminars and training
sessions, he gives his clients very specific tasks. Most of them
are centered on humor, his belief being that, as he puts, ``there's
a close relationship between the ha-ha of humor and the ah-ha of
discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he asks people to come up with offbeat mottoes for
themselves or their companies, and he has stimulated some beauties.
From the Bank of America group: ``Bank of America: Where you're
never alone until you need a loan.'' From Microsoft: ``We're
arrogant, and we should be.''
</P>
<P>
   But other creativity researchers called the new Science paper
something of an artful dodge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't very profound, and it didn't thrill me,'' said Dr.
Mark A. Runco, editor of Creativity Research Journal and a
professor of child and adolescent studies at California State
University in Fullerton. ``For one thing, I'm not sure it was a
fair test. Who are these judges of creativity? People aren't very
good at judging creative ideas. Not even creative people are good
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The poet Goethe, Runco pointed out, thought his study of optics
to be his most important contribution to humanity, but today people
read his poetry, not his science papers. Beethoven judged as his
greatest composition a piece of music that practically nobody
listens to anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it fair to have given the human subjects complete
freedom without any structure or template, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anyone who would think that a completely open
task or environment would be most conducive to creativity,'' Runco
said. Instead, he explained, most researchers in creativity studies
are seeking to understand the balance and interdynamics between
structure and openness.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Wycoff, the founder of Innovation Network, a professional
association of creativity consultants, and author of ``Mind
Mapping,'' believes the key to creativity is ``structure, but
structure with permeability.''
</P>
<P>
   Another essential factor, she said, is energy. ``People are
never out of ideas,'' she said, ``but they may run out of energy.''
And in this arena, alas, the computer will always have us beat.

   Vive Las Vegas! The Strip's New Hotel
</P>
<P>
   Now you can always have Paris _ sort of _ even if you never get
to France. New York, Venice, Monte Carlo and Luxor have all been
paid homage in the form of Las Vegas hotels, so the Paris Las Vegas
Casino Resort seemed overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Opened Sept. 1 on the Strip, it is next to one of its corporate
siblings, Bally's, and across Las Vegas Boulevard from Bellagio.
The 2,916-room resort is highlighted by a 50-story half-scale copy
of the Eiffel Tower that has a restaurant 100 feet up and an
observation deck near the top from which you can view the neon
version of the City of Light at your feet.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other Paris landmarks copied on the hotel's 24-acre
grounds are the Arc de Triomphe, the Hotel de Ville and the facades
of the Louvre and the Paris Opera. There is no Metro, but there is
a monorail that links the hotel to Bally's and the MGM Grand. Three
of the four legs of the Eiffel Tower rise from the casino floor and
go through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Among the chefs who will lend their talents are Jean Joho, chef
and owner of Everest and Brasserie Jo in Chicago, and Gabino
Sotelino, another Chicago chef, whose outdoor Mon Ami Gabi at the
Paris Las Vegas takes its name from his home restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   All rooms in the 34-story hotel include two-line telephones, a
data port and a marble bath with separate shower and tub.
</P>
<P>
   Rates at the Paris Las Vegas, 3655 Las Vegas Boulevard South,
range from $129 to $239 for standard rooms, $350 to $5,000 for
suites. Reservations: (888) 266-5687.
</P>
<P>
   Car Rental, Greens Fees Add Up to Miles Three airlines have
recently formed alliances, and bonus miles are being awarded for
booking airline tickets on the Internet.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Northwest has two new car rental partners _ Avis and Hertz. Now,
members of Worldperks can earn 50 miles a day for cars rented from
Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Hertz and National. A flight is no
longer necessary to earn the mileage with any of the Worldperks
car-rental partners.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TD Waterhouse Group, a discount brokerage firm, has launched a
customer reward program in conjunction with American Airlines.
Since Aug. 2, TD Waterhouse customers have received AAdvantage
miles for depositing additional assets, maintaining minimum
balances and adding to money-market positions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Troon Golf joined America West's frequent flier program in July.
Members of Flightfund earn three miles for every dollar spent on
greens fees, up to 500 miles a round. More than 30 Troon golf
courses in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia,
Illinois, Missouri, South Carolina, Texas, Australia and Scotland
are participating.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To encourage the purchase of airline tickets on line, America
West Airlines (www.americawest.com), American Airlines
(www.aa.com), Delta Air Lines (www.delta-air-.com), Northwest
Airlines (www.nwa.com) and US Airways (www.usair.com) are offering
participants in their frequent flier programs up to 1,000 extra
miles for tickets purchased through their Web sites until the end
of this year.

   Copenhagen Celebrates Historic Neighborhood
</P>
<P>
   Through Dec. 12, the Danish Museum of Decorative Art will
observe the 250th anniversary of Frederiksstaden, the stately
Rococo neighborhood in central Copenhagen that is considered one of
the finest examples of 18th-century urban development. Created
during Denmark's Golden Age reign of Frederick V (1746-1766),
Frederiksstaden's elegantly geometric street plan was an
architectural homage to the 300th anniversary of the
Danish-Norwegian throne. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The district's architectural masterpieces include Amalienborg
Palace, the principal royal residence since 1794, and the Baroque
dome of the 19th-century Marble Church. An exquisite octagonal
square in front of Amalienborg Palace is the home of the recently
restored equestrian statue of Frederick V by Jacques Francois
Joseph Saly.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The museum is housed in the former Frederik's Hospital near the
center of the historic quarter; its eclectic exhibition showcases
Frederiksstaden's art, ceramics, glass, furniture and fashion,
along with architectural drawings, city maps, models and documents.
Through a comprehensive display of 18th-century portraits, busts
and woodcuts of Frederick V, the exhibit's final section, ``The
Cult of Royalty,'' illustrates the importance of absolute monarchy
in 18th-century Denmark and attempts to provide an international
perspective on the Frederiksstaden epoch.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the events planned in connection with the anniversary are
a performance by the Vox Nova Ensemble and Concerto Copenhagen of
Frederick V's funerary cantata by Johann Adolph Scheibe at Garrison
Church on Sept. 19 and a concert of 18th-century chamber music by
the Frederiksstaden Baroque Ensemble at the museum on Oct. 24.
Information: Danish Museum of Decorative Arts, 68 Bredgade,
Copenhagen, (45-33) 14 94 52, www.mus-kim.dk. Closed Monday.
Admission $6.50, under 16 free.

<P>
   Classic Woodies Recall Another World
</P>
<P>
   Bette Davis and Clark Gable drove them, the Beach Boys sang
about them, Southern Californian surfers of the 1960s cruised in
them, and now, after a long public absence, the woodies of
yesteryear are back in the limelight. The Petersen Automotive
Museum in Los Angeles is honoring these curious old cars through
Jan. 17 in an exhibition entitled ``Surf's Up! The Great American
Woody.'' Aptly named, woodies used a substantial amount of wood in
their bodies, creating a unique look.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 restored woody classics, predominantly from the 30's
through the mid-50's, are on display, including a selection of the
popular wood-paneled station wagons and the less remembered, but
notably elegant, sedans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the show's highlights are a customized 1951 Ford Country
Squire ``surf wagon,'' complete with surfboards in back, and a
customized 1948 Chrysler Town and Country convertible that belonged
to the cowboy-actor Leo Carrillo who played Pancho on the
television series ``The Cisco Kid.'' His car features a mounted
steer's head on the hood. There is also a customized 1946 Mercury
station wagon, a rugged ancestor of today's sport utility vehicles.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Background surf music and a large-screen video presentation
(including old surf footage) help recreate a world gone by.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Admission to ``Surf's Up! The Great American Woody'' is included
with general admission ($7) to the Petersen Automotive Museum, 6060
Wilshire Boulevard. Information: (323) 930-2277.
</P>
<P>
   In the Loire Valley, Gardens and Nothing But
</P>
<P>
   Garden lovers can enjoy a feast for the eyes and palate at two
fanciful and practical garden projects in the Loire Valley. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until Oct. 30, Prince Louis Albert de Broglie is displaying more
than 400 varieties of tomatoes, 120 types of lettuce and 28 kinds
of melons, along with dozens of examples of basil, mint, thyme,
raspberries and strawberries from his 2.47-acre potager, or
vegetable garden, at the Chateau de la Bourdaisiere in
Montlouis-sur-Loire. There is also a well-stocked garden shop for
seeds, books and garden gear. The garden is open daily, 10 a.m. to
7 p.m.; admission is $4, $3.25 for ages 8 to 12 (at 6 francs to the
dollar).
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can also stay at the proud stone chateau, which serves
as a sort of bed-and-breakfast. The 20 rooms cost $150 to $200 a
night. This Saturday and Sunday, a Festival de la Tomate offers
visitors a chance to sample the season's bounty. Admission: $5.
Information: Le Potager d'un Prince, Le Chateau de la Bourdaisiere,
37270 Montlouis-sur-Loire; (33-2) 47.45.16.31, fax (33-2)
47.45.09.11, or www.chateaux-france.com/bourdaisiere.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until Oct. 24, visitors to Chaumont-sur-Loire can view some 30
potagers at Rien que des Potagers (Nothing but Vegetable Gardens),
organized by the Conservatoire International des Parcs et Jardins
et du Paysage. The Chaumont conservatory was founded eight years
ago, and is housed in the grand former stables of the Chateau de
Chaumont-sur-Loire (also open for visits). This year's competition
attracted about 300 international contestants, ranging from
sculptors to landscape architects, and the finalists' garden
designs _ classic to innovative _ are installed on the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors may tour the patchwork of small gardens on their own,
or take free hourly guided visits. There's also a good garden shop
and for those who want to eat, an outdoor tea salon, a pasta
restaurant and the more sophisticated Grand Velum, in an elegant
tent, all on the grounds. Grand Velum's inventive chef,
Francois-Xavier Bogard, cooks only with local organic produce.
Meals cost $18 to $24 without wine, but there is a wide selection
of local wines by the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Rien Que des Potagers, Conservatoire International
des Parcs et Jardins et du Paysage, 41150 Chaumont-sur-Loire; phone
and fax, (33-2) 54.20.99.24. The gardens are open daily 9 A.M. to 7
P.M. until Oct. 24; admission: $4, free under age 8.
</P>
<P>
   Both gardens will have special events for the Semaine du Gout
(Week of Taste), Oct. 16 to 24.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A century ago, paleontologists began exploring a cave outside
the town of Krapina, 30 miles north of Zagreb, Croatia. The place
was littered with fossil bones of Neanderthals, the enigmatic human
relatives that died out about 30,000 years ago, and stone tools and
bones of extinct animals.
</P>
<P>
   By the completion of excavations in 1905, Krapina had yielded
more hominid fossils than any other site known at the time, and the
collection remains a treasure of Neanderthal research.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, scientists at the University of Zagreb
took a complete set of X-rays of the Krapina fossils: 874
Neanderthal bone fragments representing more than 75 individuals.
Now researchers at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of
Archaeology and Anthropology have studied the X-ray images of skull
fragments pieced together and shown in haunting profile, as well as
many other bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exciting new data, and the first time researchers have
had an opportunity to view, in total, so many radiographic images
of fossils from an entire group of Neanderthals,'' said Dr. Alan
Mann, an anthropologist at Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The X-ray images and the researchers' assessments have been
compiled in the book ``The Krapina Hominids: A Radiographic Atlas
of the Skeletal Collection,'' published by the Republic of Croatia.
Publication coincided with an international conference on the
Krapina Neanderthals, held in Zagreb in August.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted by Mann and Dr. Morrie Kricun, also of
Pennsylvania; Dr. Janet Monge, a professor of anthropology at Bryn
Mawr College and a member of the Pennsylvania museum staff; Dr.
Gerald Finkel of Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in
Philadelphia; Dr. Michelle Lampl, an anthropologist at Emory
University in Atlanta, and Dr. Jakov Radovcic, a paleontologist at
the Croatian Natural History Museum in Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
   One objective was to investigate the health of these
Neanderthals. On the whole, they were found to be a robust, healthy
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to document one of the earliest benign bone
tumors ever found; one individual may have had a surgical
amputation of his hand, and several individuals had examples of
osteoarthritis, which may have made them a little stiff in the
morning,'' Dr. Monge said. The X-rays also revealed a number of
healed fractures.

TRIPS TO EXPLORE THE FAMILY TREE

<TEXT>
<P>
   In July, Rabbi Bennett F. Miller of New Brunswick, N.J., and two
cousins took a 10-day tour to the family's former village, Sasov,
now in Ukraine, and to Poland. The trip was designed and researched
for them by Miriam Weiner, owner of Routes to Roots in Secaucus,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in Sasov, 800 of 1,200 people were Jews,'' Miller said.
``No Jews are left. But Miriam's people took us to cemeteries and
old synagogues. They took us to where the archives were. We could
have spent days searching, but they knew where to go.'' Rabbi
Miller, rabbi of Anshe Emeth Memorial Temple, said he was proud and
grateful to be able to make such a trip.
</P>
<P>
   Digging into family roots is a popular format for travel these
days. A 30-member Elderhostel genealogy tour to Ireland scheduled
for next June, for example, was full by last month. Ann H. Waigand,
publisher of The Educated Traveler newsletter, said her first issue
on genealogy tours, published earlier this year, got five times
more single-issue orders than any other issue she had put out in
nine years. Caravella Italia, a tour company in Philadelphia and
Bologna, will offer four Jewish Heritage Tours of Italy next year
because of the interest in the two offered this year, according to
David Diliberto, the owner.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the growth in collecting family history is linked to
the Internet, where the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
in May posted material from its collection of genealogical data,
the world's largest, adding an enormous free resource to existing
research sites and for a time creating a traffic jam at the Mormon
Web site: www.familysearch.org. The Mormons, who believe that
searching for ancestors is a religious duty, have microfilmed
genealogy records of all kinds all over the world to assist in the
tracing of forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Other varied sites like www.Jewishgen.org, give statistics and
records or sources for them. Searchers may be able to contact
people bearing a family name, for example, without leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   Jewishgen, among other sites, gives access to systems that
provide numerical equivalents for names spelled or transliterated
variously; for example, Scherman, Schurman, Sherman, Shireman and
Shurman are indexed together as S655. This safeguards against
missing leads, and many families will need to come to grips with
such code systems. They make it easier to trace family roots to
specific cities and villages.
</P>
<P>
   Here are brief reports on some genealogy trips, and leads for
finding still others.
</P>
<P>
   Caravella Italia designs tours for family groups of 4 to 12 who
want to visit particular areas in Italy. These are not for those
who simply want to find a particular document, Diliberto said, but
for travelers who would like to visit towns and perhaps see
relatives who stayed behind when family members migrated to the
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the families know some names, we can do a little tracing
coming forward,'' Diliberto said. ``We find the records office. We
build this research into the tour cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the customized tours, he said, the company makes a
specialty of Jewish history in Italy, with tours that have been
directed by Prof. Mark Bernheim of Miami University in Ohio, who
has a background in the subject and teaches in Florence in the
summer. Four departures will be offered next year, at dates to be
set. The 13-night tours this year were for groups of 12 visiting
Rome, Pitigliano in Tuscany, Florence, Ferrara _ scene of ``The
Garden of the Finzi-Continis'' _ and Venice.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Genny Bassani-Liscia, sister of Giorgio Bassani, author
of the novel, accompanied the group to Ferrara from her home in
Florence, led a walking tour and gave an account of her girlhood
experiences when the family fled the Nazis. She also led a
discussion after a viewing of the De Sica movie. Mrs.
Bassani-Liscia expects to join this trip again next month. With
hotels and nine meals, land arrangements for the tour cost $4,975 a
person, double occupancy.

   Ashton-Drye Associates near Buffalo offers only custom tours,
principally focusing on the arts, said the owner, Marjory Sgroi. It
has started setting up family-history trips in the British Isles as
a sideline. ``We don't do the genealogy research,'' she said.
``When families come to us, they know where they want to go to. We
arrange hotels, transportation, meals and access to records.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sgroi said that most groups, through family newsletters or
reunions, were able to decide in advance what they wanted. Prices
for trips of one to two weeks range from $1,800 to $2,500 a person
without air fare; groups range from 15 to 85 people.

Adventure Tour, in Western Ukraine and Poland, visits Kiev, small
German villages in the area and Lublin and Warsaw. Postponed
because of the fighting in Kosovo this year, the tour is expected
to run next year. Land arrangements were $1,995 a person, double

   Elderhostel's Irish genealogy tour got twice as many
applications as there were spaces, and it was filled by lottery on
Aug. 13, under the organization's usual procedure. Richard Harris,
the director for international programs, and Birgitta Zissis, who
directs both domestic and foreign programs, said that there had
always been a major interest in family history, but it is on the
rise, and Elderhostel is responding with more trips.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's new genealogy trip to Denmark next year, May
13 to 27, is virtually full. The Swedish version is being offered
May 6 to 21 for the second time and still has space. By 2001,
Harris said, there will be an English program as well.

   For those just getting involved, the New England Historic
Genealogical Society in Boston offers free sessions, ``Getting
Started in Your Family History,'' at noon and at 7 p.m. on the
first Monday of each month. It also conducts twice-yearly trips to
Brigham Young University, and offers other genealogy tours. The
next Utah trip, Nov. 14 to 21, will cost $810 a person in double
occupancy, not including air fare.
</P>
<P>
   For those interested both in the Internet and in using computer
software to trace family records, this group is offering an all-day
class this month on Sept. 24 and Sept. 25 in Boston. ``Computer
Resources for Genealogists'' costs $80 a person. This class touches
on many software programs that can be purchased for prices that
begin around $20 and run quite a way up. Our older son, a
programmer, has been working with the Broderbund Family Tree Maker

   Jane Schwerdtfeger, the education director at the New England
genealogical group, said it was taking its act on the road with
more advanced four-session classes. On Nov. 5 and 6, it will offer
its second-level program at Connecticut College in New London, and
later that month in Concord, N.H. This organization has an

   CHINA-NUKE (Undated) _ American bomb makers visiting China in
1979 were startled by a series of questions that suggested the
Chinese were hot on the trail of the secret to building a modern
nuclear arsenal, miniaturization. China succeeded in September
1992. Was China's advance the result of espionage, hard work or
some mix of the two? Today, the debate rages on. Experts agree that
spying occurred, but clash violently on how much was stolen and
what impact it had on Beijing's advance, if any. A Los Alamos team
concluded in 1995 that China's stride was probably based on
espionage. A report this year by a congressional committee that
made the case public went further, claiming that it would have been
``virtually impossible'' for China to have made small warheads
``without the nuclear secrets stolen from the United States.'' A
review of the dispute, based on months of interviews and
disclosures of weapon and intelligence secrets, suggests that the
congressional report went beyond the evidence in asserting that
stolen secrets were the main reason for China's breakthrough. The
review also bolsters an important point of agreement among feuding
experts: that the federal investigation focused too soon on the Los
Alamos National Laboratory and one worker there, Wen Ho Lee, who
was fired for security violations. The lost secrets, it now
appears, were available to hundreds and perhaps thousands of
individuals scattered throughout the nation's arms complex. A

   PRINCETON, N.J. _ A certain amount of disorder has broken out
around Joe Tsien, the biologist who announced last week that he had
created a smarter strain of mouse by genetically altering a gene
for memory.
</P>
<P>
   Patients call seeking help. Individuals of enhanced imagination
warn that the mice may escape and take over the planet. Television
crews patrol the halls. His voice-mail box has overflowed.
</P>
<P>
   But Tsien, seemingly the only scientist on the Princeton campus
who, on a warm summer day, is wearing a tie, ignores the chaos and
a phone that rings every couple of minutes. In soft tones he
describes the remarkable journey that has led him from Wuxi, a
small town near Shanghai, China, to the position of having made a
significant, maybe decisive, contribution to understanding the
nature of memory and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Tsien (pronounced Chen) says he did not begin to consider the
wider implications of his work until just before his article was
published. He engineered his smarter mice for purely academic
reasons, to address and perhaps solve the question of how memories
are laid down in the brain. But the mice turned out to be smarter
as well as having better memories, lending an unexpected new
dimension to the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Although many arguments with psychologists doubtless lie ahead,
Tsien believes that learning, memory and intelligence are all
intimately related because, as his smarter mice demonstrate, ``a
common unifying mechanism underlies them all.'' And because mice
and people use the same basic mechanism of memory, the smarter mice
could well shed much light on the nature of human intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Tsien's result, as he is the first to note, rests on knowledge
and techniques developed by other scientists. He describes his
experiment as ``obvious'' _ at least in retrospect. His achievement
lies in the fact that, in a highly competitive field of biology, he
was the first to conceive of the experiment and to see that it
could be decisive. He also carried it out in a particularly
convincing way. ``Extremely nicely done,'' was the verdict of Dr.
Eric Kandel, a leading biologist at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that led to the smarter mice was no lucky break.
Rather, it was a feat for which Tsien had been preparing
intensively for many years, including seven years of postdoctoral
education.
</P>
<P>
   In Wuxi, where his father was a clerk and his mother an
accountant, he was the only person to enter college from his high
school, which was attached to a fabric plant. But the college was a
good one, the East China Normal University in Shanghai, and he
decided to do doctoral studies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1986 China was still very closed, so we really had no idea
about the United States,'' Tsien says in describing how he picked a
college. He chose the University of Minnesota because it offered to
waive the application fee, which he could not afford, and because
the Chinese characters for Minnesota translated invitingly to
``clean air blue sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Having recovered from the surprise of finding the
clean-air-blue-sky state so cold, he developed an interest in
neurophysiology and the instruments then available for monitoring
the electrical signals transmitted by brain cells. ``I got
fascinated by seeing a nerve cell fire. They are talking _ what
does that mean?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A long apprenticeship was necessary before he could begin to
parse that language. He did his Ph.D. thesis with Dr. Lester Drewes
of the University of Minnesota helping him conduct studies under a
Defense Department grant on how the warfare agent sarin blocks the
transmission of nervous signals.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving his Ph.D. in 1990, he was accepted as a
postdoctoral student by Kandel's laboratory. There he worked on
identifying genes that are active in rats' brains during memory
formation. ``I got a more systematic education in neuroscience. I
got to see how a big lab operates,'' Tsien said.
</P>
<P>
   He then moved to another leading neuroscience laboratory, that
of Dr. Susumu Tonegawa at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Tonegawa won the Nobel Prize in 1987 for research on
the genetic control of the immune system, and later switched to the
study of learning.
</P>
<P>
   In Tonegawa's lab, Tsien worked with so-called knock-out mice,
animals from which a gene has been deleted. The idea is to learn
what a gene does by excising it and seeing what defects the mouse
develops. He became interested in the brain-cell component, known
as the NMDA receptor, suspected of being central to the memory
mechanism. The receptor consists of parts made by several genes,
the chief part being specified by a gene called NR1.
</P>
<P>
   Using advanced genetic techniques, he decided to create a mouse
lacking the NR1 gene in the cells of its forebrain. Creating the
mouse took two and a half years and, for a postdoctoral student,
was a substantial risk. If the experiment failed, there would be no
result worth publishing.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he was able to knock out the gene in just the cells
of the hippocampus, a brain module dedicated to learning and much
studied by neuroscientists. ``I think a god looked on me very
kindly,'' he says, referring to the element of luck in creating
such a valuable research tool.
</P>
<P>
   The mice lacking the NR1 gene in their hippocampus did indeed
remember less well, suggesting that the NMDA receptor is important
in laying down memories. But the experiment, published in December
1996, was regarded by other experts as less than fully conclusive,
because the absence of the NR1 gene could have caused general brain
damage not specific to memory.
</P>
<P>
   Tonegawa became very interested in the mouse, as did Kandel,
because Tsien had made it with a technique developed in Kandel's
laboratory. The two lab chiefs were also interested in receiving
due credit, and discussions ensued between them that were stressful
for him, Tsien recalls.
</P>
<P>
   However, he now had sufficient credentials to set up his own
laboratory. ``After working with these two powerful people, I
wanted to be free,'' Tsien says. Two years ago he was appointed an
assistant professor at Princeton and was able to set up his own
lab. He began to think about how he might try to improve a mouse's
memory, rather than sabotage it, because such an experiment would
run far less risk of being criticized as nonspecific.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The focus of his thinking was the anatomy of the NMDA receptor.
The intricate biological device is shaped like a cylinder or
doughnut embedded in the outer wall of certain brain cells. Usually
its central channel is firmly closed. But when the nerve cell
receives signals from two other nerve cells at the same time, the
NMDA channel springs open, allowing a current to flow into cell.
</P>
<P>
   This current generates a long-lasting change within the cell,
making it much more responsive the next time either of the two
other nerve cells is active alone.
</P>
<P>
   This property of the NMDA receptor _ opening when two signals
arrive simultaneously _ has long been suspected to be the basic
mechanism of memory, because it is a way for the brain to make an
association between two events.
</P>
<P>
   The exact degree of simultaneity turns out to be very important.
In young mice, two signals can arrive as much as one-tenth of a
second apart for their coincidence to change the nerve cell. In
older animals, the NMDA receptor allows a much narrower window of
time for an association to register.
</P>
<P>
   Another known fact about the receptor was that its composition
changed with the age of the animal. Its main component is the gene
product of NR1, which Tsien had knocked out in his memory-deficient
mice. But the NR1 component works with any of four different
partners, which modulate its activity in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the partners, known as NR2A and NR2B, are particularly
important in cells of the forebrain. As animals age, there is a
switch from NR2B to NR2A as the preferred partner for NR1.
</P>
<P>
   Abilities in many animals decline after sexual maturity. Song
birds cannot learn new songs. The human mind becomes less flexible
in learning new languages. ``I am always stuck with my Chinese
accent, but if I had come to the United States 12 years earlier I
would have learned perfect American,'' Tsien says by way of
personal example.
</P>
<P>
   As he contemplated these various pieces of information, Tsien
said, it seemed clear that they were related. The natural switch
with age of NR1's partner must underlie the increasingly stringent
requirement for two signals to arrive simultaneously, and the
narrowed window of time must be the reason why older people find it
harder to make associations.
</P>
<P>
   But no one had specifically stated the idea in those terms, as
far as Tsien knew. And certainly no one had done the obvious
experiment, which was to engineer mice in which the NR2B gene was
artificially put into hyperdrive to see if their memory improved.
</P>
<P>
   So Tsien took a copy of the mouse NR2B gene and linked it to a
special piece of DNA, called a promoter, that is active only in
cells of the mouse forebrain. He injected this genetic fragment
into fertilized mouse eggs, where it added itself to the mouse's
normal complement of genes. Because of the promoter, the NR2B gene
was active in cells of the forebrain, adding its product to that
produced by the mouse's own NR2B gene.
</P>
<P>
   With all the extra NR2B being produced in the mice's brain
cells, the NMDA receptors underwent a subtle but significant
change. Instead of staying open for 100-thousandths of a second, as
they do in normal mice, the receptor's interval increased to
250-thousandths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   That minute biophysical change, Tsien says, is what underlies
the mice's superior learning skills. The essence of smartness is an
extra 150-thousandths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   Credit for a discovery is often disputed, particularly when the
finding is important. Tonegawa told Kevin Coughlin, a reporter for
the Star-Ledger of New Jersey, that Tsien may have started
developing the smarter mice while at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and accused him of being uncollegial. If the mice were
developed in Tonegawa's lab, MIT would have rights to them and
Tonegawa could exercise a lab chief's claim to a share of the
academic credit.
</P>
<P>
   Tsien said he was ``totally surprised'' by Tonegawa's remarks.
His smarter mice experiment was conceived and executed entirely at
Princeton, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tonegawa, who was traveling in Japan last week, did not respond
to a request made through his secretary for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Litster, MIT's vice president for research and the
official in charge of disputes over scientific conduct, said that
MIT ``is not endorsing Tonegawa's claims, certainly not until we
know what they are. If it's a dispute between Tonegawa and a former
postdoc over credit, I don't really think we ought to get involved
in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Tsien is waiting to see how the implications of his
smarter mice are received by his peers in the neuroscience
community and by the public. ``To the scientific community this is
a small step for a man,'' he says. ``The fundamental question is:
`Is this a giant step for mankind?'''
</P>
<P>
   What does he think? ``I don't know,'' Tsien replies.

   Before Lisa Tiger got the awful news late in the afternoon of
July 5, 1992, neither she nor any of her friends or relatives had
heard of a Creek-Seminole Indian's getting a diagnosis of HIV.
Though the AIDS epidemic was already a decade old, the disease was
hardly ever discussed among American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tiger, then 27, set about to change that. That year, she
told her own story about contracting the AIDS virus to 300 tribal
leaders attending the annual National Congress of American Indians,
who listened in stunned silence, then embraced her, and flooded her
with invitations to speak at their reservations. ``I was booked
solid for the next three years all over the country,'' Ms. Tiger
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, however, and despite her frenzied efforts,
the interest in AIDS among the nation's 1.9 million Indians has
withered. Ms. Tiger, who lives in Muskogee, Okla., had only one
speaking engagement booked last month, then nothing for the rest of
the year. ``This doesn't seem to be a concern to anybody anymore,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some health experts say they fear that AIDS is about to
explode among the 500 tribes in the United Sates. Last year on the
Navajo reservation, for instance, AIDS cases grew by 25 percent to
the current 101 cases, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know HIV is being transmitted on the reservations, but the
tribal leaders are just not paying attention,'' said Ron Rowell,
executive director of the National Native American AIDS Prevention
Center in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a decade behind the rest of the country,'' he added.
``Everything in Indian country has been late in the game in this
epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that the number of acknowledged cases
remains relatively small. As of December, according to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, AIDS had been diagnosed among
1,939 American Indians and Alaskan Natives since the beginning of
the epidemic in 1981. Among all Americans, cases totaled 688,200.
</P>
<P>
   The figures suggest that American Indians are at lower risk for
infection with HIV than other populations. But Rowell, a Choctaw
Indian from Oklahoma who is openly gay, said he believed the
official numbers were low, artificially held down by spotty
surveillance data and by the stigma still attached to homosexuality
among many Indians.
</P>
<P>
   One major impediment is that Indians, more than half of whom now
live away from reservations, are often misclassified in health
reports. Dr. Doug Thoroughman, an epidemiologist with the CDC
assigned to the Indian Health Service, recently re-examined 1995
figures for sexually transmitted diseases reported to officials in
a state with a large Indian population. The name of the state has
not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found a huge number of people who were listed as white or
black or Asian were in fact Native American,'' he said. His
findings, which have yet to be published, showed that the real
number of gonorrhea cases was 82 percent higher than reported. For
syphilis the figure was 36 percent, and for chlamydia 45 percent.
Although he did not measure for AIDS, he said he would expect to
find a similar pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, the burden of disease is a lot higher than
is being reported,'' Thoroughman said.
</P>
<P>
   Another new study suggests that tribal health officials are
simply not reporting cases of AIDS. A survey by the Intertribal
Council of Arizona and others last fall found that 58 of 92 tribal
health departments surveyed were not reporting their HIV or AIDS
statistics to any state or federal health authority.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the incidence among Indians still seems minuscule.
The National AIDS coordinator for the Indian Health Service, Daniel
Simpson, said only 97 new HIV infections were reported to the CDC
last year from clinics affiliated with the Indian Health Service,
many of which are operated by tribal health departments.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, where some 30,000 Indians live, only 40 AIDS
cases among Indians have been reported to date. But the state
health department randomly tested more than 250 people at the most
recent Five-Borough Powwow in Queens last fall and found the rate
of infection was at least 3 percent, three times what was
previously believed, according to Diana Gubiseh-Ayala, the
coordinator of AIDS services for the American Indian Community
House, which collaborated in the anonymous study.
</P>
<P>
   Without accurate information spurring them to action, most
tribes have tended to ignore the dangers, dedicating little concern
to the epidemic and fewer resources to HIV prevention than any
other population in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're stuck in this vicious circle of bad surveillance feeding
into the notion that this is not a problem,'' Rowell said. ``It
keeps us from getting the resources into the community, and keeps
the epidemic spreading.''
</P>
<P>
   One notable exception is the Navajo nation, based primarily in
Arizona. There, an official tribal office promotes prevention
efforts and the nonprofit Navajo AIDS Network provides client
services to 53 people with HIV, most of them secretly gay men with
wives and children, said Melvin Harrison, the network's director.
</P>
<P>
   Several are Hopis who have left their own more restrictive
communities for treatment, he said. Dr. Lisa Sumner, clinical
director of the Keams Canyon Indian Health Service Hospital serving
the Hopi reservation, said no Hopi had ever tested positive or been
treated while on Hopi land.
</P>
<P>
   But even among the Navajo, the oppression of homosexuals is so
overt that Harrison believes there are many more people with HIV
living on the reservation in shamed silence. Of a total population
of 230,000 Navajos, 130,000 live on the reservation covering more
than 26,000 square miles, giving life there all the anonymity of an
intimate small town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real homophobic here on the reservation,'' Harrison said.
``I'm the only person who knows about these individuals, and I
carry that with me. The other day a friend came up to me and said:
`Melvin, I want to ask you a question. Did my brother die of AIDS?'
And I can't say anything even after they're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   These are just the conditions that allow the epidemic to take
hold. Last year, Harrison said, there were 25 additional known
cases among Navajos, including three young women who almost
certainly contracted HIV on the reservation from their steady
sexual partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that really got the attention of the Navajo people,''
Harrison said. ``People are beginning to listen.''

 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VICUS, Peru _ Wilmer Ochoa Navarro, 13, raised his hand, walked
to the front of the classroom and announced before 25 other
children, ``I'm sad because the terrorists murdered my mother and
my father.''
</P>
<P>
   There was not a stir in the room, not even a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   Then Teodosio Chavez, 11, came forward, and said, ``I'm sad
because they burned down our house.'' Nelson Vilcapoma, also 11,
took his turn and said, ``I'm sad because they killed my mother and
my dog.''
</P>
<P>
   And on and on it went in numbing repetition, one
Quechua-speaking Indian child after another pouring out grief over
a series of attacks by Shining Path guerrillas that would overwhelm
any adult, no less a child.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmer, Teodosio and Nelson are three of an estimated 500,000
Peruvian children who have suffered in the last 20 years of
guerrilla warfare and sometimes brutal army counterinsurgency.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 50,000 Peruvian children have been orphaned in
fighting that raged with particular intensity between 1987 and 1993
but still goes on sporadically here in Ayacucho Province. One
hundred thousand youths have been displaced, 5,000 have been
forcibly recruited for combat by the Maoist-inspired rebels and
countless more have lost brothers, sisters and friends in the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian psychologists speak of a coming harvest of resentment,
drug abuse and alcoholism from children who have been traumatized
by the fighting. And in a country with precious few resources, few
youths receive counseling or any help at all.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the Andean mountain village of Vicus, and in 17
other rural communities and Lima shantytowns, a small
three-year-old pilot project appears to be making headway in
relieving the pain of at least a few children.
</P>
<P>
   With money from the Peruvian government and two Dutch
foundations, a private Peruvian group called the Center for Popular
Promotion and Development has organized what amounts to group
therapy for 1,500 children from age 4 to early adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Young social workers encourage children to express their fears
and joys in a friendly classroom setting. They play mock war games
that include guerrilla attacks on villages and successful village
militia and army counterattacks. The counselors sing songs about
war and peace, and they take the children through spontaneous,
dramatic role-playing to break down psychological barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Grimaldo Rios, 35, a psychologist and the director of the
Peruvian group running the program, said the central idea was
promoting resiliency in children by encouraging positive thinking,
self-esteem and a balance of autonomy and mutual support. Much of
the program's theory was developed by Edith Grotberg, an American
psychologist affiliated with the University of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to discuss pain than let it paralyze,'' Rios said.
``We want the children to express their trauma and adopt a more
hopeful and positive attitude so they can build successful lives in
the future.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A morning of treatment here begins with a cat-and-mouse game on
a dusty, windblown soccer field in the middle of the village. All
of the children hold hands and make a circle, except for a little
child who plays a mouse and a much bigger, older child who plays a
cat.
</P>
<P>
   The children pulled together to defend the mouse from the cat,
who tried to break into the circle. A 22-year-old social worker
named Carolina Cardenas told them, ``When there is danger we must
all work together to protect each other.''
</P>
<P>
   From cats and mice, the children moved on to harsh reality as
Miss Cardenas said, ``Now let's see how we protect the community
when it comes under attack.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of children dressed as guerrillas in ponchos and
mountain hats and wielding hand-carved wooden toy rifles run down a
hill and attack the rest of the children. To the rescue comes a
second band of children, dressed in military green to look like the
village's self-defense militia. The militia children fire back and
save the village.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise was a rough replay of 15 Shining Path attacks on
this farming community from 1985 to 1993 in retribution for its
organizing a self-defense militia to resist the rebels. A total of
18 villagers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons and purposes of what at first appear to be
unnecessarily violent games for young war victims are many. The
children learn that despite their losses, they are able to resist,
survive and live another day. They also learn that the people who
victimized them and their families were the losers in the end. And
perhaps most important, the weekly replays of their battles and
shared pain serve to vent anxieties that might otherwise fester.
</P>
<P>
   When one of the children started crying uncontrollably during
the play attack, Rios said, ``We have to work with him and give him
individual attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Miss Cardenas took the children to a one-room adobe
house to discuss the war game. The children wrote down and talked
about what makes them sad, and what made them happy, in what the
program calls juvenile parliament. The idea is to share hardship
but at the same time emphasize the positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy because even though I am an orphan, the militiamen
bring me clothes,'' said Rolando Escobar, 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy because there are no more terrorist attacks,'' said
Gelacio Huamani, 12.
</P>
<P>
   Then the children voted to come to a communal decision on what
makes them the saddest and what makes them the happiest. By large
margins the orphans voted that what made them sad was losing their
parents, while those who still had parents voted that having a
mother and father was what made them happy.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the children lucky enough to still have parents vote,
Wilmer, the 13-year-old orphan, rubbed his neck nervously as tears
welled up in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a sad boy,'' he said later, while telling how he and his
four brothers watched Shining Path rebels hack their parents to
death during a raid in 1993. ``But playing makes me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents said the program was helping their children be more
attentive in school and more talkative at home and among friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've observed a change in the children,'' said Jorge Chavez
Oriendo, 59, president of the village communal council. ``They are
learning faster and behaving better. It's a relief to everybody in
Vicus.''

STRAINS WITH NORTH KOREA EASE, BUT CLOUDS HOVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In recent weeks, North Korea has watched attentively as
pulses in the region quickened over its threat to test fire a
long-range missile.
</P>
<P>
   Just as suddenly, the government in Pyongyang has made
conciliatory noises, lowering the temperature and leading many in
Washington, Tokyo and Seoul to feel that their fears of imminent
trouble had perhaps been misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   So when talks between the United States and North Korea get
under way in Berlin on Tuesday, the first thing American diplomats
will want to determine is which North Korea shows up. Will it be
the one that threatens to ``mete out merciless retaliation'' upon
its enemies? Or will it be the nation of starving millions that has
grudgingly accepted the extended hand of international aid?
</P>
<P>
   The United States says the Berlin talks are intended to
emphasize the advantages to North Korea of toning down its
threatening behavior, and in particular of shelving its plan to
test its newest long-range rocket, the Taepodong 2. The rocket may
have a range up to 6,000 miles, enabling it to hit Hawaii and parts
of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The United States treated the missile test as a foregone
conclusion as recently as a month ago. But the unrelenting
international pressure, together with inducements offered to North
Korea, have led Washington to sound a far more optimistic tone.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, State Department spokesman James Foley
said, ``Some of the public statements by the North Koreans have
given us hope that North Korea is taking seriously the path to
better relations with the U.S. and the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that given North Korea's extreme isolation, it is
difficult to know what drives its leaders toward more conciliatory
postures. And history indicates that such postures never last long.
</P>
<P>
   In the specific case of North Korea's seeming turnaround on the
missile testing, the ledger of inducements for cooperation and
penalties for provocation are both piled high.
</P>
<P>
   American officials will not discuss their offers to the North,
but it is widely thought that the United States is ready to
increase food and perhaps other agricultural aid and to raise the
level of American representation at talks with the North. There has
also been talk of easing the American trade embargo on North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, meanwhile, has indicated it would speed up the much
delayed construction of a nuclear power plant in the North, part of
an agreement from previous talks with North Korea that were aimed
at preventing the country from developing nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, too, has made noises about improving relations,
presumably through increased aid, if North Korea does not test fire
a new missile.
</P>
<P>
   None of these factors loom as large, however, as the penalties
that North Korea would be likely to suffer by testing its new
missile.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has discussed ending financial backing for the nuclear
power plant, and political pressure has risen sharply in Japan to
suspend lucrative remittances by Koreans living in Japan. Estimates
of the value of these remittances range from $250 million to $600
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, could be forced to
suspend tourist visits from his country; such tourism could earn
North Korea $942 million by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The most imponderable source of pressure, but possibly the most
important, may come from North Korea's last ideologically
sympathetic patron: China. Keeping North Korea afloat with fuel and
grain shipments and other aid is already expensive for China.
Watching North Korea launch missiles that would spur Japan to
increase its military spending and to work with Washington on a
``theater missile defense'' might be more than China is willing to
bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand the Japanese have really decided to do
something about the remittances if there is a launch, and the North
Korean leadership is able to live quite well because of these
remittances,'' said James Kelley, president of the Pacific Forum of
the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ``On the other
hand, the Chinese must know that there is no chance of putting off
the theater missile defense if the North Koreans launch.''
</P>
<P>
   Other regional analysts, however, dismiss the notion that
foreign pressure has had much effect and describe the missile
threat and apparent pullback as part of a deliberate North Korean
game of provocation and brief detente.
</P>
<P>
   These analysts say that whatever concessions North Korea wins at
this week's talks in Berlin will surely be followed by disturbing
new incidents to press a new round of demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``If North Korea decides not to launch the missile, it is
because it has decided it has additional leverage to gain from not
launching,'' said Chuck Downs, author of a recent book called
``Over the Line: North Korea's Negotiating Strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we cannot be at all assured that there will not be some
kind of additional new tension-building incidents. The goal for
them is to keep a three-ring circus going.''

<P>
   When that Grand Old Man of Victorian England, William Ewart
Gladstone, was in his 85th year, he was steering the second
home-rule bill for Ireland through a recalcitrant parliament and
going home to translate the odes of Horace at night.
</P>
<P>
   When Ronald Reagan reached the tender age of 73, he was fighting
his second presidential election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the world's most successful central banker, is
also 73.
</P>
<P>
   Politics and economics are plainly jobs that the old can do
well. They are not alone. The boardrooms of the world's big
companies are full of non-executive sages, telling whippersnapper
40-somethings how to run their firms.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, are so few of the rich world's older folk in
employment? They live longer and enjoy better health than their
parents did.
</P>
<P>
   Most jobs have become less physically demanding; most people in
late middle age are well educated; most evidence suggests that
training older workers, if done sensibly, is no harder than
training the young. But the figures show an astonishing and
long-drawn-out retreat from the job market.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1960, men could expect to spend 50 of their 68
years of life in paid work. Today, they are likely to work for only
38 of their 76 years.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than two-thirds of men in their late 50s and early 60s are
in the rich world's labor force. Indeed, by the time they celebrate
their 55th birthday, more than half of Europe's men have gone home
to translate Horace.
</P>
<P>
   For most, that is something to celebrate. Never before have so
many people been able to look forward to so many years of healthy
leisure. Two-thirds of people say that they like being retired and
have no desire to go back to work. There are grandchildren to
enjoy, foreign countries to visit, books to read and golf games to
play.
</P>
<P>
   The pleasures of old age are less expensive, and more widely
available, than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is whether all of this retirement is voluntary.
It is worth asking for its own sake; in a liberal society, the old,
too, should be free to choose.
</P>
<P>
   But, in addition, the stampede to retire has consequences not
merely for the old themselves. And it is often being encouraged by
perverse public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread and early retirement will increasingly affect the
lives of everyone else, for two reasons. The first is a familiar
one: as the share of old folk in the population rises, so will the
burden on the young of paying for their pensions and health care.
</P>
<P>
   The second is less discussed: the rise of the grey-headed
leisured class has consequences for economic growth, because of its
impact on the supply of labor and of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Many governments, their eyes focused on the impact that future
pensions claims will have on public finances, have embarked on
reforms _ but not always reforms that give pensioners a freer
choice. For their eyes are also trained, in the shorter term, on
high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Governments, especially in Western Europe, are pressing more
people to retire early, on the mistaken view that this will provide
jobs for the young, even as they try to trim pensioners'
entitlements in order to reduce the burden on public finances.
</P>
<P>
   This is unforgivable from a liberal point of view. It is also
foolish from the perspective of public policy.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer size of the baby-boom generation that starts to reach
retirement age over the coming decade means that there will be a
simple, but huge imbalance: too few people in work, paying taxes
and pension contributions; too many in retirement, drawing on
pensions and running up health costs.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the main alternatives will be to renege on the
pensions that workers thought they had been promised, or to raise
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It would be far better for the health of economies if more older
people went on working instead.
</P>
<P>
   Quite small rises in the ages at which people retire have large
effects: as long as older folk stay in the job market, they pay
taxes (helping one side of the fiscal balance) and draw either no
pension, or a smaller one (helping the other).
</P>
<P>
   Governments should recognize that people (like politicians)
would prefer to decide for themselves when to retire. At present,
the choice is, perversely, biased in favor of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in many countries, the opportunity cost of working
beyond the minimum retirement age is high: workers must often leave
the job market in order to receive a state pension, and even where
this is not the case, they rarely earn any extra pension for their
additional taxes and contributions.
</P>
<P>
   If they claim disability benefit, as many in their late 50s and
early 60s do, their pension rights are rarely affected.
</P>
<P>
   Such perverse incentives should be replaced with neutrality.
Employers, often urged on by trade unions, also put obstacles of
their own in the way of older workers.
</P>
<P>
   Pension schemes based on defined benefits make it
disproportionately expensive to offer jobs to older people. Pay
schemes that reward long service more than merit and productivity
make it disproportionately costly to keep older workers on the
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   And sheer discrimination, formally banned in the United States
but flourishing in most countries, persuades many older folk to go
home rather than risk probable rebuff.
</P>
<P>
   Would such changes coax 60-year-olds off the golf course? In
America, where jobs for older workers are plentiful and the
government is scrapping the tax disincentives for older folk to
work, early retirement has begun to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Give people a choice, and they might surprise you. &QL;

   When that Grand Old Man of Victorian England, William Ewart
Gladstone, was in his 85th year, he was steering the second
home-rule bill for Ireland through a recalcitrant parliament and
going home to translate the odes of Horace at night.
</P>
<P>
   When Ronald Reagan reached the tender age of 73, he was fighting
his second presidential election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the world's most successful central banker, is
also 73.
</P>
<P>
   Politics and economics are plainly jobs that the old can do
well. They are not alone. The boardrooms of the world's big
companies are full of non-executive sages, telling whippersnapper
40-somethings how to run their firms.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, are so few of the rich world's older folk in
employment? They live longer and enjoy better health than their
parents did.
</P>
<P>
   Most jobs have become less physically demanding; most people in
late middle age are well educated; most evidence suggests that
training older workers, if done sensibly, is no harder than
training the young. But the figures show an astonishing and
long-drawn-out retreat from the job market.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1960, men could expect to spend 50 of their 68
years of life in paid work. Today, they are likely to work for only
38 of their 76 years.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than two-thirds of men in their late 50s and early 60s are
in the rich world's labor force. Indeed, by the time they celebrate
their 55th birthday, more than half of Europe's men have gone home
to translate Horace.
</P>
<P>
   For most, that is something to celebrate. Never before have so
many people been able to look forward to so many years of healthy
leisure. Two-thirds of people say that they like being retired and
have no desire to go back to work. There are grandchildren to
enjoy, foreign countries to visit, books to read and golf games to
play.
</P>
<P>
   The pleasures of old age are less expensive, and more widely
available, than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is whether all of this retirement is voluntary.
It is worth asking for its own sake; in a liberal society, the old,
too, should be free to choose.
</P>
<P>
   But, in addition, the stampede to retire has consequences not
merely for the old themselves. And it is often being encouraged by
perverse public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread and early retirement will increasingly affect the
lives of everyone else, for two reasons. The first is a familiar
one: as the share of old folk in the population rises, so will the
burden on the young of paying for their pensions and health care.
</P>
<P>
   The second is less discussed: the rise of the grey-headed
leisured class has consequences for economic growth, because of its
impact on the supply of labor and of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Many governments, their eyes focused on the impact that future
pensions claims will have on public finances, have embarked on
reforms _ but not always reforms that give pensioners a freer
choice. For their eyes are also trained, in the shorter term, on
high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Governments, especially in Western Europe, are pressing more
people to retire early, on the mistaken view that this will provide
jobs for the young, even as they try to trim pensioners'
entitlements in order to reduce the burden on public finances.
</P>
<P>
   This is unforgivable from a liberal point of view. It is also
foolish from the perspective of public policy.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer size of the baby-boom generation that starts to reach
retirement age over the coming decade means that there will be a
simple, but huge imbalance: too few people in work, paying taxes
and pension contributions; too many in retirement, drawing on
pensions and running up health costs.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the main alternatives will be to renege on the
pensions that workers thought they had been promised, or to raise
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It would be far better for the health of economies if more older
people went on working instead.
</P>
<P>
   Quite small rises in the ages at which people retire have large
effects: as long as older folk stay in the job market, they pay
taxes (helping one side of the fiscal balance) and draw either no
pension, or a smaller one (helping the other).
</P>
<P>
   Governments should recognize that people (like politicians)
would prefer to decide for themselves when to retire. At present,
the choice is, perversely, biased in favor of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in many countries, the opportunity cost of working
beyond the minimum retirement age is high: workers must often leave
the job market in order to receive a state pension, and even where
this is not the case, they rarely earn any extra pension for their
additional taxes and contributions.
</P>
<P>
   If they claim disability benefit, as many in their late 50s and
early 60s do, their pension rights are rarely affected.
</P>
<P>
   Such perverse incentives should be replaced with neutrality.
Employers, often urged on by trade unions, also put obstacles of
their own in the way of older workers.
</P>
<P>
   Pension schemes based on defined benefits make it
disproportionately expensive to offer jobs to older people. Pay
schemes that reward long service more than merit and productivity
make it disproportionately costly to keep older workers on the
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   And sheer discrimination, formally banned in the United States
but flourishing in most countries, persuades many older folk to go
home rather than risk probable rebuff.
</P>
<P>
   Would such changes coax 60-year-olds off the golf course? In
America, where jobs for older workers are plentiful and the
government is scrapping the tax disincentives for older folk to
work, early retirement has begun to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Give people a choice, and they might surprise you. &QL;

RESEARCHERS DISCOVER A HELPFUL SIDE OF PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By JOHN O'NEIL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What good is pain? Researchers at the University of California
at San Francisco think that in the case of an inflamed joint, that
ache may be the body's way of telling its most aggressive
defenders, ``Enough, already _ you're hurting me!''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Holly Strausbaugh, a fellow at the NIH Pain Center at the
university, said that research by her team, published last week in
the journal Nature Medicine, demonstrated one way in which pain
plays an important role in regulating the body's inflammatory
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   In that cycle, the body responds to injury or intruders by
releasing an array of substances that fight infectious agents and
speed healing by increasing blood flow. Swelling, mild fever and
soreness are all signs that an inflammatory response has been set
off.
</P>
<P>
   If unchecked, these defenses can cause serious harm to healthy
tissue; that is what happens in chronic inflammatory diseases like
arthritis. But how the defenders know when to ease up has remained
a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, researchers at the university found that the activation
of pain nerves seemed to serve as a signal to reduce swelling, and
Dr. Strausbaugh's team hoped to find out more about the biochemical
mechanisms involved.
</P>
<P>
   They looked specifically at the link between pain and
neutrophils, ``little short-lived cells that pack a real wallop,''
in Dr. Strausbaugh's words, and that are the body's first line of
defense. Rats given an electrical impulse designed to simulate the
firing of pain cells were found to have lower levels of neutrophils
in inflamed joints.
</P>
<P>
   A second phase of the experiment found that the pain signals
dampened the inflammatory response by inhibiting neutrophils'
ability to release L-selectin, a substance that allows them to
leave the bloodstream and enter an infected area.
</P>
<P>
   Examination of the neutrophils showed that they had lost a
molecule that enables them to ride blood vessels through the body.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Strausbaugh says the new research underscores what a fine
balance is needed in turning on and off the body's defenses.
``Inflammation is a good thing when everything goes according to
plan,'' she said. Part of the plan seems to be that pain cells,
generally activated at the moment of trauma, subside during the
initial stages of immune response before reasserting themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem like it takes a while for pain to develop,'' Dr.
Strausbaugh said. ``It's almost like the inflammation has to build
up to a certain degree before fibers activate and say that's
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of questions about timing may prove useful in
improving pain management, she said. In a separate University of
California at San Francisco study published in The Lancet in July,
researchers found that knee patients given higher levels of pain
relief after surgery had lower levels of infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thinking would be that people with less pain would be
getting more neutrophils into the site,'' Dr. Strausbaugh said.
Without the normal initial pain, the body's most aggressive
defenders responded full force, with a positive result in the short
term; but damage to healthy tissue seems likely to rise if the
mechanisms to moderate such all-out assaults are held in check too
long.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Strausbaugh conceded that people will always think of pain
``in a very negative way.'' But she speculated that understanding
its purpose could make it easier to bear. And just as other recent
work has shown that people with mild fevers might be better off not
taking analgesics to suppress it, she said, it may be that in a few
years doctors may be telling patients that a little pain can be
good for them.

<P>
   These are bleak times for South Americans. Brazil is recovering
from its chaotic January devaluation, but living standards have
fallen. Most of Spanish-speaking South America is in deep
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador has announced the first-ever default on Brady bonds, the
instrument created to forgive (mainly) Latin American countries
some of their debts to commercial banks from the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Markets have become increasingly nervous about Argentina's
ability to maintain the fixed exchange rate that has underpinned a
decade of growth.
</P>
<P>
   There are worries about political stability too. In Colombia,
peace talks with the largest guerrilla group seem to have foundered
before they have properly started.
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez is acting like an elected
dictator: in August a constituent assembly dominated by his people
dissolved Congress and intervened in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everywhere, governments are deeply unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is now more than a decade since much of Latin America
embraced democracy and liberal economic reform, such a panorama is
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, some Latin American politicians _ such as Chavez,
Roberto Madrazo, a populist challenger for the presidential
candidacy of Mexico's ruling party, and the leaders of Brazil's
Workers Party _ go on to claim that what they call ``savage
neo-liberalism'' has failed.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets, too, have been severe. For example, Brazil's
sovereign bonds are trading at a punishing 11 percentage points
over those of the United States Treasury, while a rally earlier
this year in the region's stock markets petered out when the United
States raised its interest rates in May.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is far more nuanced. Note first the strength of
Mexico's economy: thanks to NAFTA, it now follows that of the
United States, rather than those to the south, as investors have
started to recognize. The same goes, to a lesser extent, for
Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, the severity and length of South America's recession
owes much to external shocks and cyclical factors. These include
investors' 1997-98 flight from all emerging markets, low prices for
commodities, and last year's devastating El Nino weather.
</P>
<P>
   As such factors recede, growth will resume. And a return to
authoritarian rule is unthinkable in much of southern South
America.
</P>
<P>
   Yet neither can the current setbacks be quite so easily
dismissed. Even in the better-placed countries, economic recovery
may not be swift.
</P>
<P>
   South America remains uncomfortably dependent on commodity
exports and on foreign capital. It needs further reform, especially
of financial systems (to reduce the cost of credit), and to foster
entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   A particular question mark hangs over Argentina. Advisers to
Fernando de la Rua, the front-runner for next month's presidential
election, say their man would quickly push through radical fiscal
and other reforms, to boost competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   But they must act quickly, if Argentina is to grow again _ the
main test for its exchange-rate policy.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern Andes, the worries go even deeper. Colombia's
normally robust economy is in its worst recession since the 1930s,
brought low by fiscal and banking problems but also by worsening
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas' increased strength (which owes more to drug
money than political support) has undermined confidence. This week,
a general strike added to the government's problems. Colombia's
best hope is to try to contain the guerrillas militarily, and to
try again to coax them into talks.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador is a mess: banks have collapsed, GDP may shrink by
perhaps 7 percent, and Jamil Mahuad, the fourth president in as
many years, will struggle to get congressional approval for the
fiscal and banking measures needed to secure IMF aid.
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela, Chavez has swept away a corrupt and self-serving
political elite, but risks making matters worse. He shows few signs
of fostering independent democratic institutions, or of addressing
Venezuela's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a doubling of the oil price, the economy may contract by
6 percent this year, largely because of business mistrust of his
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ecuador and Venezuela, both accustomed to the easy money of
oil, have been notoriously resistant to free markets and fiscal
discipline. And until Chavez has more economic success, he is
hardly likely to inspire imitators.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries are testament to lack of reform, rather than to
its failure. But they are also reminders of just how hard a task
would-be reformers can face ) _ and of how far much of the rest of
South America has come, despite its current ills. &QL;

<P>
   In education, only one thing counts: the chance of a good school
for every child. This is the thinking behind America's voucher
schemes, which use public money, voted by state legislatures, to
provide education credits for poor families.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with these, parents can send their children to whatever
schools they choose, public or private.
</P>
<P>
   More power to them, you might think. But vouchers are so
controversial that their spread around the country has been
glacial.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, vouchers simply allow parental choice to operate,
forcing the worst public schools to improve themselves if they want
to keep pupils (and the education money that follows them).
</P>
<P>
   But some inevitably sink; and this has created opposition to
vouchers not only among teachers' unions, but the public at large.
Polls show Americans equally divided for and against them and, as a
result, every scheme ends up in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest decision, on Aug. 24, a federal judge in Ohio
struck down the voucher scheme in Cleveland, giving parents one
term's grace before suspending it. The judge did not argue that the
scheme had hurt the public schools, but that it constituted an
``advancement of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland the vast majority of the 4,000 children in the
voucher plan have left public schools for Catholic ones. This means
that taxpayers' money, previously allocated to the public schools,
has been transferred to parochial ones, often run by nuns and with
crucifixes prominent in the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Such a transfer appears to contradict the First Amendment to the
Constitution, which requires that the government stay neutral and
distant from all religious matters.
</P>
<P>
   It means that state money, hedged about with state conditions,
ends up in schools whose first purpose is to teach the tenets of a
particular faith.
</P>
<P>
   Why this has happened is no mystery. Parochial schools, although
often in the distressed centers of cities, have better discipline
and get better results.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in a long line of cases the Supreme Court has
insisted not only that government should not help in advancing
religion, but that it should avoid ``excessive entanglement'' in
it. This has been applied even in the most minor cases, such as
lending secular textbooks or reimbursement for state tests.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever state money comes close to religious schools,
government regulation is called in to check that religion is not
thereby promoted. Hence ``entanglement.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet America's government is hardly consistent in its behavior.
Even while excluding most support for religious schools, the Court
has raised no objections to individuals getting tax breaks for
donating money to their churches or synagogues (which in turn
support schools).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Court has extended tax exemptions to churches as
charities, and decided that it must not discriminate between
religious charities and the rest; but the effect is the same, that
state money is funnelled towards religious institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Should not the Court, by the same token, rule swiftly in favor
of voucher schemes like Cleveland's? So far it has been silent,
which is increasingly unhelpful.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the Court should either ban both religious tax breaks
and the use of vouchers for religious schools, or neither.
</P>
<P>
   If it is to be truly zealous about separating church and state
in its traditional sense of outlawing the indirect flow of public
money to sectarian schools (as opposed, say, to preventing the
establishment of a state religion) then the logic of its position
is that it should also outlaw tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   But this is unlikely in the near term. So advocates of vouchers
_ which include this newspaper _ had better settle for second best:
a swift ruling, in line with its previous position, that vouchers
cannot be used in religious schools. And then vouchers will be free
to help improve the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is worse: that, embroiled in religious
controversy, voucher schemes could become so contentious that they
might disappear.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a great pity, since vouchers provide many of the
poorest children with their only means of escape from awful
schools.
</P>
<P>
   And by restricting vouchers to secular schools, the Court would
at least encourage the creation of a thriving market in secular
education, public and private, which could attract more of the
corporations and philanthropists who are already interested in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Every American _ in time _ would then acquire the opportunity to
choose good secular schools over bad. Religious schools would feel
the pressure of more competition. But that might just make them try
even harder. &QL;

   WINSTON-SALEM _ On the roads of North Carolina it is not unusual
to see cars sporting bumper stickers that pointedly proclaim
``Tobacco pays my bills'' or ``I smoke and I vote.''
</P>
<P>
   This state leads the nation in tobacco production, and three of
the country's five biggest cigarette manufacturers are based here.
The state's leaders have never shown much enthusiasm for the
campaign against tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina did sign on to last year's $360 billion
settlement of lawsuits against cigarette makers, but according to
the attorney-general's office it did so primarily ``to bring
much-needed stability to the tobacco industry and the tobacco
farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   As one state legislator put it, ``In North Carolina, tobacco is
as sacred as a cow in India.''
</P>
<P>
   Many North Carolinians think of the cigarette companies as good
corporate citizens. The tobacco industry is still widely seen as a
positive force in places like Winston-Salem, which has lent its
name to two leading cigarette brands.
</P>
<P>
   The state's fourth-largest city owes its place as a commercial
and industrial center to the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which
was established there in 1875.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that the impact of the tobacco industry on
Winston-Salem has been huge would be an understatement,'' says a
former mayor, Martha Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the tobacco industry's influence on Winston-Salem's
development is easy to find. Tobacco leaves feature in the city's
seal, and a statue of the young R.J. Reynolds riding into town on
horseback stands outside the city hall.
</P>
<P>
   A high school, an auditorium, a park and the airport are named
after members of the Reynolds family, and R.J. Reynolds's summer
home is now an art museum.
</P>
<P>
   Profits from cigarette sales helped to establish three
charitable foundations, and tobacco money went into bringing Wake
Forest University to the city in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette company continues to have a major impact on
Winston-Salem's civic life. RJR provides high-paying jobs to more
than 7,000 people in the area, and the company has given $16.9
million to community groups over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   As a grateful executive at a Winston-Salem charity told a local
newspaper, ``We would not enjoy the fine quality of life that we do
without the presence of RJR.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in cities that owe their existence to the tobacco industry,
however, times are changing.
</P>
<P>
   With domestic cigarette consumption down by about a third since
1970, and a series of lawsuits aimed at cigarette makers,
communities that have long relied on tobacco now want to diversify
their economies.
</P>
<P>
   In Winston-Salem, cigarette manufacturing is no longer the
primary engine of growth. RJR has lost much of its market share
since the early 1980s, and it closed its downtown factories more
than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company's share of the city's tax levy dropped from 18
percent in 1988 to 6 percent in 1998, and the size of its local
work force has fallen by half.
</P>
<P>
   As tobacco has slipped, medicine and banking have grown in
importance. The university-affiliated hospital has surpassed RJR as
the largest employer in the county.
</P>
<P>
   As the home of two large regional banks, this city of 171,000
people is the 11th-biggest banking center in the country, just
behind Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes are changing, too. In a move that would have been
unthinkable a few years ago, the city's largest shopping mall
banned smoking earlier this year. City leaders who were once
content to depend upon the tobacco industry to provide jobs are now
seeking to attract new businesses to the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a real wake-up call'' when RJR began to scale down its
operations in the late 1980s, says Allen Joines, the official
responsible for economic development: ``We have become much more
aggressive since then.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs that the tobacco era is coming to an end.
At the beginning of last year, RJR stopped offering free public
tours of its Whitaker Park cigarette plant: the number of visitors
had fallen by two-thirds over the previous decade.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you are looking for symbols, the fire that ripped
through a downtown block of disused RJR factories last August
destroyed Factory Number 256, which stood on the site of the
``little red factory'' in which R.J. Reynolds launched his business
more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not much more than an hour down the road from Winston-Salem,
Durham has moved even further away from its roots as a tobacco
town.
</P>
<P>
   The city was once the home of James B. Duke's American Tobacco
Company, which controlled more than 90 percent of the world tobacco
market until regulators broke it up in 1911. Tobacco money financed
the development of a small Methodist college, subsequently renamed
Duke University in honor of its patron.
</P>
<P>
   Durham is still the headquarters of the Liggett Group, the
fifth-largest cigarette maker in the country, but the tobacco
industry now employs less than 1 percent of the city's workers.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech firms based in the nearby Research Triangle Park
account for 42,000 jobs in the Durham area, and Duke University
Medical Center is the county's biggest employer. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 875. OPTIONAL COPY FOLLOWS TO 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In rural areas, too, the economic landscape is changing. Tobacco
growers are looking for ways to diversify their operations as the
federal government scales back its tobacco price-support programs.
</P>
<P>
   Much to the chagrin of those of their neighbors who object to
strong odors, farmers in the state now make more money from poultry
and pig farming than they do from tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many tobacco growers, deep in debt, have failed to find new
sources of income. The challenge of diversification is particularly
acute in the hilly Piedmont region, where farms are smaller than in
the flat eastern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians hope to ease the fears of nervous farmers by
directing much of the $4.6 billion that North Carolina is due to
receive from the tobacco settlement to communities that depend on
tobacco. Everybody hopes the tobacco companies survive long enough
to make all the payments. &QL;

IN MARKING HIS 400TH ANNIVERSARY, SPAIN DIGS FOR THE BONES OF
VELAZQUEZ 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Spain's celebration of the 400th anniversary of
the birth of the painter Diego Velazquez de Silva includes major
exhibitions of his work at the Prado Museum. But officials want
something else for the festivities: his bones.
</P>
<P>
   They have been digging around Madrid for five months searching
for his long-missing remains, enthralling the capital with the big
hunt. Newspapers report on every development. Locals take their
children to observe the ever widening excavations where some think
he is buried among the remains of a razed church, while others
insist that a mummy with a sword discovered in another church could
be that of Velazquez.
</P>
<P>
   The search has fueled interest in the activities to commemorate
the legacy of the master, whose 1656 masterpiece ``Las Meninas''
(``The Maids of Honor''), depicting the court of Philip IV, is
considered not only a national treasure but one of the great easel
paintings in the history of art. It hangs permanently in the Prado,
along with many of the artist's other paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hoopla, the secretary of state for culture, Miguel
Angel Cortes, complained last week that the Year of Velazquez, as
the commemoration is known, is getting too little attention abroad.
The Prado's director, Fernando Checa, quickly retorted that the
museum was doing quite enough with its newly refurbished Velazquez
galleries and two large Velazquez exhibitions to begin in October
and December.
</P>
<P>
   The Madrid regional government started the digging on April 30
at the Plaza de Ramales, one block from the Royal Palace, because
that is where the medieval Church of San Juan stood until it was
wrecked during the last century. Records show that Velazquez was
buried in the church a day after his death in 1660, in a black cape
and hat, with a sword.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three poorly documented digs at the same site since the
mid-19th century apparently also searched for Velazquez's remains
in the church, which was razed around 1809 to make room for a plaza
ordered by Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother and then ruler of
Spain. Regional officials exuded confidence at the outset of the
latest investigation, arguing that modern research techniques might
lead to Velazquez's tomb, marked with an epitaph in Latin, in time
for the 400th anniversary. Velazquez was born on June 6, 1599.
</P>
<P>
   Madrid City Hall initially helped, but stopped after spending
$38,000. Then the Ministry of Education and Culture dropped a
bombshell, announcing in June that it had discovered the mummy at
the 16th-century Church of San Placido.
</P>
<P>
   Ministry officials thought that Velazquez's remains might have
been moved to San Placido when the other church was wrecked, and
suddenly the cultural officials from the national and regional
administrations, both governed by the conservative Popular Party,
seemed to be jostling for prominence in the search.
</P>
<P>
   But Juan Carlos Doadrio, a senior regional official in charge of
the digging at the razed church, said, ``Since the Ministry of
Culture pulled out the mummy, we have to check it. But the mummy is
not Velazquez. I know it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic cardinal of Madrid, Antonio Maria Rouco, gave
permission on Wednesday to exhume the mummy, Doadrio said. It will
be studied at the Complutense University of Madrid, and if some 20
initial tests indicate that it might be Velazquez's remains,
officials may seek DNA samples from Velazquez's descendants, who
are said to be living in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But Doadrio and his boss, Gustavo Villapalos, who is in charge
of education and historical landmarks, are betting that Velazquez's
remains might still be in the ruins of the San Juan church. It was
razed in just three or four days, and no record has been found that
the artist's bones were moved.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said that the previous excavations had focused on
the church's main altar, but no one has ever dug up the middle nave
where Velazquez might have been buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have to open it all up,'' Doadrio said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Plaza de Ramales, where four tile street signs depict
Velazquez's face, with long black hair and a mustache, as he
painted his self-portrait in ``Las Meninas,'' there are three
open-pit archeological dig sites. The smallest measures about 21 by
13 feet, and the three represent all but one corner of the old
church.
</P>
<P>
   The bones of some 50 people have been found, along with many
ceramic pieces. Exposed red brick and stone marks the old church's
foundation. ``We're looking for the remains of the church,'' said
Miguel de Aguila, a dig worker, puffing a cigarette and echoing the
official line about the purpose of the excavation. ``If Velazquez
turns up, he turns up.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics don't buy it. Franco Gonzalez, a Madrid regional
assemblyman from the Communist-led United Left coalition, blasted
the dig as an ill-conceived ``Indiana Jones'' adventure whose real
purpose might be to install an underground parking lot or at least
score political points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trying to sell to public opinion that they were
going to find Velazquez's remains,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   And Francisco Ayala, one of Spain's most respected writers,
wrote in an opinion article on the Velazquez events for the
newspaper El Pais: ``Do we really know where the remains of
Cervantes are buried, if they are still buried? Let the illustrious
dead rest in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are still nearly four months left in the Year of
Velazquez.

   WINSTON-SALEM _ On the roads of North Carolina it is not unusual
to see cars sporting bumper stickers that pointedly proclaim
``Tobacco pays my bills'' or ``I smoke and I vote.''
</P>
<P>
   This state leads the nation in tobacco production, and three of
the country's five biggest cigarette manufacturers are based here.
The state's leaders have never shown much enthusiasm for the
campaign against tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina did sign on to last year's $360 billion
settlement of lawsuits against cigarette makers, but according to
the attorney-general's office it did so primarily ``to bring
much-needed stability to the tobacco industry and the tobacco
farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   As one state legislator put it, ``In North Carolina, tobacco is
as sacred as a cow in India.''
</P>
<P>
   Many North Carolinians think of the cigarette companies as good
corporate citizens. The tobacco industry is still widely seen as a
positive force in places like Winston-Salem, which has lent its
name to two leading cigarette brands.
</P>
<P>
   The state's fourth-largest city owes its place as a commercial
and industrial center to the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which
was established there in 1875.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that the impact of the tobacco industry on
Winston-Salem has been huge would be an understatement,'' says a
former mayor, Martha Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the tobacco industry's influence on Winston-Salem's
development is easy to find. Tobacco leaves feature in the city's
seal, and a statue of the young R.J. Reynolds riding into town on
horseback stands outside the city hall.
</P>
<P>
   A high school, an auditorium, a park and the airport are named
after members of the Reynolds family, and R.J. Reynolds's summer
home is now an art museum.
</P>
<P>
   Profits from cigarette sales helped to establish three
charitable foundations, and tobacco money went into bringing Wake
Forest University to the city in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette company continues to have a major impact on
Winston-Salem's civic life. RJR provides high-paying jobs to more
than 7,000 people in the area, and the company has given $16.9
million to community groups over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   As a grateful executive at a Winston-Salem charity told a local
newspaper, ``We would not enjoy the fine quality of life that we do
without the presence of RJR.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in cities that owe their existence to the tobacco industry,
however, times are changing.
</P>
<P>
   With domestic cigarette consumption down by about a third since
1970, and a series of lawsuits aimed at cigarette makers,
communities that have long relied on tobacco now want to diversify
their economies.
</P>
<P>
   In Winston-Salem, cigarette manufacturing is no longer the
primary engine of growth. RJR has lost much of its market share
since the early 1980s, and it closed its downtown factories more
than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company's share of the city's tax levy dropped from 18
percent in 1988 to 6 percent in 1998, and the size of its local
work force has fallen by half.
</P>
<P>
   As tobacco has slipped, medicine and banking have grown in
importance. The university-affiliated hospital has surpassed RJR as
the largest employer in the county.
</P>
<P>
   As the home of two large regional banks, this city of 171,000
people is the 11th-biggest banking center in the country, just
behind Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes are changing, too. In a move that would have been
unthinkable a few years ago, the city's largest shopping mall
banned smoking earlier this year. City leaders who were once
content to depend upon the tobacco industry to provide jobs are now
seeking to attract new businesses to the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a real wake-up call'' when RJR began to scale down its
operations in the late 1980s, says Allen Joines, the official
responsible for economic development: ``We have become much more
aggressive since then.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs that the tobacco era is coming to an end.
At the beginning of last year, RJR stopped offering free public
tours of its Whitaker Park cigarette plant: the number of visitors
had fallen by two-thirds over the previous decade.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you are looking for symbols, the fire that ripped
through a downtown block of disused RJR factories last August
destroyed Factory Number 256, which stood on the site of the
``little red factory'' in which R.J. Reynolds launched his business
more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not much more than an hour down the road from Winston-Salem,
Durham has moved even further away from its roots as a tobacco
town.
</P>
<P>
   The city was once the home of James B. Duke's American Tobacco
Company, which controlled more than 90 percent of the world tobacco
market until regulators broke it up in 1911. Tobacco money financed
the development of a small Methodist college, subsequently renamed
Duke University in honor of its patron.
</P>
<P>
   Durham is still the headquarters of the Liggett Group, the
fifth-largest cigarette maker in the country, but the tobacco
industry now employs less than 1 percent of the city's workers.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech firms based in the nearby Research Triangle Park
account for 42,000 jobs in the Durham area, and Duke University
Medical Center is the county's biggest employer. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 875. OPTIONAL COPY FOLLOWS TO 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In rural areas, too, the economic landscape is changing. Tobacco
growers are looking for ways to diversify their operations as the
federal government scales back its tobacco price-support programs.
</P>
<P>
   Much to the chagrin of those of their neighbors who object to
strong odors, farmers in the state now make more money from poultry
and pig farming than they do from tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many tobacco growers, deep in debt, have failed to find new
sources of income. The challenge of diversification is particularly
acute in the hilly Piedmont region, where farms are smaller than in
the flat eastern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians hope to ease the fears of nervous farmers by
directing much of the $4.6 billion that North Carolina is due to
receive from the tobacco settlement to communities that depend on
tobacco. Everybody hopes the tobacco companies survive long enough
to make all the payments. &QL;

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most aspiring politicians test the ground by releasing position
papers. Warren Beatty released a film featuring a man in a woolly
hat and baggy trousers instead.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bulworth,'' Beatty played a Democratic senator who is
finally driven mad by Washington's evil ways.
</P>
<P>
   He swaps his suits for ghetto gear, tears up his speech about
``standing at the dawn of a new millennium,'' and starts rapping
about the ``real issues'' instead: the hold of big money on
politics, the lack of universal health care, the export of jobs to
the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   This exercise in truth-telling naturally goes down famously with
the voters, and Senator Jay Billington Bulworth prepares to return
to Washington to clean house. The fictional Bulworth is inevitably
assassinated by big money before he can fulfill the people's
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   But there are growing signs that the real Beatty is preparing to
go to Washington in his place _ and go, moreover, as president
rather than a mere senator.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty has not yet announced his candidacy _ indeed, he has not
yet decided whether to run as a Democrat or a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   He is also being advised not to run by influential Democrats
(who think that he will split the left of the party) and by some
close friends (who warn the self-confessed perfectionist that you
cannot control a campaign as you can a film).
</P>
<P>
   But Beatty has been arguing for years that American liberalism
has been destroyed by the influence of money on politics, and he
thinks that the groundswell of support for campaign-finance reform
provides a chance of changing that.
</P>
<P>
   He is vigorously consulting activists in both the Democratic
Party and the Reform Party, and has sought advice from Pat Caddell,
the pollster who helped to bring New Coke into the world.
</P>
<P>
   He has written a somewhat elliptical piece for the New York
Times condemning the grip of big money on American politics, and
has another piece coming out in the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura, the governor of Minnesota, is apparently courting
him as the Reform Party's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Arianna Huffington first floated the idea of a Beatty
candidacy, it has been the cause of mirth. How can a man who lives
in a mansion in the Hollywood Hills take himself seriously as a
champion of the poor?
</P>
<P>
   And how can a man who is admired more for his womanizing than
his contribution to public life hope to fill the shoes of such
paragons as William Jefferson Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   One joke making the rounds is that Beatty will be able to win
the California primary even if the only people who vote for him are
women who have slept with him. (His paramours range from Madonna to
Diane Keaton.)
</P>
<P>
   The mirth is the result of more than just Beatty's record as an
inveterate liberal and retired roue. (He has now settled down with
Annette Bening, an actress.) It is the result of his profession.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan never lived down the fact that he starred in
``Bedtime for Bonzo,'' despite changing America more radically than
any president since Franklin Roosevelt, and today's Hollywood crowd
is regarded as much more of a joke than Reagan's ever was.
</P>
<P>
   There is no permutation of political correctness that does not
have some celebrity's name attached to it. Yet Hollywood is one of
the most ruthless industries in the world: a place where giant
multinationals package pap for the masses, slippery agents carry
the art of the double cross to levels undreamed of by Talleyrand,
and nobody bats an eyelid when the stars make millions and the rest
of the crew is thrown on the dole at the end of a production.
</P>
<P>
   Rich liberals always have a hard time dealing with the hypocrisy
charge. But Beatty is very far from being an airhead. Politics is
the other of his two great interests in life.
</P>
<P>
   He stumped for Robert Kennedy in 1968, strategized for George
McGovern in 1972, and worked as a key adviser for Gary Hart in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   His dinner conversation is more Washington than Hollywood,
focused on the hot topic of the day with occasional excursions into
political lore. (He tells a nice story about a friend bumping into
Richard Nixon on a beach at the height of the Watergate crisis. He
asked the embattled president whether he was ever tempted to press
the button. Nixon went silent for a while and then replied, slowly
and deliberately, ``No, that would be wrong.'')
</P>
<P>
   Beatty has the political skills it takes to rise to the top of a
brutal industry. He made a fortune out of ``Bonnie and Clyde''
(1967) by negotiating a contract that gave him 40 percent of the
gross.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, with the Cold War still raging, he persuaded Gulf +
Western to produce $25 million for ``Reds,'' a film that came close
to endorsing the philosophy of the other side; and the man who
financed Bulworth's anti-capitalist rants was none other than the
arch-capitalist himself, Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   If Beatty's involvement in politics is not quite as silly as it
sounds, neither is Hollywood's. Hollywood is one of America's most
successful industries, accounting for three-quarters of the films
shown in Europe and more than half of those in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the country's most controversial industries, too,
provoking fury in everybody from middle-of-the-road Americans, who
blame it for encouraging violence, to French bureaucrats, who
accuse it of destroying their film industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has no choice but to woo Washington, and to keep the
fires of both political parties stoked with heaps of money. The
resulting nexus between Hollywood and Washington is inevitably
blamed for trivializing politics. But it is not entirely clear who
is doing the trivializing.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians usually become infatuated with Hollywood only when
they have to disguise failed policies with star power: the decline
of the Clinton presidency can be dated from the time when the
celebrities started outnumbering the Ivy League professors at White
House dinners.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollywood figures often become preoccupied by Washington
because they want to prove that they are serious: Reagan was
attracted to politics by the idea of ``getting government off
people's backs,'' just as Beatty is by the idea of reforming
America's money politics.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of reasons to oppose a Beatty candidacy, not
least that he is going to do more harm than good to his own cause
by taking votes from Bill Bradley; but the fact that he lives in
the Hollywood Hills is not one of them. &QL;

`PETE PETERSON: ASSIGNMENT HANOI': RETURN TO VIETNAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time and station are

<TEXT>
<P>
   An ambassador's life can be a busy one, even as it makes for
tedious television. So, at least, it appears from ``Pete Peterson:
Assignment Hanoi,'' Tuesday night's tribute to the first U.S.
ambassador to Vietnam. Douglas ``Pete'' Peterson took up his post
in 1997; the last time he resided in that country, for
six-and-a-half years, had been as a prisoner of war, captured in
1966 when his fighter plane was shot down.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson is seen being lobbied by American businessmen who are
having trouble making investments pay off in Vietnam, and relaying
their appeals to Vietnamese officials who are resistant to
capitalism. He stands tall at ceremonies of every sort, shakes
hands all around and testifies before Congress on the virtues of
Vietnamese-American friendship. He attends the cocktail parties of
other ambassadors in Saigon, at one of which he met his second
wife, a Vietnamese-born Australian diplomat. ``Now his life has
taken a new turn,'' announces the narrator, and in a private moment
the couple share a bowl of soup.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson appears to be an earnest and dutiful public servant. If
he were running again for Congress, where he served for three
terms, Tuesday night's portrait might do as a campaign commercial.
We are informed that he works long days.
</P>
<P>
   Due attention is given to his tortures by his captors (the worst
was kneeling and holding his hands in the air for hours at a
stretch) and to his personal tragedies (the deaths of his first
wife and their 16-year-old son within a few years). But mainly the
program is devoted to the virtues of reconciliation, or what he
calls in ambassadorial lingo ``a peaceful and constructive approach
to our relationship'' and what the scriptwriter could not forbear
from calling ``a search for closure.''
</P>
<P>
   The program's treatment of Vietnam, although it touches on
continuing areas of friction with the United States, doesn't go
much deeper than a travelogue. The big news is that many young
people are riding around on motorbikes and carrying cellular
phones. The hour is shot through with banalities: ``A new era in
United-States-Vietnamese relations has begun.'' The narrator can't
resist salutes: ``Pete Peterson had survived!'' ``Pete Peterson has
returned!'' And we are told, ``He welcomes every opportunity to
talk to Vietnamese.''
</P>
<P>
   There are affecting scenes, particularly of a solemn ceremony of
the return from Vietnam of coffins of American servicemen who had
been listed for decades as missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Peterson is shown to be the sort of representative
who gives the United States a good name. Unfortunately that does
not translate into enjoying the pleasure of his on-screen company.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Most aspiring politicians test the ground by releasing position
papers. Warren Beatty released a film featuring a man in a woolly
hat and baggy trousers instead.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bulworth,'' Beatty played a Democratic senator who is
finally driven mad by Washington's evil ways.
</P>
<P>
   He swaps his suits for ghetto gear, tears up his speech about
``standing at the dawn of a new millennium,'' and starts rapping
about the ``real issues'' instead: the hold of big money on
politics, the lack of universal health care, the export of jobs to
the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   This exercise in truth-telling naturally goes down famously with
the voters, and Senator Jay Billington Bulworth prepares to return
to Washington to clean house. The fictional Bulworth is inevitably
assassinated by big money before he can fulfill the people's
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   But there are growing signs that the real Beatty is preparing to
go to Washington in his place _ and go, moreover, as president
rather than a mere senator.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty has not yet announced his candidacy _ indeed, he has not
yet decided whether to run as a Democrat or a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   He is also being advised not to run by influential Democrats
(who think that he will split the left of the party) and by some
close friends (who warn the self-confessed perfectionist that you
cannot control a campaign as you can a film).
</P>
<P>
   But Beatty has been arguing for years that American liberalism
has been destroyed by the influence of money on politics, and he
thinks that the groundswell of support for campaign-finance reform
provides a chance of changing that.
</P>
<P>
   He is vigorously consulting activists in both the Democratic
Party and the Reform Party, and has sought advice from Pat Caddell,
the pollster who helped to bring New Coke into the world.
</P>
<P>
   He has written a somewhat elliptical piece for the New York
Times condemning the grip of big money on American politics, and
has another piece coming out in the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura, the governor of Minnesota, is apparently courting
him as the Reform Party's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Arianna Huffington first floated the idea of a Beatty
candidacy, it has been the cause of mirth. How can a man who lives
in a mansion in the Hollywood Hills take himself seriously as a
champion of the poor?
</P>
<P>
   And how can a man who is admired more for his womanizing than
his contribution to public life hope to fill the shoes of such
paragons as William Jefferson Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   One joke making the rounds is that Beatty will be able to win
the California primary even if the only people who vote for him are
women who have slept with him. (His paramours range from Madonna to
Diane Keaton.)
</P>
<P>
   The mirth is the result of more than just Beatty's record as an
inveterate liberal and retired roue. (He has now settled down with
Annette Bening, an actress.) It is the result of his profession.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan never lived down the fact that he starred in
``Bedtime for Bonzo,'' despite changing America more radically than
any president since Franklin Roosevelt, and today's Hollywood crowd
is regarded as much more of a joke than Reagan's ever was.
</P>
<P>
   There is no permutation of political correctness that does not
have some celebrity's name attached to it. Yet Hollywood is one of
the most ruthless industries in the world: a place where giant
multinationals package pap for the masses, slippery agents carry
the art of the double cross to levels undreamed of by Talleyrand,
and nobody bats an eyelid when the stars make millions and the rest
of the crew is thrown on the dole at the end of a production.
</P>
<P>
   Rich liberals always have a hard time dealing with the hypocrisy
charge. But Beatty is very far from being an airhead. Politics is
the other of his two great interests in life.
</P>
<P>
   He stumped for Robert Kennedy in 1968, strategized for George
McGovern in 1972, and worked as a key adviser for Gary Hart in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   His dinner conversation is more Washington than Hollywood,
focused on the hot topic of the day with occasional excursions into
political lore. (He tells a nice story about a friend bumping into
Richard Nixon on a beach at the height of the Watergate crisis. He
asked the embattled president whether he was ever tempted to press
the button. Nixon went silent for a while and then replied, slowly
and deliberately, ``No, that would be wrong.'')
</P>
<P>
   Beatty has the political skills it takes to rise to the top of a
brutal industry. He made a fortune out of ``Bonnie and Clyde''
(1967) by negotiating a contract that gave him 40 percent of the
gross.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, with the Cold War still raging, he persuaded Gulf +
Western to produce $25 million for ``Reds,'' a film that came close
to endorsing the philosophy of the other side; and the man who
financed Bulworth's anti-capitalist rants was none other than the
arch-capitalist himself, Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   If Beatty's involvement in politics is not quite as silly as it
sounds, neither is Hollywood's. Hollywood is one of America's most
successful industries, accounting for three-quarters of the films
shown in Europe and more than half of those in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the country's most controversial industries, too,
provoking fury in everybody from middle-of-the-road Americans, who
blame it for encouraging violence, to French bureaucrats, who
accuse it of destroying their film industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has no choice but to woo Washington, and to keep the
fires of both political parties stoked with heaps of money. The
resulting nexus between Hollywood and Washington is inevitably
blamed for trivializing politics. But it is not entirely clear who
is doing the trivializing.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians usually become infatuated with Hollywood only when
they have to disguise failed policies with star power: the decline
of the Clinton presidency can be dated from the time when the
celebrities started outnumbering the Ivy League professors at White
House dinners.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollywood figures often become preoccupied by Washington
because they want to prove that they are serious: Reagan was
attracted to politics by the idea of ``getting government off
people's backs,'' just as Beatty is by the idea of reforming
America's money politics.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of reasons to oppose a Beatty candidacy, not
least that he is going to do more harm than good to his own cause
by taking votes from Bill Bradley; but the fact that he lives in
the Hollywood Hills is not one of them. &QL;

EXTRADITION HEARING ON ALLEGED EMBEZZLER IS AWAITED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMBURG, Germany _ Martin Frankel, the money manager sought on
charges that he embezzled hundreds of millions of dollars, spent
another day in prison as German prosecutors waited for American
law-enforcement officials to formally ask for his extradition to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rudiger Bagger, the Hamburg prosecutor, said that police had
charged Frankel with violating German laws by carrying a false
passport. The charge is minor compared with those leveled against
Frankel in the United States, but it makes it easier to hold him in
prison while German officials wait for more detailed evidence from
their U.S. counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Bagger said that a hearing on Frankel's extradition may be held
as early as Thursday, but that it would probably take several weeks
before he is actually sent back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   German police officials, acting on a request from the FBI,
arrested Frankel at a Hamburg hotel on Saturday night. Frankel and
a companion, Cynthia Allison, stayed at the elegant Hotel Prem for
about eight weeks under assumed names.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, who is 44, had been a fugitive since early May, when he
became engulfed in accusations of having systematically embezzled
at least $200 million from insurance companies that had invested
money with him.
</P>
<P>
   Though German prosecutors do not expect any problems in
extraditing Frankel, Bagger said that the FBI's arrest warrant
provided only the most general allegations with few specific facts
to back them up.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. prosecutors will have to send extensive information and
supporting documents here concerning the crimes that Frankel is
charged with committing, but that information is not expected to
arrive until later this week at the earliest.

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG, NEW YORK AND PARIS _ Simon Noble, a young-looking
28-year-old, is nobody's idea of a latter-day Bugsy Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago he had been due to study banking and international
finance at Manchester University, when he took a part-time job at
the London office of Intertops, an Austrian bookmaker offering bets
on Germany's Bundesliga (soccer betting inside the country was a
government monopoly).
</P>
<P>
   Noble, who has a good head for numbers, kept delaying his
degree. Now he runs Intertops.com, an Internet spin-off in Antigua.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Bugsy's Flamingo Hotel, which gave birth to Las Vegas,
had its admirers, so some see Intertops.com as a pioneer in a
thriving young industry serving some 20 million gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian Sinclair, of Christiansen Capital Advisors, a New
York-based management consultancy, reckons that the revenues of the
400 or so online gambling sites (i.e.: the money that the gaming
companies keep) will surpass $1 billion this year, compared with
$300 million in 1997. Others give even higher estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But Bugsy also had his detractors, and some critics compare
Internet gambling to crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Around half the bets in the Caribbean are made by American
punters. Politicians argue that the Internet is enticing minors and
college students into gambling, and providing an even quicker way
for addicts of all ages to fritter away their money.
</P>
<P>
   They also whisper _ with no hard evidence _ that some virtual
casinos are a haven for money laundering (just as the Flamingo and
other joints once were).
</P>
<P>
   Several states have tried to outlaw wire-transfers to Caribbean
gambling sites. In 1998 the Department of Justice brought charges
under the Wire Act against 22 American citizens involved in
managing foreign-based sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't hide online,'' Janet Reno, the attorney-general,
warned Internet betting operators, ``and you can't hide offshore.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent huge National Gambling Impact Study Commission
(NGISC) report recommended banning Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   What is afoot? The answer depends on your attitude to gambling.
Yet from a strictly commercial viewpoint, the lesson is clear.
</P>
<P>
   Internet gambling may still be small (the revenues of American
casinos alone are 50 times bigger). But technology is gradually
helping to globalize one of the world's most idiosyncratic and
local industries.
</P>
<P>
   Property vendors like to say that only three things matter:
location, location and location. In gambling, the equivalent has
always been regulation, regulation and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Countries tend to grant only limited exceptions to a general
ban. Even in a free-trade area such as the European Union, gambling
is usually an exception to the rule that firms can ply their trade
freely across borders. The result is one of the most peculiar and
cronyish industries in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In America it is virtually impossible to bet (legally) on a
football game, unless you happen to be in Las Vegas or on an Indian
reservation; betting on horse racing is also difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Yet states earn around $40 billion a year from heavily promoted
lotteries _ gambling that one member of the NGISC describes as ``a
massive bait-and-switch consumer fraud.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (825-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The regulators are a rum lot, stretching from the Hong Kong
Jockey Club (which has financed most of the territory's social
services) to the (once-notorious) Las Vegas Gaming Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's ``spread-betting'' firms, which offer bets on
everything from Test matches to the performance of individual
shares, are regulated by the Financial Services Authority. Heavy
taxation is usually the price for being allowed to operate.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, for example, the national lottery pays back 50
percent of customers' stakes as prizes, but then gives 80 percent
of what is left to the government through tax and its contribution
to ``good causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bookmakers, who pay out as winnings 75 percent of betting
proceeds, hand over only 37 percent of their take to the
government. Casinos surrender at least 95 percent of what is spent,
but their tax rate is only 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Technology allows gambling to jump out of such boxes. Off-track
horse betting jumped in popularity once the shops started providing
live television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In Las Vegas, thousands of one-armed bandits have been linked to
create a game with odds and potential prizes comparable to a state
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, bingo halls have fought back against the national
lottery by forming a national network with a super-jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Governments are forever reproving those that overstep the mark.
Bookmakers in Britain who offered a game based on the results of
the Irish national lottery were forced to adapt its prize structure
into something less appealing so as not to siphon money out of the
British one.
</P>
<P>
   There have been endless rows in America about what games tribal
authorities can offer, and how far offshore floating casinos must
be (the distance seems to have fallen from miles to a few inches).
</P>
<P>
   Cross-border gambling is a particular threat. In 1994 the
British government won the ``Schindler'' case to stop a group from
selling German lottery tickets in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In America, lotteries also have to stay in their states: hence
the traffic streaming across the border from New York state to
Connecticut to play ``Powerball,'' a ludicrous multi-state lottery
that gives its sad devotees (including your correspondent) a
pathetically small chance of winning an outrageously large sum of
money.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming ``foreign competition,'' Victor Chandler, a British
telephone bookmaker, recently moved to Gibraltar. The firm thus
avoids the 9 percent tax levied on off-track betting in Britain,
although it voluntarily pays 1.5 percent of its takings to
Britain's horse-racing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler will start taking bets over the Internet at the end of
the year, but it already reports that more inquiries from new
customers are coming via the web; one in four American punters
makes contact this way.
</P>
<P>
   It costs less than $500,000 to set up an Internet site, which
even a mildly efficient operator should be able to win back within
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Schneider, the publisher of Interactive Gaming News, points
out that more than 40 places, including most tax havens, now allow
Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest country to become a haven for Internet gambling is
Australia. Most of the big casinos are involved. The leading sports
bookie, Centrebet (which also claims to be among the top five
worldwide) is pushing into Scandinavia, accepting bets on Finnish
baseball and Danish ice hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was taken over by Jupiters, which is part-owned by
America's Hilton Hotels, Centrebet has turned away American-based
punters; despite that handicap, its Internet business, which now
generates A$50 million ($32 million) a year, doubles every year.
</P>
<P>
   For punters, Internet gambling is riskier than the regulated
thing. Betting on sports online, where everybody knows the result,
is safer than online casino games, where it is practically
impossible to know the odds _ though some websites at least monitor
the payouts.
</P>
<P>
   There is the risk that a site will close before you collect your
winnings (one punter cited by the NGISC lost $7,000 that way).
Hence most bigger firms want to establish brands.
</P>
<P>
   Noble says his books are audited by KPMG, and that Intertops.com
has paid out $200 million since it began _ the largest successful
bet was for SFr350,000 ($230,000) on Romania reaching the second
stage of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Like other bookmakers, he has to cope with syndicates such as
the Kosher Kids and the Chinamen (``You take the first bet, and
politely refuse the rest''). The global spread of punters helps in
his two main sports, American football and English soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Local gamblers, who follow form, can make a killing betting
against better-known clubs; but this is usually offset by Asian
gamblers who tend to bet on famous names such as Manchester United
and the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   In a few years, the odds are that much sports betting will have
moved to the web. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,625) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, both William Hill, a high-street bookmaker, and IG
Index, a spread-betting firm, report big increases in Internet
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   In America, a fair chunk of the ``street'' (i.e.: mob) betting
will also move. Yet the Internet is also tempting students who
would not dream of taking odds from Two Fingers Rossi on a street
corner in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Most places in Europe will enforce some tacit regulation of
Internet gambling. But the land of the day trader and Powerball
looks likely to pass an Internet Gambling Prohibition Act,
sponsored by John Kyl, a Republican senator, and supported by,
among others, the state attorneys-general, most American sporting

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG, NEW YORK AND PARIS _ Simon Noble, a young-looking
28-year-old, is nobody's idea of a latter-day Bugsy Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago he had been due to study banking and international
finance at Manchester University, when he took a part-time job at
the London office of Intertops, an Austrian bookmaker offering bets
on Germany's Bundesliga (soccer betting inside the country was a
government monopoly).
</P>
<P>
   Noble, who has a good head for numbers, kept delaying his
degree. Now he runs Intertops.com, an Internet spin-off in Antigua.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Bugsy's Flamingo Hotel, which gave birth to Las Vegas,
had its admirers, so some see Intertops.com as a pioneer in a
thriving young industry serving some 20 million gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian Sinclair, of Christiansen Capital Advisors, a New
York-based management consultancy, reckons that the revenues of the
400 or so online gambling sites (i.e.: the money that the gaming
companies keep) will surpass $1 billion this year, compared with
$300 million in 1997. Others give even higher estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But Bugsy also had his detractors, and some critics compare
Internet gambling to crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Around half the bets in the Caribbean are made by American
punters. Politicians argue that the Internet is enticing minors and
college students into gambling, and providing an even quicker way
for addicts of all ages to fritter away their money.
</P>
<P>
   They also whisper _ with no hard evidence _ that some virtual
casinos are a haven for money laundering (just as the Flamingo and
other joints once were).
</P>
<P>
   Several states have tried to outlaw wire-transfers to Caribbean
gambling sites. In 1998 the Department of Justice brought charges
under the Wire Act against 22 American citizens involved in
managing foreign-based sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't hide online,'' Janet Reno, the attorney-general,
warned Internet betting operators, ``and you can't hide offshore.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent huge National Gambling Impact Study Commission
(NGISC) report recommended banning Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   What is afoot? The answer depends on your attitude to gambling.
Yet from a strictly commercial viewpoint, the lesson is clear.
</P>
<P>
   Internet gambling may still be small (the revenues of American
casinos alone are 50 times bigger). But technology is gradually
helping to globalize one of the world's most idiosyncratic and
local industries.
</P>
<P>
   Property vendors like to say that only three things matter:
location, location and location. In gambling, the equivalent has
always been regulation, regulation and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Countries tend to grant only limited exceptions to a general
ban. Even in a free-trade area such as the European Union, gambling
is usually an exception to the rule that firms can ply their trade
freely across borders. The result is one of the most peculiar and
cronyish industries in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In America it is virtually impossible to bet (legally) on a
football game, unless you happen to be in Las Vegas or on an Indian
reservation; betting on horse racing is also difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Yet states earn around $40 billion a year from heavily promoted
lotteries _ gambling that one member of the NGISC describes as ``a
massive bait-and-switch consumer fraud.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (825-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The regulators are a rum lot, stretching from the Hong Kong
Jockey Club (which has financed most of the territory's social
services) to the (once-notorious) Las Vegas Gaming Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's ``spread-betting'' firms, which offer bets on
everything from Test matches to the performance of individual
shares, are regulated by the Financial Services Authority. Heavy
taxation is usually the price for being allowed to operate.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, for example, the national lottery pays back 50
percent of customers' stakes as prizes, but then gives 80 percent
of what is left to the government through tax and its contribution
to ``good causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bookmakers, who pay out as winnings 75 percent of betting
proceeds, hand over only 37 percent of their take to the
government. Casinos surrender at least 95 percent of what is spent,
but their tax rate is only 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Technology allows gambling to jump out of such boxes. Off-track
horse betting jumped in popularity once the shops started providing
live television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In Las Vegas, thousands of one-armed bandits have been linked to
create a game with odds and potential prizes comparable to a state
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, bingo halls have fought back against the national
lottery by forming a national network with a super-jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Governments are forever reproving those that overstep the mark.
Bookmakers in Britain who offered a game based on the results of
the Irish national lottery were forced to adapt its prize structure
into something less appealing so as not to siphon money out of the
British one.
</P>
<P>
   There have been endless rows in America about what games tribal
authorities can offer, and how far offshore floating casinos must
be (the distance seems to have fallen from miles to a few inches).
</P>
<P>
   Cross-border gambling is a particular threat. In 1994 the
British government won the ``Schindler'' case to stop a group from
selling German lottery tickets in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In America, lotteries also have to stay in their states: hence
the traffic streaming across the border from New York state to
Connecticut to play ``Powerball,'' a ludicrous multi-state lottery
that gives its sad devotees (including your correspondent) a
pathetically small chance of winning an outrageously large sum of
money.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming ``foreign competition,'' Victor Chandler, a British
telephone bookmaker, recently moved to Gibraltar. The firm thus
avoids the 9 percent tax levied on off-track betting in Britain,
although it voluntarily pays 1.5 percent of its takings to
Britain's horse-racing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler will start taking bets over the Internet at the end of
the year, but it already reports that more inquiries from new
customers are coming via the web; one in four American punters
makes contact this way.
</P>
<P>
   It costs less than $500,000 to set up an Internet site, which
even a mildly efficient operator should be able to win back within
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Schneider, the publisher of Interactive Gaming News, points
out that more than 40 places, including most tax havens, now allow
Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest country to become a haven for Internet gambling is
Australia. Most of the big casinos are involved. The leading sports
bookie, Centrebet (which also claims to be among the top five
worldwide) is pushing into Scandinavia, accepting bets on Finnish
baseball and Danish ice hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was taken over by Jupiters, which is part-owned by
America's Hilton Hotels, Centrebet has turned away American-based
punters; despite that handicap, its Internet business, which now
generates A$50 million ($32 million) a year, doubles every year.
</P>
<P>
   For punters, Internet gambling is riskier than the regulated
thing. Betting on sports online, where everybody knows the result,
is safer than online casino games, where it is practically
impossible to know the odds _ though some websites at least monitor
the payouts.
</P>
<P>
   There is the risk that a site will close before you collect your
winnings (one punter cited by the NGISC lost $7,000 that way).
Hence most bigger firms want to establish brands.
</P>
<P>
   Noble says his books are audited by KPMG, and that Intertops.com
has paid out $200 million since it began _ the largest successful
bet was for SFr350,000 ($230,000) on Romania reaching the second
stage of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Like other bookmakers, he has to cope with syndicates such as
the Kosher Kids and the Chinamen (``You take the first bet, and
politely refuse the rest''). The global spread of punters helps in
his two main sports, American football and English soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Local gamblers, who follow form, can make a killing betting
against better-known clubs; but this is usually offset by Asian
gamblers who tend to bet on famous names such as Manchester United
and the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   In a few years, the odds are that much sports betting will have
moved to the web. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,625) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, both William Hill, a high-street bookmaker, and IG
Index, a spread-betting firm, report big increases in Internet
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   In America, a fair chunk of the ``street'' (i.e.: mob) betting
will also move. Yet the Internet is also tempting students who
would not dream of taking odds from Two Fingers Rossi on a street
corner in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Most places in Europe will enforce some tacit regulation of
Internet gambling. But the land of the day trader and Powerball
looks likely to pass an Internet Gambling Prohibition Act,
sponsored by John Kyl, a Republican senator, and supported by,
among others, the state attorneys-general, most American sporting
leagues and various casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually, however, the Justice Department has opposed the idea

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Ty's probably laughing his head off,'' whined one
distraught collector. ``I just can't imagine being without them.''
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the news on Aug. 31 that Ty Warner, the
founder of Ty Inc., is retiring all of his toy company's Beanie
Babies by the end of the year looks like inspired marketing _ and
great news for collectors.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is going to make these hugely popular and scarce
little bean-bag animals, with names like ``Honks'' the goose and
``Slowpoke'' the sloth, even scarcer.
</P>
<P>
   Since he introduced Beanie Babies in 1993, Warner has proved a
superlative marketer, manipulating demand by supplying restricted
quantities of Beanies to small, specialist toy shops, bypassing big
toy chains and periodically ``retiring'' animals to boost their
value.
</P>
<P>
   He has added a touch of exclusivity too, by never advertising,
relying on word of mouth, and building a mystique about himself and
his private firm, based in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been startling. Although Beanies were
originally a children's toy, 70 percent of collectors are adults.
Many have sunk large sums, trading the 212-strong range of animals
on the secondary market, taking out insurance policies in case
their Beanies are stolen, and writing in for legal advice about how
to divide their collections when they get divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Beanies that sell new for $4-5 can trade for thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Beaniex.com, an auction website for Beanies
(http://www.beaniex.com), features ``Peanut,'' a Royal Blue
Elephant, for $5,200, and ``Brownie Brown Bear'' for $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The craze has generated a whole spin-off industry from sellers
on the street to people such as Mary Beth Sobolewski, who left a
job at IBM to start ``Bean Bag World Monthly,'' a magazine with a
circulation of more than a million and the biggest of several
Beanie publications.
</P>
<P>
   This latest, carefully crafted announcement made on Ty's website
(http://www.ty.com) is guaranteed to send the price of Beanies
rocketing.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, the statement is a huge teaser. The company refused
to clarify whether ``retirement'' meant the end of Beanie Babies
for good or merely a clearing of the shelves for a new collection.
A new black bear called ``The End'' coinciding with its statement
merely added to the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Ty then blacked out its site for more than 12 hours before
reposting the news. Children and collectors sat up all night in
case the news was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Creating panic buying is astute at a time when the Beanie Babies
craze has started to wane and competition for new collectible toys
such as the Pokemon characters has intensified.
</P>
<P>
   A renewed buying frenzy could, however, turn out to be nothing
more than a short-term bounce. Perhaps these little bean bags
really are like tin soldiers, baseball cards or Picasso paintings,
which become more valuable the scarcer they get. But the suspicion
is that, by choking off the supply of Beanies, Ty is stabbing its
customers in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Once the hype dies and collectors move on to something else,
there will be no new buyers to keep the market liquid. Prices could
plummet; and collectors who have not already sold will be left with
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that happens will decide if Beanie Babies were a genuine
collectible or just a well-marketed fad. &QL;

 By ANDREW MARSHALL  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From her farmhouse kitchen, Lavon Griffieon can see
field after field of green stretching out to the horizon. On one
side, that is.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, marching up almost to the farm, are serried ranks
of brown and beige houses, concrete evidence of a problem which
America is starting to notice: urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Family farmers are under intense pressure in America, as prices
plunge to ever-lower levels and their debt rises to unmanageable
levels. Many are simply cashing in their chips and selling out to
land speculators.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers' problems rarely make it very high up the list of
concerns in Washington, but the problems spawned by the farm
crisis, like sprawl, are starting to coalesce into a new political
agenda, against developers and against the massive agricultural
conglomerates which are squeezing the small farmers from both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Griffieon, sitting in her neat kitchen with her husband and
children, is at the forefront of that agenda. Unlikely as it might
seem, this farming family from Iowa is part of a growing political
movement which is getting attention at the highest levels.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Mrs. Griffieon led a local group which sought
to educate Iowans about agriculture. It might seem an unlikely task
in a state where agriculture dominates the local economy and the
state seems to be submerged in fields of rolling green.
</P>
<P>
   However as she points out, ``most Americans are three
generations removed from agriculture and they really don't
understand what goes on on farms.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years, the scale of the problems which she
and her farming friends faced started to move her towards something
else, a more active campaign.
</P>
<P>
   What had been the small town of Ankney to the south began to
expand relentlessly, eating up those green fields like a swarm of
locusts. And as the farm crisis bit, more and more land went out of
farming forever to become new housing.
</P>
<P>
   She founded 1,000 Friends of Iowa, a group which campaigns for
farmers and against the insidious spread of development into
farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Just up the road are four lifesize cows stand with her message
set out in large letters: ``Urban Sprawl/Ain't Too Pretty/Save Our
Farms/Build In The City.''
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the crisis for family farmers in the U.S. is
terrifying. Take pork, a staple of the economy in Iowa. Pork prices
had been good in 1997, but collapsed in 1998 and have sunk even
lower this year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, hogs were going for over fifty dollars a hundredweight
in the auction pens at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, about
five dollars over the 10-year average. This year, those prices were
dipping towards thirty dollars. Economists are used to the pattern
of the pork market, which even has a name: the hog cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Prices go up, so farmers invest in more pigs. Overproduction
reduces prices, and the pigs get slaughtered so prices sink again.
But this time, the dip is lower and there is no sign of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is the massive spread of industrial pig
farming, or ``hog confinement'' as it is called.
</P>
<P>
   The large food producers have created vast pork factories with
thousands of pigs across the Midwest and the West, and they aren't
going to cut back. So the small farmers suffer even more.
</P>
<P>
   More and more farmers go out of business every day. Farmland is
worth about $2,700 an acre; development land goes for six times
that. Just by selling up, a farmer can erase his debts and turn
himself into a wealthy man.
</P>
<P>
   But the land goes out of farming forever, and another street of
houses is added to the Iowa countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Urban sprawl has started to pop up on the political agenda
across America.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ``1,000 Friends'' groups in states across the
nation, and similar grass-roots efforts are multiplying. There were
hundreds of proposals to limit urban expansion on the ballots at
last year's election, and there will be more next year.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the most likely Democratic candidate in
next year's election, has become an advocate of Smart Growth.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't just sprawl. The massive hog farms also became an
issue in last year's elections, as dozens of small campaigning
groups raised questions about the pollution they cause.
</P>
<P>
   America has also started to become more concerned about food
quality, questioning both the reliability of imports and what goes
into the food produced by the large industrial companies which
dominate the nation's tables.
</P>
<P>
   For these problems, and many others, many Iowans blame the large
food producers. Todd Lust, a 36-year old farmer, told Gore to
enforce competition rules to stop family farmers from going out of
business when he visited the State Fair this year, but he didn't
get the answers he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear him say he was going to fight the corporations?''
he asked a Des Moines Register reporter afterwards. ``I think it's
too late. They waited too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers are giving up the struggle to survive alone, and
are becoming contractors to the conglomerates. ``It's becoming a
lord-serf kind of thing,'' says Mrs. Griffieon, another nail in the
coffin of the small farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But she will go on fighting. The family has been farming for six
generations. ``That's a hard thing to break up,'' she says. ``You
don't want to be the link that breaks.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ From her farmhouse kitchen, Lavon Griffieon can see
field after field of green stretching out to the horizon. On one
side, that is.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, marching up almost to the farm, are serried ranks
of brown and beige houses, concrete evidence of a problem which
America is starting to notice: urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Family farmers are under intense pressure in America, as prices
plunge to ever-lower levels and their debt rises to unmanageable
levels. Many are simply cashing in their chips and selling out to
land speculators.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers' problems rarely make it very high up the list of
concerns in Washington, but the problems spawned by the farm
crisis, like sprawl, are starting to coalesce into a new political
agenda, against developers and against the massive agricultural
conglomerates which are squeezing the small farmers from both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Griffieon, sitting in her neat kitchen with her husband and
children, is at the forefront of that agenda. Unlikely as it might
seem, this farming family from Iowa is part of a growing political
movement which is getting attention at the highest levels.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Mrs. Griffieon led a local group which sought
to educate Iowans about agriculture. It might seem an unlikely task
in a state where agriculture dominates the local economy and the
state seems to be submerged in fields of rolling green.
</P>
<P>
   However as she points out, ``most Americans are three
generations removed from agriculture and they really don't
understand what goes on on farms.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years, the scale of the problems which she
and her farming friends faced started to move her towards something
else, a more active campaign.
</P>
<P>
   What had been the small town of Ankney to the south began to
expand relentlessly, eating up those green fields like a swarm of
locusts. And as the farm crisis bit, more and more land went out of
farming forever to become new housing.
</P>
<P>
   She founded 1,000 Friends of Iowa, a group which campaigns for
farmers and against the insidious spread of development into
farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Just up the road are four lifesize cows stand with her message
set out in large letters: ``Urban Sprawl/Ain't Too Pretty/Save Our
Farms/Build In The City.''
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the crisis for family farmers in the U.S. is
terrifying. Take pork, a staple of the economy in Iowa. Pork prices
had been good in 1997, but collapsed in 1998 and have sunk even
lower this year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, hogs were going for over fifty dollars a hundredweight
in the auction pens at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, about
five dollars over the 10-year average. This year, those prices were
dipping towards thirty dollars. Economists are used to the pattern
of the pork market, which even has a name: the hog cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Prices go up, so farmers invest in more pigs. Overproduction
reduces prices, and the pigs get slaughtered so prices sink again.
But this time, the dip is lower and there is no sign of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is the massive spread of industrial pig
farming, or ``hog confinement'' as it is called.
</P>
<P>
   The large food producers have created vast pork factories with
thousands of pigs across the Midwest and the West, and they aren't
going to cut back. So the small farmers suffer even more.
</P>
<P>
   More and more farmers go out of business every day. Farmland is
worth about $2,700 an acre; development land goes for six times
that. Just by selling up, a farmer can erase his debts and turn
himself into a wealthy man.
</P>
<P>
   But the land goes out of farming forever, and another street of
houses is added to the Iowa countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Urban sprawl has started to pop up on the political agenda
across America.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ``1,000 Friends'' groups in states across the
nation, and similar grass-roots efforts are multiplying. There were
hundreds of proposals to limit urban expansion on the ballots at
last year's election, and there will be more next year.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the most likely Democratic candidate in
next year's election, has become an advocate of Smart Growth.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't just sprawl. The massive hog farms also became an
issue in last year's elections, as dozens of small campaigning
groups raised questions about the pollution they cause.
</P>
<P>
   America has also started to become more concerned about food
quality, questioning both the reliability of imports and what goes
into the food produced by the large industrial companies which
dominate the nation's tables.
</P>
<P>
   For these problems, and many others, many Iowans blame the large
food producers. Todd Lust, a 36-year old farmer, told Gore to
enforce competition rules to stop family farmers from going out of
business when he visited the State Fair this year, but he didn't
get the answers he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear him say he was going to fight the corporations?''
he asked a Des Moines Register reporter afterwards. ``I think it's
too late. They waited too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers are giving up the struggle to survive alone, and
are becoming contractors to the conglomerates. ``It's becoming a
lord-serf kind of thing,'' says Mrs. Griffieon, another nail in the
coffin of the small farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But she will go on fighting. The family has been farming for six
generations. ``That's a hard thing to break up,'' she says. ``You
don't want to be the link that breaks.'' &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like Broadway, baseball and big-game hunting, the art
trade has always had a season. It began in mid-September, rose to
heights each fall and again each spring, then tailed off at the end
of June, when rich collectors headed for a summer of leisure at
their country homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``August,'' said Arnold Glimcher, the chairman of the Pace
Wildenstein Gallery, ``was a time when you could pull in the
sidewalk, and some galleries would even close for the whole
month.'' Certainly, big-name dealers left town, leaving skeleton
crews in charge of their galleries.
</P>
<P>
   But not last year, and especially not this year. ``It's been
insanity this summer; our business has not let up at all,''
Glimcher said, still working one day in mid-August and willing to
reel off sales of major works by Rothko, de Kooning and
Lichtenstein.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers all over Manhattan related similar experiences. And
Nancy Rosen, an art adviser who makes regular visits to Chelsea,
SoHo, midtown and uptown to look at all kinds of art, witnessed the
same thing. ``I go to galleries all the time, and this summer
they're not empty,'' she said. ``Almost all the dealers I know have
said they've had more activity this summer than they've ever had
before.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, art dealers and auction houses have
gloried in the exuberant economy and the ever-ascending stock
market, which have created many multimillionaires and billionaires
eager to plow their excess cash into paintings, sculpture and
decorative art. People like Michael Dell from the high-tech sector
and Gwyneth Paltrow and Leonardo DiCaprio from the entertainment
industry have been bitten by the collecting bug.
</P>
<P>
   Now these new collectors, along with many executives and
entrepreneurs who began collecting in the 1980s and have since
grown richer, are so strong in number and buying power that they
are changing the art world.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, the business, which once followed the rhythms of
the carriage trade, is instead moving to the beat of Wall Street.
That means that art buying has become a year-round activity, and
lazy Augusts are a thing of the past, even when dealers do go on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the phone every single day for work,'' said Jennifer
Vorbach, a partner at C&AMP;M Arts, about her two recent weeks on
vacation in the Hamptons. ``These were significant pieces of
business wanting to happen, and the business had to go on no matter
where I was.'' C&AMP;M's August sales included a major Warhol painting,
a Rothko painting and a Cornell box.
</P>
<P>
   ``With mobile phones and the Internet, I don't think business
stops anymore,'' agreed Rachel Kaminsky, the director of Otto
Naumann Ltd., an old-masters dealer that also had visits in August
from collectors she called significant.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Brooks, who as the chief executive of Sotheby's sees a lot
of collectors, new and old, is not the least surprised by the
gallery activity. ``The new collectors are people who work 12
months a year, and if they work 12 months a year, they want to buy
art 12 months a year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far neither Sotheby's nor its archrival, Christie's, is
holding sales in New York during the summer. But both auction
houses, concerned that the big sales of impressionist, modern and
contemporary art in New York and London are bunched too closely in
November-December and May-June, are considering spreading the sales
more evenly throughout the year. They are also counting on Internet
sales to cater to people who simply must buy between auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Besides buoyant sales, dealers and auction houses alike are
seeing a second effect of the influx of new money: Their business
is more volatile. Ms. Brooks said that when she joined Sotheby's 20
years ago, she was told the art market did not follow the stock
market. Then, the art market was said to lag the stock market by a
couple of years. ``Now we track the stock market much more
closely,'' she said, ``and we have more ups and downs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the stock market was off its record highs for six or
eight weeks earlier this year, it had an impact,'' she added.
``Even in that short period of time it had an impact
psychologically. Those ups and downs affect people who are willing
to spend $500,000 or $1 million or $5 million on a picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Burge, the chairman of Christie's in the Americas,
who used to make a strong case that the art market rose and fell in
fairly predictable cycles lasting about seven years, said he had
long since given up that theory. ``We're a full nine years into
this cycle,'' he said, thanks to the prosperity of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   This newfound dependence on the whims of the stock exchanges is
widely acknowledged. ``Why are you calling me?'' asked one dealer
when queried about the market outlook. ``You ought to be
interviewing Alan Greenspan.''
</P>
<P>
   With Greenspan and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve Board
so far keeping their cool, the art world is counting on a strong
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is early for announcements, Sotheby's, for example,
said it would offer a Cezanne still life, ``A Stoneware Pitcher,''
estimated at $18 million to $25 million, and Monet's landscape with
his wife, ``In the Meadow,'' estimated at $15 million to $20
million, both from private collections. Christie's has a van Gogh,
``The Bridge at Trinquetaille,'' from the estate of Akram Ojjeh,
which has an unpublished estimate said to be $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the galleries, Pace Wildenstein will have new work from the
estate of Saul Steinberg, while Alexander and Bonin, Luhring
Augustine and others will have shows by young British artists
featured in the ``Sensation'' exhibition that opens at the Brooklyn
Museum of Art in October.
</P>
<P>
   But that is a small sampling, since the new collectors' tastes
are broad. While many of those with megadollars to spend do want
trophies by impressionists and 20th-century masters, many more,
with smaller budgets, seem to be interested in contemporary art,
especially the youngest collectors. ``They focus more on the highly
publicized sectors, to young artists they have heard about,'' said
Francesca Guglielmino, the business head of Citibank's Art Advisory
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Not every artist has benefited, of course, but some have noticed
the difference. ``Things have gotten better, definitely,'' said
Lisa Yuskavage, a painter whose work has won critical praise.
``When I started showing in the early '90s, it was hard to sell a
painting. But now I see brand-new artists' shows selling out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yuskavage, though, is a little wary. ``This is a capitalist
country, and everything goes from that, and that's not bad,'' she
said. ``But I'm a little nervous about it. You want people to be
able to buy your work even after the stock market fizzles.''

   If you have ever fallen about with laughter, scientists now
think they can explain why: humor makes some people, literally,
weak at the knees.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Leiden University, in the Netherlands, decided to
investigate why some people become ``weak with laughter,'' a phrase
that is used in many languages. They recruited volunteers who were
shown, or told, jokes, and while they laughed their physical
responses were monitored.
</P>
<P>
   The team measured a reflex in the subjects' legs by stimulating
a nerve behind the knee and measuring the contraction of the calf
muscle. This is known as the H-reflex and provides a measure of how
ready people's muscles are to move.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that when people were told jokes that made
them laugh out loud, the reflex almost disappeared, but it was
unaffected by jokes that only brought a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Gert van Dijk, a member of the research team, said: ``When the
reflex is strong, you can say the muscles are ready to fire. When
it is low, you know the spinal cord has said to the muscles they
had better shut up for a while and not move.''
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the study, published in The Lancet medical journal,
was to look at a phenomenon called cataplexy, a rare side-effect of
the sleep disorder narcolepsy.
</P>
<P>
   When sufferers from the condition laugh, they drop to the floor
and are unable to move for several minutes while remaining fully
conscious.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe there is a switch in the brain, which
normally operates only during sleep to prevent people acting out
their dreams, but which may also be triggered by laughter in
susceptible individuals. While this is extreme in narcoleptics, one
ordinary person in six has laughter-induced weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hoped we would see people with narcolepsy have a bigger
drop in the reflex,'' Dr. van Dijk said. ``But that is not what we
found. They did have a drop, but normal people had exactly the same
reaction. You do get weak at the knees if you laugh out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was unable to spread the jokes that made the study's
subjects fall about. ``They were told by students,'' he said. ``I
don't know what jokes they told and I don't think I want to know.
From outside the room it was clear that the volunteers certainly
found them funny and that was the point.'' &QL;

<P>
   The world's oceans are suffering outbreaks of disease on an
unprecedented scale, according to a group of leading marine
biologists who cite man as the chief culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Mass epidemics of viruses and parasites have resulted from a
warmer climate, pollution and human activities such as sea farming,
the scientists warn.
</P>
<P>
   They believe there are dire consequences for the future
diversity of marine life if the outbreaks of disease persist and so
continue to cause mass deaths within the oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Just 30 years ago, scientists believed that the oceans were so
vast that they would remain relatively immune from human influence,
but recent evidence shows that the seas have become as vulnerable
as the terrestrial environment.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the world's most distinguished marine researchers have
highlighted a series of disturbing reports over the past two
decades that indicate an ever-growing threat of infections. These
have resulted in the mass mortality of fish, sea mammals, coral
reefs and sea water plants.
</P>
<P>
   In a major review article in the journal Science, they point to
a continuing increase in the number of reported outbreaks of
disease, the worrying shift in infections from one host species to
another and the emergence of new diseases due to the human
exploitation of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   They cite 34 instances of mass mortality since 1938 where 10
percent or more of a population had been wiped out. All but seven
occurred in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past few decades, there has been a worldwide increase
in reports of diseases affecting marine organisms,'' the authors of
the Science article say.
</P>
<P>
   Many other outbreaks have probably gone unnoticed or unreported,
warn the 13 biologists, whose expertise ranges from microbiology
and ecology to immunology, oceanography and epidemiology.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Harvell, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary
biology at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. and a lead author of
the report, warned of the potentially catastrophic dangers posed by
marine pathogens _ viruses, bacteria, fungi and other parasites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combined effects of rising temperatures, human activity
and pollution are producing a volatile mix that may threaten
tropical corals and temperate species alike,'' said Professor
Harvell, an authority on coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
   Across the globe, dramatic examples have emerged to illustrate
the threats posed by the breakdown of natural barriers that
controlled the spread of marine pests.
</P>
<P>
   The waters of the Caribbean are now highlighted by the
scientists as a toxic ``hot spot,'' where mass mortalities have
resulted in a dramatic breakdown in the delicate web of marine
life.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, an outbreak in the Eighties of a mysterious
pathogen virtually wiped out the dominant sea urchin of the
Caribbean, which the authors describe as a ``keystone herbivore.''
The sea urchin's near extinction resulted in the replacement of
coral reefs in the area with algal growths.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time other, unknown, infectious agents wiped out
some of the most common species of marine organisms in the region,
notably 4,000 hectares of turtle grass seaweed in Florida Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the dozen or so coral diseases currently described for the
Caribbean region, the identity of the causative agent is known only
for three; nonetheless, the severity and novelty of many of the
disease symptoms suggest that the diseases are indeed new,'' the
scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   They highlight their concerns about the cross infection of
marine species directly due to human influence. The rare freshwater
seals of Lake Baikal in Siberia are known to be infected with the
distemper virus of domestic dogs, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Other seal populations _ the harbor seals and grey seals of the
seas around Northwestern Europe _ also died in their hundreds as a
result of becoming infected with the viruses of dolphins and
porpoises.
</P>
<P>
   The viruses were transmitted to the seals by infected harp seals
which had migrated to Europe from their normal hunting grounds off
Greenland, which had themselves been decimated by overfishing.
</P>
<P>
   Further examples of pathogens jumping from one species to
another are cited by the scientists, such as influenza in birds
causing mass deaths in seals and whales, and the infection of sea
fan corals with a soil fungus _ indicating the breakdown of the
land-sea barrier, the scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Warmer seas and chemical pollution are lowering the natural
resistance of marine organisms to infections. For instance, higher
temperatures caused European harbor seals to group together on land
in bigger colonies, making them more vulnerable to infections.
</P>
<P>
   The El Nino event _ a warm water current in the Pacific Ocean _
has become more frequent in recent years, causing coral reefs to
become bleached as a result of the death of vital algae on which
the coral depends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coral bleaching of 1998 was the most geographically
extensive and severe in recorded history, causing significant
mortality worldwide... The demise of some corals is likely to have
been accelerated by opportunistic infections,'' the scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Pollutants, such as organochlorides, are thought to be
implicated in the mass mortality of Mediterranean monk seals off
the coast of Mauritania, which died after becoming infected with a
distemper virus of dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Direct human activity is also taking its toll. The scientists
cite the example of a virus brought to Anxious Bay in South
Australia. The virus infected frozen pilchards which were used to
feed the blue-fin tuna farms of the area.
</P>
<P>
   The inability of science to even identify many of the diseases
in the oceans means there is an ``urgent need'' to study the
problem across many academic disciplines, the scientists say. &QL;

 NEW YORK: market fizzles.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How beholden the art market is to the new class of collectors is
difficult to say, although some dealers say they are posting record
sales. Many more say they are having their best year since the
market peak of 1989-90, when vigorous buying from Japan sent prices
for even mediocre art to unprecedented highs. But dealers, as
private businesses, do not report their sales as public companies
do.
</P>
<P>
   Yet signs that the art business is strong are everywhere. At the
auction houses, for example, combined North American sales of
Christie's and Sotheby's climbed from $1.68 billion during the
1996-97 season (from July 1, 1996, through June 30, 1997) to almost
$2.15 billion in the year ended June 30, 1999. That is an increase
of nearly 30 percent in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Art insurers are also smiling. ``Business really picked up in
1996,'' said Dietrich von Frank, president and chief executive of
AXA Nordstern Art Insurance. He said the average increase of
private collection holdings among his clients was up about 10
percent in the last year, after a jump of about 7.5 percent the
previous season.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Haber, an expert at Acordia, which also specializes in
art insurance, said his clients had on average increased the
insured value of their holdings by 15 percent to 20 percent in the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   And those figures do not capture the effect of many beginning
collectors, who tend to insure their early art purchases by adding
to their homeowner policies, rather than buying special policies to
cover their art.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the economy, while consumer spending continues to be
robust, conspicuous spending is even more so. Spending on luxury
goods like art, according to Robert Frank's recent book, ``Luxury
Fever,'' is increasing four times faster than spending overall.
</P>
<P>
   Art buying is always tied to real estate, and the size of new
homes _ first, second and sometimes third _ is exploding. Twenty
thousand square feet, which used to sound baronial, is
unexceptional nowadays. Homes of 40,000 square feet to 60,000
square feet, with yards of walls to cover, are being built not just
by Bill Gates but also by people whose names do not sell magazines.
The Whitney Museum of American Art, meanwhile, has only 42,000
square feet of exhibition space.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that collectors are filling these homes with art,
but they insist that new houses are not driving the market. ``I
don't have the sense that it's people decorating,'' Ms. Brooks
said. ``Collecting is a lot more focused today. New collectors are
driven people who are very intense about everything they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Dealers report that during the last two summers it has been the
browsers who have disappeared, not the collectors. ``The people
coming in aren't surprises,'' said Andrew Fabricant, a director of
the Richard Gray Gallery. ``It's not walk-in trade.'' Some seem to
come to New York, often from the Hamptons, but sometimes from the
West Coast, specifically to look and buy, several dealers said.
</P>
<P>
   Still other buyers apparently are intense enough to go
collecting on their real vacations. ``Rich people get bored,'' said
Thea Westreich, an art adviser. ``They're on vacation, and spending
money is a kick.'' She said she was busy all summer with ``high-end
business, significant money, willing to buy $5 million to $10
million pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Another new factor, during August especially, was European
collectors, who by all signs were in the United States primarily
for vacation and decided to go shopping for art, too.
</P>
<P>
   Delighted by all this activity, dealers and auctioneers
nevertheless take pains to make distinctions between the '90s and
the '80s, when speculators inflated the market, and anything and
everything sold. The whole thing fell apart when the Japanese
economic bubble burst.
</P>
<P>
   This market, by contrast, remains more orderly and rational,
they said. ``Now,'' Burge said, ``collectors are so well advised.
They have advisers, curators, restorers, conservators following
them around in packs. Anyone with serious money is buying with
advice.'' For the most part the frenzy is gone, except perhaps in
contemporary art, some experts said, although not for attribution.
</P>
<P>
   The market is so strong that some collectors are starting to
sell. For example, in July _ also an unusual occurrence _ Richard
York, an American art dealer, received an 1871 Hudson River
painting by Jasper Cropsey from ``one person who thinks it's a good
time to sell.'' Both the Monet and the Cezanne at Sotheby's are
voluntary sales. And Burge promised, ``It will be a rich fall
because of discretionary selling. You'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of discretionary selling has both positive and
negative implications. It is desirable because dealers and
auctioneers have had a hard time finding good, fresh material to
sell. On the other hand, it does mean that some people think prices
are peaking. Or perhaps, everyone hopes, the sellers simply want to
trade up to better, more expensive works.

<P>
   The world's oceans are suffering outbreaks of disease on an
unprecedented scale, according to a group of leading marine
biologists who cite man as the chief culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Mass epidemics of viruses and parasites have resulted from a
warmer climate, pollution and human activities such as sea farming,
the scientists warn.
</P>
<P>
   They believe there are dire consequences for the future
diversity of marine life if the outbreaks of disease persist and so
continue to cause mass deaths within the oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Just 30 years ago, scientists believed that the oceans were so
vast that they would remain relatively immune from human influence,
but recent evidence shows that the seas have become as vulnerable
as the terrestrial environment.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the world's most distinguished marine researchers have
highlighted a series of disturbing reports over the past two
decades that indicate an ever-growing threat of infections. These
have resulted in the mass mortality of fish, sea mammals, coral
reefs and sea water plants.
</P>
<P>
   In a major review article in the journal Science, they point to
a continuing increase in the number of reported outbreaks of
disease, the worrying shift in infections from one host species to
another and the emergence of new diseases due to the human
exploitation of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   They cite 34 instances of mass mortality since 1938 where 10
percent or more of a population had been wiped out. All but seven
occurred in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past few decades, there has been a worldwide increase
in reports of diseases affecting marine organisms,'' the authors of
the Science article say.
</P>
<P>
   Many other outbreaks have probably gone unnoticed or unreported,
warn the 13 biologists, whose expertise ranges from microbiology
and ecology to immunology, oceanography and epidemiology.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Harvell, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary
biology at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. and a lead author of
the report, warned of the potentially catastrophic dangers posed by
marine pathogens _ viruses, bacteria, fungi and other parasites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combined effects of rising temperatures, human activity
and pollution are producing a volatile mix that may threaten
tropical corals and temperate species alike,'' said Professor
Harvell, an authority on coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
   Across the globe, dramatic examples have emerged to illustrate
the threats posed by the breakdown of natural barriers that
controlled the spread of marine pests.
</P>
<P>
   The waters of the Caribbean are now highlighted by the
scientists as a toxic ``hot spot,'' where mass mortalities have
resulted in a dramatic breakdown in the delicate web of marine
life.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, an outbreak in the Eighties of a mysterious
pathogen virtually wiped out the dominant sea urchin of the
Caribbean, which the authors describe as a ``keystone herbivore.''
The sea urchin's near extinction resulted in the replacement of
coral reefs in the area with algal growths.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time other, unknown, infectious agents wiped out
some of the most common species of marine organisms in the region,
notably 4,000 hectares of turtle grass seaweed in Florida Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the dozen or so coral diseases currently described for the
Caribbean region, the identity of the causative agent is known only
for three; nonetheless, the severity and novelty of many of the
disease symptoms suggest that the diseases are indeed new,'' the
scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   They highlight their concerns about the cross infection of
marine species directly due to human influence. The rare freshwater
seals of Lake Baikal in Siberia are known to be infected with the
distemper virus of domestic dogs, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Other seal populations _ the harbor seals and grey seals of the
seas around Northwestern Europe _ also died in their hundreds as a
result of becoming infected with the viruses of dolphins and
porpoises.
</P>
<P>
   The viruses were transmitted to the seals by infected harp seals
which had migrated to Europe from their normal hunting grounds off
Greenland, which had themselves been decimated by overfishing.
</P>
<P>
   Further examples of pathogens jumping from one species to
another are cited by the scientists, such as influenza in birds
causing mass deaths in seals and whales, and the infection of sea
fan corals with a soil fungus _ indicating the breakdown of the
land-sea barrier, the scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Warmer seas and chemical pollution are lowering the natural
resistance of marine organisms to infections. For instance, higher
temperatures caused European harbor seals to group together on land
in bigger colonies, making them more vulnerable to infections.
</P>
<P>
   The El Nino event _ a warm water current in the Pacific Ocean _
has become more frequent in recent years, causing coral reefs to
become bleached as a result of the death of vital algae on which
the coral depends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coral bleaching of 1998 was the most geographically
extensive and severe in recorded history, causing significant
mortality worldwide... The demise of some corals is likely to have
been accelerated by opportunistic infections,'' the scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Pollutants, such as organochlorides, are thought to be
implicated in the mass mortality of Mediterranean monk seals off
the coast of Mauritania, which died after becoming infected with a
distemper virus of dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Direct human activity is also taking its toll. The scientists
cite the example of a virus brought to Anxious Bay in South
Australia. The virus infected frozen pilchards which were used to
feed the blue-fin tuna farms of the area.
</P>
<P>
   The inability of science to even identify many of the diseases
in the oceans means there is an ``urgent need'' to study the
problem across many academic disciplines, the scientists say. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a watershed ruling, the Israeli Supreme Court on
Monday unexpectedly outlawed the Israeli security service's
practice of using physically coercive interrogation methods that
critics have long denounced as forms of torture.
</P>
<P>
   A nine-judge panel led by Chief Justice Aharon Barak unanimously
banned several of the General Security Service's admitted
techniques for obtaining information from suspected terrorists.
These include violently shaking the suspects' upper torsos, forcing
them to crouch like frogs and shackling them in contorted positions
with opaque sacks over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling is unprecedented in a country where repeated
terrorist attacks have long created a perceived conflict between
the security interests of the state and the human rights of
suspects. Until this decision, the court has shied away from
imposing restrictions on Israeli security agencies, effectively
condoning their practices.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, civil rights lawyers were stunned when, years after the
lawsuits were filed but only four months after their hearing, the
court not only ruled decisively that the interrogation methods were
illegal but immediately enjoined the government from using them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly surprising,'' said Dan Yakir, lawyer for the
Association for Civil Rights in Israel. ``On the one hand, it was
the only legal decision they could have handed down. On the other,
the supreme court doesn't have a very impressive record in
defending human rights in light of security claims.''
</P>
<P>
   The court, clearly made uneasy that it had come to an
unequivocal legal decision, acknowledged mixed emotions in its
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deciding these applications weighed heavy on the court,'' the
decision said. ``Our apprehension is that this decision will hamper
the ability to properly deal with terrorists and terrorism, which
disturbs us. We are, however, judges. Our brethren require us to
act according to the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The supreme court suggested that the parliament draft
legislation if it wanted to override the ruling by sanctioning the
use of physical force in interrogations. Barak has long believed
the issue should be addressed in the legislature and not the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Minister Yossi Beilin is unlikely to advocate
legislation that undoes the court's ruling. Speaking from the Gaza
Strip, where he was meeting with his Palestinian counterpart,
Beilin, a political leftist, said he was ``very proud'' of the
court's decision to withdraw unconditional authorization for
routine use of coercive interrogation methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took a decision that was not easy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak issued a statement Monday night saying
that the decision appeared to be problematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``A way must be found to allow for interrogation when bombs may
be detonated in order to save lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government has long argued that forceful
interrogations are legal and desirable tools for extracting
information that can prevent terror attacks; violent shaking and
other techniques do not constitute torture, they say. Rather, they
are emergency methods when faced with suspects who know of a
``ticking bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, argued that the emergency methods were used
routinely, and that routine use is what the court outlawed Monday.
The judges still left the door open for agents to use these methods
when a bomb was really ticking, by suggesting they could invoke the
emergency conditions as a defense if criminal charges were later
brought against them.
</P>
<P>
   During the administration of former Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, the supreme court was under constant attack for being
too judicially active in matters of state and religion. It was not
immediately clear whether the change of government contributed to
Monday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Several right-wing members of parliament condemned the court
Monday, saying it had given improper weight to the human dignity of
terror suspects when compared with the security of Israel. Members
of the opposition Likud Party said they would immediately draft
legislation seeking to bypass the high court decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this response is dangerous, even absurd,'' said Yuval
Steinitz, a member of parliament from the conservative Likud Party.
``Israel is setting a precedent as a country losing its ability to
defend itself.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Many cases against the methods of Shin Bet, as the General
Security Service is better known, have been pending for years. The
judges combined seven in issuing their ruling. Among the
petitioners were human rights organizations, like the Public
Committee Against Torture in Israel, and individual Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   One, Hatem Abu Zayda, who challenged the Shin Bet's use of
interrogation methods such as sleep deprivation, shaking and
beatings, was later convicted and sentenced to 74 months in prison
for his activities as a member of the military wing of Hamas, the
Islamic fundamentalist group. The government argued before the
court that information obtained during Abu Zayda's interrogation
led to the thwarting of a terrorist plan.
</P>
<P>
   Another was a suspect who the Israeli government acknowledged
was shaken to death by Shin Bet agents during an interrogation, the
court said.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the court, although it detailed the history of
recent terror attacks, concluded that security agents can use no
more force than regular police investigators. It also described the
interrogation methods in unflinching detail.
</P>
<P>
   According to the court, forceful shaking, which causes the
suspect's head to whip back and forth, is the security agents'
harshest technique. The General Security Services claimed that
``shaking is indispensable to fighting and winning the war on
terrorism,'' the court said. Violently shaking suspects had allowed
agents to procure information that thwarted fatal attacks, the
government claimed.
</P>
<P>
   But the justices found that, ``Plainly put, shaking is a
prohibited investigation method. It harms the suspect's body. It
violates his dignity. It is a violent method which does not form
part of a legal investigation. It surpasses that which is
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges also described and proscribed an interrogation
technique whereby Shin Bet agents seat a suspect on a child-sized
chair that is tilted forward, tie one hand behind his back and one
behind the chair, cover his head with a suffocating sack and play
powerfully loud music for a protracted period of time.
</P>
<P>
   In criticizing the court's decision Monday, Gideon Ezra, a
member of parliament and former General Security Services official,
said that Shin Bet would find ways to get around the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that the GSS will find new methods,'' he said.
``Maybe they find a chair that is a little higher.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Dan Meridor, the former justice minister and
head of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, said the
decision ``constituted a certificate of honor for the state of
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Meridor recalled when Menachem Begin, a former prime minister,
summoned a security chief in 1977 and instructed him to use
``wisdom rather than violence'' in interrogations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps that was the first prime minister that gave an
instruction like this, more than 20 years ago,'' Meridor said.
``What the high court ruled is that in an interrogation, even
during a difficult war against terror where the interrogation is
vital, one must preserve basic standards of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from within and internationally, Israel has long
debated the legitimacy of the Shin Bet security agents' methods.
The government says they are used only rarely and under high-level
supervision. Human rights groups, however, say forceful
interrogation methods are used against hundred of Palestinians a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, a state commission began an inquiry into the
practices, and ended up legitimizing the security investigators'
use of a ``moderate measure of physical pressure'' as a last resort
to prevent violent attacks.
</P>
<P>
   International human rights groups considered this tantamount to
legalizing torture and kept up a steady stream of pressure against
the Israeli government, backing up the dogged efforts of Israeli
human rights groups who kept filing legal petitions.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, from London, Amnesty International officials called the
decision, which effectively overturns the state commission's
authorization of force, a milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under no circumstances can you torture,'' said Elizabeth
Hodgkin of Amnesty's London headquarters. ``That is what the
Convention against Torture, which Israel ratified, said, and now at
last the Israeli Supreme Court has concurred. What they've been
doing there is simply unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by Channel Two on Israeli television, Abdel Rahman
al Rahman, a former detainee who said he was subjected to physical
coercion by Shin Bet agents, did not applaud the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``A prize should not be awarded to the supreme court justices,''
he said. ``It's only natural that torture should not be allowed.''

<P>
   Dismayed by the nationalist wars that have dismembered their
country, a group of dissident Yugoslavs have decided to break away
and form their own country _ in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   This week will see the launch of Cyber Yugoslavia, where nobody
gets harassed because of ethnic differences, and every citizen gets
to be a minister: already there is a Secretary for Bad Movies,
another for Kitsch and Triviality and another still for The
Undersexed.
</P>
<P>
   Even before its inauguration on Sept. 9, Cyber Yugoslavia boasts
over 3,500 citizens, and 300 more apply every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost our country in 1991 and became citizens of Atlantis,''
explains the country's webmaster, Zoran Bacic, on the site at
www.juga.com. ``We don't have a physical land, but we do have
nationality.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Internet once again proving it is the last refuge of
the hounded and dispossessed _ not to mention those who refuse to
lose their sense of humor _ adherents to the shattered Yugoslav
dream of democratic pluralism have signed up from across western
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Bacic, for example, lives in the Netherlands. And although
one-third of the citizens are Yugoslav, there are plenty of
non-Slavic names on the list, such as Arthur R. Scott, the
Secretary of Mountains. More than 200 citizens come from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent figures include Milos Vasic, the dissident Belgrade
journalist, who is Secretary for Telling Right from Wrong. Other
portfolios include Ducks, Babes, Brandy, Tavern Philosophy and
Bacchanalias, Coca-Cola, Running Up Stairs, and Everything Else.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective citizens promise to visit the website at least 50
times a year and vote on the ever-evolving constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have five million citizens, we plan to apply to the
U.N. for member status,'' Bacic writes. ``We will ask for 20 square
meters of land to be our country. On this land, we'll keep our
server.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dismayed by the nationalist wars that have dismembered their
country, a group of dissident Yugoslavs have decided to break away
and form their own country _ in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   This week will see the launch of Cyber Yugoslavia, where nobody
gets harassed because of ethnic differences, and every citizen gets
to be a minister: already there is a Secretary for Bad Movies,
another for Kitsch and Triviality and another still for The
Undersexed.
</P>
<P>
   Even before its inauguration on Sept. 9, Cyber Yugoslavia boasts
over 3,500 citizens, and 300 more apply every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost our country in 1991 and became citizens of Atlantis,''
explains the country's webmaster, Zoran Bacic, on the site at
www.juga.com. ``We don't have a physical land, but we do have
nationality.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Internet once again proving it is the last refuge of
the hounded and dispossessed _ not to mention those who refuse to
lose their sense of humor _ adherents to the shattered Yugoslav
dream of democratic pluralism have signed up from across western
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Bacic, for example, lives in the Netherlands. And although
one-third of the citizens are Yugoslav, there are plenty of
non-Slavic names on the list, such as Arthur R. Scott, the
Secretary of Mountains. More than 200 citizens come from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent figures include Milos Vasic, the dissident Belgrade
journalist, who is Secretary for Telling Right from Wrong. Other
portfolios include Ducks, Babes, Brandy, Tavern Philosophy and
Bacchanalias, Coca-Cola, Running Up Stairs, and Everything Else.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective citizens promise to visit the website at least 50
times a year and vote on the ever-evolving constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have five million citizens, we plan to apply to the
U.N. for member status,'' Bacic writes. ``We will ask for 20 square
meters of land to be our country. On this land, we'll keep our
server.'' &QL;

 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For anyone aspiring to public office, and for
television satirists of every hue there is one line that is
guaranteed to raise laughter and cheers across the land. ``It's
high time to get the federal government out of our bathrooms. Let's
get the government out of the toilet!''
</P>
<P>
   If you were wondering what the U.S. federal government, or
indeed any government, was doing there in the first place, listen
to Representative James Traficant, Jr., a Democrat from Ohio, who
is one of several Congressmen to have made the issue his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Speaker,'' he opined, ``a flush is not a flush. The old
standard lavatory flushed away 3.5 gallons of water; so Congress in
its inimitable wisdom passed a new law that said all toilets in
America must use only 1.6 gallons of water. Since then, Americans
are flushing, flushing, flushing like mad, wasting more water than
ever, recklessly trying to remove all of that void.''
</P>
<P>
   That was two years ago, when the then five-year-old law came up
for review. Now, two things _ this summer's drought on the Eastern
Seaboard and a fresh attempt to have the law repealed _ have
flipped open the lavatory lid once again to reveal what every
American has known since 1992 but was too embarrassed to say.
</P>
<P>
   The new toilets don't work, and _ hooray _ it's not just you. If
they don't actually clog up, they don't do _ to put it delicately _
all they are supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   You can gauge the inadequacy of the 1.6 gallon tanks by the
number of bathroom dealers proclaiming in their advertisements that
their particular brand of environmentally responsible new-flush,
low-flow (or ``lo-flo'') lavatory is the only one that will really
do the job.
</P>
<P>
   You can gauge it also by the notes that you find, not just in
restaurants and hotels, but in private homes as well, instructing
you how to flush (hold it down) and what to do it if doesn't work
(try again).
</P>
<P>
   A Michigan builder who testified before Congress last month said
that the size of the lavatory cistern was now an issue whenever he
fitted out a new house.
</P>
<P>
   A plumber admitted ``cannibalizing'' the lavatories from old
houses to install in new ones to get around the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   His Congressman, Joe Knollenberg _ who is sponsoring the bill to
have the law repealed _ said he had received ``thousands'' of
calls, letters and e-mail messages in support.
</P>
<P>
   The really desperate admit to making weekend flits to Canada to
buy non-regulation models from north of the border (where your
cistern can be as big as U.S. ones used to be).
</P>
<P>
   Bathroom shops and warehouses in border towns have risen to the
opportunity, advertising their ``Canadian'' lavatories just past
the frontier post. The ``land of the free'' now boasts a black
market in lavatories whose proportions would not have disgraced the
old Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Lavatories were not the only bathroom equipment to come in for
scrutiny under the 1992 law: national standards were set also for
faucets and for that American staple that was for so long the envy
of visiting Europeans _ the really forceful shower.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a lamentable decline in the pressure of
bathroom showers to the point where they are almost _ dare one say
_ British in their halfheartedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seinfeld,'' the television comedy series (now ended), showed
the characters complaining that the new shower heads just didn't
wash the shampoo out of their hair. (It doesn't necessarily, as I
can vouch, lather the shower gel either).
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the law, of course, was to save water, and money
_ yours and the government's. Water in the U.S. is mostly metered,
so using less of it cuts household bills.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, during the recession, the law also suited plumbers
and bathroom fitters, who took on new business as local authorities
in drought-prone areas offered people financial inducements to
trade in their old toilets for new.
</P>
<P>
   Government calculations held out annual savings from the new
toilets alone of 12,000 gallons of water, up to $50, and plenty of
social and environmental guilt.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's drought does not augur well for this year's
attempt to repeal the bathroom law, even though the number of
congressmen sponsoring the bill has risen to more than 80.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, Americans will probably have no choice but to have
the federal government in their bathrooms for a while longer. And
if they were hoping just to flush it down the you-know-where _
well, now you know why they can't. &QL;

BEIJING CHOOSES A FRENCHMAN'S MODERN DESIGN FOR ITS NATIONAL
THEATER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France)  (lb) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese officials have settled on a stark modern
French design for China's new national theater complex in a
startling denouement to an epic decision-making process that has
lasted 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The design, a titanium and glass bubble-shaped structure that
will sit in the middle of a vast lake and will be entered via an
underwater tunnel, most resembles a giant sleek UFO. Sitting next
to the Greco-Stalinist architecture of Tiananmen Square and
catty-cornered from the Qing facade of the Forbidden City, the new
structure will certainly seem otherworldly.
</P>
<P>
   It will quickly redefine the landscape in the sedate,
conservative political heart of Beijing, adding the first touch of
modern Western architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The selection, which was confirmed by officials at the Chinese
Ministry of Construction and Ministry of Culture, has not been
announced in China. But it is all the buzz among architects, and
many people here have heard at least that a foreign architect has
been chosen for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never expected that a design like this would be selected,
and a foreign design, too,'' said Wang Mingxian, an expert on
architecture in Beijing. ``Initially the fear was that the
selection would be too conservative, but now some people are
worrying that there is not enough attention paid to traditional
architectural relations with other structures.''
</P>
<P>
   The building, designed by Paul Andreu of Paris, was selected
from dozens of entries, about half from Chinese architects, after a
yearlong design competition. It is unclear who gave the final
approval, but Lin Xiaolan of the Ministry of Construction Foreign
Affairs office said the plans were first screened by a group of
architects and then ``submitted to the central leadership for
consideration and approval.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice to erect for the first time a modern Western-style
building as a national landmark and symbol of national pride is
likely to arouse considerable controversy: Patriotic spirit is
running high as China approaches the 50th anniversary of Communist
rule on Oct. 1. And the new theater is more evocative of Disney's
Epcot than of a proud Communist past.
</P>
<P>
   Also a significant anti-Western popular undercurrent had
remained since NATO accidentally bombed the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in May.
</P>
<P>
   But some people pointed out that the ultramodern theater was in
some ways suitable, a symbol of China's ultra-rapid modernization
over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is surprising that this could be chosen, but in a way it
fits,'' said Wu Hung, a professor of art history at the University
at Chicago who is now a visiting scholar in Beijing. ``Beijing is
no longer a traditional city. It is modern and international.
They've been experimenting with modern architecture in other parts
of the city. Now it's broken into Tiananmen Square.''
</P>
<P>
   The government plans to start construction of the new theater
complex in March with the goal of completing it by 2002. The
project, which includes a 2,700-seat opera theater, as well as a
music hall and two smaller theaters, is budgeted at more than $362
million.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators have suggested that the government is delaying
announcement of the plan until after the 50th anniversary
celebrations to avoid igniting popular outrage. But Ms. Lin of the
Construction Ministry said the plans had not yet been announced in
China because ``all of the official procedures have not yet been
competed, and there still may be some amendments.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Prime Minister Chou En-lai first proposed building an opera
house on the site in 1958, and soon after, workers began digging a
foundation. But the plan was then waylaid for the next three
decades, first by politics and later by proposals to build other
government buildings on this prime piece of real estate.
</P>
<P>
   And so for 30 years this parcel of land has been home to a
partly dug pit and an array of small run-down houses. The plan to
build an opera-house complex was last revived in 1997, and the
government organized an invitation-only international design
contest in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the judging, some Chinese architects publicly
criticized the project's extravagant size and cost at a time when
state industries are ailing and unemployment is on the rise. With
the unveiling of the new plan, there are more dissatisfied voices,
with some architects deriding the theater as ``a giant duck's
egg.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wang, the architecture critic, said it was inevitable that
some people would be dissatisfied with the plan, given the
theater's politically and emotionally charged location. ``This
decision is one of the big challenges to architecture in the 20th
century,'' he said. ``Beijing is an ancient capital, so we want
coherence and unity. But it is also an international capital, so we
want it to have a vibrant feel. Those demands create
inconsistencies.''
</P>
<P>
   But the working-class Beijingers who live on the south side of
the future site have more practical concerns. Many residents of the
small Yu Fu area, a tangle of low gray-brick buildings that lack
indoor plumbing, said they had been told they would have to move
next year.
</P>
<P>
   News travels fast in Beijing's old alleyways, and most residents
already knew that a European design had been chosen. A few said
that Beijing did not need an opera house.
</P>
<P>
   But most were speechless when shown a picture of the building
that would someday occupy their space, and whose grand titanium
shell presented such a contrast to their dusty homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing like this in Beijing,'' said a man who gave
only his surname, Xiu. After a bit more contemplation, he added,
``It's pretty, though.''
</P>
<P>
   But others were perplexed by the alien structure. ``Oh, so this
is it,'' said a man named Zou, sunning himself on a ledge outside
the public toilets. He studied the smooth surface of the bubble
dome for several minutes, and then ventured: ``That can't be all.
What goes on top?''

   Saying he brought no ``magic wand,'' he urged political leaders
to seize an opportunity he described as ``the best in many years to
set Northern Ireland on the path to enduring peace and political
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the politicians he will cajole in the weeks to come, he said:
``Each of them sought public office and the power that comes with
it. With that power comes responsibility. At this time and place,
that means having the courage and wisdom to find a way to overcome
the obstacles to implementation of the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal obstacle is the dispute between the Ulster
Unionists, the largest Protestant party, and Sinn Fein, the
political arm of the Irish Republican Army, over whether the new
Northern Ireland Assembly, the power-sharing institution at the
heart of the agreement, can begin to function without the start of
IRA disarmament beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said his review would not renegotiate the original
settlement, but would focus tightly on disarmament methods and
timing and creating the executive Cabinet with members from the
rival parties to run the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his old office in the brick office complex near the
Stormont Parliament buildings that were the scene of the two-year
talks that led to the accord, Mitchell started what will be at
least a month of meetings by ``doing a lot of listening.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would end the talks for this week on Wednesday to
make way for the publication the next day of the report by the
chairman of the Independent Policing Commission, Chris Patten, that
is expected to recommend sweeping changes for the province's force,
the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

   WASHINGTON _ For anyone aspiring to public office, and for
television satirists of every hue there is one line that is
guaranteed to raise laughter and cheers across the land. ``It's
high time to get the federal government out of our bathrooms. Let's
get the government out of the toilet!''
</P>
<P>
   If you were wondering what the U.S. federal government, or
indeed any government, was doing there in the first place, listen
to Representative James Traficant, Jr., a Democrat from Ohio, who
is one of several Congressmen to have made the issue his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Speaker,'' he opined, ``a flush is not a flush. The old
standard lavatory flushed away 3.5 gallons of water; so Congress in
its inimitable wisdom passed a new law that said all toilets in
America must use only 1.6 gallons of water. Since then, Americans
are flushing, flushing, flushing like mad, wasting more water than
ever, recklessly trying to remove all of that void.''
</P>
<P>
   That was two years ago, when the then five-year-old law came up
for review. Now, two things _ this summer's drought on the Eastern
Seaboard and a fresh attempt to have the law repealed _ have
flipped open the lavatory lid once again to reveal what every
American has known since 1992 but was too embarrassed to say.
</P>
<P>
   The new toilets don't work, and _ hooray _ it's not just you. If
they don't actually clog up, they don't do _ to put it delicately _
all they are supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   You can gauge the inadequacy of the 1.6 gallon tanks by the
number of bathroom dealers proclaiming in their advertisements that
their particular brand of environmentally responsible new-flush,
low-flow (or ``lo-flo'') lavatory is the only one that will really
do the job.
</P>
<P>
   You can gauge it also by the notes that you find, not just in
restaurants and hotels, but in private homes as well, instructing
you how to flush (hold it down) and what to do it if doesn't work
(try again).
</P>
<P>
   A Michigan builder who testified before Congress last month said
that the size of the lavatory cistern was now an issue whenever he
fitted out a new house.
</P>
<P>
   A plumber admitted ``cannibalizing'' the lavatories from old
houses to install in new ones to get around the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   His Congressman, Joe Knollenberg _ who is sponsoring the bill to
have the law repealed _ said he had received ``thousands'' of
calls, letters and e-mail messages in support.
</P>
<P>
   The really desperate admit to making weekend flits to Canada to
buy non-regulation models from north of the border (where your
cistern can be as big as U.S. ones used to be).
</P>
<P>
   Bathroom shops and warehouses in border towns have risen to the
opportunity, advertising their ``Canadian'' lavatories just past
the frontier post. The ``land of the free'' now boasts a black
market in lavatories whose proportions would not have disgraced the
old Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Lavatories were not the only bathroom equipment to come in for
scrutiny under the 1992 law: national standards were set also for
faucets and for that American staple that was for so long the envy
of visiting Europeans _ the really forceful shower.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a lamentable decline in the pressure of
bathroom showers to the point where they are almost _ dare one say
_ British in their halfheartedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seinfeld,'' the television comedy series (now ended), showed
the characters complaining that the new shower heads just didn't
wash the shampoo out of their hair. (It doesn't necessarily, as I
can vouch, lather the shower gel either).
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the law, of course, was to save water, and money
_ yours and the government's. Water in the U.S. is mostly metered,
so using less of it cuts household bills.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, during the recession, the law also suited plumbers
and bathroom fitters, who took on new business as local authorities
in drought-prone areas offered people financial inducements to
trade in their old toilets for new.
</P>
<P>
   Government calculations held out annual savings from the new
toilets alone of 12,000 gallons of water, up to $50, and plenty of
social and environmental guilt.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's drought does not augur well for this year's
attempt to repeal the bathroom law, even though the number of
congressmen sponsoring the bill has risen to more than 80.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, Americans will probably have no choice but to have
the federal government in their bathrooms for a while longer. And
if they were hoping just to flush it down the you-know-where _
well, now you know why they can't. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think that Y2K is a brand of cereal, you are seriously
behind the curve. America is rapidly going millennium-mad, stocking
up on all the elements for a good party: guns, dried food and
honey.
</P>
<P>
   The bullets are just in case everything goes wrong and the
arrival of Y2K sends every computer in the country into a flat
spin, triggering a temporary breakdown in social order.
</P>
<P>
   The dried food and the honey are perhaps even more worrying.
Many Americans fear that when the screens darken, the country will
be plunged into food shortages.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one group of people seems particularly keen to fill
the larder with cartons of 9mm hollow-point bullets and a little
something: computer programmers.
</P>
<P>
   America has always taken the millennium bug more seriously than
other countries. Concern has gone into overdrive in the last
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The new status symbol is to be spending New Year's Eve at home:
it means you are critical personnel forbidden to travel and that
you may be needed on the Big Day. If your boss has told you it's
fine to go parascending on Pitcairn Island it may be time to start
looking at the small ads.
</P>
<P>
   But with this fascination goes fear, and in America fear means a
lightweight item with a 30-round magazine and a fiberglass stock.
</P>
<P>
   Religious, right-wing and survivalist groups have been advising
America for some time to stock up on the ``Four Bs: bullets,
bandages, beans and Bibles,'' as one website puts it.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just hard-core survivalists who are getting ready
to lock and load: there has been a noticeable boom in sales of guns
and ammunition this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jordan of the Winchester company said ``sales are
thriving.'' For the first time in years, the industry raised gun
prices earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sales are through specialist firms set up to prepare
for the millennial market. David Goodyear created Bread and Lead in
Oregon (motto: ``Nothing concentrates the mind like the prospect of
death'') specifically to cater for Y2K demand, and he said business
is booming.
</P>
<P>
   But general dealers are also doing well. Darren at All-American
Guns in Virginia said there has been a surge since mid-February.
Highly popular products have been ``military-style firearms'' and
``home defense weapons,'' especially the AR-15 (Armalite) rifle.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of ammunition sales has risen steadily since last
year and ``sales of case lots have risen noticeably,'' said Al
Russo of Remington.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K is definitely a factor, though he also points to the booming
economy and fears that new gun legislation would clamp down on
sales. But he also notes that the camping and survival industries
are also doing very well. ``They are experiencing good times; you
can't buy dry foods anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   If gun sales have been going nicely, sales of dried foods and
other survivalist rations _ what one paper called ``Apocalypse
Chow'' _ have exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Point, which makes military-style Meals Ready to Eat
(MREs) saw a 500 percent increase in sales in the first quarter of
the year as people turned their thoughts from having a few people
around for lunch to fighting off the neighbors with a semiautomatic
and some antipersonnel devices.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the key to the smiles on the faces of some
beekeepers. Honey keeps well, can be used as a sweetener, on bread
or in drinks, and is ideal for stockpiling, so many people
concerned about impending social collapse have been buying it in
large quantities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the few commodities where the consumer can go
directly to the producer,'' said Paul Hendricks, a beekeeper from
Denver. ``It keeps well, and it doesn't matter if you don't have
heat or refrigeration.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike MREs, it is also nice to eat. (Winnie the Pooh knew this:
when the Hundred Acre Wood was flooded, he sat it out in a tree
with several jars of ``hunny'' _ but he left his M-16 at home.)
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales of honey in the U.S. were up by between 10 and 20
percent in the first four months of the year, and bulk sales were
up by a similar amount _ about a million pounds of honey a month.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Adee, a honey producer from South Dakota, toured Y2K
shows across America and found demand heaviest in Denver, Colo., in
the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some places they bought cases,'' he said, with people carrying
away 60-lb. boxes. ``For a family, that's quite a bit of honey.''
Perhaps most worryingly, ``a lot of them were computer people.''
</P>
<P>
   The boom in gun sales in northern Virginia also seems to reflect
the desire of the area's high-tech workers to tool up _ and we are
not talking about a Phillips screwdriver. &QL;

   London: A Changed Thames and a Millennium Dome
</P>
<P>
   By WARREN HOGE
</P>
<P>
   Down by the riverside is not a place that Londoners and tourists
have made much of until now. Twentieth-century London largely
turned its back on the Thames, leaving the shoreline hostage to
shipping, warehouses, dreary postwar housing projects and
dereliction. But all that has changed dramatically with the coming
of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Britain will celebrate the event on New Year's Eve with the
opening of the huge $1.2 billion riverside structure called the
Millennium Dome. It sits astride the First Meridian at Greenwich,
where time is said to begin, and will house under its
record-setting 20-acre roof a world's fairlike pageant showcasing
21st-century Britain. It will also anchor the far-flung development
of the river that makes the Thames suddenly the place to see and be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   The old Bankside power station is undergoing a $210 million
refurbishment to become the Bankside branch of the Tate Gallery,
scheduled to open in May. Next door is Shakespeare's Globe, the
open-air Elizabethan-style theater that made its debut in 1997
presenting Shakespeare plays in authentic settings. The South Bank
Center, billed as Europe's largest culture complex, has spruced up
its riverfront promenades and taken down the concrete walkways that
used to make going to concerts and theater there like a visit to a
penitentiary.
</P>
<P>
   A 450-foot Ferris wheel, promising 25-mile views over the city
from its 32 enclosed capsules, is being mounted on the shoreline
near the South Bank Center, and a $25 million bridge, the first to
be built over the river since the construction of Tower Bridge in
1894 and the only one devoted solely to pedestrians, will connect
the Tate Bankside with St. Paul's Cathedral. The span's designer is
Sir Norman Foster, Britain's most famous architect, whose passion
for the river is such that when he was ennobled this year he chose
the title Lord Foster of Thameside.
</P>
<P>
   The dome is the creation of London's other marquee architect,
Richard Rogers, who when he became a peer called himself Lord
Rogers of Riverside. Lord Foster has also designed a glass-encased
new riverfront home for London's soon-to-be first elected mayor and
a vast and sleek new subway station for the extended Underground
line. It will connect the city center with the Canary Wharf complex
on an old dockside area in East London that has become a financial
center; the line will then continue on to the Millennium Dome.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that kept people away from the water in London was
that it was hard to get to. The subway line will help address the
problem, and so will a number of new riverboats and renovated piers
being introduced this year. White Horse Fast Ferries has been
running boats since June from the Embankment across from the South
Bank Center to Canary Wharf and in the year to come will add other
city stops and a shuttle to the Millennium Dome. City Cruises has
started circular runs between five piers with a jump-on, jump-off
service that allows passengers to wander around all these new
shoreline attractions.
</P>
<P>
   A booklet called ``Thames River Services _ Times and Fares'' is
available free from any central London Underground station;
schedule information is available by calling (44-171) 222-1234.

   Amsterdam: Van Gogh's Museum, Rembrandt's House
</P>
<P>
   By MARLISE SIMONS
</P>
<P>
   People apparently cannot get enough of Vincent van Gogh's
vibrant and enigmatic work, and the museum dedicated to him in
Amsterdam opened a whole new wing in June to please the unending
stream of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The striking annex adds an architectural thrill and a new sense
of vitality to the home of the world's largest van Gogh collection.
Now there is room for display of the more than 200 paintings the
museum owns while the extra space makes it possible to put on
related temporary shows.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdamers make up only a small portion of the museum's 1.2
million annual visitors. But many have joined the passionate
arguments about the new annex, a striking appearance on the
otherwise staid Museum Square. For the $21 million building, the
Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa used forms and materials that
look like nothing else in Amsterdam; he made a curving facade of
granite, put titanium on the convex roof and lined protrusions from
the wall in aluminum. The main building from 1973 has itself had a
$14.5 million overhaul, with new lighting, air-conditioning,
offices, a more spacious lobby and the inevitable, sprawling gift
shop. A series of ambitious shows have been planned, mostly dealing
with 19th-century themes to provide the context in which the artist
lived. One, for example, will examine the impact of gaslight and
electricity on 19th-century culture.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gogh Museum, 7 Paulus Potter Street; (31-20) 5705200. Open
daily. Admission $6.10.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, the refurbished quarters of the Netherlands' other
great artistic icon, Rembrandt, are ready and will reopen for
visitors on Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The master's house, built in 1606, and one of the finest
examples of a 17th-century Dutch bourgeois home, was closed a year
ago to return it as much as possible to its original state. The
house had been adapted and transformed early this century when it
became a museum, but restorers have now brought back 17th-century
furniture and stripped away the wood paneling to make it look again
like the home it was. Walls and ceilings are now in the original
ocher yellow and burgundy. The second-foor artist's studio has
been given leaded windows, similar to those Rembrandt drew of his
own workplace. The curators painstakingly uncovered fireplaces,
brought back ancient tiles and put in box beds, one of them after
Rembrandt's own rendering of his wife, Saskia, in bed.
</P>
<P>
   The results are handsome and have an air of authenticity.
Although the objects in the house are not Rembrandt's own _ he went
bankrupt and all his belongings were confiscated and scattered _
the curators are proud of the result because they begged and
borrowed furniture, tiles and other accouterments of the era from a
range of Dutch museums.
</P>
<P>
   Until Jan. 9, the Rembrandt House will show ``Rembrandt's
Treasures,'' a display of the type of artifacts the painter
collected, including costumes, helmets, shells, musical instruments
and porcelain. Where possible, the exhibition will show how
Rembrandt used these and similar objects as props in his own work.
Rembrandt House, 4-6 Jodenbree Street; (31-20) 5200400. Open daily.
Admission $6.10 for regular visits, $8.55 for special exhibits.

   Moscow: A Welcoming Setting for Appreciating Pushkin
</P>
<P>
   By CELESTINE BOHLEN
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be Russian or a fanatic about Aleksandr
Pushkin, the beloved 19th-century poet, to enjoy the ample and
elegant museum dedicated to his life, his times and his work,
situated in a stately mansion in the heart of Moscow. Having
recently completed a three-year renovation, the museum, with a
glass-covered atrium at its center, is an oasis of a Russia that
disappeared after the 1917 revolution, a Russia of country estates
and musical evenings, of ball gowns and card games, with an
intriguing collection of Pushkiniana sprinkled throughout.
</P>
<P>
   There is a charming portrait of the poet as a 3-year-old in a
room decorated with the toys and memorabilia of aristocratic
children of his generation. And there is his death mask in a room
dedicated to the final year of his life, including the letters and
manuscripts found on his desk in his house in St. Petersburg on the
day he was fatally wounded in a duel at age 37.
</P>
<P>
   But the museum offers more in its 15-room exposition space,
spread across the early 19th century mansion _ a smattering of
antiques, portraits of famous Russians known to Pushkin, prints and
engravings showing Russia's two principal cities and its lush
countryside as they looked at the beginning of the last century.
With loving and exacting detail, restorers added chandeliers,
finely made curtains _ one set recently inspired a visiting member
of the British royal family to take measurements to copy at home _
and costumes of the period, which adorn life-size figures that
stand waiting to join the dancing in the ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   After its restoration, the State Museum of A.S. Pushkin (not to
be confused with Moscow's Pushkin Fine Arts Museum) is also a rare
example of a Russian cultural institution that is ready to meet the
demands of the late-20th-century tourist. In winter, the atrium
offers visitors a refuge from the cold; there is a basement cafe
and a 250-seat hall that is host to concerts and literary evenings.
This fall, a children's center will open, offering plays and games
designed to bring the poet and his works _ many of which were based
on Russian fairy tales _ back to life. Future projects include
plans to restore the garden, to open a bookshop and to allow the
public, by appointment, to visit rare collections of books and
porcelains donated by Pushkin lovers over the years.
</P>
<P>
   All this adds up to an open and welcoming atmosphere, made
complete by a well-informed staff that likes nothing better than to
plunge into detailed accounts of Pushkin's life, poetry, friends
and loves. There is one English-speaking guide who can help
non-Russian speakers soak up the enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, which stretches the length of a city block, is on
the corner of Prichistenko Street and Khrushchevski pereulok
(Lane), named after the family that built the original mansion. It
is open 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day except Mondays and the last
Friday of the month. The price of a ticket is 10 rubles (about 40
cents), and in a rare victory for equal rights in a city that often
takes advantage of foreign tourists, is the same for foreigners as
it is for Russians.

<P>
   If you think that Y2K is a brand of cereal, you are seriously
behind the curve. America is rapidly going millennium-mad, stocking
up on all the elements for a good party: guns, dried food and
honey.
</P>
<P>
   The bullets are just in case everything goes wrong and the
arrival of Y2K sends every computer in the country into a flat
spin, triggering a temporary breakdown in social order.
</P>
<P>
   The dried food and the honey are perhaps even more worrying.
Many Americans fear that when the screens darken, the country will
be plunged into food shortages.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one group of people seems particularly keen to fill
the larder with cartons of 9mm hollow-point bullets and a little
something: computer programmers.
</P>
<P>
   America has always taken the millennium bug more seriously than
other countries. Concern has gone into overdrive in the last
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The new status symbol is to be spending New Year's Eve at home:
it means you are critical personnel forbidden to travel and that
you may be needed on the Big Day. If your boss has told you it's
fine to go parascending on Pitcairn Island it may be time to start
looking at the small ads.
</P>
<P>
   But with this fascination goes fear, and in America fear means a
lightweight item with a 30-round magazine and a fiberglass stock.
</P>
<P>
   Religious, right-wing and survivalist groups have been advising
America for some time to stock up on the ``Four Bs: bullets,
bandages, beans and Bibles,'' as one website puts it.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just hard-core survivalists who are getting ready
to lock and load: there has been a noticeable boom in sales of guns
and ammunition this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jordan of the Winchester company said ``sales are
thriving.'' For the first time in years, the industry raised gun
prices earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sales are through specialist firms set up to prepare
for the millennial market. David Goodyear created Bread and Lead in
Oregon (motto: ``Nothing concentrates the mind like the prospect of
death'') specifically to cater for Y2K demand, and he said business
is booming.
</P>
<P>
   But general dealers are also doing well. Darren at All-American
Guns in Virginia said there has been a surge since mid-February.
Highly popular products have been ``military-style firearms'' and
``home defense weapons,'' especially the AR-15 (Armalite) rifle.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of ammunition sales has risen steadily since last
year and ``sales of case lots have risen noticeably,'' said Al
Russo of Remington.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K is definitely a factor, though he also points to the booming
economy and fears that new gun legislation would clamp down on
sales. But he also notes that the camping and survival industries
are also doing very well. ``They are experiencing good times; you
can't buy dry foods anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   If gun sales have been going nicely, sales of dried foods and
other survivalist rations _ what one paper called ``Apocalypse
Chow'' _ have exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Point, which makes military-style Meals Ready to Eat
(MREs) saw a 500 percent increase in sales in the first quarter of
the year as people turned their thoughts from having a few people
around for lunch to fighting off the neighbors with a semiautomatic
and some antipersonnel devices.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the key to the smiles on the faces of some
beekeepers. Honey keeps well, can be used as a sweetener, on bread
or in drinks, and is ideal for stockpiling, so many people
concerned about impending social collapse have been buying it in
large quantities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the few commodities where the consumer can go
directly to the producer,'' said Paul Hendricks, a beekeeper from
Denver. ``It keeps well, and it doesn't matter if you don't have
heat or refrigeration.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike MREs, it is also nice to eat. (Winnie the Pooh knew this:
when the Hundred Acre Wood was flooded, he sat it out in a tree
with several jars of ``hunny'' _ but he left his M-16 at home.)
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales of honey in the U.S. were up by between 10 and 20
percent in the first four months of the year, and bulk sales were
up by a similar amount _ about a million pounds of honey a month.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Adee, a honey producer from South Dakota, toured Y2K
shows across America and found demand heaviest in Denver, Colo., in
the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some places they bought cases,'' he said, with people carrying
away 60-lb. boxes. ``For a family, that's quite a bit of honey.''
Perhaps most worryingly, ``a lot of them were computer people.''
</P>
<P>
   The boom in gun sales in northern Virginia also seems to reflect
the desire of the area's high-tech workers to tool up _ and we are
not talking about a Phillips screwdriver. &QL;

   Madrid: Renovated Galleries, a New Spot for Tapas
</P>
<P>
   By AL GOODMAN
</P>
<P>
   The Prado Museum inaugurated in July its ``definitive'' hanging
of its unmatched collection of Velazquez paintings, in preparation
for a winter exhibition celebrating the 400th anniversary of his
birth.
</P>
<P>
   The five renovated Velazquez galleries have new illumination,
including more natural light, and gold-colored wall coverings
replace the former dark red. Now, the 1656 masterpiece ``Las
Meninas'' (The Maids of Honor), depicting King Philip IV's family,
again dominates the semicircular Gallery XII, which is exclusively
Velazquez.
</P>
<P>
   Prado Museum, Paseo del Prado, (34) 91-330-2800, closed Monday.
Adult admission is $3.20.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Across town at the majestic Plaza de Oriente, which boasts the
Royal Palace and the Teatro Real opera house, a plaque at No. 3
marks the former buildings where Velazquez lived and painted ``Las
Meninas.'' Next door, at No. 4, is a new tapas and wine bar, La
Botilleria, whose owners also run the venerable Cafe de Oriente, at
No. 2. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   La Botilleria, (34) 91-548-4620, with classic dark wooden tables
and green leather benches and chairs, serves 125 Spanish wines and
pours a dozen by the glass daily, from $1.60 to $4. Tapas include
the tartaleta de txangurro, a spider crab pate on a pastry for
$2.60. A light meal with wine is about $20. Open weekdays 8:30 a.m.
to 1:30 a.m. weekends 9 a.m. to 2:30 a.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs is El Aljibe, (34) 91-548-4620, a new bar
specializing in cocktails and fancy coffees. Its floor of thick,
well-lighted glass strikingly reveals underneath it the remains of
the city's medieval Arabic stone wall. The decor includes Arabic
tapestries and archways. Open daily from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Madrid's newest luxury hotel, the 32-room Hotel Orfila, is also
among the smallest. The Orfila, 6 Calle Orfila, (34) 91-702-7770,
fax (34) 91-702-7772, a 20-minute walk from the Prado, occupies a
cream-colored 1885 stone building that was the home of a wealthy
family. Horse-drawn carriages used to pull into a courtyard that is
now the lobby. Each room in the six-story hotel has distinctive
antique furnishings. There is a restaurant and 24-hour room
service. Doubles start at $290.
</P>
<P>
   For a new view of Madrid, visitors can board one of a small
fleet of yellow double-decker buses, with roofless upper decks,
operated by Sol Opentours, (34) 91-522-1120. They do not provide
guided tours but instead make a continuous 90-minute daily circuit
of Old Madrid, stopping to take on or drop off passengers at 15
locations, including the Prado and the Plaza de Ramales, a block
from the Plaza de Oriente, from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. One-day tickets
cost $10.30.

   Paris: A Gondola View and an Advertising Museum
</P>
<P>
   By ALAN RIDING
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors come to Paris simply to look at it, and where
better to do so than the viewing platforms at the Arc de Triomphe,
the Georges Pompidou Center (which reopens on Jan. 1 after
renovation), and, of course, the Eiffel Tower? Now, as part of
millennium celebrations through the end of next year, the city's
rooftops and monuments can be seen from a new angle. Four times an
hour, a gondola attached to a large tethered balloon rises 490 feet
above the Parc Andre Citroen, beside the Seine in western Paris.
And, yes, the view is spectacular, weather permitting.
</P>
<P>
   As the giant balloon rises silently, familiar sights come into
focus: the Bois de Boulogne, the Arc de Triomphe, the high rises of
the Defense business district, the Sacre-Coeur presiding over
Montmartre, the Tuileries Gardens, the Eiffel Tower, the golden
dome of Les Invalides and the embarrassingly ugly Tour
Montparnasse. Slicing through Paris is the Seine, with its barges
and tourist boats. And immediately below is the Parc Andre Citroen
itself, one of the city's most beautiful new landscaped spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there is no chance of floating away. The cheerfully
decorated yellow helium balloon, 105 feet high and 71 feet in
diameter, is attached to the ground by a thick cable that allows it
to rise (helium being lighter than air) and then winches it down.
At present, the gondola reaches the same level as the second
platform of the Eiffel Tower, but the balloon's organizers are
awaiting permission for it to climb to 980 feet. The open-air
gondola, with room for 30 adults or 60 children, sways gently but
not alarmingly: no ``flights'' are permitted when the wind is
stronger than 25 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Parc Andre Citroen, 2 Rue de la Montagne de la Fage; (33-1)
44.26.20.00. Metro stop Javel Andre Citroen or Balard, or shuttle
boat ($5.80 round trip) from the Eiffel Tower. Open daily 9 a.m. to
9 p.m. in summer; 9 a.m. to sundown the rest of the year. Admission
$11.
</P>
<P>
   In this city of museums, there is also always something new in
the air. On Nov. 18, a Museum of Advertising, claiming to be the
first of its kind in the world, will open as part of the Musee des
Arts Decoratifs in the Rohan Wing of the Palais du Louvre. The
museum has a vast collection of advertising posters dating to the
18th century as well as film, TV and radio commercials from the
1930's to today. And the interior has been designed by the French
architect Jean Nouvel to be cutting-edge, both through inter-active
screens and displays of avant-garde video techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Palais du Louvre, 107 Rue de Rivoli, Paris 75001; (33-1)
44.55.57.50. Open Tuesday through Sunday, closed Monday. Admission
prices not yet determined.

   Berlin: Century of Art, Up-to-the-Minute Dining
</P>
<P>
   By ROGER COHEN
</P>
<P>
   It is now a decade since the Berlin wall fell, time enough for
the tremendous discharge of energy resulting from this city's
unification to find expression in a host of new museums,
restaurants and developments occupying the space that was long the
cold wilderness of Europe's fault line. To wander this area is to
discover Berlin's essential fascination: the city's restless flux.
</P>
<P>
   From a disused railroad station that once abutted the west side
of the wall, the Hamburger Bahnhof museum of contemporary art
emerged three years ago. As bold in conception as that other
junction-turned-gallery, the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, it has a
remarkable collection, including some of the finest works of Joseph
Beuys and Anselm Kiefer.
</P>
<P>
   From Sept. 4 until early next year, the museum will house part
of a show called ``The 20th Century: A Century of Art in Germany''
that is as ambitious as the Whitney's current evocation of the
American century. The Bahnhof exhibition, ``Collage-Montage,''
groups works using these techniques by artists including Jean Arp,
Oskar Schlemmer and Jean Tinguely. Other parts of the show are at
the Altes Museum (``The Power of Art'') and the Neue
National-galerie (``Spirit and Matter''). From Beckmann to
Baselitz, nothing has been omitted.
</P>
<P>
   Hamburger Bahnhof, 50-51 Invalidenstrasse, Tiergarten district;
Altes Museum, Am Lustgarten, Mitte district; Neue Nationalgalerie,
Matthaikirchplatz, Tiergarten district. All open Tuesday to Sunday.
Admission $6.70 at each museum or $11.10 combined entry. Telephone
for all three: (49-30) 266-2690 or 266-2651.
</P>
<P>
   Just to the east of where the wall stood, the area called Mitte
is still very much a construction site. Restaurants, clubs and bars
open daily, burying without trace the drab uniformity and culinary
stodginess of the former East German state. Try Cantamaggio, where
Italian generosity in the kitchen meets German minimalist design;
Angela Giampa of Como and Noemi Anastasi of Genoa prepare their own
pasta and it is memorable. The bar is always packed.
</P>
<P>
   On the banks of the Spree, the Standige Vertretung, or Permanent
Representation (as the West German diplomatic presence in the East
was once called), has become an institution in less than two years.
The restaurant serves such German classics as knuckle of pork and,
on a lighter note, delectable Flammekuchen, thinly rolled,
flame-cooked dough covered with anything from ham and onions to
perch. With them, beers from east or west, perhaps a Kostritzer
from Saxony or a Cologne lager, Kolsch.
</P>
<P>
   Cantamaggio, 4 Alte Schonhauser Strasse; (49-30) 283-1895.
Standige Vertretung, 8 Schiffbauerdamm; (49-30) 282-3965.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest single development on the former no man's land
between East and West is the Potsdamer Platz, the heart of prewar
Berlin. Lacking grandeur and unabashedly commercial _ a McDonald's
and a Tony Roma's are prominent _ it has proved hugely popular. A
Walt Disney musical, ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame,'' whose world
premiere took place here in June, is proving a big attraction. The
theater stands on a part of the development called the
Marlene-Dietrich-Platz. Although this is still a more provincial
place than in the time of its most famous daughter, the message of
such lavish productions is clear enough: Berlin rising.
</P>
<P>
   Musical Theater Berlin, 1 Marlene-Dietrich-Platz; (49-180)
54-444. Tickets, $44 to $97.

   Rome: Modern Art in a City of the Ancient
</P>
<P>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, all roads seem to lead to ruins. By the time a visitor
has toured the Colosseum, stumbled around the stones and columns of
the Forum, and inspected the newly restored Nero's palace, the
Domus Aurea, there is often little energy left to explore
Renaissance palaces, let alone 19th- and 20th-century art
collections.
</P>
<P>
   Which is too bad, because one of the most pleasant museums in
Rome is the National Gallery of Modern Art, an imposing white
marble building overlooking the Villa Borghese. Over the last few
years, the gallery has undergone an extensive renovation, which is
almost complete, and which already offers visitors a beautifully
displayed introduction to Italian art from the 1780s through the
present, from Antonio Canova, the 18th-century sculptor, to Lucio
Fontana, one of Italy's best-known modern artists.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the museum reopened its collection of 1950s and 1960s
artworks, offering a rare chance to see Op Art Italian-style, as
well as the works of Alberto Burri, who was one of the first in
Italy to use ordinary objects, like gunnysacks, to create art. Many
tourists believe that great Italian art ended with Bernini. Here,
without waiting in long lines, they can see conceptual art and
contemporary installations usually associated with New York or
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   By Dec. 15, the last renovation of the wing that contains art
dating from 1911 to 1945 should be complete. That part of the
collection includes well-known works by Giorgio de Chirico and
Giorgio Morandi and the Italian futurists Giacomo Balla and Umberto
Boccioni.
</P>
<P>
   The museum also has a collection of non-Italian works, including
two Van Goghs that were stolen in 1998 but returned, and a Gustav
Klimt.
</P>
<P>
   Set inside the vast public park known as Villa Borghese, the
museum is only a few minutes' walk from Villa Giulia, one of the
most important collections of Etruscan art in the world. It is also
close to the recently reopened and very popular Galleria
Bor- &QC; ghese, where Canova's scandalous nude sculpture of Pauline

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Islamic rebels continued their assault on Dagestan on
Monday, spurring fears that the Kremlin might lose control of the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic militants have seized six villages in western
Dagestan, including Novolakskoye. Fourteen Russian troops were
killed on Sunday in fighting in that region.
</P>
<P>
   More rebels were reported to be massing on the Chechen-Dagestan
border. Some experts worried that even the Dagestan capital,
Makhachkala, might not be safe from attack.
</P>
<P>
   All of Dagestan seemed to be vulnerable after a bomb attack
Saturday night at a housing complex for military officers and their
families in Buinaksk, Dagestan's second largest city. Monday, the
death toll from the Buinaksk bombing rose to 52, and it could rise
again since rescuers are still combing through the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The dire reports from Dagestan are a marked turnabout from two
weeks ago, when the Russian military proclaimed that it had the
rebels on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the Russian military's initial success led it to
make several blunders, including switching the focus of its efforts
in Dagestan away from repelling Islamic rebel incursions across the
border with Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody could have expected this even three months ago,'' said
Emil Pain, who served as an adviser to President Boris Yeltsin on
Chechnya. ``But it has taken place, and the likelihood of the very
worst scenarios is extremely high.''
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Seleznyov, the Communist speaker of Parliament, signaled
that the debate over Dagestan had taken a partisan turn when he
vowed to begin a parliamentary inquiry, saying Russia's
intelligence services and forces had failed to anticipate the rebel
campaign against Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed the rebels' invasion into Dagestan altogether,'' he
said. ``Prevention is not part of our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Yeltsin said the Russian leader might address
Parliament on the issue. The president, he said, believes that the
fighting in Dagestan is a ``real threat to the integrity of
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   But the initial sense here was that the Russian government,
already distracted by allegations of scandal and by maneuvering
over next year's presidential elections, had been caught off guard
and had no ready response to re-establish order in the northern
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in Dagestan began last month when Islamic rebels
crossed into the Botlikh region of the Russian republic from
Chechnya, vowing to create an Islamic state.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They were led by Shamil Basayev, a Chechen commander, and
Khattab, a Jordanian-born Chechen. After several weeks, the rebels
appeared to have been beaten back. The Russian military declared
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Russian military switched its strategy. Instead of
trying to consolidate its control of the border region and of
western Dagestan, it began a campaign against several villages
controlled by the Wahhabi sect in central Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   The Wahhabis, an Islamic sect, had enjoyed relative autonomy and
were thought to have some sympathy for the Chechen-based rebels.
But they had not emerged as a major threat to the authorities in
Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Vowing to bring the Wahhabis to heel, the Russian military
assaulted their villages, Karamakhi and Chabanmakhi, which are
southwest of Makhachkaka.
</P>
<P>
   Pain, the former Yeltsin adviser, argued Monday that this was a
mistake. For one thing, he said, the assault was more likely to
turn people against the Dagestani authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``People turn to Wahhabism not because they are seeking out the
details of Islam,'' he said. ``They turn to it for protection. With
attack aircraft you cannot halt such a movement. You only make it
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Pain speculated that the Russian military might have been
influenced by Dagestani authorities eager to reassert their control
over some of the more prosperous Wahhabi-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
   The military's concentration on the Wahhabis also distracted it
from the fragile peace in western Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military was surprised this weekend when about 1,000
militants left their bases in Chechnya and crossed into Dagestan
again, according to Russian news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Russian warplanes pounded targets along the
Dagestan-Chechen border and, according to the Chechens, villages
inside Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most intense fighting centered on a group of 50
policeman who found themselves surrounded by the rebels in western
Dagestan. Cut off and low on ammunition, the police mounted a
desperate fight. Finally, they broke through the militants' lines,
helped by the arrival of reinforcements.

`HITLER'S NIECE': UNCLE ALF, IN LOVE WITH HIS PRINCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   She called him Uncle Alf, he called her Princess. He would later
declare that she was the only woman he ever loved. For two years
the pair shared a house in Munich; then, in September 1931, she was
found dead in the apartment, a gunshot wound in her chest, an
apparent suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Though there were rumors of sexual perversion and whispered talk
of murder, Geli Raubal's death did not derail her uncle's rise to
political power. Hitler would not die for another 14 years, when he
committed suicide in his bunker below the garden of the Reich
chancellery in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Hitler and Geli Raubal _ the daughter
of his half-sister, Angela _ has long been the subject of
speculation among biographers and historians seeking a psychosexual
explanation for the sources of the Fuehrer's evil.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest novel Ron Hansen mixes historical fact and
imaginative speculation to try to flesh out the story of Hitler and
his niece. The resulting story not only lacks the subtle narrative
skills displayed in this author's earlier books (``Marietta in
Ecstasy,'' ``Nebraska'') but also trivializes Hitler's historical
crimes by dwelling, pruriently, on his private foibles.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent effort to convey Geli's point of view, Hansen
writes much of this novel from a deliberately naive perspective.
The problem with this approach is that Hitler and his Nazi henchmen
emerge, in the first portion of the book, as bizarrely comic
figures, narcissistic oddballs, whose biggest sins are egomania and
self-absorption. Hitler's idea of flirtation is to boast about
himself and his destiny, while ``Doktor Goebbels was like Hitler in
thinking the highest order of entertainment was his talking about
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen's Hitler is a mama's boy who likes to be coddled by
women. He likes peanut butter sandwiches, has bad manners and worst
taste (his country house features such wall decorations as a
picture of ``three jolly fat men hoisting steins of foaming beer''
and ``a lantern that when lit depicted a little boy urinating'').
</P>
<P>
   This Hitler is given to terrible mood swings, and like Dr. Evil
in the Austin Powers movies, he sucks his pinkie when he's nervous.
As a suitor he's comically inept. When he and Geli take a walk
through the beautiful German countryside, she looks to him, hoping
he'll tell her he loves her. Instead he tries out a line of newly
penned verse: ``And high above the world,'' he says, ``on the cold
fastness of the Kehlstein, I feed the needy flames of my hate.''
</P>
<P>
   We're told that Goebbels' ``huge and luminous black eyes''
betrayed ``an aching to charm and fascinate''; that Goering was ``a
fattish but still fairly handsome Nordic he-man''; that Himmler had
a moist handshake and radiated ``a fearsome seething and
contempt.'' Of Hitler his sister observes: ``The family always,
always underestimated him. No wonder he was so distant.''
</P>
<P>
   As the novel progresses, Hansen's Hitler inexplicably
metamorphosizes from an awkward, self-conscious outsider into a
charismatic politician, sought after by women, and worshiped by
colleagues. His relationship with Geli (who was 19 years his
junior) also changes as she grows up. From a watchful father figure
he becomes a smarmy suitor and eventually a wildly jealous and
possessive warden.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen's Geli, too, undergoes a sea change. Initially she comes
across as a very ordinary teen-ager, spirited, giggly and
irreverent. She mocks her uncle's politics, flirts with his friends
and dreams of getting married and becoming a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Her attitude toward her uncle is ambivalent: on one hand, she
cherishes the power she exerts over him and resents his new
friendship with Eva Braun; on the other, she knows her uncle has
driven away all her suitors and she longs for the freedom she has
lost. As Hitler's sexual demands on her become increasingly
importunate, she comes to resemble her captor _ moody, petulant and
angry _ and she also secretly begins to plot her escape.
</P>
<P>
   This evolving relationship between Geli and her uncle is laid
out by Hansen in clumsy, stage-managed scenes. He lards his
narrative with awkward exposition detailing Hitler's political
machinations and he resorts to increasingly cloying, melodramatic
prose. He describes how Hitler's glare swung toward a friend ``like
a farmer's scythe in wheat,'' and how Goering wept uncontrollably,
like ``a planet of grief.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hansen acknowledges in an afterword, he has also freely
invented ``intimate moments'' in Hitler's life. In what amounts to
a highly speculative extrapolation of existing evidence and
historical gossip, Hansen portrays Hitler forcing Geli to engage in
kinky, incestuous sex.
</P>
<P>
   He gives us graphic scenes in which Hitler commands his niece to
pose for him nude, molests her sexually and compels her to perform
degrading acts. ``You hate! You destroy!'' Hansen's Geli screams at
her uncle. ``You'll do to Germany just what you're doing to me!''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt such graphic scenes depicting Hitler as a sexual
monster are meant to link a perverse sexual psychopathology with
his abhorrent politics, but they end up distracting attention from
Hitler's public crimes, crimes that tragically were not the
speculative imaginings of a novelist, crimes that have been
consigned to the margins of this inept and voyeuristic novel.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When American bomb makers began visiting China in 1979, they
were startled by increasingly pointed questions that suggested
their Chinese peers were hot on the trail of the secret to building
a modern nuclear arsenal. The breakthrough allows H-bombs to be
made so small that many can fit atop a single missile or be fired
from trucks, submarines and other mobile platforms.
</P>
<P>
   China succeeded on Sept. 25, 1992, according to a spy who told
his American handlers that Beijing had exploded a bomb based on the
miniaturization secret.
</P>
<P>
   A team of scientists at the Los Alamos weapons laboratory in New
Mexico set to work on a whodunit with huge potential implications:
Was China's advance the result of espionage, hard work or some mix
of the two?
</P>
<P>
   Today, the debate rages on. Experts agree that spying occurred,
but clash violently on how much was stolen and what impact it had
on Beijing's advance, if any.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos team concluded in 1995 that China's stride was
probably based on espionage. A report this year by a congressional
committee that made the case public went further, claiming that it
would have been ``virtually impossible'' for China to have made
small warheads ``without the nuclear secrets stolen from the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional report unleashed a torrent of criticism from
scientists inside and outside the government who said the
importance of the espionage was overstated, and that China could
well have achieved the breakthrough on its own, as it insists
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   A review of the dispute, based on months of interviews and
disclosures of weapon and intelligence secrets, suggests that the
congressional report went beyond the evidence in asserting that
stolen secrets were the main reason for China's breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   The review also bolsters an important point of agreement among
feuding experts: that the federal investigation focused too soon on
the Los Alamos National Laboratory and one worker there, Wen Ho
Lee, who was fired for security violations. The lost secrets, it
now appears, were available to hundreds and perhaps thousands of
individuals scattered throughout the nation's arms complex.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials asked that some aspects of the spy case
involving weapons and intelligence secrets not be published, and
The New York Times agreed to refrain from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   For the Los Alamos team of detectives, the overall spy theory
was confirmed strongly in 1995 when the CIA obtained an internal
Chinese document that included a description of America's most
advanced miniature warhead, the W-88. Revealing for the first time
their top evidence in the case, the document's secret contents,
federal officials say the Chinese text cited five key attributes of
the warhead, including two measurements accurate to within four
hundredths of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   But the critics, who are also revealing new information, insist
that Beijing, even if it spied, made the miniaturization
breakthrough on its own, after pursuing it for at least 13 years,
from 1979 to 1992. The prowess of Chinese scientists, American
experts said, is suggested by a camera it built for photographing
nuclear blasts, which was far better than a similar one made by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need any help from us,'' said Harold Agnew, a past
Los Alamos director, visitor to China and federal intelligence
adviser. ``They're just curious, as we are curious about them.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Chinese spying has been blurred by issues that
range from Republican distaste for President Clinton's China policy
to allegations of racial bias in the investigation to fears among
scientists that the uproar is prompting security measures so tight
as to damage work, morale and recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   As in most spy cases, the evidence is open to interpretation,
some experts seeing the glass half full, others half empty.
</P>
<P>
   Several critics familiar with the Chinese document obtained by
the CIA said that its description of the American warhead, which
includes the size, shape and position of crucial components, was
not by itself sufficient to build a miniaturized warhead.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department official who supervised the Los Alamos
inquiry, Notra Trulock, agreed with this assessment but said the
information was secret and had never been mentioned in any public
document or Internet posting. Anyone who had it, he and his team
reasoned, must have also obtained access to a much broader range of
secrets about the warhead's design.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Trulock said in an interview, knowing the
approximate size and shape of the components provided a road map to
Chinese bomb makers, probably allowing them to skip years of
preliminary testing.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock added, however, that the congressional committee was too
categorical in its report, which was based in part on his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I testified, I used the appropriate caveats to express
uncertainties in our evidence and our conclusions,'' said Trulock,
formerly the Energy Department's intelligence chief. ``We typically
said: `Probably this. Probably that.''' The committee, he said,
``made judgments'' about the centrality of spying in China's
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., who was chairman of the
committee, defended the work of his staff of 47, which included no
one with nuclear design experience. The panel, he said in a lengthy
interview, drew largely on Clinton administration witnesses for its
expertise. The conclusion that espionage allowed Beijing to skip
decades of research, he said, was an appropriate one, based on the
government's own evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judgment matters,'' he said, responding to Trulock's
criticism. ``We don't know everything to a certainty. The question
is what is more likely than not.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Cox expressed surprise when told of the depth
and breadth of China's interest in the miniaturization secret. He
also played down the fact, reported by intelligence officials and
trumpeted by federal critics, that most of the world's nuclear
powers have figured out the secret of bomb miniaturization.
</P>
<P>
   Can China, Cox asked, ``develop it indigenously because France
did? That is a stretch. It's almost apples and oranges.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The main evidence cited by Cox's committee was the Chinese
document obtained by the CIA in 1995 and a 1980s inquiry into
spying at the Livermore weapons lab in California that concluded
China had likely obtained design secrets of the neutron bomb. The
unclassified version of the report gave no details of the 1995
document's secret details about the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   The report was signed by the committee's four Democrats. But
immediately after its release, Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. of South
Carolina, one of the Democrats, criticized it as rushed,
superficial and exaggerated. The witnesses heard by the committee,
he added, ``did not have the technical background to fully assess
the nature or value of the information lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Spratt's critique has been echoed and amplified by a
range of top scientists and bomb designers who say Beijing could
have miniaturized its warheads on its own without spying.
</P>
<P>
   Richard L. Garwin, a physicist who has long advised Washington
on nuclear arms, recently on a bipartisan team led by former
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, said, ``There is no reason to
believe that China could not have built perfectly adequate
warheads'' for a range of modern missiles ``from nuclear technology
that it developed itself.''
</P>
<P>
   China, several officials said, simply went down the same path as
other nuclear powers, helped along by the general knowledge of what
the United States had achieved: proof that hydrogen bombs can be
made very small but nonetheless very powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every state has come to it,'' said one federal official,
referring to breakthroughs in atomic triggers by the Soviet Union,
Britain and France. ``Now they've got it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston T. Hawkins, head of international security studies at
Los Alamos, which is clearly on the defensive because of the spy
scandal, said the basic physics of bombs and missiles push weapons
designers in roughly the same direction. To obtain the best
performance, he said, engineers are invariably led toward narrow
nose cones about 16 degrees wide _ if cut from a pie, a very modest
slice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you realize that,'' Hawkins said, ``it drives every
nation down similar paths. Eventually, all weapons systems will
look alike. It has to do more with physics than espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   That view is not universally accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Henson, an intelligence analyst who first sounded the
alarm at Los Alamos, said there was nothing in the design of
missile nose cones that propelled a scientist to shape the core of
an atomic trigger into an oval.
</P>
<P>
   Do scientific and technical analyses automatically ``draw you to
a watermelon?'' he asked, alluding to the shape of the U.S.'s
top-secret design for its atomic trigger. ``That's not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond a shadow of a doubt,'' Henson added. ``Major
espionage took place.''
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence agencies are less categorical. Analysts
have concluded that espionage played a role in Beijing's advance,
but cannot identify a hard link comparable to the Soviet Union's
theft in the 1940s of the American design for the first atom bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a smoking gun,'' said a top administration
official who has closely scrutinized the secret data.
</P>
<P>
   A damage assessment by the American intelligence community, made
public in April, said a mix of espionage, openly available data and
scientific acumen had greatly lengthened Chinese strides. Stolen
secrets, it said, ``could help'' Beijing develop a mobile missile
and ``probably accelerated its program to develop future nuclear
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board,
which did its own investigation, said both congressional and
administration leaders had engaged in ``simplification and
hyperbole'' in the spy case. Neither dramatic damage assessments
nor categorical reassurances, it said, were wholly substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   And Hawkins said the specific secrets known to have been seized
by the Chinese, principally those detailed in the 1995 document,
would have been little help to a bomb maker, and far from Trulock's
road map. As for an H-bomb's innards, what designers call the
physics package, Hawkins said the documents ``describe nothing
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains unresolved how China got the W-88 secrets in the
first place, but a consensus is emerging that the search for the
leak narrowed too quickly to Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by the Senate as well as the president's foreign
intelligence board this year raised serious questions about whether
the FBI and Energy Department had too quickly focused on the
weapons lab. No evidence has pinpointed it as the leak's source.
Lee, fired this year from Los Alamos for security violations, has
not been charged with a crime and has denied spying.
</P>
<P>
   However Beijing made its miniaturization advance _ on its own,
by theft or a combination of the two _ it is apparently proud
enough to boast about it publicly, at least among its friends in
the mountains of New Mexico. Henson said a Chinese arms scientist,
Sun Cheng Wei, bragged of the breakthrough a few years ago at Los
Alamos, telling an open seminar that China had forged significantly
ahead in nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he said,'' recalled Henson, who attended the talk, ``was
that for a long time they were dealing only with round designs, and
then only watermelons.''

RUSSIANS KILL THREE SERBS IN KOSOVO SKIRMISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Russian peacekeeping troops shot and
killed three armed Serbs on Monday in a firefight in eastern
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, frequently accused by local Albanians of siding
with the Serbs, came under fire when they surprised three Serbs who
had ambushed a car, killing a passenger, a spokesman for the
NATO-led peacekeeping force said.
</P>
<P>
   As the spokesman described the episode, the three Serbs were
beating two wounded Albanians when the Russian soldiers arrived on
the scene. Ordered to stop, the Serbs instead opened fire on the
Russian soldiers, who returned fire and killed the three Serbs. The
Russians had no casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the NATO secretary-general, Javier Solana, who is
on a visit to Kosovo, singled out the 3,000 Russian troops for
praise.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that disappointed local Albanians, Solana
emphatically supported the Russian presence. ``We are particularly
happy they are here and that Russian and NATO troops are working
side by side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said that their performance in the firefight was proof
that the Russians were professional and deserved NATO's full
support.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Russian troops in Kosovo has brought no end of
complications to the peacekeeping mission, in particular when they
stole the march on NATO's entry into Kosovo on June 11, occupying
the airport in Pristina, the provincial capital, ahead of a British
contingent. The airport remains under effective Russian control.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian peacekeepers have also met with public protests by
Kosovo Albanians, who accuse Russia of siding with the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, and who contend that Russian
mercenaries fought alongside Serbian forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two weeks, hundreds of protesters have prevented
Russian troops from entering Orahovac to serve as peacekeepers
there. The Russians have also come under fire more often than the
other peacekeepers, possibly from Albanians opposed to having them
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Solana, who has been championed here as a savior since the
NATO bombing campaign forced the withdrawal of Serbian forces, made
no concessions to Albanian sensitivities. He met with
representatives of the demonstrators, including the Albanian mayor
of Orahovac, and told them that Russian troops were part of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This incident this morning proves that the Russian troops
behave according to the obligations'' that all peacekeeping troops
have, he said at a news conference in Pristina. He said they
deserved the same respect as peacekeeping troops from any other
country.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Solana also voiced his support for transforming part of the
Albanian guerrilla force, the Kosovo Liberation Army, into a
civilian emergency force, but said it was essential that the group
demilitarize first.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit he met with Gen. Agim Ceku, commander of the
KLA, and said he had spoken several times to Hashim Thaci, its
political leader. ``We still have days to develop the details'' of
the transformation to a civilian force, Solana said, ``but the
philosophy is not going to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not yet been determined how funds would be provided for
the force, which would eventually come under control of the United
Nations. Solana suggested that money could be provided bilaterally
by individual countries.

<P>
   When American bomb makers began visiting China in 1979, they
were startled by a series of increasingly pointed questions that
suggested their Chinese peers were hot on the trail of the secret
to building a modern nuclear arsenal. The breakthrough allows
H-bombs to be made so small that many can fit atop a single missile
or be fired from trucks, submarines and other mobile platforms.
</P>
<P>
   China succeeded on Sept. 25, 1992, according to a spy who told
his American handlers that Beijing had exploded a bomb based on the
miniaturization secret.
</P>
<P>
   A team of scientists at the Los Alamos weapons laboratory in New
Mexico set to work on a whodunit with huge potential implications:
Was China's advance the result of espionage, hard work or some mix
of the two?
</P>
<P>
   Today, the debate rages on. Experts agree that spying occurred,
but clash violently on how much was stolen and what impact it had
on Beijing's advance, if any.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos team concluded in 1995 that China's stride was
probably based on espionage. A report this year by a congressional
committee that made the case public went further, claiming that it
would have been ``virtually impossible'' for China to have made
small warheads ``without the nuclear secrets stolen from the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional report unleashed a torrent of criticism from
scientists inside and outside the government who said the
importance of the espionage was overstated, and that China could
well have achieved the breakthrough on its own, as it insists
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   A review of the dispute, based on months of interviews and
disclosures of weapon and intelligence secrets, suggests that the
congressional report went beyond the evidence in asserting that
stolen secrets were the main reason for China's breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   The review also bolsters an important point of agreement among
feuding experts: that the federal investigation focused too soon on
the Los Alamos National Laboratory and one worker there, Wen Ho
Lee, who was fired for security violations. The lost secrets, it
now appears, were available to hundreds and perhaps thousands of
individuals scattered throughout the nation's arms complex.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials asked that some aspects of the spy case
involving weapons and intelligence secrets not be published, and
The New York Times agreed to refrain from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   For the Los Alamos team of detectives, the overall spy theory
was confirmed strongly in 1995 when the CIA obtained an internal
Chinese document that included a description of America's most
advanced miniature warhead, the W-88. Revealing for the first time
their top evidence in the case, the document's secret contents,
federal officials say the Chinese text cited five key attributes of
the warhead, including two measurements accurate to within four
hundredths of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   But the critics, who are also revealing new information, insist
that Beijing, even if it spied, made the miniaturization
breakthrough on its own, after pursuing it for at least 13 years,
from 1979 to 1992. The prowess of Chinese scientists, American
experts said, is suggested by a camera it built for photographing
nuclear blasts, which was far better than a similar one made by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need any help from us,'' said Harold Agnew, a past
Los Alamos director, visitor to China and federal intelligence
adviser. ``They're just curious, as we are curious about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Deconstructing the damage wrought by espionage is an imprecise
art that mixes inference, evidence and deduction. In the vacuum
between what is known and what is suspected, personal, partisan or
institutional bias often rushes in.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Chinese spying has been blurred by issues that
range from Republican distaste for President Clinton's China policy
to allegations of racial bias in the investigation to fears among
scientists that the uproar is prompting security measures so tight
as to damage work, morale and recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   As in most spy cases, the evidence is open to interpretation,
some experts seeing the glass half full, others half empty.
</P>
<P>
   Several critics familiar with the Chinese document obtained by
the CIA said that its description of the American warhead, which
includes the size, shape and position of key components, was not by
itself sufficient to build a miniaturized warhead.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department official who supervised the Los Alamos
inquiry, Notra Trulock, agreed with this assessment but said the
information was secret and had never been mentioned in any public
document or Internet posting. Anyone who had it, he and his team
reasoned, must have also obtained access to a much broader range of
secrets about the warhead's design.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Trulock said in an interview, knowing the
approximate size and shape of the components provided a road map to
Chinese bomb makers, probably allowing them to skip years of
preliminary testing.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock added, however, that the congressional committee was too
categorical in its report, which was based in part on his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I testified, I used the appropriate caveats to express
uncertainties in our evidence and our conclusions,'' said Trulock,
formerly the Energy Department's intelligence chief. ``We typically
said: `Probably this. Probably that.''' The committee, he said,
``made judgments'' about the centrality of spying in China's
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., who was chairman of the
committee, defended the work of his staff of 47, which included no
one with nuclear design experience. The panel, he said in a lengthy
interview, drew largely on Clinton administration witnesses for its
expertise. The conclusion that espionage allowed Beijing to skip
decades of research, he said, was an appropriate one, based on the
government's own evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judgment matters,'' he said, responding to Trulock's
criticism. ``We don't know everything to a certainty. The question
is what is more likely than not.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Cox expressed surprise when told of the depth
and breadth of China's interest in the miniaturization secret. He
also played down the fact, reported by intelligence officials and
trumpeted by federal critics, that most of the world's nuclear
powers have figured out the secret of bomb miniaturization.
</P>
<P>
   Can China, Cox asked, ``develop it indigenously because France
did? That is a stretch. It's almost apples and oranges.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE SECRET: AMERICA SHRINKS AN ATOMIC MATCH
</P>
<P>
   From the dawn of the nuclear age, miniaturization has been an
obsession of weapon designers.
</P>
<P>
   The world's first atomic bomb, designed by the Los Alamos
laboratory and detonated in the New Mexico desert in July 1945 was
an awesome, but cumbersome affair. A lump of plutonium the size of
a softball was surrounded by a much larger ball of high explosives
that was 5-feet wide and made up of 32 explosive charges and 64
detonators. Big as a car, it could not have fit into a small
airplane, let alone a missile.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, American physicists made an important breakthrough: the
H-bomb. Roughly a thousand times more powerful than the first
atomic weapon, the hydrogen bomb was a two-stage device. Inside its
dense casing, an atomic explosion _ called the primary _ worked as
a match to kindle the fiery heat that touched off an even more
powerful detonation by the bomb's hydrogen fuel, which was known as
the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Size was an issue from the start. The first H-bomb stood two
stories high and weighed 82 tons. It would be militarily useful
only if it could be shrunk, and over the next few years, America's
best physicists set out to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   After considerable trial and error, American scientists figured
out that they could obtain the same kind of explosive power from a
smaller package. A main breakthrough centered on the large, heavy
atomic match. By shaping its plutonium fuel into an ovoid, roughly
like a watermelon, scientists were able to drastically shrink the
size and number of the explosives that triggered the nuclear blast.
</P>
<P>
   After at least one flop, the radical idea roared to life in July
1957 in a nuclear explosion in the Nevada desert, according to
Chuck Hansen, author of a detailed history of America's early
nuclear efforts. It had taken the United States a little more than
five years to move from the first H-bomb to its miniaturized
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   The development had profound implications for the Cold War's
nuclear competition.
</P>
<P>
   Shrinking the atomic trigger from something roughly the size of
a washing machine to something smaller than a football allowed
weapons designers to put thermonuclear arms atop small missiles
that could be launched from submarines or mobile platforms like
trucks. Arms would no longer be confined to bombers or fixed silos
in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The advance meant weapons could now be carried, quite
stealthily, closer to enemy shores and could be made safer from
attack. It also meant warheads could fit into the cramped spaces of
narrow nose cones, which streaked faster to Earth than blunter
shapes and were less buffeted by winds during the fiery plunge,
making them more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The first warhead in the new generation of weapons, the W-47,
was less than half the size of the bomb that leveled Hiroshima but
up to 80 times as powerful. In 1960, when the first Polaris
submarine put to sea, each of its 16 missiles was armed with a
W-47.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons continued to evolve and, by all accounts, the apex
was reached in the 1980s with the W-88, one of the most deadly
weapons in the American arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The warhead, made for submarines, first went to sea a decade ago
and is considered quite powerful for its small size. The precise
number is secret. But at least eight W-88s can fit atop the Trident
D-5 missile, which is less than 7 feet wide. Since Trident subs
have 24 missiles, a single submarine can carry up to 192 of the
thermonuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Today, American submarines on patrol in the Atlantic carry the
small warheads. And the Navy is adding them to its Pacific fleet,
so in the next few years the W-88 is also likely to be aimed at
China.
</P>
<P>
   THE CHINESE: ARMS ENIGMA GOES FAST AND SLOW
</P>
<P>
   China was late in joining the nuclear club, but showed
considerable skill when it did so.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing detonated its first bomb in 1964. The tricky design was
based on uranium, like the Hiroshima bomb, but saved costly fuel
and made the bomb lighter, increasing its military value.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney D. Drell, a Stanford physicist and Clinton administration
adviser, writing in ``China Builds the Bomb'' (Stanford University
Press, 1988), called the feat ``enormously impressive.'' Beijing's
first hydrogen bomb came just 32 months later.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the step from nuclear to thermonuclear took
London 66 months, Moscow 75 months, Washington 87 months and Paris
103 months, said Robert S. Norris of the Natural Resources Defense
Council, a private group in Washington that monitors nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   China set off just six test blasts to get to the H-bomb stage,
vs. 31 for the United States. That was typical. While developing at
least six types of weapons, Beijing over the decades conducted
relatively few nuclear tests, 45 in all, vs. 1,030 for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   China's nuclear force was modest. Starting in the 1980s, its
military deployed about 20 missiles that can now reach anywhere in
North America, each topped by a single warhead that can unleash a
force equal to up to five million tons of high explosives. That is
about 300 times stronger than the Hiroshima bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The big warheads are not particularly accurate, but they fit
China's professed war doctrine _ to fire nuclear arms only in
retaliation. The big missiles can, if necessary, hit a city.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence strongly suggests that, in this period, China had
no idea how to shrink thermonuclear arms. According to ``China's
Strategic Seapower'' (Stanford University Press, 1994), the warhead
for the submarine missile deployed by Beijing in the 1970s weighed
1,300 pounds _ more than twice the old American W-47, suggesting
the Chinese were still using a spherical atomic match to ignite
H-bombs.
</P>
<P>
   China's interest in building smaller weapons was spurred, in
part, by the United States' development in the late 1970s of a new,
high-accuracy design known as the Missile Experimental, or MX, that
bristled with 10 warheads. Though meant primarily to unnerve
Moscow, the weapon also worried Beijing, which quickly grasped that
its handful of big, land-based missiles suddenly looked like
sitting ducks that could be destroyed in a first strike of
precisely aimed H-bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's unease grew as the American Navy in the late 1970s
unveiled plans for a new submarine-launched missile nearly as
unerring as the MX and bearing an even more powerful warhead _ the
W-88.
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence agencies knew little about China's nuclear
program and modernization plans, if any, before President Richard
Nixon's visit to China in 1972. But the military ties that followed
the Nixon administration's diplomatic initiative opened the door.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By 1979, American nuclear arms designers and security experts
were starting to visit their Chinese peers, weapon labs and Lop
Nur, the sprawling site in China's western desert where prototype
nuclear weapons were detonated.
</P>
<P>
   From Los Alamos alone, at least 85 scientists and officials made
trips from 1979 to 1990, according to Robert S. Vrooman, a former
CIA officer who at the time directed counterintelligence at Los
Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Top visitors included Agnew, the past director of the weapons
lab; Danny B. Stillman, its head of intelligence; and George A.
Keyworth II, a physicist who later became President Reagan's
science adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits were judged to far outweigh the risks that arms
scientists in informal settings and conversations might, by
accident or design, give away secrets. And indeed, the Americans
learned much.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a huge intelligence game for the United States,''
said one U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``At the beginning we knew zip about China.''
</P>
<P>
   One discovery was that parts of the Chinese program were quite
advanced, including technologies for bomb development.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have excellent facilities, some better than ours,'' said
Agnew, who in 1979 and 1982 was among the first visitors.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, the Chinese were able to peer into fiery
blasts with an advanced camera known as pinex, revealing details to
aid warhead development. The American version of the device had one
axis, he said, the Chinese version two, doubling its usefulness.
``It's much better,'' Agnew said.
</P>
<P>
   The American visitors also learned much about what China lacked.
From a barrage of inquiries over the years, it became clear that
Beijing was eager to learn everything it could about shrinking the
atomic trigger. The questions were regular, increasingly pointed
and never answered, American officials said, insisting that Beijing
got no secrets that way.
</P>
<P>
   But in one case, investigators became suspicious about an
American scientist at the Livermore weapons lab in California who
in 1979 had talked with Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, born in Taiwan, never confessed. But some federal
investigators, in an investigation code-named Tiger Trap, feared
the scientist had compromised not only the design of the W-70, the
neutron bomb, but the secret to making small atomic triggers.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons experts say that the crucial insight of the watermelon
shape can be communicated with a few comments, a hand motion or a
simple drawing on the back of an envelope, although many years of
computing, calculation, experiment and factory labor would then be
needed to turn the idea into nuclear blasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real challenge is not in the design, it's in the
manufacturing,'' said Houston T. Hawkins, head of international
security studies at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, casting plutonium is difficult because of
uncertainties in how it reacts with other metals and materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange beast,'' Hawkins said of the dense metal that
fuels most atom bombs.
</P>
<P>
   THE BREAKTHROUGH: CHINA TAKES A GIANT NUCLEAR STEP
</P>
<P>
   China finally succeeded in exploding a miniaturized bomb on
Sept. 25, 1992, American officials revealed. It took intelligence
analysts more than two years to fully understand what China had
accomplished, its feat becoming clear only after a Chinese nuclear
expert who had been recruited to spy for the United States
delivered an intriguing report to his American handlers.
</P>
<P>
   The spy said China's September 1992 test blast, which had been
initially viewed by American analysts as routine, was anything but.
The bomb detonated that day was miniaturized with a core, the spy
said, in the distinctive shape of an oval, indicating China had
begun to master the art of making modern warheads.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, the task of tracking the technical ins and
outs of other nations' nuclear programs fell to the national
weapons labs. Among the sleuths was Dr. Robert M. Henson, an
experienced weapons designer at Los Alamos who had been analyzing
intelligence on foreign programs since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1995, Henson said in an interview, he began looking
more closely at how China had cracked the miniaturization puzzle.
For help he turned to Lawrence A. Booth, a friend who specialized
in Russian analyses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept looking into it for two weeks,'' Henson recalled.
``Then, we decided to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   They drew up their analysis and eventually took it to Trulock,
who the previous year had become director of intelligence at the
Energy Department, which oversees Los Alamos. Trulock, who has a
bachelor's degree in political science and no formal technical
training, said he wanted to bring in other nuclear experts,
particularly ones who had long experience in developing the
miniaturized nuclear triggers for H-bombs. John L. Richter of Los
Alamos, a scientist who filled that void, joined the team.
</P>
<P>
   The group looked more closely at a clue provided by the Chinese
spy, who described the size of the bomb's atomic core with an
analogy to a common household object, officials said in a new
disclosure. Working from that, the scientists calculated a more
precise size and Henson and Richter went through the American
stockpile of nuclear arms, looking up measurements to see if any
matched.
</P>
<P>
   The atomic trigger of the W-88, they discovered, was close
enough in size to raise suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department held meetings in which the Los Alamos team
was joined by analysts from the CIA and the Defense Intelligence
Agency. Federal officials now say the intelligence agencies were
skeptical, reasoning that too much was being made of a foreigner's
rough analogy. But the Energy Department and the Los Alamos team
felt the evidence was provocative.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came in 1995, as has been previously disclosed,
when a Chinese government official sent a package of secret Chinese
documents to American officials.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock said the document, dated 1988, laid out China's nuclear
modernization plans for Beijing's First Ministry of Machine
Building, which, among other things, made missiles and nose cones.
It not only described China's plans but compared them to the
nuclear arms of the American arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively crude hand drawings sketched out the nose cones
enveloping the W-88, the W-87, the W-78, the W-76, the W-62 and the
W-56 _ warheads of the Trident, MX and Minuteman missiles _ and
also gave their overall weights and dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, these were not damning. Though still officially
classified secret in some cases, such information by then was
widely available in many unclassified American papers and articles.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese document, some 20 pages in translation, went on
to give sensitive data about the W-88, federal officials revealed.
It accurately described the shape of the atomic trigger as not
spherical and said it was situated in the nose cone's narrow
forward end _ an arrangement used in some but not all American
warheads. And it correctly described the nuclear fuel, or
secondary, as having a spherical shape.
</P>
<P>
   More unsettling to the team, it described the width of the
casing that surrounds the atomic trigger to within a millimeter, or
four hundredths of an inch. ``That's pretty damn accurate,''
Trulock recalled.
</P>
<P>
   A senior federal official agreed. ``That opened eyes,'' he
recalled. ``It seemed to confirm earlier assessments that had
seemed insubstantial.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Trulock said his team later found that the Chinese document also
gave a similarly exact measure for the width of the W-88s
secondary, or hydrogen stage. ``Primaries are the long pole in the
tent,'' he said, referring to the importance of the atomic trigger.
``But that measurement was as good as the one for the primary.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA eventually concluded that the agent who sent the
documents was acting under instruction of Chinese intelligence. No
one has ever come up with a persuasive explanation of why China
sent the documents to American spies.
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 to 1996, American officials revealed, China used its
new atomic match to ignite a variety of hydrogen bombs, including
one similar in some respects to the W-88. After this series of
blasts shook the ground at the Lop Nur test site, China signed the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, signaling an end to its nuclear
experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   THE INVESTIGATION: FEDERAL SLEUTHS HUNT FOR A SPY
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department opened an investigation into the possible
theft of W-88 secrets on Sept. 28, 1995, and over the next three
years, federal officials quietly tried to find out whether there
was a Chinese spy in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   If espionage had occurred, Trulock and his team reasoned, it
must have happened between 1984, when the warhead entered
engineering development, and 1988, the date of the Chinese
document.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials focused on Los Alamos, which had
designed the bomb. They looked particularly closely at anyone who
had traveled to China in those years or met visiting Chinese
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman, then head of counterintelligence at Los Alamos and
later a vocal critic of the inquiry, said investigators scrutinized
only those people whose trips to China were paid for by the Energy
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Left unexamined, he said, were at least 15 additional people
whose trips were paid for by the Chinese, the CIA, the Air Force or
privately. These travelers tended to be top weapon designers and
high officials _ the people who knew the most American arms secrets
and had the most intimate contact with Chinese peers, Vrooman said.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1996, the Energy Department turned a list of a dozen
suspects over to the FBI, which began a criminal case that
eventually narrowed down to Lee, an American scientist of Taiwanese
birth working at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and his wife, Sylvia, had traveled to China in 1986 and
1988. Mrs. Lee was a secretary at Los Alamos who often met visiting
Chinese delegations. And Lee, though a mechanical engineer by
training and never a weapon designer, was familiar with the W-88
and many other nuclear arms and secrets (including the atomic
trigger advance) because of his work on secret computer codes.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI believed it had enough evidence to seek a secret wiretap
on Lee's phone calls, citing 20 reasons he was a prime suspect. But
the Justice Department found the evidence unpersuasive and would
not seek a court order for the eavesdropping, a routine step in
most spy cases.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman has charged that the inquiry was marred by a racist bias
to target Chinese-Americans, an assertion federal officials have
vehemently denied. But the Republican chairman and the ranking
Democrat of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which
investigated the spy case and heard testimony from Vrooman,
concluded that federal investigators had focused prematurely on
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   After the spy case exploded in public, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson recommended that Vrooman be disciplined for letting Lee
retain access to secrets even after doubts about him had been
raised.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, fired this year from Los Alamos for security violations,
has not been charged with a crime and has denied spying. After his
ouster, investigators found that he had loaded many secret files
onto an unsecured computer, raising the risk that they could fall
into the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry most likely would not have come into public view had
it not been for a series of unrelated disclosures about China.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, The New York Times reported that two U.S.
aerospace companies were under criminal investigation for providing
rocket data to Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
   A furor erupted in Congress. The House created a select
committee led by Cox, to look into whether the administration's
increasingly open policies on satellite exports had compromised
national security.
</P>
<P>
   There was no hint the committee would end up studying nuclear
bombs. None of its 47 staff members had any experience in atomic
design.
</P>
<P>
   Composed of five Republicans and four Democrats, the committee
did not learn of the suspected Chinese nuclear espionage until
October 1998, just a few months before its mandate expired. On Nov.
12 and Dec. 16 it held secret hearings in which Trulock was called
as the star witness.
</P>
<P>
   In January, after three months of investigation, the committee
completed a secret manuscript. In May, after a lengthy argument
with the White House over what could be made public, it released an
872-page report. The chapter on atomic espionage, just 37 pages,
garnered most of the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   In fiery prose accompanied by vivid color pictures and charts,
the committee charged that Chinese spies had carried off vital
secrets about seven of America's most advanced arms.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Republic of China, it alleged, ``has stolen
classified information on all of the United States' most advanced
thermonuclear warheads,'' leaping from the clumsy designs of the
1950s to those that are far more modern and deadly.
</P>
<P>
   The main evidence cited was the Chinese document obtained by the
CIA in 1995 and a 1980s inquiry into spying at the Livermore lab
that concluded China had most likely obtained design secrets of the
neutron bomb. The unclassified version of the report gave no
details of the 1995 document's secret details about the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   The report was signed by the committee's four Democrats. But
immediately after its release, Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. of South
Carolina, one of the Democrats, criticized it as rushed,
superficial and exaggerated. The witnesses heard by the committee,
he added, ``did not have the technical background to fully assess
the nature or value of the information lost.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE DEBATE: ANALYSTS SIFT FOR THE TRUTH
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Spratt's critique has been echoed and amplified by a
range of top scientists and bomb designers who say Beijing could
have miniaturized its warheads on its own without spying.
</P>
<P>
   Richard L. Garwin, a physicist who has long advised Washington
on nuclear arms, recently on a bipartisan team led by former
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, said, ``There is no reason to
believe that China could not have built perfectly adequate
warheads'' for a range of modern missiles ``from nuclear technology
that it developed itself.''
</P>
<P>
   China, several officials said, simply went down the same path as
other nuclear powers, helped along by the general knowledge of what
the United States had achieved: proof that hydrogen bombs can be
made very small but nonetheless very powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every state has come to it,'' said one federal official,
referring to breakthroughs in atomic triggers by the Soviet Union,
Britain and France. ``Now they've got it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins, the head of international security studies at Los
Alamos, which is clearly on the defensive because of the spy
scandal, said the basic physics of bombs and missiles push weapons
designers in roughly the same direction. To obtain the best
performance, he said, engineers are invariably led toward narrow
nose cones about 16 degrees wide _ if cut from a pie, a very modest
slice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you realize that,'' Hawkins said, ``it drives every
nation down similar paths. Eventually, all weapons systems will
look alike. It has to do more with physics than espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   That view is not universally accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Henson, the analyst who first sounded the alarm at Los Alamos,
said there was nothing in the design of missile nose cones that
propelled a scientist to shape the core of an atomic trigger into
an oval.
</P>
<P>
   Do scientific and technical analyses automatically ``draw you to
a watermelon?'' he asked, alluding to the shape of the top-secret
design. ``That's not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond a shadow of a doubt,'' Henson added. ``Major
espionage took place.''
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence agencies are less categorical. Analysts
have concluded that espionage played a role in Beijing's advance,
but cannot identify a hard link comparable to the Soviet Union's
theft in the 1940s of the American design for the first atom bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has come to the same conclusion,'' said a top
administration official who has closely scrutinized the secret
data. ``We don't have a smoking gun.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal intelligence study done last year, which the Cox
committee drew on, said American secrets lost between 1984 and 1988
let the Chinese ``accelerate their nuclear weapons program well
beyond indigenous capabilities,'' a view that echoed the original
Los Alamos finding.
</P>
<P>
   A damage assessment by the American intelligence community, made
public in April, said a mix of espionage, openly available data and
scientific acumen had greatly lengthened Chinese strides. Stolen
secrets, it said, ``could help'' Beijing develop a mobile missile
and ``probably accelerated its program to develop future nuclear
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board,
which did its own investigation, said both congressional and
administration leaders had engaged in ``simplification and
hyperbole'' in the spy case. Neither dramatic damage assessments
nor categorical reassurances, it said, were wholly substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   And Hawkins, the Los Alamos official, said the specific secrets
known to have been seized by the Chinese, principally those
detailed in the 1995 document, would have been little help to a
bomb maker, and far from Trulock's road map. As for an H-bomb's
innards, what designers call the physics package, Hawkins said the
documents ``describe nothing significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox insisted that highly classified intelligence data available
to his committee showed a more persuasive case than has emerged
publicly. ``There are more interpolating facts'' that closely tie
lost W-88 secrets to Beijing's advance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal official cited intelligence data about China's
atomic trigger showing it to be anything but an exact copy. ``It
turns out the W-88 is slightly smaller,'' said the official, who
believes Beijing may have made the advance on its own.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unresolved how China got the W-88 secrets in the
first place, but a consensus is emerging that the search for the
leak narrowed too quickly to Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by the Senate as well as the president's foreign
intelligence board this year raised serious questions about whether
the FBI and Energy Department had too quickly focused on the
weapons lab. No evidence has pinpointed it as the leak's source.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman, the head of counterintelligence at the laboratory from
1987 until 1998, noted that one secret document describing the
design of the W-88 warhead went to 548 mailing addresses throughout
the government and military. Some administration experts believe
the data described by the Chinese in the 1995 document came from
engineering plans or from secret manuals on military bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of information was widely available,'' said Drell of
Stanford, who served on the president's advisory board
investigation. ``The manuals that went out had pictures and
numbers. If a submarine came in, and there was a problem, they had
to know what they were dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   However Beijing made its miniaturization advance _ on its own,
by theft or a combination of the two _ it is apparently proud
enough to boast about it publicly, at least among its friends in
the mountains of New Mexico. Henson said a Chinese arms scientist,
Sun Cheng Wei, bragged of the breakthrough a few years ago at Los
Alamos, telling an open seminar that China had forged significantly
ahead in nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he said,'' recalled Henson, who attended the talk, ``was
that for a long time they were dealing only with round designs, and
then only watermelons.''

   CHINA-NUKE (Undated) _ American bomb makers visiting China in
1979 were startled by a series of questions that suggested the
Chinese were hot on the trail of the secret to building a modern
nuclear arsenal, miniaturization. China succeeded in September
1992. Was China's advance the result of espionage, hard work or
some mix of the two? Experts agree that spying occurred, but clash
on what impact it had on Beijing's advance, if any. A review of the
dispute, based on interviews and disclosures of weapon and
intelligence secrets, suggests that the congressional report went
beyond the evidence in asserting that stolen secrets were the main
reason for China's breakthrough. The review also bolsters a point
of agreement among feuding experts: that the federal investigation
focused too soon on the Los Alamos Laboratory and one worker there,
Wen Ho Lee. A Special Report by William J. Broad. (The report has

LONDON THEATER CONTINUES TO PROLIFERATE WITH BOTH QUANTITY AND

   LONDON _ If you want an example of the extent to which London
has superseded New York as the capital of the English-language
theater, and maybe also an indication of why we critics sometimes
suffer from a medical syndrome known as drama fatigue, consider
just one week of openings this fall. It's that of Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Monday: we trot cheerfully off to the Old Vic, which will have
been transformed into a theater-in-the-round for Sophocles'
``Antigone.'' The rebellious heroine will be played by Tara
Fitzgerald, who is best known as a movie actress but got excellent
reviews for the Ophelia she performed opposite Ralph Fiennes in New
York in 1995. The director is Declan Donnellan, whose Cheek by Jowl
company had a huge success when it brought that Jacobean thunderer,
John Webster's ``Duchess of Malfi,'' to New York four years ago.
And though there will be a nine-member chorus, all the characters
will be performed by four actors, which is just one more than would
have been the case in the Athens of 442 B.C., when the tragedy
probably had its premiere.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday: still resilient, we amble off to the Piccadilly to see
the musical ``Spend, Spend, Spend,'' so-called because that's what
a housewife called Viv Nicholson famously told journalists she
planned to do when she won a vast fortune gambling on soccer
results in 1961. The tale of her triumph and decline got stunning
notices when it was staged in Leeds last year _ and everybody is
hoping that in its creators, the unknown Steve Brown and Justin
Greene, the British impresarios may at long last have ended their
search for plausible heirs to Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical throne.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday: we lope gamely to the Lyric for ``Comic Potential,''
the latest piece by Britain's most prolific and successful comic
dramatist, Alan Ayckbourn. The word from the Yorkshire resort of
Scarborough, where the playwright first presents all his work in
the theater he runs himself, is that it is set in a futuristic
Britain where television soaps are performed by android actors. The
hope is that, as one visiting London critic extravagantly put it,
the comedy will ``hurt you with the exuberance of its laughter and
liberate you with its seriousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday: we trudge to the New Ambassador's for ``Some Explicit
Polaroids'' by Mark Ravenhill. Heard of him? In 1996 he won glowing
reviews and considerable notoriety with a play about rough sex and
consumerism whose very title most newspapers found too obscene to
publish, even though it ended up in lights on Shaftesbury Avenue.
Reportedly his latest piece is still more acerbic, this time
describing how six people ``mix their own peculiar cocktails of
love, honor, happiness, sex and money''; but at least the title is
printable.
</P>
<P>
   Friday: we dodder off to the National Theater for the premiere
of ``Remember This'' by Stephen Poliakoff, a dramatist with a sharp
eye for aspects of the late 20th century others tend to ignore:
technological innovation, shopping malls, concrete-and-glass office
blocks and the people doomed to inhabit them. His latest involves a
man, played by Stanley Townsend, who makes and collects videos of
weddings and bizarre consequences of the destruction of his tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday: we stay at home, pouring warm water onto our feet and
cold drinks down our throats. But very likely we're feeling a bit
guilty about our failure on Oct. 12 to have made the 60-mile trip
to Chichester's Festival Theater for ``The Retreat From Moscow,'' a
new play about marital discord by the author of ``Shadowlands,''
William Nicholson. But we need our weekend, because the next days
will keep us busy, too. Tuesday, Oct. 19, brings maybe the most
eagerly awaited event of the fall, the opening at London's Lyceum
of the most visually inventive show now on Broadway, Julie Taymor's
production of Disney's ``Lion King.'' And on Wednesday, Oct. 20, at
the Gielgud, we'll be seeing Noel Coward's ``Song at Twilight,''
with Corin Redgrave as a grumpy old writer, glancingly based on
Somerset Maugham, and his sister Vanessa as the ex-mistress who
owns letters revealing that he was a closet gay. Maybe we critics
will find ourselves having to go to matinees in order to stay
abreast of things _ and maybe drama fatigue will escalate into
theater nervosa or even theater delirium, a condition in which
overwrought reviewers start muddling plays with their own feverish
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Does it sound chauvinistic or triumphalist to point out that
within eight or nine fall days London will see roughly one-sixth of
the new productions Broadway sometimes gets in a year? And I've yet
more boastful news to impart. Late October brings Nigel Hawthorne
to the Barbican in a role surely made inevitable by his starring
performance in ``The Madness of King George'': the most demented,
tormented monarch in dramatic literature, Shakespeare's King Lear.
In early December Maggie Smith comes to the West End in the latest
play by the author of ``King George'': Alan Bennett's ``Lady in the
Van,'' based on an aged eccentric who spent several years living in
the dramatist's own London driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Add Antony Sher's Macbeth, to be seen at Royal Shakespeare
Company headquarters in Stratford in November; throw in Helen
Mirren, who comes to the West End the same month in Donald
Margulies' ``Collected Stories,'' about a famous novelist and her
protege; finish off with Zoe Wanamaker, recently a successful
Electra on Broadway, as the rejected wife of Simon Russell Beale's
King George IV in ``Battle Royal,'' a new play due at the National
in early December; and it's clear that several important
performances are in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   Myself, I'm especially looking forward to another major event at
the National, the poet Ted Hughes' version of the first great
Western drama: Aeschylus' ``Oresteia,'' this time staged by Katie
Mitchell, who is maybe the brightest and most interesting of
Britain's younger directors. The first part starts previews as
early as Sept. 24, but not until the second is deemed ready will
both open officially, and that could be as late as early December.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What else will be joining Trevor Nunn's productions of Gorky's
``Summerfolk'' and Shakespeare's ``Merchant of Venice'' (Henry
Goodman a fine Shylock) at the National, Julian Barry's ``Lenny''
at the Queen's (Eddie Izzard funny and touching as the ``sick''
comic Lenny Bruce), the all-male ``Antony and Cleopatra'' (Mark
Rylance a sprightly queen of the Nile) at Shakespeare's Globe on
the South Bank, and London's other summer holdovers? Well, the West
End brings us a revival of ``A Penny for a Song,'' John Whiting's
charming tale of English eccentrics in the Napoleonic era
(Whitehall, Sept. 30); a revival of that great American musical
``The Pajama Game,'' directed by Simon Callow (Victoria Palace,
Oct. 4); ``Great Balls of Fire,'' a song-packed recreation of the
Jerry Lee Lewis story (Cambridge, Oct. 6); the imaginative touring
company Shared Experience in a version of Charlotte Bronte's ``Jane
Eyre'' (New Ambassadors, Nov. 25); and, at some still-unspecified
theater and date, a bunch of Noel Coward's livelier revue sketches,
``Masterpieces.''
</P>
<P>
   And by November, the Royal Shakespeare Company, which these days
spends its summers out of London, should be firmly ensconced in the
Barbican. After Yukio Ninagawa's production of ``Lear'' come
several transfers from Stratford, the most striking of which are
Aphra Behn's ``Oroonoko'' and, surprisingly, the latest of the
seemingly endless series of revivals of ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream'' to have hit London in recent years. ``Oroonoko,'' the
adaptation of a little-known story by the most famous of women who
were dramatists in the 17th century, is of exceptional interest,
involving as it does a black slave with moral and intellectual
gifts far surpassing the white colonials who exploit him. Michael
Boyd's revival of ``The Dream'' finds a powerful new eroticism in
the play, notably in Titania's amour with Bottom, which usually
packs the sexual charge of the ``Teddy Bear's Picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the most exciting work is often to be found in the
smaller London theaters, such as the Donmar, the Royal Court and
the Almeida. The latter will have the estimable Ian McDiarmid
playing the ferocious title role in Marlowe's ``Jew of Malta'' at
its home in Islington on Oct. 5. Covent Garden's Donmar becomes
rather more stellar on Nov. 9, since the major roles in Richard
Greenberg's tale of American fathers and sons, ``Three Days of
Rain,'' are being taken by Elizabeth McGovern and Colin Firth, who
played a sensuous Darcy in British television's version of Jane
Austen's ``Pride and Prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing in the British theater matters more than the
reopening of the Royal Court, which has been in exile in the West
End while its 400-seat playhouse in Chelsea has been rebuilt. After
more than $35 million has been spent on everything from offices to
a fly tower to a restaurant stretching beneath Sloane Square, the
place will be back in business this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The play won't be officially announced until Sept. 21, but the
word is that the favored dramatist is Conor McPherson, the
27-year-old Irishman whose ``Weir'' has recently proved quite a
success on both sides of the Atlantic. If he can produce anything
as stirring and unpretentiously wise this time, the omens for ``the
national theater of new writing,'' as the Court likes to style
itself, have to be good.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Congress returns this week from its August
recess, Republicans and the White House face difficult choices
between compromise and confrontation on issues from tax cuts to gun
control to regulation of managed health care.
</P>
<P>
   Over the break, Republicans also promised to begin a series of
contentious and, for the Clinton administration, potentially
embarrassing hearings into allegations that Russians laundered
billions of dollars through the Bank of New York, and into new
revelations about the siege of the Branch Davidian compound near
Waco, Texas, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The first big step, however, will be President Clinton's. He is
eager for Republicans to send him their $792-billion tax cut bill
so he can veto it on the ground that it is too expensive. After
that, the battle will begin over the fall's dominant issue: how to
divide the projected $3 trillion federal surplus among tax relief,
federal programs and debt reduction through the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had counted on whipping up support for their tax
bill in town meetings and other events across the country in
August. But the campaign apparently failed to stir constituents
from their summer diversions or to shift the White House's
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with polling data and past experience, the White House is
confident that the public is on its side on the issue of taxes and
spending. Clinton said in his weekly radio address on Saturday that
he would support a smaller tax package in return for Republican
concessions on Medicare, the federal health insurance program for
the elderly, including a voluntary prescription drug program for
senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there may be the basis for looking at a middle-class
tax cut at a level we can pay for, once we've done the important
things on Social Security and Medicare,'' White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said on Sunday. Lockhart said $300 billion is the maximum
tax relief the president is willing to accept.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans are divided over whether to adopt a
conciliatory approach and produce some legislative gains, or stick
to their core principles going into the 2000 campaign season. Aides
say that Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and some key Senate Republicans,
like Pete Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Budget Committee,
are willing to discuss a smaller tax package. But Rep. Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, the majority whip, and Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the
majority leader, are counseling a hard line, Republican aides say.
</P>
<P>
   Many congressional Republicans also express suspicions that the
president may be less interested in a grand bargain than in a
legislative train wreck that he and Vice President Al Gore could
use as a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This latest exercise is further proof that the president does
not want to admit that he is dead set against giving any tax relief
to married couples, small business owners, investors and millions
of other Americans,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who heads the
House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the greater worry both inside the White House and
among some Democrats on Capitol Hill is that the president, in his
eagerness to strike a deal, will compromise both his and his
party's principles, said one White House official. Aides are
working to make sure he does not reach an agreement that robs them
of a potent campaign issue, or that forces Democrats to choose
between their president and their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sorting out the nation's fiscal priorities into
the new millennium, Congress must pass 13 appropriations bills to
keep the government running after Sept. 30, the end of the current
fiscal year. The House has approved 11, the Senate nine. Only two
are ready to be sent to the president.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate, convening on Wednesday in what will be a
light first week back to work, each resumes work on spending bills
as the first order of business.

<P>
   Congressional appropriators have tried to devise a budget
beneath stringent spending limits outlined in the 1997 balanced
budget agreement, but they now concede it is likely Congress will
have to borrow from Social Security to pay for its operations next
year. Each party will likely blame the other if this happens.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the pressure on the budget caps, Clinton later this
month will request from lawmakers several billion dollars in
additional spending for fiscal 2000, including new money for
drought relief, aid to earthquake victims in Turkey and
peacekeeping and rebuilding efforts in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have a long list of non-budgetary priorities whose
fate remains in limbo, including gun control, managed-care
regulation and an overhaul of the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators are to meet this month to try to
reconcile juvenile justice bills. The Senate version tightens gun
control; the House bill is silent on the matter. The Senate has
approved a managed care bill; the House will likely debate and vote
on at least one version later this month. The House is set to
debate campaign finance next week; the Senate most likely will do
so in October.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders see little political gain in any of these
three divisive issues, and are likely to try to thwart all but the
most minimal changes.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats and White House aides acknowledge that
prospects are slim for any major policy achievements next year,
Clinton's last in office. So Democrats have a narrow window to
broker any compromises this year before the presidential campaign
season seizes all the political attention.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet the White House has signaled that it does not need
Republican cooperation to notch policy successes. ``If the
Republicans come back and they're not interested, and they want
gridlock, well, we're going to keep moving forward,'' Lockhart
said. The administration is considering executive actions on
initiatives like clean air regulations and parental leave.
</P>
<P>
   With such an ambitious fall agenda, few lawmakers or aides are
hopeful that the House, at least, will meet the Oct. 29 adjournment
date tentatively scheduled by Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the
majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, John Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont
McKenna College in California who follows Congress closely, summed
up his forecast for the fall legislative season in one word:
``Pain.''

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Go ahead. Start calling the Comets, who reached a pro basketball
milestone Sunday with their third straight WNBA world championship,
a dynasty.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After winning the league's first crown in 1997, the Comets have
posted regular-season records of 27-3 and 26-6, the latter under
the most difficult of circumstances. In the process, they've
annexed another couple of titles to establish what must be
considered a dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   And as scary as it may seem to some, there are plenty of signs
the Comets' indomitable spirit, tremendous talent and abilities
will keep ruling the WNBA for at least a few more years.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's 59-47 victory over the New York Liberty in front of a
wild sellout crowd of 16,285 at Compaq Center gave the Comets their
third silver Tiffany-designed trophy. There had been only three pro
basketball franchises before the Comets to win three consecutive
world championships.
</P>
<P>
   The famed George Mikan hook shot was the catalyst to the
Minneapolis Lakers' becoming NBA champs from 1952-54.
</P>
<P>
   After Bill Russell was drafted by the Celtics out of the
University of San Francisco, a string of NBA titles soon followed
to Boston Garden. The Celtics won eight championships in a row
beginning in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   And Michael Jordan put aside his endorsements and dark glasses
long enough to pilot the Chicago Bulls to three straight titles
from 1991-93 and again from '96-98.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Comets? There's no end in sight to how many WNBA
titles they can reel off.
</P>
<P>
   There were many disbelievers who predicted that because of a
league that got stronger from the influx of former American
Basketball League performers, the Comets were doomed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from the Yolanda Griffith-led Sacramento Monarchs and
the Los Angeles Sparks, who counted Lisa Leslie and ex-ABL
sidekicks DeLisha Milton and L'Keshia Frett among their numbers,
the doomsayers believed the Comets had an even greater foe to
overcome: Kim Perrot, the point guard who led the Comets to
back-to-back WNBA titles, had announced in February she was
battling lung and brain cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But after Perrot died Aug. 19, Van Chancellor _ the only Coach
of the Year the WNBA has known _ deftly guided the Comets through
the tail end of the season and the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly, the immediate future looks ripe for adding a
fourth crown.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Cooper, the two-time league Most Valuable Player,
three-time scoring champ and three-time Championship Series MVP,
will be 37 next season. She may not be as speedy as before, but, as
she is fond of saying, ``I haven't forgotten how to play the game
of basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   WNBA opponents have yet to figure out a way to stop her. Double
and triple teams are merely a challenge that test Cooper's
mentality and mettle yet falter in a hail of 3-pointers or driving
layups.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Cooper hasn't enjoyed a stretch like the three-game sortie
in her and the WNBA's ``rookie season,'' when, in the span of a
week, she scored 42 points at Sacramento, 40 at Phoenix, then a
WNBA-record 44 on a return trip to Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   But the night of Aug. 14, 1999, at Compaq Center won't soon be
forgotten. Twenty-four hours after her dear friend Perrot had been
airlifted from Mexico to M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Cooper scored
an amazing 42 points in a 71-53 Comets massacre of the Minnesota
Lynx.
</P>
<P>
   And she is just one part of the Comets juggernaut that returns
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Swoopes, runner-up for the 1999 MVP award and the first
player to log a triple double in the league, will be back at age
29.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Thompson, 24, twice an All-WNBA first-teamer who this year
made the second-team squad, brings back her 3-point bombs, powerful
inside moves and tremendous defensive acumen.
</P>
<P>
   How the rest of the 11-woman lineup looks lies largely in the
hands of the WNBA. Because of expansion by four teams next season,
there are a number of Comets who will probably find their way onto
other rosters.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no indication as to how many players each of the
present 12 teams can protect from the expansion draft. But the
draft process will be a direct determinant on the face of the 2000
Comets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we have to make a judgment as to how do we best
balance the need to make our expansion teams reasonably competitive
and yet give the existing teams the benefits of all their efforts _
in some cases over the past three seasons,'' said WNBA president
Val Ackerman.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, expansion by four teams _ and so quickly
following the addition of Minnesota and Orlando this season _ may
weaken the level of competition leaguewide. And that could be
advantageous to the Comets' hopes for a fourth title, depending on
potential realignment and several other factors.
</P>
<P>
   But the Comets have so far proved that no obstacle, on the court
or off, can keep them out of the WNBA throne room.
</P>
<P>
   And the Comets' dominance, said Ackerman, isn't all bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at it in a lot of ways as a plus, much like dynasties
in other sports have drawn attention, which has made people focus
on the excellence of the top teams,'' she said. ``I think the
efforts of Houston have been a positive for the league, and
particularly this year, when so many talented new players came into
the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that in the future, there would be some
additional opportunities for teams to get closer, and I do expect
that to happen. For now, I think this (Houston) is a great story.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When American bomb makers began visiting China in 1979, they
were startled by increasingly pointed questions that suggested
their Chinese peers were hot on the trail of the secret to building
a modern nuclear arsenal. The breakthrough allows H-bombs to be
made so small that many can fit atop a single missile or be fired
from trucks, submarines and other mobile platforms.
</P>
<P>
   China succeeded on Sept. 25, 1992, according to a spy who told
his American handlers that Beijing had exploded a bomb based on the
miniaturization secret.
</P>
<P>
   A team of scientists at the Los Alamos weapons laboratory in New
Mexico set to work on a whodunit with huge potential implications:
Was China's advance the result of espionage, hard work or some mix
of the two?
</P>
<P>
   Today, the debate rages on. Experts agree that spying occurred,
but clash violently on how much was stolen and what impact it had
on Beijing's advance, if any.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos team concluded in 1995 that China's stride was
probably based on espionage. A report this year by a congressional
committee that made the case public went further, claiming that it
would have been ``virtually impossible'' for China to have made
small warheads ``without the nuclear secrets stolen from the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional report unleashed a torrent of criticism from
scientists inside and outside the government who said the
importance of the espionage was overstated, and that China could
well have achieved the breakthrough on its own, as it insists
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   A review of the dispute, based on months of interviews and
disclosures of weapon and intelligence secrets, suggests that the
congressional report went beyond the evidence in asserting that
stolen secrets were the main reason for China's breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   The review also bolsters an important point of agreement among
feuding experts: that the federal investigation focused too soon on
the Los Alamos National Laboratory and one worker there, Wen Ho
Lee, who was fired for security violations. The lost secrets, it
now appears, were available to hundreds and perhaps thousands of
individuals scattered throughout the nation's arms complex.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials asked that some aspects of the spy case
involving weapons and intelligence secrets not be published, and
The New York Times agreed to refrain from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   For the Los Alamos team of detectives, the overall spy theory
was confirmed strongly in 1995 when the CIA obtained an internal
Chinese document that included a description of America's most
advanced miniature warhead, the W-88. Revealing for the first time
their top evidence in the case, the document's secret contents,
federal officials say the Chinese text cited five key attributes of
the warhead, including two measurements accurate to within four
hundredths of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   But the critics, who are also revealing new information, insist
that Beijing, even if it spied, made the miniaturization
breakthrough on its own, after pursuing it for at least 13 years,
from 1979 to 1992. The prowess of Chinese scientists, American
experts said, is suggested by a camera it built for photographing
nuclear blasts, which was far better than a similar one made by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need any help from us,'' said Harold Agnew, a past
Los Alamos director, visitor to China and federal intelligence
adviser. ``They're just curious, as we are curious about them.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Chinese spying has been blurred by issues that
range from Republican distaste for President Clinton's China policy
to allegations of racial bias in the investigation to fears among
scientists that the uproar is prompting security measures so tight
as to damage work, morale and recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   As in most spy cases, the evidence is open to interpretation,
some experts seeing the glass half full, others half empty.
</P>
<P>
   Several critics familiar with the Chinese document obtained by
the CIA said that its description of the American warhead, which
includes the size, shape and position of crucial components, was
not by itself sufficient to build a miniaturized warhead.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department official who supervised the Los Alamos
inquiry, Notra Trulock, agreed with this assessment but said the
information was secret and had never been mentioned in any public
document or Internet posting. Anyone who had it, he and his team
reasoned, must have also obtained access to a much broader range of
secrets about the warhead's design.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Trulock said in an interview, knowing the
approximate size and shape of the components provided a road map to
Chinese bomb makers, probably allowing them to skip years of
preliminary testing.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock added, however, that the congressional committee was too
categorical in its report, which was based in part on his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I testified, I used the appropriate caveats to express
uncertainties in our evidence and our conclusions,'' said Trulock,
formerly the Energy Department's intelligence chief. ``We typically
said: `Probably this. Probably that.''' The committee, he said,
``made judgments'' about the centrality of spying in China's
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., who was chairman of the
committee, defended the work of his staff of 47, which included no
one with nuclear design experience. The panel, he said in a lengthy
interview, drew largely on Clinton administration witnesses for its
expertise. The conclusion that espionage allowed Beijing to skip
decades of research, he said, was an appropriate one, based on the
government's own evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judgment matters,'' he said, responding to Trulock's
criticism. ``We don't know everything to a certainty. The question
is what is more likely than not.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Cox expressed surprise when told of the depth
and breadth of China's interest in the miniaturization secret. He
also played down the fact, reported by intelligence officials and
trumpeted by federal critics, that most of the world's nuclear
powers have figured out the secret of bomb miniaturization.
</P>
<P>
   Can China, Cox asked, ``develop it indigenously because France
did? That is a stretch. It's almost apples and oranges.''

 &HT;    Tearful Capriati seeks to look forward, not back
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jennifer Capriati, by reaching the fourth round, used
the 1999 U.S. Open to prove she's ready and finally able to take
her tennis game back to the top.
</P>
<P>
   But she proved in an emotional post-match news conference
Monday, after losing to fourth seed Monica Seles 6-4, 6-3, that her
psyche may still be too fragile.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati, 23, began by reading a prepared statement and then
telling reporters she wishes to ``close the envelope of my past''
and would no longer discuss the memories, matches, feelings or
details of her youth or two-year hiatus from tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of, every time I read something about myself, I
always read that little tidbit about the past,'' she said,
explaining why she made the statement. ``I just hope by doing this,
it will end that chapter and I can start new.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati spoke for about 10 minutes and explained that she
hasn't found healing in talking about her past ``I really thought
that's what it was going to do,'' she said. ``(But) I just really
didn't know how to handle it, just how to go about saying it,
afraid I was going to say something wrong. Maybe that's why I've
played with a lot of anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   She couldn't answer the next question, but it had nothing to do
with the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to start crying,'' she squeaked out before covering
her face. ``It's nothing bad, it's just . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati turned red and put her face on her arms on the desk in
front of her for several seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a little overwhelming, that's all,'' she said
through tears while her father and former coach, Stefano, stood
teary-eyed in the back of the room.
</P>
<P>
   A tour official asked if she wanted to end the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needs to be done,'' Capriati answered.
</P>
<P>
   But she continued crying and didn't move. The tour official
repeated that she could end the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish I didn't have to talk about this stuff all the
time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati looked again like the overachieving but overwhelmed
teenager whose career went from shining star to burn out in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   She turned pro in 1990, just before her 14th birthday, as one of
the greatest phenoms ever. She reached the semifinals of the French
Open a few months later and quickly became a media darling.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1993, her struggles began, in the form of shoplifting and
possession of marijuana citations and a night in jail. She lost in
the first round of the U.S. Open that year and didn't play another
professional match until February 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has played intermittently because of injuries
and motivational problems. This year, since March, marks the first
steady rise of her return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there is much mystery, much question to what happened,
and I must also say many lies,'' Capriati's statement read. ``Yes,
I made mistakes by rebelling, by acting out in confused ways. But
it was all due to the fact that I was very young and I was
experiencing my adolescence. Most of you know how hard that can be.
When you do it in front of the world, it is even harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Her time off did not involve ``reckless drug use, hurting
others,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a path of quiet rebellion, of a little experimentation
of a darker side of my confusion in a confusing world, lost in the
midst of finding my identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati called her past ``sacred'' and declined to answer a
question about a 1991 match against Seles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what happened with me doesn't happen too often,''
Capriati said.
</P>
<P>
   But other players talk about it almost as much. Andre Agassi's
career has been like a roller coaster. Steffi Graf and Mary Pierce
endured troubles with their fathers. Seles got stabbed and lost
years of her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine how tough that must be, having that done to
you,'' Capriati said of Seles. ``She was in no control over it. My
situation was different. I was in complete control or . . . I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the essence of the stories of athletes and even regular
folks is where they've been, whether in or out of their control,
and where they've ended up.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati will end up with a ranking in the low 30s after this
tournament. She said she plans to continue working hard on her
tennis, which improved more this summer than she had expected. The
match with Seles was a good one. Capriati fought back once in each
set to pressure Seles but said she needs more mental strength
against top players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little nervous there a few times in the match and just
didn't really know how to handle the big points,'' Capriati said.
</P>
<P>
   She hoped her statement would provide a cleansing moment for
her. It might not have done that, but the whole of her 1999 Open
did reveal an older, better-spoken Jennifer Capriati.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a new person completely,'' she said. ``I just feel
like a real mature adult now.''

UNDATED: and oranges.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The main evidence cited by Cox's committee was the Chinese
document obtained by the CIA in 1995 and a 1980s inquiry into
spying at the Livermore weapons lab in California that concluded
China had likely obtained design secrets of the neutron bomb. The
unclassified version of the report gave no details of the 1995
document's secret details about the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   The report was signed by the committee's four Democrats. But
immediately after its release, Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. of South
Carolina, one of the Democrats, criticized it as rushed,
superficial and exaggerated. The witnesses heard by the committee,
he added, ``did not have the technical background to fully assess
the nature or value of the information lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Spratt's critique has been echoed and amplified by a
range of top scientists and bomb designers who say Beijing could
have miniaturized its warheads on its own without spying.
</P>
<P>
   Richard L. Garwin, a physicist who has long advised Washington
on nuclear arms, recently on a bipartisan team led by former
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, said, ``There is no reason to
believe that China could not have built perfectly adequate
warheads'' for a range of modern missiles ``from nuclear technology
that it developed itself.''
</P>
<P>
   China, several officials said, simply went down the same path as
other nuclear powers, helped along by the general knowledge of what
the United States had achieved: proof that hydrogen bombs can be
made very small but nonetheless very powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every state has come to it,'' said one federal official,
referring to breakthroughs in atomic triggers by the Soviet Union,
Britain and France. ``Now they've got it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston T. Hawkins, head of international security studies at
Los Alamos, which is clearly on the defensive because of the spy
scandal, said the basic physics of bombs and missiles push weapons
designers in roughly the same direction. To obtain the best
performance, he said, engineers are invariably led toward narrow
nose cones about 16 degrees wide _ if cut from a pie, a very modest
slice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you realize that,'' Hawkins said, ``it drives every
nation down similar paths. Eventually, all weapons systems will
look alike. It has to do more with physics than espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   That view is not universally accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Henson, an intelligence analyst who first sounded the
alarm at Los Alamos, said there was nothing in the design of
missile nose cones that propelled a scientist to shape the core of
an atomic trigger into an oval.
</P>
<P>
   Do scientific and technical analyses automatically ``draw you to
a watermelon?'' he asked, alluding to the shape of the U.S.'s
top-secret design for its atomic trigger. ``That's not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond a shadow of a doubt,'' Henson added. ``Major
espionage took place.''
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence agencies are less categorical. Analysts
have concluded that espionage played a role in Beijing's advance,
but cannot identify a hard link comparable to the Soviet Union's
theft in the 1940s of the American design for the first atom bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a smoking gun,'' said a top administration
official who has closely scrutinized the secret data.
</P>
<P>
   A damage assessment by the American intelligence community, made
public in April, said a mix of espionage, openly available data and
scientific acumen had greatly lengthened Chinese strides. Stolen
secrets, it said, ``could help'' Beijing develop a mobile missile
and ``probably accelerated its program to develop future nuclear
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board,
which did its own investigation, said both congressional and
administration leaders had engaged in ``simplification and
hyperbole'' in the spy case. Neither dramatic damage assessments
nor categorical reassurances, it said, were wholly substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   And Hawkins said the specific secrets known to have been seized
by the Chinese, principally those detailed in the 1995 document,
would have been little help to a bomb maker, and far from Trulock's
road map. As for an H-bomb's innards, what designers call the
physics package, Hawkins said the documents ``describe nothing
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains unresolved how China got the W-88 secrets in the
first place, but a consensus is emerging that the search for the
leak narrowed too quickly to Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by the Senate as well as the president's foreign
intelligence board this year raised serious questions about whether
the FBI and Energy Department had too quickly focused on the
weapons lab. No evidence has pinpointed it as the leak's source.
Lee, fired this year from Los Alamos for security violations, has
not been charged with a crime and has denied spying.
</P>
<P>
   However Beijing made its miniaturization advance _ on its own,
by theft or a combination of the two _ it is apparently proud
enough to boast about it publicly, at least among its friends in
the mountains of New Mexico. Henson said a Chinese arms scientist,
Sun Cheng Wei, bragged of the breakthrough a few years ago at Los
Alamos, telling an open seminar that China had forged significantly
ahead in nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he said,'' recalled Henson, who attended the talk, ``was
that for a long time they were dealing only with round designs, and
then only watermelons.''

ROGERS HURLS SHUTOUT AS METS DOWN GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bit by bit, Kenny Rogers puts dings in the myth, each
strong outing burying the notion that there is something a little
different about him, something that prevents him from succeeding in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the cloak-and-dagger personality, the enigmatic hushed
answers, were left in the Bronx, because since arriving at Shea
Stadium in July, Rogers has been a mystery almost exclusively to
opposing hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the San Francisco Giants shook their heads at Rogers the
way the Yankees once did. Moving his pitches inside and out,
lulling the Giants with pitches that dotted the outside corner of
the plate only to freeze them by banging his best fastball of the
last month inside, Rogers threw a four-hit shutout and the Mets
won, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Mets' first complete-game shutout in a year and just
their third complete game of the season; Rogers has two.
</P>
<P>
   In his eight starts for the Mets, Rogers is 4-0 and the team is
7-1. The Mets remained four games ahead of the Cincinnati Reds in
the wild-card race and two games behind the Atlanta Braves in the
National League East before Atlanta's game Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine this success from Rogers, the man who admitted upon his
return to New York that it was important for him to prove to
himself he could succeed here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had an issue with where I pitched,'' said Rogers, who
pitched for the Yankees in 1996 and '97 and was acquired by the
Mets from Oakland. ``I think it was everybody else's hang-up. It's
New York, it's always different. Maybe it's a little more intense.
Sometimes you need this. I knew I could pitch here. I thought it
wasn't where I pitched. I thought it was how I pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be little doubt how he is pitching now, with
confidence and ease.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said that one of the most important things a pitcher can
do when he joins a new team is to earn his teammates' trust. Then
they will be relaxed when playing behind him and may even swing
more easily when they are at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel it when they have confidence in you and there's a
reverse,'' Rogers said. ``You can feel it when nobody has
confidence in you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers is familiar with both sensations, but with the Mets he
has given his teammates nothing but reason to relax and scoop up
the groundballs he produces. Since he suffered back spasms that
shortened his outing to three innings on Aug. 21, Rogers has
allowed just two runs in 241/3 innings, plunging his earned run
average as a Met to 3.15.
</P>
<P>
   Monday he had complete control of his fastball, sinker and
curve. Rogers struck out nine _ Barry Bonds went down three times _
and walked just one. He was moving the ball around the plate so
successfully _ particularly the sinker _ that the Giants were
helping him expand the strike zone, swinging at pitches that were
off the plate. And, because he is a groundball pitcher anyway,
Rogers was the beneficiary of the Mets' stellar infield, which
recorded 12 outs on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers held the Giants at bay while Rickey Henderson generated
enough offense to win the game. He hit a leadoff double and later
scored the Mets' first run in the sixth inning, then hit a two-run
single to shallow center in the seventh. ``This is a new Rickey,''
manager Bobby Valentine said. ``A reborn guy, a hitter who looks
like he has a lot left in the tank.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the report Valentine got about Rogers when the Mets
traded for him. Valentine was unconcerned about Rogers' history in
New York _ he was 18-15 with a 5.11 ERA as a Yankee _ only worried
about his arm. But Valentine said the people he talked to told him
Rogers' ``arm would have plenty of tosses left.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of them worked against the Giants, and his mastery of
Bonds, by keeping the ball bouncing around the plate like a
pinball, was exceptional. On the first strikeout, Rogers got Bonds
to chase an 87 mph fastball up. In the fourth inning, he stunned
Bonds with a four-seam fastball on the outside corner that Bonds
took for a called third strike. ``That's as good a pitch as I can
throw,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Mike Piazza said: ``The pitches Barry was looking for,
he was giving them to him. But they were a few inches from where he
expected them and he couldn't do anything with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' best inning was the ninth, when he retired the heart of
the Giants' lineup and, by his own admission, threw harder than
usual. He struck out Bonds first, this time by spinning him around
when he reached for an 88 mph fastball that was up. Jeff Kent went
next: after sinker after sinker, the strikeout pitch was a slider
that dropped away. Finally, Ellis Burks lined out to Robin Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, reliever Pat Mahomes walked by to give Rogers a tap,
and Rogers said to him, ``I told you I would give you the day
off.''
</P>
<P>
   He has had better stuff before, Rogers said, but this time he
moved the ball better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used both sides of the plate so well,'' Piazza said.
``Maybe there are two or three hitters in the history of the game
who can, but I don't think a hitter can cover both sides of the
plate. If he is hitting inside and outside and he throws the curve
for strikes, what do you look for?''

<P>
   When American bomb makers began visiting China in 1979, they
were startled by a series of increasingly pointed questions that
suggested their Chinese peers were hot on the trail of the secret
to building a modern nuclear arsenal. The breakthrough allows
H-bombs to be made so small that many can fit atop a single missile
or be fired from trucks, submarines and other mobile platforms.
</P>
<P>
   China succeeded on Sept. 25, 1992, according to a spy who told
his American handlers that Beijing had exploded a bomb based on the
miniaturization secret.
</P>
<P>
   A team of scientists at the Los Alamos weapons laboratory in New
Mexico set to work on a whodunit with huge potential implications:
Was China's advance the result of espionage, hard work or some mix
of the two?
</P>
<P>
   Today, the debate rages on. Experts agree that spying occurred,
but clash violently on how much was stolen and what impact it had
on Beijing's advance, if any.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos team concluded in 1995 that China's stride was
probably based on espionage. A report this year by a congressional
committee that made the case public went further, claiming that it
would have been ``virtually impossible'' for China to have made
small warheads ``without the nuclear secrets stolen from the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional report unleashed a torrent of criticism from
scientists inside and outside the government who said the
importance of the espionage was overstated, and that China could
well have achieved the breakthrough on its own, as it insists
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   A review of the dispute, based on months of interviews and
disclosures of weapon and intelligence secrets, suggests that the
congressional report went beyond the evidence in asserting that
stolen secrets were the main reason for China's breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   The review also bolsters an important point of agreement among
feuding experts: that the federal investigation focused too soon on
the Los Alamos National Laboratory and one worker there, Wen Ho
Lee, who was fired for security violations. The lost secrets, it
now appears, were available to hundreds and perhaps thousands of
individuals scattered throughout the nation's arms complex.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials asked that some aspects of the spy case
involving weapons and intelligence secrets not be published, and
The New York Times agreed to refrain from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   For the Los Alamos team of detectives, the overall spy theory
was confirmed strongly in 1995 when the CIA obtained an internal
Chinese document that included a description of America's most
advanced miniature warhead, the W-88. Revealing for the first time
their top evidence in the case, the document's secret contents,
federal officials say the Chinese text cited five key attributes of
the warhead, including two measurements accurate to within four
hundredths of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   But the critics, who are also revealing new information, insist
that Beijing, even if it spied, made the miniaturization
breakthrough on its own, after pursuing it for at least 13 years,
from 1979 to 1992. The prowess of Chinese scientists, American
experts said, is suggested by a camera it built for photographing
nuclear blasts, which was far better than a similar one made by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need any help from us,'' said Harold Agnew, a past
Los Alamos director, visitor to China and federal intelligence
adviser. ``They're just curious, as we are curious about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Deconstructing the damage wrought by espionage is an imprecise
art that mixes inference, evidence and deduction. In the vacuum
between what is known and what is suspected, personal, partisan or
institutional bias often rushes in.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Chinese spying has been blurred by issues that
range from Republican distaste for President Clinton's China policy
to allegations of racial bias in the investigation to fears among
scientists that the uproar is prompting security measures so tight
as to damage work, morale and recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   As in most spy cases, the evidence is open to interpretation,
some experts seeing the glass half full, others half empty.
</P>
<P>
   Several critics familiar with the Chinese document obtained by
the CIA said that its description of the American warhead, which
includes the size, shape and position of key components, was not by
itself sufficient to build a miniaturized warhead.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department official who supervised the Los Alamos
inquiry, Notra Trulock, agreed with this assessment but said the
information was secret and had never been mentioned in any public
document or Internet posting. Anyone who had it, he and his team
reasoned, must have also obtained access to a much broader range of
secrets about the warhead's design.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Trulock said in an interview, knowing the
approximate size and shape of the components provided a road map to
Chinese bomb makers, probably allowing them to skip years of
preliminary testing.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock added, however, that the congressional committee was too
categorical in its report, which was based in part on his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I testified, I used the appropriate caveats to express
uncertainties in our evidence and our conclusions,'' said Trulock,
formerly the Energy Department's intelligence chief. ``We typically
said: `Probably this. Probably that.''' The committee, he said,
``made judgments'' about the centrality of spying in China's
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., who was chairman of the
committee, defended the work of his staff of 47, which included no
one with nuclear design experience. The panel, he said in a lengthy
interview, drew largely on Clinton administration witnesses for its
expertise. The conclusion that espionage allowed Beijing to skip
decades of research, he said, was an appropriate one, based on the
government's own evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judgment matters,'' he said, responding to Trulock's
criticism. ``We don't know everything to a certainty. The question
is what is more likely than not.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Cox expressed surprise when told of the depth
and breadth of China's interest in the miniaturization secret. He
also played down the fact, reported by intelligence officials and
trumpeted by federal critics, that most of the world's nuclear
powers have figured out the secret of bomb miniaturization.
</P>
<P>
   Can China, Cox asked, ``develop it indigenously because France
did? That is a stretch. It's almost apples and oranges.''

 &HT;    Four receivers not enough, so Falcons scouting for more
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons pro personnel chief Ron Hill was
``crunching'' film Monday looking for wide receivers, and trade
talks continued in an effort to erase the biggest question mark for
the team.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, who begin the regular season Sunday in the Georgia
Dome against the Minnesota Vikings, have four receivers on the
roster, and it's one of the smallest and inexperienced groups in
the NFL. Starters Terance Mathis (5 feet 10) and Chris Calloway
(5-10) have a total of 836 catches in their careers. Reserves Tim
Dwight (5-8) and Ronnie Harris (5-11) have combined for 12.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Atlanta carried five wide receivers. Some teams carry
six.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Carrying four receivers) is not one of the more comfortable
things,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``It's difficult when you know
it's not the squad you're going to be with the whole time. You've
got to be flexible enough to make some changes later.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons began training camp wondering who would replace
starter Tony Martin, who was released in February in connection
with his legal problems, and now they have more questions.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight and Harris have outstanding speed, but Dwight has learned
speed doesn't overcome a lack of technique. Both are learning the
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've slowed down a lot,'' Dwight said. ``You don't have to be
fast to get open; you've got to be smart. I'll be in the slot a lot
more, and I've learned you've got to be more in control. I've tried
to harness my speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Passing game coordinator Jack Burns, who is in charge of
play-calling, said having four wideouts instead of five won't
change the Falcons' gameplan. The team typically dresses four
receivers per game.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that tight ends Brian Kozlowski, 6-3, 250, and
tight end O.J. Santiago, 6-7, 267, can split wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be in the same packages we normally would be,'' Burns
said. ``Brian can overlap and do some things for us there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't know what we're going to carry until maybe the end of
the week. We're not sure how many we'll carry, or what we'll do,
but whichever way we go, we'll be able to function.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL teams began assembling their practice squads on Monday
night, and there's a good chance Eugene Baker and/or Jammi German,
who were cut on Sunday, will return to the team that way. Both have
practice squad eligibility. Rondel Menendez, who will agree to an
injury settlement today, cannot be re-acquired.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons also could find a receiver recently released by
another team.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as no one gets injured, we should be OK,'' quarterback
Chris Chandler said. ``They're all good players. Maybe that's one
of the things to look forward to this season, to see how that story
goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis and Burns have seen improvement from the backups.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more confident, more aware,'' he said. ``Last year,
they were just running routes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim has the great push,'' Burns said. ``He gets defenders on
their heels, moving around, and then he can run past them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronnie can really run, too. He's fast enough to threaten the
goalline. He's much farther along than when he came to us last
year. He's also a little stronger physically.''

   THE SECRET: AMERICA SHRINKS AN ATOMIC MATCH
</P>
<P>
   From the dawn of the nuclear age, miniaturization has been an
obsession of weapon designers.
</P>
<P>
   The world's first atomic bomb, designed by the Los Alamos
laboratory and detonated in the New Mexico desert in July 1945 was
an awesome, but cumbersome affair. A lump of plutonium the size of
a softball was surrounded by a much larger ball of high explosives
that was 5-feet wide and made up of 32 explosive charges and 64
detonators. Big as a car, it could not have fit into a small
airplane, let alone a missile.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, American physicists made an important breakthrough: the
H-bomb. Roughly a thousand times more powerful than the first
atomic weapon, the hydrogen bomb was a two-stage device. Inside its
dense casing, an atomic explosion _ called the primary _ worked as
a match to kindle the fiery heat that touched off an even more
powerful detonation by the bomb's hydrogen fuel, which was known as
the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Size was an issue from the start. The first H-bomb stood two
stories high and weighed 82 tons. It would be militarily useful
only if it could be shrunk, and over the next few years, America's
best physicists set out to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   After considerable trial and error, American scientists figured
out that they could obtain the same kind of explosive power from a
smaller package. A main breakthrough centered on the large, heavy
atomic match. By shaping its plutonium fuel into an ovoid, roughly
like a watermelon, scientists were able to drastically shrink the
size and number of the explosives that triggered the nuclear blast.
</P>
<P>
   After at least one flop, the radical idea roared to life in July
1957 in a nuclear explosion in the Nevada desert, according to
Chuck Hansen, author of a detailed history of America's early
nuclear efforts. It had taken the United States a little more than
five years to move from the first H-bomb to its miniaturized
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   The development had profound implications for the Cold War's
nuclear competition.
</P>
<P>
   Shrinking the atomic trigger from something roughly the size of
a washing machine to something smaller than a football allowed
weapons designers to put thermonuclear arms atop small missiles
that could be launched from submarines or mobile platforms like
trucks. Arms would no longer be confined to bombers or fixed silos
in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The advance meant weapons could now be carried, quite
stealthily, closer to enemy shores and could be made safer from
attack. It also meant warheads could fit into the cramped spaces of
narrow nose cones, which streaked faster to Earth than blunter
shapes and were less buffeted by winds during the fiery plunge,
making them more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The first warhead in the new generation of weapons, the W-47,
was less than half the size of the bomb that leveled Hiroshima but
up to 80 times as powerful. In 1960, when the first Polaris
submarine put to sea, each of its 16 missiles was armed with a
W-47.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons continued to evolve and, by all accounts, the apex
was reached in the 1980s with the W-88, one of the most deadly
weapons in the American arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The warhead, made for submarines, first went to sea a decade ago
and is considered quite powerful for its small size. The precise
number is secret. But at least eight W-88s can fit atop the Trident
D-5 missile, which is less than 7 feet wide. Since Trident subs
have 24 missiles, a single submarine can carry up to 192 of the
thermonuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Today, American submarines on patrol in the Atlantic carry the
small warheads. And the Navy is adding them to its Pacific fleet,
so in the next few years the W-88 is also likely to be aimed at
China.
</P>
<P>
   THE CHINESE: ARMS ENIGMA GOES FAST AND SLOW
</P>
<P>
   China was late in joining the nuclear club, but showed
considerable skill when it did so.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing detonated its first bomb in 1964. The tricky design was
based on uranium, like the Hiroshima bomb, but saved costly fuel
and made the bomb lighter, increasing its military value.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney D. Drell, a Stanford physicist and Clinton administration
adviser, writing in ``China Builds the Bomb'' (Stanford University
Press, 1988), called the feat ``enormously impressive.'' Beijing's
first hydrogen bomb came just 32 months later.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the step from nuclear to thermonuclear took
London 66 months, Moscow 75 months, Washington 87 months and Paris
103 months, said Robert S. Norris of the Natural Resources Defense
Council, a private group in Washington that monitors nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   China set off just six test blasts to get to the H-bomb stage,
vs. 31 for the United States. That was typical. While developing at
least six types of weapons, Beijing over the decades conducted
relatively few nuclear tests, 45 in all, vs. 1,030 for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   China's nuclear force was modest. Starting in the 1980s, its
military deployed about 20 missiles that can now reach anywhere in
North America, each topped by a single warhead that can unleash a
force equal to up to five million tons of high explosives. That is
about 300 times stronger than the Hiroshima bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The big warheads are not particularly accurate, but they fit
China's professed war doctrine _ to fire nuclear arms only in
retaliation. The big missiles can, if necessary, hit a city.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence strongly suggests that, in this period, China had
no idea how to shrink thermonuclear arms. According to ``China's
Strategic Seapower'' (Stanford University Press, 1994), the warhead
for the submarine missile deployed by Beijing in the 1970s weighed
1,300 pounds _ more than twice the old American W-47, suggesting
the Chinese were still using a spherical atomic match to ignite
H-bombs.
</P>
<P>
   China's interest in building smaller weapons was spurred, in
part, by the United States' development in the late 1970s of a new,
high-accuracy design known as the Missile Experimental, or MX, that
bristled with 10 warheads. Though meant primarily to unnerve
Moscow, the weapon also worried Beijing, which quickly grasped that
its handful of big, land-based missiles suddenly looked like
sitting ducks that could be destroyed in a first strike of
precisely aimed H-bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's unease grew as the American Navy in the late 1970s
unveiled plans for a new submarine-launched missile nearly as
unerring as the MX and bearing an even more powerful warhead _ the
W-88.

   American intelligence agencies knew little about China's nuclear
program and modernization plans, if any, before President Richard
Nixon's visit to China in 1972. But the military ties that followed
the Nixon administration's diplomatic initiative opened the door.

UNDATED: the door.
<TEXT>
<P>
   By 1979, American nuclear arms designers and security experts
were starting to visit their Chinese peers, weapon labs and Lop
Nur, the sprawling site in China's western desert where prototype
nuclear weapons were detonated.
</P>
<P>
   From Los Alamos alone, at least 85 scientists and officials made
trips from 1979 to 1990, according to Robert S. Vrooman, a former
CIA officer who at the time directed counterintelligence at Los
Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Top visitors included Agnew, the past director of the weapons
lab; Danny B. Stillman, its head of intelligence; and George A.
Keyworth II, a physicist who later became President Reagan's
science adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits were judged to far outweigh the risks that arms
scientists in informal settings and conversations might, by
accident or design, give away secrets. And indeed, the Americans
learned much.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a huge intelligence game for the United States,''
said one U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``At the beginning we knew zip about China.''
</P>
<P>
   One discovery was that parts of the Chinese program were quite
advanced, including technologies for bomb development.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have excellent facilities, some better than ours,'' said
Agnew, who in 1979 and 1982 was among the first visitors.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, the Chinese were able to peer into fiery
blasts with an advanced camera known as pinex, revealing details to
aid warhead development. The American version of the device had one
axis, he said, the Chinese version two, doubling its usefulness.
``It's much better,'' Agnew said.
</P>
<P>
   The American visitors also learned much about what China lacked.
From a barrage of inquiries over the years, it became clear that
Beijing was eager to learn everything it could about shrinking the
atomic trigger. The questions were regular, increasingly pointed
and never answered, American officials said, insisting that Beijing
got no secrets that way.
</P>
<P>
   But in one case, investigators became suspicious about an
American scientist at the Livermore weapons lab in California who
in 1979 had talked with Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, born in Taiwan, never confessed. But some federal
investigators, in an investigation code-named Tiger Trap, feared
the scientist had compromised not only the design of the W-70, the
neutron bomb, but the secret to making small atomic triggers.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons experts say that the crucial insight of the watermelon
shape can be communicated with a few comments, a hand motion or a
simple drawing on the back of an envelope, although many years of
computing, calculation, experiment and factory labor would then be
needed to turn the idea into nuclear blasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real challenge is not in the design, it's in the
manufacturing,'' said Houston T. Hawkins, head of international
security studies at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, casting plutonium is difficult because of
uncertainties in how it reacts with other metals and materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange beast,'' Hawkins said of the dense metal that
fuels most atom bombs.
</P>
<P>
   THE BREAKTHROUGH: CHINA TAKES A GIANT NUCLEAR STEP
</P>
<P>
   China finally succeeded in exploding a miniaturized bomb on
Sept. 25, 1992, American officials revealed. It took intelligence
analysts more than two years to fully understand what China had
accomplished, its feat becoming clear only after a Chinese nuclear
expert who had been recruited to spy for the United States
delivered an intriguing report to his American handlers.
</P>
<P>
   The spy said China's September 1992 test blast, which had been
initially viewed by American analysts as routine, was anything but.
The bomb detonated that day was miniaturized with a core, the spy
said, in the distinctive shape of an oval, indicating China had
begun to master the art of making modern warheads.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, the task of tracking the technical ins and
outs of other nations' nuclear programs fell to the national
weapons labs. Among the sleuths was Dr. Robert M. Henson, an
experienced weapons designer at Los Alamos who had been analyzing
intelligence on foreign programs since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1995, Henson said in an interview, he began looking
more closely at how China had cracked the miniaturization puzzle.
For help he turned to Lawrence A. Booth, a friend who specialized
in Russian analyses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept looking into it for two weeks,'' Henson recalled.
``Then, we decided to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   They drew up their analysis and eventually took it to Trulock,
who the previous year had become director of intelligence at the
Energy Department, which oversees Los Alamos. Trulock, who has a
bachelor's degree in political science and no formal technical
training, said he wanted to bring in other nuclear experts,
particularly ones who had long experience in developing the
miniaturized nuclear triggers for H-bombs. John L. Richter of Los
Alamos, a scientist who filled that void, joined the team.
</P>
<P>
   The group looked more closely at a clue provided by the Chinese
spy, who described the size of the bomb's atomic core with an
analogy to a common household object, officials said in a new
disclosure. Working from that, the scientists calculated a more
precise size and Henson and Richter went through the American
stockpile of nuclear arms, looking up measurements to see if any
matched.
</P>
<P>
   The atomic trigger of the W-88, they discovered, was close
enough in size to raise suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department held meetings in which the Los Alamos team
was joined by analysts from the CIA and the Defense Intelligence
Agency. Federal officials now say the intelligence agencies were
skeptical, reasoning that too much was being made of a foreigner's
rough analogy. But the Energy Department and the Los Alamos team
felt the evidence was provocative.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came in 1995, as has been previously disclosed,
when a Chinese government official sent a package of secret Chinese
documents to American officials.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock said the document, dated 1988, laid out China's nuclear
modernization plans for Beijing's First Ministry of Machine
Building, which, among other things, made missiles and nose cones.
It not only described China's plans but compared them to the
nuclear arms of the American arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively crude hand drawings sketched out the nose cones
enveloping the W-88, the W-87, the W-78, the W-76, the W-62 and the
W-56 _ warheads of the Trident, MX and Minuteman missiles _ and
also gave their overall weights and dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, these were not damning. Though still officially
classified secret in some cases, such information by then was
widely available in many unclassified American papers and articles.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese document, some 20 pages in translation, went on
to give sensitive data about the W-88, federal officials revealed.
It accurately described the shape of the atomic trigger as not
spherical and said it was situated in the nose cone's narrow
forward end _ an arrangement used in some but not all American
warheads. And it correctly described the nuclear fuel, or
secondary, as having a spherical shape.
</P>
<P>
   More unsettling to the team, it described the width of the
casing that surrounds the atomic trigger to within a millimeter, or
four hundredths of an inch. ``That's pretty damn accurate,''
Trulock recalled.
</P>
<P>
   A senior federal official agreed. ``That opened eyes,'' he
recalled. ``It seemed to confirm earlier assessments that had
seemed insubstantial.''

UNDATED: seemed insubstantial.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trulock said his team later found that the Chinese document also
gave a similarly exact measure for the width of the W-88s
secondary, or hydrogen stage. ``Primaries are the long pole in the
tent,'' he said, referring to the importance of the atomic trigger.
``But that measurement was as good as the one for the primary.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA eventually concluded that the agent who sent the
documents was acting under instruction of Chinese intelligence. No
one has ever come up with a persuasive explanation of why China
sent the documents to American spies.
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 to 1996, American officials revealed, China used its
new atomic match to ignite a variety of hydrogen bombs, including
one similar in some respects to the W-88. After this series of
blasts shook the ground at the Lop Nur test site, China signed the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, signaling an end to its nuclear
experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   THE INVESTIGATION: FEDERAL SLEUTHS HUNT FOR A SPY
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department opened an investigation into the possible
theft of W-88 secrets on Sept. 28, 1995, and over the next three
years, federal officials quietly tried to find out whether there
was a Chinese spy in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   If espionage had occurred, Trulock and his team reasoned, it
must have happened between 1984, when the warhead entered
engineering development, and 1988, the date of the Chinese
document.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials focused on Los Alamos, which had
designed the bomb. They looked particularly closely at anyone who
had traveled to China in those years or met visiting Chinese
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman, then head of counterintelligence at Los Alamos and
later a vocal critic of the inquiry, said investigators scrutinized
only those people whose trips to China were paid for by the Energy
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Left unexamined, he said, were at least 15 additional people
whose trips were paid for by the Chinese, the CIA, the Air Force or
privately. These travelers tended to be top weapon designers and
high officials _ the people who knew the most American arms secrets
and had the most intimate contact with Chinese peers, Vrooman said.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1996, the Energy Department turned a list of a dozen
suspects over to the FBI, which began a criminal case that
eventually narrowed down to Lee, an American scientist of Taiwanese
birth working at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and his wife, Sylvia, had traveled to China in 1986 and
1988. Mrs. Lee was a secretary at Los Alamos who often met visiting
Chinese delegations. And Lee, though a mechanical engineer by
training and never a weapon designer, was familiar with the W-88
and many other nuclear arms and secrets (including the atomic
trigger advance) because of his work on secret computer codes.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI believed it had enough evidence to seek a secret wiretap
on Lee's phone calls, citing 20 reasons he was a prime suspect. But
the Justice Department found the evidence unpersuasive and would
not seek a court order for the eavesdropping, a routine step in
most spy cases.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman has charged that the inquiry was marred by a racist bias
to target Chinese-Americans, an assertion federal officials have
vehemently denied. But the Republican chairman and the ranking
Democrat of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which
investigated the spy case and heard testimony from Vrooman,
concluded that federal investigators had focused prematurely on
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   After the spy case exploded in public, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson recommended that Vrooman be disciplined for letting Lee
retain access to secrets even after doubts about him had been
raised.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, fired this year from Los Alamos for security violations,
has not been charged with a crime and has denied spying. After his
ouster, investigators found that he had loaded many secret files
onto an unsecured computer, raising the risk that they could fall
into the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry most likely would not have come into public view had
it not been for a series of unrelated disclosures about China.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, The New York Times reported that two U.S.
aerospace companies were under criminal investigation for providing
rocket data to Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
   A furor erupted in Congress. The House created a select
committee led by Cox, to look into whether the administration's
increasingly open policies on satellite exports had compromised
national security.
</P>
<P>
   There was no hint the committee would end up studying nuclear
bombs. None of its 47 staff members had any experience in atomic
design.
</P>
<P>
   Composed of five Republicans and four Democrats, the committee
did not learn of the suspected Chinese nuclear espionage until
October 1998, just a few months before its mandate expired. On Nov.
12 and Dec. 16 it held secret hearings in which Trulock was called
as the star witness.
</P>
<P>
   In January, after three months of investigation, the committee
completed a secret manuscript. In May, after a lengthy argument
with the White House over what could be made public, it released an
872-page report. The chapter on atomic espionage, just 37 pages,
garnered most of the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   In fiery prose accompanied by vivid color pictures and charts,
the committee charged that Chinese spies had carried off vital
secrets about seven of America's most advanced arms.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Republic of China, it alleged, ``has stolen
classified information on all of the United States' most advanced
thermonuclear warheads,'' leaping from the clumsy designs of the
1950s to those that are far more modern and deadly.
</P>
<P>
   The main evidence cited was the Chinese document obtained by the
CIA in 1995 and a 1980s inquiry into spying at the Livermore lab
that concluded China had most likely obtained design secrets of the
neutron bomb. The unclassified version of the report gave no
details of the 1995 document's secret details about the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   The report was signed by the committee's four Democrats. But
immediately after its release, Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. of South
Carolina, one of the Democrats, criticized it as rushed,
superficial and exaggerated. The witnesses heard by the committee,
he added, ``did not have the technical background to fully assess
the nature or value of the information lost.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   THE DEBATE: ANALYSTS SIFT FOR THE TRUTH
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Spratt's critique has been echoed and amplified by a
range of top scientists and bomb designers who say Beijing could
have miniaturized its warheads on its own without spying.
</P>
<P>
   Richard L. Garwin, a physicist who has long advised Washington
on nuclear arms, recently on a bipartisan team led by former
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, said, ``There is no reason to
believe that China could not have built perfectly adequate
warheads'' for a range of modern missiles ``from nuclear technology
that it developed itself.''
</P>
<P>
   China, several officials said, simply went down the same path as
other nuclear powers, helped along by the general knowledge of what
the United States had achieved: proof that hydrogen bombs can be
made very small but nonetheless very powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every state has come to it,'' said one federal official,
referring to breakthroughs in atomic triggers by the Soviet Union,
Britain and France. ``Now they've got it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins, the head of international security studies at Los
Alamos, which is clearly on the defensive because of the spy
scandal, said the basic physics of bombs and missiles push weapons
designers in roughly the same direction. To obtain the best
performance, he said, engineers are invariably led toward narrow
nose cones about 16 degrees wide _ if cut from a pie, a very modest
slice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you realize that,'' Hawkins said, ``it drives every
nation down similar paths. Eventually, all weapons systems will
look alike. It has to do more with physics than espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   That view is not universally accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Henson, the analyst who first sounded the alarm at Los Alamos,
said there was nothing in the design of missile nose cones that
propelled a scientist to shape the core of an atomic trigger into
an oval.
</P>
<P>
   Do scientific and technical analyses automatically ``draw you to
a watermelon?'' he asked, alluding to the shape of the top-secret
design. ``That's not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond a shadow of a doubt,'' Henson added. ``Major
espionage took place.''
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence agencies are less categorical. Analysts
have concluded that espionage played a role in Beijing's advance,
but cannot identify a hard link comparable to the Soviet Union's
theft in the 1940s of the American design for the first atom bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has come to the same conclusion,'' said a top
administration official who has closely scrutinized the secret
data. ``We don't have a smoking gun.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal intelligence study done last year, which the Cox
committee drew on, said American secrets lost between 1984 and 1988
let the Chinese ``accelerate their nuclear weapons program well
beyond indigenous capabilities,'' a view that echoed the original
Los Alamos finding.
</P>
<P>
   A damage assessment by the American intelligence community, made
public in April, said a mix of espionage, openly available data and
scientific acumen had greatly lengthened Chinese strides. Stolen
secrets, it said, ``could help'' Beijing develop a mobile missile
and ``probably accelerated its program to develop future nuclear
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board,
which did its own investigation, said both congressional and
administration leaders had engaged in ``simplification and
hyperbole'' in the spy case. Neither dramatic damage assessments
nor categorical reassurances, it said, were wholly substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   And Hawkins, the Los Alamos official, said the specific secrets
known to have been seized by the Chinese, principally those
detailed in the 1995 document, would have been little help to a
bomb maker, and far from Trulock's road map. As for an H-bomb's
innards, what designers call the physics package, Hawkins said the
documents ``describe nothing significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox insisted that highly classified intelligence data available
to his committee showed a more persuasive case than has emerged
publicly. ``There are more interpolating facts'' that closely tie
lost W-88 secrets to Beijing's advance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal official cited intelligence data about China's
atomic trigger showing it to be anything but an exact copy. ``It
turns out the W-88 is slightly smaller,'' said the official, who
believes Beijing may have made the advance on its own.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unresolved how China got the W-88 secrets in the
first place, but a consensus is emerging that the search for the
leak narrowed too quickly to Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by the Senate as well as the president's foreign
intelligence board this year raised serious questions about whether
the FBI and Energy Department had too quickly focused on the
weapons lab. No evidence has pinpointed it as the leak's source.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman, the head of counterintelligence at the laboratory from
1987 until 1998, noted that one secret document describing the
design of the W-88 warhead went to 548 mailing addresses throughout
the government and military. Some administration experts believe
the data described by the Chinese in the 1995 document came from
engineering plans or from secret manuals on military bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of information was widely available,'' said Drell of
Stanford, who served on the president's advisory board
investigation. ``The manuals that went out had pictures and
numbers. If a submarine came in, and there was a problem, they had
to know what they were dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   However Beijing made its miniaturization advance _ on its own,
by theft or a combination of the two _ it is apparently proud
enough to boast about it publicly, at least among its friends in
the mountains of New Mexico. Henson said a Chinese arms scientist,
Sun Cheng Wei, bragged of the breakthrough a few years ago at Los
Alamos, telling an open seminar that China had forged significantly
ahead in nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he said,'' recalled Henson, who attended the talk, ``was
that for a long time they were dealing only with round designs, and
then only watermelons.''

 By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a watershed ruling, the Israeli Supreme Court on
Monday unexpectedly outlawed the Israeli security service's
practice of using physically coercive interrogation methods that
critics have long denounced as forms of torture.
</P>
<P>
   A nine-judge panel led by Chief Justice Aharon Barak unanimously
banned several of the General Security Service's admitted
techniques for obtaining information from suspected terrorists.
These include violently shaking the suspects' upper torsos, forcing
them to crouch like frogs and shackling them in contorted positions
with opaque sacks over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling is unprecedented in a country where repeated
terrorist attacks have long created a perceived conflict between
the security interests of the state and the human rights of
suspects. Until this decision, the court has shied away from
imposing restrictions on Israeli security agencies, effectively
condoning their practices.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, civil rights lawyers were stunned when, years after the
lawsuits were filed but only four months after their hearing, the
court not only ruled decisively that the interrogation methods were
illegal but immediately enjoined the government from using them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly surprising,'' said Dan Yakir, lawyer for the
Association for Civil Rights in Israel. ``On the one hand, it was
the only legal decision they could have handed down. On the other,
the supreme court doesn't have a very impressive record in
defending human rights in light of security claims.''
</P>
<P>
   The court, clearly made uneasy that it had come to an
unequivocal legal decision, acknowledged mixed emotions in its
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deciding these applications weighed heavy on the court,'' the
decision said. ``Our apprehension is that this decision will hamper
the ability to properly deal with terrorists and terrorism, which
disturbs us. We are, however, judges. Our brethren require us to
act according to the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The supreme court suggested that the parliament draft
legislation if it wanted to override the ruling by sanctioning the
use of physical force in interrogations. Barak has long believed
the issue should be addressed in the legislature and not the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Minister Yossi Beilin is unlikely to advocate
legislation that undoes the court's ruling. Speaking from the Gaza
Strip, where he was meeting with his Palestinian counterpart,
Beilin, a political leftist, said he was ``very proud'' of the
court's decision to withdraw unconditional authorization for
routine use of coercive interrogation methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took a decision that was not easy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak issued a statement Monday night saying
that the decision appeared to be problematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``A way must be found to allow for interrogation when bombs may
be detonated in order to save lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government has long argued that forceful
interrogations are legal and desirable tools for extracting
information that can prevent terror attacks; violent shaking and
other techniques do not constitute torture, they say. Rather, they
are emergency methods when faced with suspects who know of a
``ticking bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, argued that the emergency methods were used
routinely, and that routine use is what the court outlawed Monday.
The judges still left the door open for agents to use these methods
when a bomb was really ticking, by suggesting they could invoke the
emergency conditions as a defense if criminal charges were later
brought against them.
</P>
<P>
   During the administration of former Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, the supreme court was under constant attack for being
too judicially active in matters of state and religion. It was not
immediately clear whether the change of government contributed to
Monday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Several right-wing members of parliament condemned the court
Monday, saying it had given improper weight to the human dignity of
terror suspects when compared with the security of Israel. Members
of the opposition Likud Party said they would immediately draft
legislation seeking to bypass the high court decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this response is dangerous, even absurd,'' said Yuval
Steinitz, a member of parliament from the conservative Likud Party.
``Israel is setting a precedent as a country losing its ability to
defend itself.''

</P>
<P>
   Many cases against the methods of Shin Bet, as the General
Security Service is better known, have been pending for years. The
judges combined seven in issuing their ruling. Among the
petitioners were human rights organizations, like the Public
Committee Against Torture in Israel, and individual Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   One, Hatem Abu Zayda, who challenged the Shin Bet's use of
interrogation methods such as sleep deprivation, shaking and
beatings, was later convicted and sentenced to 74 months in prison
for his activities as a member of the military wing of Hamas, the
Islamic fundamentalist group. The government argued before the
court that information obtained during Abu Zayda's interrogation
led to the thwarting of a terrorist plan.
</P>
<P>
   Another was a suspect who the Israeli government acknowledged
was shaken to death by Shin Bet agents during an interrogation, the
court said.

   In its decision, the court, although it detailed the history of
recent terror attacks, concluded that security agents can use no
more force than regular police investigators. It also described the
interrogation methods in unflinching detail.
</P>
<P>
   According to the court, forceful shaking, which causes the
suspect's head to whip back and forth, is the security agents'
harshest technique. The General Security Services claimed that
``shaking is indispensable to fighting and winning the war on
terrorism,'' the court said. Violently shaking suspects had allowed
agents to procure information that thwarted fatal attacks, the
government claimed.
</P>
<P>
   But the justices found that, ``Plainly put, shaking is a
prohibited investigation method. It harms the suspect's body. It
violates his dignity. It is a violent method which does not form
part of a legal investigation. It surpasses that which is
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges also described and proscribed an interrogation
technique whereby Shin Bet agents seat a suspect on a child-sized
chair that is tilted forward, tie one hand behind his back and one
behind the chair, cover his head with a suffocating sack and play
powerfully loud music for a protracted period of time.
</P>
<P>
   In criticizing the court's decision Monday, Gideon Ezra, a
member of parliament and former General Security Services official,
said that Shin Bet would find ways to get around the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that the GSS will find new methods,'' he said.
``Maybe they find a chair that is a little higher.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Dan Meridor, the former justice minister and
head of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, said the
decision ``constituted a certificate of honor for the state of
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Meridor recalled when Menachem Begin, a former prime minister,
summoned a security chief in 1977 and instructed him to use
``wisdom rather than violence'' in interrogations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps that was the first prime minister that gave an
instruction like this, more than 20 years ago,'' Meridor said.
``What the high court ruled is that in an interrogation, even
during a difficult war against terror where the interrogation is
vital, one must preserve basic standards of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from within and internationally, Israel has long
debated the legitimacy of the Shin Bet security agents' methods.
The government says they are used only rarely and under high-level
supervision. Human rights groups, however, say forceful
interrogation methods are used against hundred of Palestinians a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, a state commission began an inquiry into the
practices, and ended up legitimizing the security investigators'
use of a ``moderate measure of physical pressure'' as a last resort
to prevent violent attacks.
</P>
<P>
   International human rights groups considered this tantamount to
legalizing torture and kept up a steady stream of pressure against
the Israeli government, backing up the dogged efforts of Israeli
human rights groups who kept filing legal petitions.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, from London, Amnesty International officials called the
decision, which effectively overturns the state commission's
authorization of force, a milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under no circumstances can you torture,'' said Elizabeth
Hodgkin of Amnesty's London headquarters. ``That is what the
Convention against Torture, which Israel ratified, said, and now at
last the Israeli Supreme Court has concurred. What they've been
doing there is simply unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by Channel Two on Israeli television, Abdel Rahman
al Rahman, a former detainee who said he was subjected to physical
coercion by Shin Bet agents, did not applaud the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``A prize should not be awarded to the supreme court justices,''
he said. ``It's only natural that torture should not be allowed.''

POLICE CHIEFS SHIFT STRATEGY, MOUNTING A WAR ON GUNS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Minn., Ky., Mo., Va.)   (rk) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Baltimore, Police Commissioner Thomas C. Frazier has made
going after guns rather than drugs his No. 1 priority, reversing
longstanding policy.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisville, Ky., in a state with a strong gun culture, Police
Chief Eugene Sherrard recently joined a federal program that seeks
to trace all guns seized in crimes, in an effort to cut off the
flow of weapons from corrupt gun dealers to criminals and
juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   In Minneapolis, to discourage drug dealers and others with
criminal backgrounds from carrying guns, Police Chief Robert K.
Olson has his officers use routine traffic stops for minor
violations to search for weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Those actions are part of a little-publicized change on the part
of police executives across the nation. As Americans debate gun
control, those officials, in cities large and small, have made it a
major element of crime control, and have also emerged as an
important voice pushing for new federal and state gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Their new attitude about police work is summed up by Olson, who
says he frequently reminds himself that with crime, ``it's about
the guns, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   This is indeed a vast change, he says, because for many
officers, ``lock 'em up, punishment, was the whole approach of
police to crime'' only a decade ago. Large numbers of officers
believed then that it was un-American to talk about gun control, he
says, and that Americans needed guns ``to keep the commies from
coming up the Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   This Thursday, in contrast, about 50 police chiefs will
accompany their cities' mayors to meet with President Clinton at
the White House, and then go to the Capitol to lobby for a bill
mandating a background check on anyone buying a weapon at a gun
show.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has passed a juvenile-justice bill requiring such
checks _ and up to three days in which to perform them, just as at
federally licensed dealers _ but the House rejected the idea in its
version of the legislation after pressure from the National Rifle
Association, which objected to any waiting period longer than one
day. The purpose of the chiefs' lobbying is to get a conference
committee of the two houses to adopt that proposal and other
gun-control provisions included in the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, most police forces attached little importance to
tracing where a gun came from or trying to halt the supply of guns
to criminals and juveniles. When the police seized a gun, they put
it in an evidence locker and often resold it through a gun dealer.
This contrasted starkly with police work on drugs, where
investigators routinely offered reduced charges to low-level street
dealers in an effort to track down drug kingpins.
</P>
<P>
   The change in police attitudes began in the mid-1980s with the
dramatic rise in homicide brought by the crack cocaine trade and
the gun industry's introduction of rapid-fire, high-capacity
semiautomatic pistols, said Clarence Harmon, a career police
officer in St. Louis who rose to be police chief from 1990 to 1995
and is now the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every cop on the street was stopping somebody with a new
semiautomatic pistol _ the bad guys were better armed than the
police _ and we began to wonder what was happening,'' Harmon said.
``I issued an order, to trace every gun we find.''
</P>
<P>
   What his officers discovered, Harmon said, was that a handful of
corrupt gun dealers in rural areas were selling to straw purchasers
_ intermediaries buying on behalf of criminals _ or to traffickers,
small-time operators reselling the guns out of the trunks of their
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to believe that the gun manufacturers had to know that
certain dealers were selling to guys on the street, or ought to
know,'' Harmon said, leading him to favor requiring that gun makers
assume more accountability for the way their products are
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   What police chiefs were finding back then, said David Kennedy, a
senior researcher at the John F. Kennedy School of government at
Harvard University, ``amounted to a sea change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When they discovered that gun trafficking was a major national
problem,'' Kennedy said, ``it meant the issue was no longer about
the access of ordinary people to guns, but about a new kind of
crime: the crime of selling firearms to criminals and juveniles.
That was something law enforcement was eager to act upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward A. Flynn, the police chief of Arlington County, Va.,
agrees that the police have become more sophisticated about a need
for reasonable gun control as a part of crime-fighting strategy.
With that change, he says, the police have also become frustrated
by the terms of the gun-control debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to have a debate about gun control,'' Flynn said.
``The people on one side only want to talk about gun owners' rights
and the Second Amendment. That is not a debate about better crime
control.''
</P>
<P>
   The police in Boston and New York took the lead in going after
guns as a way to reduce crime, and other cities have followed ,
including Minneapolis, Indianapolis and Stockton, Calif. Another
recent convert is Baltimore, where Frazier has proclaimed his chief
priority is a focus on guns, not drugs, ``because it is gun
violence that affects our quality of life and causes the most
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot arrest our way out of the drug dilemma _ the courts
and jails are already overcrowded,'' Frazier said. ``So when I make
decisions about where to target my discretionary resources, our
tactical units or officers' time, we are going to focus on the guys
who use the most gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Frazier has set up a new gun unit; begun
tracing all guns seized in crimes, with assistance from the
Maryland State Police and the federal firearms bureau, and
undertaken a crackdown on gun traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the mayors and police chiefs will lobby this week for the
Senate bill requiring background checks at gun shows, some believe
the proposal is too modest, and will push for more steps.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon wants to end congressional restrictions that bar the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms from computerizing many of
its records, a ban that stems from political opposition to anything
with even a whiff of a national gun registry.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sanchez, the police chief in Denver, says that even the
three days that gun dealers are granted to complete the federal
``instant'' background check of prospective gun buyers does not
allow sufficient time to search court records. He would like a more
comprehensive system.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Louisville, Dave Armstrong, a former district
attorney and Kentucky attorney general, believes owners should be
required to register their guns, as they must automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   And in Minneapolis, Olson, previously the police chief in Corpus
Christi, Texas, and in Yonkers, N.Y., takes the staunchest
position, which, he says, ``America is not yet mature enough as a
society to accept'': a ban on the manufacture, distribution and
possession of handguns.

ISRAELI ARABS SUSPECTED IN CAR BLASTS, POLICE HINT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 3rd graf to fix typo in `Holy War.') (th) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli police said Monday that they were
holding five people in connection with two cars that blew up in
northern Israel on Sunday, indicating that they suspect that the
men in the cars were Israeli Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   A gag order barred public identification of the suspects or the
three men, apparently would-be bombers, who were killed in the
almost simultaneous blasts in two cities. But officials hinted
broadly that they were Israeli Arabs, drawing expressions of shock
and condemnation from Israeli Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
   If that is confirmed, it would be the first time that Arab
citizens of Israel have been known to be involved in car-bombing
attempts. Previous suicide bombings, which have killed scores of
Israelis in recent years, were believed to have been carried out by
Palestinians from the militant Islamic groups Hamas and Islamic
Holy War.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's blasts, the two occupants of one explosive-packed
car were killed and a woman passer-by, an Israeli Jew, was
seriously wounded in Tiberias, a resort on the Sea of Galilee. A
second car exploded almost simultaneously in the port city of
Haifa, killing its occupant.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions took place less than 24 hours after the signing
of a new Israeli-Palestinian agreement in Egypt, though it is not
clear whether the timing of the blasts was coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that Israeli Arabs, possibly members of the Islamic
Movement in Israel, might have been acting in concert with
Palestinian militants opposed to peace moves raised concerns among
Israeli security officials and leaders of the one million Israeli
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it indeed emerges that there is such a connection, then
there will be very deep concern,'' said Public Security Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami. ``If it turns out that this attempt is linked
organically to the Islamic Movement, we'll certainly have to draw
conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Arabs voiced worries that they would again be labeled a
fifth column, a charge that had faded during decades of civic
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arab community is stunned,'' Taleb a-Sana, an Israeli Arab
member of Parliament, said in a radio interview. ``A tremendous
effort has been made over dozens of years to consolidate our status
here, to build a relationship and positive coexistence _ to
struggle, but within the law and the democratic rules of the game.
Whoever carried out such an act is enemy number one of the Arab
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Arabs complain of discrimination in job hiring and in
budgets for their communities and schools, but few have been
convicted over the years of involvement in anti-Jewish attacks.
Last week, however, an Israeli Arab was arrested and confessed to
killing two Jewish hikers on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Although he apparently acted alone, officials and analysts
speculated that the men killed in Sunday's blasts might have been
recruited by Hamas or Islamic Holy War.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said that the groups might
have enlisted Israeli Arabs after encountering difficulties in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, where their operations have been
disrupted by Palestinian and Israeli security forces.
</P>
<P>
   A judge in Tiberias ordered the five suspects held in custody
for 11 days, pending an investigation. The Israeli news agency Itim
said they were members of one family and had denied any connection
to the explosions. A court statement said that material submitted
by the police pointed to a ``ticking bomb,'' or another planned
attack.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Residents of the Israeli Arab village of Daburiya, southwest of
Tiberias, said they had heard that two local men, Amir Masalha and
Jad Azaizeh, were believed to have died in the blasts, and that
their parents had been taken to identify the bodies and required to
submit to DNA tests for identification purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The men were described as religious Muslims with links to the
Islamic Movement, which carries out educational and welfare
activities and whose candidates have been elected mayors of Arab
towns and to Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Abdallah Nimr Darwish, the founder of the movement and a
leader of its moderate wing, said that violence should be firmly
resisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are actions from the fringe, but such acts should be
confronted with full force,'' he told Israel Radio. ``We're not
prepared to allow anyone to ruin the fabric of relations between
Jews and Arabs in the state of Israel. No bitterness in life
justifies taking someone else's life.''

   CHINA-NUKE (Undated) _ American bomb makers visiting China in
1979 were startled by a series of questions that suggested the
Chinese were hot on the trail of the secret to building a modern
nuclear arsenal, miniaturization. China succeeded in September
1992. Was China's advance the result of espionage, hard work or
some mix of the two? Experts agree that spying occurred, but clash
on what impact it had on Beijing's advance, if any. A review of the
dispute, based on interviews and disclosures of weapon and
intelligence secrets, suggests that the congressional report went
beyond the evidence in asserting that stolen secrets were the main
reason for China's breakthrough. The review also bolsters a point
of agreement among feuding experts: that the federal investigation
focused too soon on the Los Alamos Laboratory and one worker there,
Wen Ho Lee. A Special Report by William J. Broad. (The report has

<P>
   NEW YORK _ An intriguing fossil skull, presumably from a Homo
erectus and possibly a revealing piece of evidence for
understanding human evolution, has been found not on a parched hill
in Africa or along a river in Java, but at a cozy little shop on
the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   However the skull got there, and this part of the story is
murky, paleoanthropologists concluded last week that it is a
genuine specimen from Indonesia and could be critical in
determining the place of the Homo erectus species in East Asia on
the human family tree. Learning that is central to a scholarly
controversy over where and how modern humans, Homo sapiens,
evolved.
</P>
<P>
   The fossil arrived in March at Maxilla and Mandible, a shop
whose window display of bleached bones, mounted insects, animal
sculpture and other natural history curiosities has long made it
stand out among the neighboring toy stores and boutiques. It was
delivered, the shop owner said, by a mysterious man who said he
represented the estate of a collector of curios. But the shop
owner, in cleaning the material, recognized the skull as possibly
an ancient and valuable specimen.
</P>
<P>
   As scientists later determined, the dark gray skull apparently
belonged to a young male, probably in his 20s, but experts who
examined it inside and out were struck by some puzzling
characteristics. The individual's brain was small, about half the
size of Homo sapiens' brain but within the range for Homo erectus.
Yet he had a humanlike high forehead, not the sloping kind typical
of Homo erectus and other early hominids.
</P>
<P>
   A cast made of the inside surface of the skull revealed the
brain's configuration, which bore some resemblance to Homo sapiens'
brains. An apparent swelling in one region of the brain, scientists
said, suggested that the Homo erectus was developing the potential
for language and speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very interesting specimen because it's not like any
other Homo erectus we know from Indonesia or anywhere else,'' said
Dr. Eric Delson, a paleoanthropologist at Lehman College of the
City University of New York, who directed the investigation. ``Of
course, it's only one individual, but it could represent a
distinctive population. We just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   When he learned of the discovery, Dr. Philip Rightmire of the
State University of New York at Binghamton, a specialist in Homo
erectus research, said: ``Any new specimen is important. There are
just a handful of skulls from Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this decade, paleoanthropologists generally divided the
lineage of genus Homo into three successive species. Homo habilis
appeared about 2.5 million years ago, at the time of the first
evidence of stone toolmaking. Homo erectus, beginning about 1.8
million years ago, was the first to leave Africa, spreading across
Eurasia as far as China and Indonesia. The species was once thought
to be the direct ancestor of Homo sapiens.
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists are not so sure. Other distinct species may have
emerged and overlapped between Homo erectus and Homo sapiens.
Genetic studies point to anatomically modern humans' appearing
first in Africa some 100,000 years ago from descendants of the Homo
erectus population that remained there. The African branch of Homo
erectus is now usually labeled Homo ergaster to distinguish it from
the Asian species. If modern humans sprang from Africa, then the
Far East Homo erectus was probably an evolutionary dead end, though
a few scientists still think otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The rounded shape of the new skull and the inferred structure of
its brain, the examining team said, at least raised the question of
whether the Homo erectus of Indonesia was, in fact, evolving toward
a more modern human species. It is an intriguing thought, but the
scientists said it was premature to venture further along this line
of speculation.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, how the skull came into their eager hands is
mystifying enough.
</P>
<P>
   The story seems to have begun in 1997 near the village of Poloyo
on the Solo River of Central Java, in Indonesia. The region has
yielded several hominid fossils around Sambungmacan, Ngandong and
Trinil, including the first Homo erectus bones discovered by the
Dutch physician Eugene Dubois in 1891 and originally named Java
Man. Paleontologists said buyers often visit the area on the
lookout for fossil discoveries that might fetch a handsome price in
the bone trade at Jakarta or overseas. Scientists say they believe
a farmer picked up this new skull and found a buyer who paid cash.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the skull _ an almost complete cranium, but missing the
upper and lower jaws _ found its way in March to a shop that just
happened to be named for those missing parts. Maxilla and Mandible
also happens to lie at 451 Columbus Ave. between 81st and 82nd
Streets, half a block north of the American Museum of Natural
History, and has an owner, Henry Galiano, who is friendly with some
of the scientists there.
</P>
<P>
   Galiano said a man showed up with a car loaded with rocks,
minerals and tribal curios from Indonesia. The man said he was
disposing of material from the estate of a collector. People like
this often appear at the shop. Galiano said he had never seen the
man before or since and was not sure of the identity of the estate.
But he bought the lot, he said, and only then recognized the skull
as early hominid. It was covered in dirt, perhaps to disguise its
true nature.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Galiano saw Delson walking by the shop, he rushed
out with an invitation: ``Want to see something really
interesting?''
</P>
<P>
   Before he started Maxilla and Mandible 16 years ago, Galiano
worked in the paleontology laboratory at the American Museum and
got to know Delson, who is also on the research staff there.
Galiano said that he often turned over items of potential
scientific value to museums, especially anything related to
hominids.
</P>
<P>
   Delson and several colleagues soon realized that this seemed to
be an advanced Homo erectus or an archaic Homo sapiens. And their
inquiries to Indonesian paleontologists produced an exchange of
information and illustrations based on an earlier examination in
Jakarta. This showed that the Poloyo skull and the one from the
Manhattan shop were one and the same. The scientists and Galiano
agreed that the specimen should be returned to Indonesia.

</P>
<P>
   Dr. Teuku Jacob, a paleoanthropologist at Gadjah Mada University
in Jogjakarta, Indonesia, visited New York last week to confirm the
skull's identity. This might have been impossible if a dealer in
Jakarta had not invited an Indonesian physical anthropologist,
Doedhi Hartono, to examine it and publish an illustration and brief
description.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything matches,'' Jacob said of the specimen and the
published description. ``I am very certain this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacob said it was his understanding that the skull was sold to
American tourists and then disappeared, a not unusual fate.
``Almost all Indonesian fossils have strange postmortem
biographies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob joined American paleontologists in analyzing the fossil
and the brain cast obtained from the skull's interior surface. They
are preparing papers on their findings for publication as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Studying the actual skull and casts, the researchers noted that
the cranial bone was thick and the brow ridges well developed, both
characteristics of Homo erectus. The thickness and roughness of
certain points on the skull, indicative of the individual's muscle
development, were the main clues that this was probably a male. The
clearly defined sutures in the skull cap, where bone segments
fused, were apparently those of a younger person.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Broadfield, a graduate student at City University, said
the braincase examination revealed a high degree of cerebral
asymmetry, a differential development of the two sides of the
brain, that seemed advanced for Homo erectus. It also showed a bump
in what is known as the Broca's cap area of the brain, the seat of
language capability in modern humans. The combination of asymmetry
and a Broca's cap, he said, was rare in Homo erectus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not to say this guy could speak like a modern human,''
Broadfield said. ``But the potential is there for some higher
processing, some type of communication cognition, that we don't see
for other H. erectus specimens.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ralph Holloway, a specialist in paleoneurology at Columbia
University, is making a more detailed study of the brain case.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carl Swisher 3rd of the Berkeley Geochronology Center in
California will be analyzing sediment found embedded inside the
skull, which could yield chemical traces of the specimen's apparent
age. Delson's team said the skull could be anywhere from 100,000 to
1 million years old.
</P>
<P>
   At the Maxilla and Mandible shop last Monday, Galiano formally
presented the skull as a gift to Jacob for its return to Indonesia.
The shop owner would not estimate how much money his generosity
might have cost him, though some paleontologists speculated that
the skull might have commanded up to $500,000 on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a good relationship with scientists, and that
relationship is more important than the loss of a few dollars,''
Galiano said. ``Something like that skull should not be in private
hands, but in a proper institution in its proper country.''

SPORTS COLUMN: CAPRIATI STILL HASN'T MADE PEACE WITH HER PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TEN-USOPEN) 
(th) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once upon a fortnight, Jana Novotna's tears were even
more public than Jennifer Capriati's during a sad spectacle Monday
at the U.S. Open. They were global, on the shoulder of royalty, at
the tennis tournament that, for her, mattered most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to win Wimbledon,'' Novotna said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, five years after she choked her first chance away to
Steffi Graf and broke down in the company of the Duchess of Kent,
Novotna did claim victory on the hallowed Center Court grass,
enabling her to say Monday, with no regrets, that she would retire
from tennis later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Millions could tell you that Novotna should have beaten Graf in
the finals that July afternoon in 1993, and many would argue, given
her serve-and-volley skills, that she should have won more often.
</P>
<P>
   She was too fragile, people said. Didn't measure up to societal
champion standards. Novotna was here to have none of that. Tennis,
she said, had been her ticket out of Communist Czechoslovakia. It
had shown her the world, and made her fluent in English and more
than enough money and so many friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the one Grand Slam,'' Novotna said. ``I've had
a great, long and healthy career.''
</P>
<P>
   With her 31st birthday less than one month away, Novotna was
declaring that the only career definition that mattered was the one
she had made for herself. This is what is otherwise known as a
healthy life's perspective, a place that would some day be nice for
Capriati to reach.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time prodigy returned to the Open this year in vastly
improved shape, with a renewed competitive spirit. Her 6-4, 6-3
fourth-round defeat to Monica Seles was closer than it sounds, but
far more one-sided Monday was her long-time struggle to combat the
expectations of others. The fans. The agents. The sponsors. The
parents. The news media.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had prepared a 10-paragraph statement prior to the
Open to address her teen-age ``path of quiet rebellion, of a little
experimentation of a darker side.'' The week-long dilemma was when
to share it, when would be the best time, and the answer,
unfortunately, was that there was none.
</P>
<P>
   The statement rambling in generality begot a line of questioning
that ended with someone asking if Capriati viewed the news media as
an adversary. Suddenly, she looked more 13 than 23, the staged
performance dissolving into an improvisation of tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needs to be done,'' she gasped, her face in her hands, when
a tour attendant asked if she wished to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish I didn't have to talk about this all the time,''
she said, in what was less a contradiction, more of a plea.
</P>
<P>
   She was led into the corridor, into the arms of her father,
Stefano. His ex-wife, Denise, was nearby, crying. Parents who were
once painfully unschooled in adolescent psychology had suffered
dearly, and now, their daughter was still paying for her family's'
mistakes and her youthful transgressions, in the form of perceived
public debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much time do we have to punish her?'' Stefano Capriati
said later, outside in the warm afternoon sun. ``She did nothing to
except damage herself.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been wonderful, primarily for Capriati, if she
could have sat down, regaled the world with introspective insights.
Then again, Darryl Strawberry and too many soldiers of sporting
dysfunction have rehearsed the lines, mouthed the words, until
critics had to beg them to stop. Redemption is a process, not a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Capriati has shed 30 pounds to become a
competitive player again is its own example for others, and speaks
to a level of determination and courage. Yet the tears
unceremoniously shed suggested that 10 paragraphs or 10 hours Up
Close with Roy Firestone cannot set a time table for the emergence
of a secure young adult, independent of her folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult when you're young because it's hard to find a
place for it all,'' the 29-year-old sage, Andre Agassi, said after
continuing his stroll through the men's draw by straight-setting
Arnaud Clement. ``I find the position of media focus a good one. It
gives me an objective platform to look at myself without having to
take it personally. I feel like I can get a lot of opinions and not
care a damn if I don't want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefano Capriati said he hoped Monday's experience could be
cathartic for his daughter, a ``cure,'' as if the problem had been
a lingering case of acne, or a hitch in her serve. Maybe the
decision to placate the public was actually her's.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, if she is to get where Jana Novotna is, if she is to
walk away from tennis with any self-esteem, Jennifer Capriati will
realize that she needs to make her most convincing statements to
herself. &QL;

 &HT;    Border leaders give Bush mixed reviews
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Fresh from his success among Texas Hispanic
voters in the past fall's re-election bid, Gov. George W. Bush has
taken his Spanish-laced stump speeches to the national stage, and
the Republican Party sees him as a bona fide crossover hit.
</P>
<P>
   In his bid for the presidency, Bush is energetically courting
the nation's fastest-growing voting group. And he's creating great
expectations in key states such as California, where local GOP
officers consider Bush a potential savior as they try to patch up
relations with Hispanics following former Gov. Pete Wilson's
anti-immigrant crusades.
</P>
<P>
   The courtship hasn't been completely smooth. Bush has been
criticized by some Hispanic groups for skipping their national
meetings, and he disappointed some Texas border leaders who felt he
didn't support their agenda during this year's legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush used a speech before 3,000 people at the Latino
Business Association's annual meeting in Los Angeles to lay out the
first portion of his education platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was very, very important for him to be here, and I
think he did a good job,'' said Los Angeles insurance man Hector
Barreto, the association's chairman. ``One of the things people are
noticing about this candidate is, he is different. He is not the
traditional conservative Republican politician. His message is one
of inclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters, including Barreto, think the governor can
replicate the strong numbers he posted among Texas Hispanics in his
1998 re-election bid. One poll showed him taking 39 percent of the
Texas Hispanic vote. Another _ the one his campaign quotes _ gave
him 49 percent. Both numbers are unprecedented for a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   What's unusual is that Bush did it without tailoring his
positions or making specific promises to Hispanic voters, a
strategy that top Bush adviser Karl Rove said is at work again in a
presidential campaign targeting Hispanics nationwide. In Los
Angeles last week, Rove said it's a broad audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They share a lot of common values,'' he said when asked to
compare Texas Hispanics and California Hispanics. ``There is some
poll data that indicate that Latinos in California are more
Democratic in orientation than in Texas. In Texas, they tend to be
less affiliated with either party, or more likely to be less
partisan in their affiliation if they are Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   A foothold for GOP Last year, Bush translated his message into
Spanish in heavily Hispanic parts of the state, including the
border area, traditionally a Democratic stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spent a lot of time down here. That's unusual for a
Republican candidate,'' said Jerry Polinard, a political science
professor at the University of Texas-Pan American in Edinburg. ``He
was not pandering to the Latino vote; I think that was important.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign says the governor's core message, with its
emphasis on improving education, fighting crime and promoting
individual responsibility, resonates with Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Hispanic community, like communities all over
America, is responding to his message of prosperity with a
purpose,'' Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said. ``He is actively
reaching out to new faces and new voices as he campaigns for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Pete Gallego, a Democrat from Alpine, said Bush's
strategy of sticking to a broad message and making no specific
promises to border-area voters will translate well to a national
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of his strengths is, he's really good at generalities,''
Gallego said. ``He's good at painting a big picture and leaving the
details (to others). In Bush's case, I think (Hispanics will)
overlook a lot of the details because they think he's a good guy _
and he is,'' Gallego said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by the William C. Velasquez Institute of Hispanic
Voters in California and Texas showed Bush leading Vice President
Al Gore 40 percent to 38 percent in Texas but trailing Gore by a
2-to-1 ratio in California _ which, according to the institute, is
a good showing considering that California Hispanics chose
President Clinton over Republican Bob Dole by a 10-to-1 ratio in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, nowhere was Bush's reach into Hispanic Democratic
strongholds more stark than in El Paso and the Rio Grande Valley,
where Bush rebounded from his 1994 defeat by Ann Richards in those
regions to win the three most populous border counties.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some border leaders felt let down after Bush's big
buildup during last year's gubernatorial race. Although he didn't
promise specifics, many expected Bush's aggressive campaigning
would lead to his active support for their agenda, which sought
significant state money for roads, job training and economic
development on the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``George is charismatic, but looking beyond his charisma, I find
that he didn't do very much for the border,'' said McAllen Mayor
Leo Montalvo. ``Deliver, then ask for my support.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign points to his leadership on pushing through
legislation to help colonias, substandard housing developments
concentrated near the border. However, Montalvo and others thought
Bush should have stepped in when their $1 billion highway proposal
was being shot down by lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his misgivings, Montalvo doesn't think disappointing a
few elected officials on the border will put a dent in Bush's
appeal to Hispanics there or elsewhere. ``The issues get lost in
the shuffle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For some national Hispanic groups, Bush's lack of specifics on
some of their main issues _ and his absence at their annual
conventions _ have tempered their earlier praise for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His support among the Latino community is very real, but it's
also very fragile,'' said Lisa Navarrete, spokeswoman for the
National Council of La Raza, one of the country's most powerful
Hispanic groups.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Enrique ``Rick'' Dovalina, president of the League
of United Latin American Citizens, said the governor missed an
opportunity to explain his position on issues such as immigration
and school vouchers to thousands of politically active Hispanics at
LULAC's annual meeting last month in Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what his stance is (on those issues) because he
hasn't talked to us,'' Dovalina said. ``Right now, we're very
disappointed with the way he's parading around with his taco
politics. He doesn't have the Hispanic vote sewn up just because
he's speaking Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither LULAC nor NCLR is a partisan group, but neither has been
seen as friendly to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign said he is bombarded with requests to appear at
events and can't accept every one. The governor has gone out of his
way to meet with Hispanics around the country, said spokesman
McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Bush sought out Iowa Hispanics to urge them to vote
in the presidential straw poll. He has scheduled meetings with
local Hispanic leaders as he crisscrosses the country, and on
Friday returned to the border to attend the opening of a new
international bridge linking Eagle Pass and Piedras Negras,
Coahuila.
</P>
<P>
   In Starr County _ a Democratic stronghold where Richards beat
Bush by a 3-to-1 ratio in 1994 _ merchant Noel Benavides said he's
seeing underground support building for the governor. While
Democrat Garry Mauro also beat Bush soundly in Starr County in last
year's governor's race, the governor won 37 percent of the county,
up from 22 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people say they're Democrats, but when it
comes down to it, I get the impression from talking to people in
this area that they will vote for Bush,'' said Benavides, owner of
the J.C. Ramirez store in downtown Roma.

 &HT;    Williams advances, awaits Seles
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Powerful Serena Williams met her tennis opposite
Monday in the fourth round of the U.S. Open in 16th seed Conchita
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. resident eventually adjusted to
Martinez's unfamiliar and off-pace game, winning 4-6, 6-2, 6-2, but
it was not a pretty or particularly entertaining couple of hours of
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   For every moonball from Martinez, Williams would over-crank and
hit 6 feet out. For every swirling forehand from Martinez, Williams
would slow down and hit a dribbler that would run down her side of
the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, (it was) just a matter of making some adjustments,
getting my consistency together, getting myself together,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   She reduced her unforced errors from 21 in the first set to 17
in the second and 14 in the third. She also improved the number of
winners but still struggled to convert break points. She won just
5-of-15.
</P>
<P>
   And after just two aces in the first set, Williams hit 10 in the
final two sets, many at deuce or on other important points.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's stats changed little throughout the match, and she
finished with just seven winners to her opponent's 45.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these kinds of tests are important,'' Williams said.
``(They) can also kind of cut your career short, playing too many
hours out in the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was an important win for the seventh seed. It puts her
into her first Grand Slam quarterfinal in nearly two years on the
professional circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who is ranked No. 6 this week, plays fourth seed
Monica Seles on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really looking forward to it,'' she said. ``I love playing
Monica. Whenever we play, it's always very intense and very fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has won both times she has played Seles.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth seed Mary Pierce also advanced to her first U.S. Open
quarterfinal since 1994. She came back from a 0-4 lead in the
second set, and then set point down, to defeat unseeded Sabine
Appelmans 6-3, 7-6 (8-6).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think today was more of an intensity thing,'' Pierce said.
``Against someone like Sabine, you can't do that because she's a
fighter. I decided not to let it go any farther and wake up, just
try to win it in two sets.''
</P>
<P>
   Second seed Lindsay Davenport also managed to do that, holding
off a second-set rally by ninth seed Julie Halard-Decugis.
Davenport won 6-1, 6-2 and will play Pierce in the quarterfinals.

   Maddux goes 9 innings, gets win over Cards
</P>
<P>
   By Carroll Rogers
</P>
<P>
   Staff Writer
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The one thing the Braves needed on Monday night was
some distance, and not the Mark McGwire tape measure kind.
</P>
<P>
   The farther away they could get from that botched third strike
play on Sunday afternoon that cost them a win against Arizona in
the game, the series and off Randy Johnson, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Greg Maddux, his seven-game win streak and a fresh start
against the Cardinals on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Once again showing little problem with his bum wrist, Maddux
held off the Cardinals for a 4-1 win in front of 41,678, snapping a
two-game Braves losing streak and starting this series well.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mets' 3-0 win over the Giants, the Braves got to hold
at 2 1/2 games up in first place.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Maddux lost a game was when the Braves were
shutout by the Marlins Dennis Springer 2-0 on July 21 on the tail
end of that five-game losing streak on the roadtrip to open the
second half. The Braves haven't lost more than two in a row since
and Maddux made sure of it Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The National League's pitcher of the month in August made his
first September start a dandy, from allowing only three hits and a
run over the first eight innings to sitting down 23 batters in a
rowto collect his 18th win of the season. Two of the singles came
back-to-back which cost him the run on a Joe McEwing sacrifice fly
in the second inning. But McEwing became the first of 20
consecutive batters retired by Maddux as he and the offense
rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux had a 1-0 lead on a Gerald Williams homer to leadoff the
game _ which stretched his career-high season total to 13 _ and
lost it on that manufactured Cardinal run in the second inning. But
he got it back with a single up the middle in the third inning, his
11th hit of the season. He was bunted over to second, advanced to
third on a Bret Boone fly and scored on an infield hit by Chipper
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   First in line for forgetting Sunday was Eddie Perez, who was
charged with a throwing error on that critical play when Randall
Simon failed to cover first base. Perez helped that cause with a
bases loaded sacrifice fly in the sixth to stretch Maddux's lead to
3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones collected his 38th home run of the season and
third in the last two games to give Maddux a 4-1 cushion and help
seal Garrett Stephenson's fate. The Braves, who got past Stephenson
10 days before only after Bret Boone's heroics against the
Cardinals bullpen, handed Stephenson his first loss in seven starts
since he was recalled from AAA early last month.

UNDATED: the door.
<TEXT>
<P>
   By 1979, American nuclear arms designers and security experts
were starting to visit their Chinese peers, weapon labs and Lop
Nur, the sprawling site in China's western desert where prototype
nuclear weapons were detonated.
</P>
<P>
   From Los Alamos alone, at least 85 scientists and officials made
trips from 1979 to 1990, according to Robert S. Vrooman, a former
CIA officer who at the time directed counterintelligence at Los
Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Top visitors included Agnew, the past director of the weapons
lab; Danny B. Stillman, its head of intelligence; and George A.
Keyworth II, a physicist who later became President Reagan's
science adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits were judged to far outweigh the risks that arms
scientists in informal settings and conversations might, by
accident or design, give away secrets. And indeed, the Americans
learned much.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a huge intelligence game for the United States,''
said one U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``At the beginning we knew zip about China.''
</P>
<P>
   One discovery was that parts of the Chinese program were quite
advanced, including technologies for bomb development.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have excellent facilities, some better than ours,'' said
Agnew, who in 1979 and 1982 was among the first visitors.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, the Chinese were able to peer into fiery
blasts with an advanced camera known as pinex, revealing details to
aid warhead development. The American version of the device had one
axis, he said, the Chinese version two, doubling its usefulness.
``It's much better,'' Agnew said.
</P>
<P>
   The American visitors also learned much about what China lacked.
From a barrage of inquiries over the years, it became clear that
Beijing was eager to learn everything it could about shrinking the
atomic trigger. The questions were regular, increasingly pointed
and never answered, American officials said, insisting that Beijing
got no secrets that way.
</P>
<P>
   But in one case, investigators became suspicious about an
American scientist at the Livermore weapons lab in California who
in 1979 had talked with Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, born in Taiwan, never confessed. But some federal
investigators, in an investigation code-named Tiger Trap, feared
the scientist had compromised not only the design of the W-70, the
neutron bomb, but the secret to making small atomic triggers.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons experts say that the crucial insight of the watermelon
shape can be communicated with a few comments, a hand motion or a
simple drawing on the back of an envelope, although many years of
computing, calculation, experiment and factory labor would then be
needed to turn the idea into nuclear blasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real challenge is not in the design, it's in the
manufacturing,'' said Houston T. Hawkins, head of international
security studies at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, casting plutonium is difficult because of
uncertainties in how it reacts with other metals and materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange beast,'' Hawkins said of the dense metal that
fuels most atom bombs.
</P>
<P>
   THE BREAKTHROUGH: CHINA TAKES A GIANT NUCLEAR STEP
</P>
<P>
   China finally succeeded in exploding a miniaturized bomb on
Sept. 25, 1992, American officials revealed. It took intelligence
analysts more than two years to fully understand what China had
accomplished, its feat becoming clear only after a Chinese nuclear
expert who had been recruited to spy for the United States
delivered an intriguing report to his American handlers.
</P>
<P>
   The spy said China's September 1992 test blast, which had been
initially viewed by American analysts as routine, was anything but.
The bomb detonated that day was miniaturized with a core, the spy
said, in the distinctive shape of an oval, indicating China had
begun to master the art of making modern warheads.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, the task of tracking the technical ins and
outs of other nations' nuclear programs fell to the national
weapons labs. Among the sleuths was Dr. Robert M. Henson, an
experienced weapons designer at Los Alamos who had been analyzing
intelligence on foreign programs since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1995, Henson said in an interview, he began looking
more closely at how China had cracked the miniaturization puzzle.
For help he turned to Lawrence A. Booth, a friend who specialized
in Russian analyses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept looking into it for two weeks,'' Henson recalled.
``Then, we decided to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   They drew up their analysis and eventually took it to Trulock,
who the previous year had become director of intelligence at the
Energy Department, which oversees Los Alamos. Trulock, who has a
bachelor's degree in political science and no formal technical
training, said he wanted to bring in other nuclear experts,
particularly ones who had long experience in developing the
miniaturized nuclear triggers for H-bombs. John L. Richter of Los
Alamos, a scientist who filled that void, joined the team.
</P>
<P>
   The group looked more closely at a clue provided by the Chinese
spy, who described the size of the bomb's atomic core with an
analogy to a common household object, officials said in a new
disclosure. Working from that, the scientists calculated a more
precise size and Henson and Richter went through the American
stockpile of nuclear arms, looking up measurements to see if any
matched.
</P>
<P>
   The atomic trigger of the W-88, they discovered, was close
enough in size to raise suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department held meetings in which the Los Alamos team
was joined by analysts from the CIA and the Defense Intelligence
Agency. Federal officials now say the intelligence agencies were
skeptical, reasoning that too much was being made of a foreigner's
rough analogy. But the Energy Department and the Los Alamos team
felt the evidence was provocative.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came in 1995, as has been previously disclosed,
when a Chinese government official sent a package of secret Chinese
documents to American officials.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock said the document, dated 1988, laid out China's nuclear
modernization plans for Beijing's First Ministry of Machine
Building, which, among other things, made missiles and nose cones.
It not only described China's plans but compared them to the
nuclear arms of the American arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively crude hand drawings sketched out the nose cones
enveloping the W-88, the W-87, the W-78, the W-76, the W-62 and the
W-56 _ warheads of the Trident, MX and Minuteman missiles _ and
also gave their overall weights and dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, these were not damning. Though still officially
classified secret in some cases, such information by then was
widely available in many unclassified American papers and articles.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese document, some 20 pages in translation, went on
to give sensitive data about the W-88, federal officials revealed.
It accurately described the shape of the atomic trigger as not
spherical and said it was situated in the nose cone's narrow
forward end _ an arrangement used in some but not all American
warheads. And it correctly described the nuclear fuel, or
secondary, as having a spherical shape.
</P>
<P>
   More unsettling to the team, it described the width of the
casing that surrounds the atomic trigger to within a millimeter, or
four hundredths of an inch. ``That's pretty damn accurate,''
Trulock recalled.
</P>
<P>
   A senior federal official agreed. ``That opened eyes,'' he
recalled. ``It seemed to confirm earlier assessments that had
seemed insubstantial.''

UNDATED: seemed insubstantial.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trulock said his team later found that the Chinese document also
gave a similarly exact measure for the width of the W-88s
secondary, or hydrogen stage. ``Primaries are the long pole in the
tent,'' he said, referring to the importance of the atomic trigger.
``But that measurement was as good as the one for the primary.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA eventually concluded that the agent who sent the
documents was acting under instruction of Chinese intelligence. No
one has ever come up with a persuasive explanation of why China
sent the documents to American spies.
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 to 1996, American officials revealed, China used its
new atomic match to ignite a variety of hydrogen bombs, including
one similar in some respects to the W-88. After this series of
blasts shook the ground at the Lop Nur test site, China signed the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, signaling an end to its nuclear
experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   THE INVESTIGATION: FEDERAL SLEUTHS HUNT FOR A SPY
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department opened an investigation into the possible
theft of W-88 secrets on Sept. 28, 1995, and over the next three
years, federal officials quietly tried to find out whether there
was a Chinese spy in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   If espionage had occurred, Trulock and his team reasoned, it
must have happened between 1984, when the warhead entered
engineering development, and 1988, the date of the Chinese
document.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials focused on Los Alamos, which had
designed the bomb. They looked particularly closely at anyone who
had traveled to China in those years or met visiting Chinese
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman, then head of counterintelligence at Los Alamos and
later a vocal critic of the inquiry, said investigators scrutinized
only those people whose trips to China were paid for by the Energy
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Left unexamined, he said, were at least 15 additional people
whose trips were paid for by the Chinese, the CIA, the Air Force or
privately. These travelers tended to be top weapon designers and
high officials _ the people who knew the most American arms secrets
and had the most intimate contact with Chinese peers, Vrooman said.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1996, the Energy Department turned a list of a dozen
suspects over to the FBI, which began a criminal case that
eventually narrowed down to Lee, an American scientist of Taiwanese
birth working at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and his wife, Sylvia, had traveled to China in 1986 and
1988. Mrs. Lee was a secretary at Los Alamos who often met visiting
Chinese delegations. And Lee, though a mechanical engineer by
training and never a weapon designer, was familiar with the W-88
and many other nuclear arms and secrets (including the atomic
trigger advance) because of his work on secret computer codes.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI believed it had enough evidence to seek a secret wiretap
on Lee's phone calls, citing 20 reasons he was a prime suspect. But
the Justice Department found the evidence unpersuasive and would
not seek a court order for the eavesdropping, a routine step in
most spy cases.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman has charged that the inquiry was marred by a racist bias
to target Chinese-Americans, an assertion federal officials have
vehemently denied. But the Republican chairman and the ranking
Democrat of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which
investigated the spy case and heard testimony from Vrooman,
concluded that federal investigators had focused prematurely on
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   After the spy case exploded in public, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson recommended that Vrooman be disciplined for letting Lee
retain access to secrets even after doubts about him had been
raised.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, fired this year from Los Alamos for security violations,
has not been charged with a crime and has denied spying. After his
ouster, investigators found that he had loaded many secret files
onto an unsecured computer, raising the risk that they could fall
into the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry most likely would not have come into public view had
it not been for a series of unrelated disclosures about China.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, The New York Times reported that two U.S.
aerospace companies were under criminal investigation for providing
rocket data to Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
   A furor erupted in Congress. The House created a select
committee led by Cox, to look into whether the administration's
increasingly open policies on satellite exports had compromised
national security.
</P>
<P>
   There was no hint the committee would end up studying nuclear
bombs. None of its 47 staff members had any experience in atomic
design.
</P>
<P>
   Composed of five Republicans and four Democrats, the committee
did not learn of the suspected Chinese nuclear espionage until
October 1998, just a few months before its mandate expired. On Nov.
12 and Dec. 16 it held secret hearings in which Trulock was called
as the star witness.
</P>
<P>
   In January, after three months of investigation, the committee
completed a secret manuscript. In May, after a lengthy argument
with the White House over what could be made public, it released an
872-page report. The chapter on atomic espionage, just 37 pages,
garnered most of the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   In fiery prose accompanied by vivid color pictures and charts,
the committee charged that Chinese spies had carried off vital
secrets about seven of America's most advanced arms.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Republic of China, it alleged, ``has stolen
classified information on all of the United States' most advanced
thermonuclear warheads,'' leaping from the clumsy designs of the
1950s to those that are far more modern and deadly.
</P>
<P>
   The main evidence cited was the Chinese document obtained by the
CIA in 1995 and a 1980s inquiry into spying at the Livermore lab
that concluded China had most likely obtained design secrets of the
neutron bomb. The unclassified version of the report gave no
details of the 1995 document's secret details about the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   The report was signed by the committee's four Democrats. But
immediately after its release, Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. of South
Carolina, one of the Democrats, criticized it as rushed,
superficial and exaggerated. The witnesses heard by the committee,
he added, ``did not have the technical background to fully assess
the nature or value of the information lost.''

   THE DEBATE: ANALYSTS SIFT FOR THE TRUTH
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Spratt's critique has been echoed and amplified by a
range of top scientists and bomb designers who say Beijing could
have miniaturized its warheads on its own without spying.
</P>
<P>
   Richard L. Garwin, a physicist who has long advised Washington
on nuclear arms, recently on a bipartisan team led by former
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, said, ``There is no reason to
believe that China could not have built perfectly adequate
warheads'' for a range of modern missiles ``from nuclear technology
that it developed itself.''
</P>
<P>
   China, several officials said, simply went down the same path as
other nuclear powers, helped along by the general knowledge of what
the United States had achieved: proof that hydrogen bombs can be
made very small but nonetheless very powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every state has come to it,'' said one federal official,
referring to breakthroughs in atomic triggers by the Soviet Union,
Britain and France. ``Now they've got it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins, the head of international security studies at Los
Alamos, which is clearly on the defensive because of the spy
scandal, said the basic physics of bombs and missiles push weapons
designers in roughly the same direction. To obtain the best
performance, he said, engineers are invariably led toward narrow
nose cones about 16 degrees wide _ if cut from a pie, a very modest
slice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you realize that,'' Hawkins said, ``it drives every
nation down similar paths. Eventually, all weapons systems will
look alike. It has to do more with physics than espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   That view is not universally accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Henson, the analyst who first sounded the alarm at Los Alamos,
said there was nothing in the design of missile nose cones that
propelled a scientist to shape the core of an atomic trigger into
an oval.
</P>
<P>
   Do scientific and technical analyses automatically ``draw you to
a watermelon?'' he asked, alluding to the shape of the top-secret
design. ``That's not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond a shadow of a doubt,'' Henson added. ``Major
espionage took place.''
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence agencies are less categorical. Analysts
have concluded that espionage played a role in Beijing's advance,
but cannot identify a hard link comparable to the Soviet Union's
theft in the 1940s of the American design for the first atom bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has come to the same conclusion,'' said a top
administration official who has closely scrutinized the secret
data. ``We don't have a smoking gun.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal intelligence study done last year, which the Cox
committee drew on, said American secrets lost between 1984 and 1988
let the Chinese ``accelerate their nuclear weapons program well
beyond indigenous capabilities,'' a view that echoed the original
Los Alamos finding.
</P>
<P>
   A damage assessment by the American intelligence community, made
public in April, said a mix of espionage, openly available data and
scientific acumen had greatly lengthened Chinese strides. Stolen
secrets, it said, ``could help'' Beijing develop a mobile missile
and ``probably accelerated its program to develop future nuclear
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board,
which did its own investigation, said both congressional and
administration leaders had engaged in ``simplification and
hyperbole'' in the spy case. Neither dramatic damage assessments
nor categorical reassurances, it said, were wholly substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   And Hawkins, the Los Alamos official, said the specific secrets
known to have been seized by the Chinese, principally those
detailed in the 1995 document, would have been little help to a
bomb maker, and far from Trulock's road map. As for an H-bomb's
innards, what designers call the physics package, Hawkins said the
documents ``describe nothing significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox insisted that highly classified intelligence data available
to his committee showed a more persuasive case than has emerged
publicly. ``There are more interpolating facts'' that closely tie
lost W-88 secrets to Beijing's advance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal official cited intelligence data about China's
atomic trigger showing it to be anything but an exact copy. ``It
turns out the W-88 is slightly smaller,'' said the official, who
believes Beijing may have made the advance on its own.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unresolved how China got the W-88 secrets in the
first place, but a consensus is emerging that the search for the
leak narrowed too quickly to Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by the Senate as well as the president's foreign
intelligence board this year raised serious questions about whether
the FBI and Energy Department had too quickly focused on the
weapons lab. No evidence has pinpointed it as the leak's source.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman, the head of counterintelligence at the laboratory from
1987 until 1998, noted that one secret document describing the
design of the W-88 warhead went to 548 mailing addresses throughout
the government and military. Some administration experts believe
the data described by the Chinese in the 1995 document came from
engineering plans or from secret manuals on military bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of information was widely available,'' said Drell of
Stanford, who served on the president's advisory board
investigation. ``The manuals that went out had pictures and
numbers. If a submarine came in, and there was a problem, they had
to know what they were dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   However Beijing made its miniaturization advance _ on its own,
by theft or a combination of the two _ it is apparently proud
enough to boast about it publicly, at least among its friends in
the mountains of New Mexico. Henson said a Chinese arms scientist,
Sun Cheng Wei, bragged of the breakthrough a few years ago at Los
Alamos, telling an open seminar that China had forged significantly
ahead in nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he said,'' recalled Henson, who attended the talk, ``was
that for a long time they were dealing only with round designs, and
then only watermelons.''

AFTER BLOWOUT, IT'S A BYE FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC has plenty of momentum after its 62-7 rout of
Hawaii, but the Trojans will be forced to sit back and watch TV
this weekend with a bye on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   They return to action on Sept. 18 against San Diego State at the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get lax. Or just settle for this win,'' wide
receiver R. Jay Soward said. ``If we do play like we did, we'll
make football interesting in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans would rather play a game this week, something that
almost happened last spring when USC agreed to move up its November
game with Washington State to Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cougars were unable to get other opponents to agree to
alter their schedules, canceling the proposed early contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer to play, but a bye will help us,'' offensive
lineman Travis Claridge said. ``It'll help guys who are banged
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Road warriors: USC didn't let the atmosphere of playing in
Hawaii become a hindrance, which was a concern before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, we were prepared and ready to play,'' said
coach Paul Hackett said. ``We didn't let Waikiki and stuff on the
road distract us.''
</P>
<P>
   On target: Quarterback Carson Palmer has become so familiar with
the offense, Hackett has basically given him free reign to utilize
much of the playbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no limitations on the play calling,'' Hackett said.
``He is more in sync. All this offseason, the spring, the summer
and training camp have changed his dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Poll numbers: USC moved up three spots to No. 18 in the
Associated Press poll. It's still too low for Palmer, but he's
beginning to like the anonymity of being in the lower half of the
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we deserve some respect,'' Palmer said. ``Being (18th)
is not a whole lot of respect there, but I do like being in the
background, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He's back: The sentimental hero of the Hawaii game was tailback
Malaefou MacKenzie, who scored three touchdowns after being out the
final 12 games last season with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The butterflies came. I hadn't touched the ball in a year,''
MacKenzie said. ``It was exciting. I hadn't played in a while. I
just got the jitterbugs out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   With Frank Strong back in the doghouse after fumbling twice
against Hawaii, MacKenzie has no other competition for the role of
short-yardage tailback.

COMMENTARY: THE PERILS OF IGNORING JUNK MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt.)  (lb) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the record, Allan L. Jordan of Charlotte, Vt., is
not presented here as an unblemished hero, a woeful man whom the
unrelenting Furies of municipal bureaucracy set out to hound. On
the contrary, one could say that Jordan planted the seeds of his
own troubles when he tried to duck out on a parking ticket that he
got while on a visit to New York City in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Make that two parking tickets _ one on the Upper West Side, the
other in Greenwich Village. Jordan insists he never saw the one in
the Village. Maybe a prankster swiped it from the windshield, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   But he certainly knew about the other one and, like ticketed
drivers the world over who think they can skip town scot-free, he
chose to ignore it. Clearly, he underestimated the long reach of
the computer.
</P>
<P>
   The city's Finance Department, the parent agency of what is now
called Parking Violations Operations, tracked him down without
breaking a sweat. Letter after letter went out, informing him that
he owed the original fines plus penalties and interest _ a total of
$230 at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where it gets interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, 64, a builder by trade, says he never saw those dunning
letters, so he had no idea that he owed penalties or, for that
matter, that there was a second ticket. The reason he knew nothing,
he says, is that the letters came in bulk-mail envelopes bearing no
markings to indicate they were from an agency of the city of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing official-looking about them. The sender was
listed in the upper left corner only as ``Cooper Square Station,
P.O. Box 915, New York, N.Y. 10276-0915.''
</P>
<P>
   To Jordan, it looked like junk mail. And his attitude toward
junk mail is that it goes straight into the trash, unopened,
``everything from Ed McMahon to credit-card solicitations.''
</P>
<P>
   He discovered the city was after him, he said, only when his
wife, Gertrude, happened one day to open a ``Cooper Square
Station'' envelope. By then, he figures, he had chucked out half a
dozen such notices. On discovering that the Finance Department had
him in its sights, he paid the original $55 fine for the Upper West
Side summons. But he challenged the penalties and the theretofore
unknown Village ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the envelopes had said `City of New York' somewhere, I
would have opened them,'' Jordan said. ``We pay our bills.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, some will dismiss all this as an attempt to beat a
bill by a man who should have paid his tickets in the first place
and should have known that he risked penalties. Still, he has
raised an intriguing question:
</P>
<P>
   Should a person be held accountable for not recognizing a
government agency that does not announce itself?
</P>
<P>
   He and the city have exchanged many letters. Lately, the Office
of the Sheriff has warned _ in envelopes marked only ``Cadman Plaza
Station'' _ that his property could be seized. At no point, Jordan
said, has any New York official acknowledged his basic point about
junk mail.
</P>
<P>
   Does his argument hold water? You may not be shocked to hear
that law professors disagree with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Whelan of Fordham University, a friend of Jordan, saw
merit in the Vermonter's position. ``Decent notice is one of the
most fundamental components of due process of law,'' he said. But
Larry Kramer of New York University, while expressing some sympathy
for Jordan, said the city had good reason to expect a reply,
regardless of the envelope it used, because ``most people open
their junk mail.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is ``what responsibility each side bears,'' Kramer
said, and he believes that city officials ``haven't done anything
wrong, even if they could have done it better.''
</P>
<P>
   You may wonder why the city sends out important mail in this
fashion. Various agencies have used such envelopes in certain
situations since 1986, said Denise Collins, a spokeswoman for the
Department of Citywide Administrative Services. Experience, she
said, shows that people are more likely to open letters that do not
scream ``parking violations'' on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, Jordan said. But he is not one of those people.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some would advise him to pay up and get the city off
his back. ``But then,'' Jordan said, ``I would in effect be saying,
`Yes sir, I will open each and every piece of junk mail that comes
to my door,' which I refuse to do.''

ESPN TURNS 20
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A viewer would have to be pretty jaded to look at ESPN in the
twilight of the 20th Century and not marvel at its role in American
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Can you remember back to what TV sports was like before the
advent of cable and the Entertainment and Sports Programming
Network (ESPN)? Are your kids as shocked to learn the baby boomers
grew up without SportsCenter as you were when your parents said
they grew up without television?
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1979, baseball had this quaint game-of-the-week series
on Saturday afternoons. If you wanted to watch a USC or UCLA
football game, you usually needed a ticket. CBS used to televise
NBA playoff games on a tape-delayed basis.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN changed more than viewing habits. It changed programming
habits. ESPN and regional cable outlets changed the way leagues and
franchises look at their product, showing them how to enjoy the
riches of gate receipts and TV rights at the same time. It is now
more notable when a sports event isn't
</P>
<P>
   televised.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Dodgers, for example. When Walter O'Malley moved the
team west, he allowed only those games at San Francisco to be
televised locally. (He actually arrived with plans for a forerunner
of pay-per-view, but never overcame delivery problems.) In 1999,
around 140 Dodgers games will be televised, and the team itself is
owned by a media company (Fox).
</P>
<P>
   From an initial programming lineup that featured things like
monster trucks, softball and hurling, ESPN developed into an entity
strong enough to be purchased in 1984 by the dominant media company
of the time, ABC/Capital Cities, and then again in 1996 by the
dominant brand name corporation, Disney. Michael Eisner so loves
ESPN that it ranks higher on the Disney corporate ladder than its
over-the-air network, ABC.
</P>
<P>
   So when you tune in SportsCenter tonight, or ESPN's three-hour,
self-indulgent birthday special (4 p.m.), give the network its due
for all that it has accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   My personal appreciation changes direction when I consider what
ESPN has become.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a person or a product becomes part of the culture,
there is the danger of narcissism. ESPN is very smitten with itself
at the moment, and borderline arrogant. It takes several different
forms.
</P>
<P>
   Back when SportsCenter was the clearing house for news and
highlights, its anchors were dependable and unobtrusive. Fellows
like Bob Ley, the late Tom Mees, Charlie Steiner and even the
bombastic Chris Berman knew they were chauffeurs. If they were good
drivers at the same time, all the better.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere during the Keith Olbermann-Dan Patrick era, ESPN
drifted off the road. This tag-team took SportsCenter's substance
and gave it a sly personality. But it was always grounded.
Olbermann's historical and non-sports tangents always returned to
home plate, and Patrick's inflections were understated.
</P>
<P>
   Very little of SportsCenter now is understated. If the anchors
aren't yelling at the camera, they're showering you with personal
catch-phrases or styles that shudder in comparison to those of
Olbermann, Patrick and even (I can't believe I'm writing this)
Berman.
</P>
<P>
   An ESPN exec, after Olbermann departed for MSNBC (and then Fox),
tried to minimize the role of anchors by saying anyone could do
SportsCenter. Obviously, he is trying to prove this point by
putting just about anyone on air.
</P>
<P>
   With Patrick making a lateral move to ESPN radio, ESPN's
signature SportsCenter talents now are Stuart Scott (boo-yah), Rich
Eisen (Olbermann Lite) and the painfully droll Kenny Mayne. Eisen
is so much a copy of Olbermann that he's liable for trademark
infringement. And while I'm warming up to Scott, he needs to rotate
his boo-yah and cool-side-of-the-pillow sayings more often. I also
wonder if anyone else knows boo-yah can be dated to a '90s B movie
that featured late rapper Tupac Shakur?
</P>
<P>
   Back when it was a mere 10-year-old, ESPN's ``worldwide leader
in sports'' motto seemed bracing, a cool elbow in the ribs of the
over-the-air networks that had lost their punch to the kid with all
the inventory. ESPN was never brighter than during the too-brief
era when it aired the first two rounds of the NCAA basketball
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a stinky air to the same motto. The relationship
between ESPN and Major League Baseball, for example, was
deteriorating long before ESPN decided it could bid on the NFL
package knowing it would cause conflicts (on Sunday nights) with
its baseball package.
</P>
<P>
   And ESPN showed even more hubris when it matter-of-factly told
baseball it would move those games to ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN now uses its strength to muscle cable affiliates for higher
subscriber fees and channel space for other outlets which are of
little use (ESPNews). It has created restaurants, sports stores and
magazines, spreading its brand name with abandon, and always with
more style than substance.
</P>
<P>
   Disney views ESPN as a more valuable property than ABC, which
short-changes the once-proud reputation of ABC Sports and its
people. Disney wanted to put the ESPN brand on Monday Night
Football before, and it has treated several long-time ABC
sportscasters and production problem rudely.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of things to like about ESPN. ``Outside the
Lines'' is still a great series. Dick Vitale's heart still beats
pure for college basketball. The network still makes room for guys
like Charlie Steiner and Chris Fowler, and the occasional
ex-newspaperman, like Chris Mortensen. And the scope and quality of
the current ``Century'' series has been as good as any of HBO's
documentaries and Ken Burns' 18-hour baseball series.
</P>
<P>
   I just wish the network would get back to the things that made
it part of the culture, and less of a brand name vulture. After
all, it's 20 years old now. It's time to stop acting like a
teen-ager.

ANGEL TALK NOT TOO PLEASING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are jobs on this planet that inspire me to hyperventilate
just at the thought of having them.
</P>
<P>
   I'd rather be stuck in an elevator with Dick Vitale than be
forced to peddle cars and endure the constant rejection endemic to
such a pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Reading meters isn't exactly a stroll in the park, either, with
growling dogs nipping at your heels and killer bees now presenting
a possible new hazard.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure I have a steely enough constitution to be a prison
guard nor an imposing enough anatomy and the same goes for being a
short-order cook at a roadside hash house.
</P>
<P>
   As for being a cop, I get goose bumps at the mere thought
because that would mean having to grow a mustache. And, as for
being a fireman, such an occupation never even enters my mind
because I don't play checkers, pinochle or crazy eights.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'd prefer selling cosmetic products door to door, or
even locking down John Gotti, than do what the veteran radio
announcer, Larry Kahn, has been doing this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The ill-starred Mr. Kahn has served as the pre- and
post-game-show host on the KLAC broadcasts of the Anaheim Angels,
who have deteriorated into the Los Angeles Clippers of major league
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It's agonizing enough that Kahn must engage in Angel-oriented
talk for 30 minutes before the team goes out and embarrasses
itself, but then he must come back afterward and take phone calls
for an hour from fans disgruntled about the team's latest
misadventure.
</P>
<P>
   He has been following such a ritual week after cloying week,
Angel loss after cloying loss in a harrowing assignment rife with
futility, frustration and disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it mildly, it's been grueling,'' admits Kahn, who not
only has to discuss the Angels, which is difficult enough, but also
has to actually watch the sadsack team perform on a daily basis,
which has to be downright intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   And, working for a station that broadcasts the Angels, it is
Kahn's duty, of course, to put as positive a light on the team as
possible, a most daunting challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not Harry Houdini,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, what nice things can Larry Kahn say about these Angels?
That they forced their manager, Terry Collins, into a premature
vacation? That their latest loss was an improvement because it
wasn't as one-sided as the one preceding it? That Tim Salmon is
overrated and can't field? That Darin Erstad is a bust? That Garret
Anderson doesn't deliver hits when his team needs them most? That
Ken Hill should be released? That Chuck Finley is the team's only
legitimate starting pitcher? That the team would have been far
better off had it given Randy Johnson all the money it wasted on Mo
Vaughn? That the team is in desperate need of a second baseman and
catcher? That the team has become such an abomination that Disney
wants to dump it?
</P>
<P>
   ``You do get some bizarre calls,'' says Kahn, a 44-year-old Los
Angeles native who graduated from Fairfax High. ``The other night a
guy calls and says, `I got the solution to all the Angels'
problems.' I said, `Please, let us know.' And he says, `They gotta
move Darin Erstad to second base.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guy, `No way.' And he says, `Why not?' And I say,
`Well, he's left-handed, and left-handers don't play second base.'
Of course, I get some intelligent calls, too, but you get some that
get you to thinking about what direction our nation is headed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a guy earlier in the season who called in and said
the reason the Angels signed Mo Vaughn was to trade him to Toronto
for Roger Clemens, that the New York Yankees ruined the whole deal
when they gave up David Wells to the Blue Jays for Clemens. And
what's scary is the guy honestly believes that's what the Angels
intended to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahn has been around long enough the former USC football
announcer has been in the broadcasting business for a quarter of a
century to realize the sports team he's covering would prefer to be
described in optimistic tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to tell the truth,'' says Kahn. ``And that's what
I've attempted to do this season. I've never been pressured by any
Angel people in any respect, and Tony Tavares has been 100 percent
supportive of everything I've said. And there have been times when
I haven't said complimentary things.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time last week after the Angels had been swept by
the Cleveland Indians when Larry Kahn didn't mince words.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constant losing gets to you after a while,'' he says.
``The Angels were pretty bad in Cleveland, and I began my post-game
broadcast by saying, `I'm not going to sugarcoat this. This is a
bad Angel team.' Would you believe some guy calls in and takes me
to task? `Where do you get off saying that the Angels are bad?' he
said. `I think the Angels are a wonderful team that has been hurt
by untimely injuries.' The guy actually got mad at me for saying
the Angels weren't very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports talk radio, at its best, can become a tedious grind to
those behind the microphones who must deal with the opinionated
dim-wits with loud voices who delight in engaging in mindless
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   At its worst, it forces its interlocutors to discuss unappealing
subjects with unappealing people like poor Larry Kahn has been
forced to do throughout this undistinguished Angel season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five days after the season is over with I'm in Maui for 10
days with my wife,'' says Kahn. ``This has not been an easy gig.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd rather write a book on Mo Vaughn's favorite
culinary recipes all those Angel losses certainly haven't resulted
in any weight loss on Mo's part than spend my evenings taking phone
calls on the natural disaster that have become the Angels.

EDITORIAL: NO SURRENDER ON CLEAN AIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS `heaviest' in 2nd graf) 
(ATTN: Northeast, Midwest)  (th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Sept. 7:
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Air Act gives the federal Environmental Protection
Agency clear authority to deal with air pollution that blows across
state lines. This is a huge problem in the Northeast, where states
like New York cannot meet federal air quality standards because
much of their pollution originates in the Midwest and is thus
beyond their control. After ducking the issue for years, the EPA
last year produced a tough but fair plan, ordering 22 states east
of the Mississippi to sharply reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides,
the main cause of smog, beginning in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Although reductions would be required of every state, the burden
of the order fell heaviest on the Midwest and its older, coal-fired
power plants, many of which would be required to make expensive
investments in clean-air technologies. Predictably, the utilities
went to court, and in May a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia temporarily suspended
the order pending further arguments over the merits of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Because the case could drag on _ and indeed could eventually go
against the EPA, given the increasingly anti-regulatory bias of the
D.C. circuit _ the agency and some Northeastern states have been
seeking a compromise with the Midwestern states. Their goal, an
honorable one, was a negotiated agreement that could withstand
legal challenges and deliver at least some interim relief from
windblown pollution. But the Midwest wants many more concessions
than the Northeast is willing to offer, and at the moment the talks
are off.
</P>
<P>
   The talks should stay off. For one thing, negotiated solutions,
however well intentioned, have a way of getting re-negotiated
later, often for the worse. Second, any compromise _ even one
favorable to the Midwest _ is certain to be challenged by one
utility or another in that region. The EPA may thus find that it
has simply traded one lawsuit for another. Finally, as a matter of
historical justice, there is no reason for a compromise. The
Midwestern states have had a cushy ride for a long time. Their
older power plants were ``grandfathered'' under the Clean Air Act
in the expectation that they would be replaced. But nearly 30 years
later, they are still belching nitrogen oxides and sending them
downwind.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's 22-state plan would force these plants, over a
reasonable time frame, to make the kinds of investments in
pollution controls and cleaner fuels that they should have been
asked to make years ago. If the D.C. circuit strikes down that
plan, so be it. The EPA can then appeal to the Supreme Court or go
back to the drawing board. But there is no need to devise a lesser
plan until forced to.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has other weapons as well. Under the Clean
Air Act, as a legal hammer of last resort, the states that suffer
from windblown pollution can petition Carol Browner, the EPA
administrator, to impose controls on specific industrial sources
that are sending pollution eastward on the wind. The Northeastern
states have filed such petitions. All Browner has to do is act on
them. That will take courage. What administration official, a year
before a national election, wants to march into the states and
start telling its big utilities to clean up or close down? But it
is a far more admirable alternative than a mushy compromise.

 (ADDS details in   5th graf; ADDS 6th graf with unsure amount of
raises.) TENTATIVE PACT REACHED IN DETROIT TEACHERS STRIKE  
(lb) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The union representing Detroit's public school
teachers announced a tentative settlement on Monday night to a
strike that kept the city's 180,000 schoolchildren on an extended
summer vacation last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider it to be not only a victory for teachers but for
the students that we teach,'' said John M. Elliott, president of
the Detroit Federation of Teachers, which represents 11,500 public
school workers, including 8,000 teachers.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear when teachers will return to work, but they
could be back in classrooms as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The schools were due to open last Tuesday, but teachers refused
to return to work without a contract, defying union leaders'
recommendations that they grant a 10-day extension in contract
talks. .
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was unclear Monday night whether the tentative
three-year agreement would pass muster with the teachers and
support staff. The union leadership has scheduled a meeting
Wednesday morning, when the rank and file will be told details of
the agreement. and teachers will vote on whether to return to work.
No vote has been scheduled on the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for raises in each of the three years of the
contract. The size of raises was not clear Monday night, but union
leaders had said the amount in the final two years would depend on
prevailing wages for teachers in Detroit's suburban areas. The
disparity between Detroit teachers' pay and that in the surrounding
areas was a sore point in contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   The school board last week offered raises amounting to 95
percent of what the union sought, which would translate to salaries
of $35,600 to $64,000 a year depending on seniority for teachers
with master's degrees. The new offer improves on that slightly.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would also reduce class size starting a year from now
in 44 elementary schools where space is available for additional
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Some classes will be reduced to 17 students from more than twice
that size. In negotiations last week, the school board had only
offered to study class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   The school board leader, David Adamany, said Monday night that
the agreement would help the district retain experienced teachers
and ``moves us along the path of reduced class sizes.''
</P>
<P>
   Adamany added that the agreement included a number of measures
that would increase teachers' accountability for performance,
including ``the ability to close failing schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there's quite a bit of reform here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was announced on a day when more than 3,000
teachers marched up front in this union-proud city's Labor Day
parade.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations had floundered until this weekend, when they picked
up speed, perhaps prompted by state legislators' threats on Friday
to seek sanctions against the teachers, who were striking in
defiance of state law.
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 state law makes the strike illegal and punishes teachers
with fines of a day's pay for every day on strike.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This is not the first time this year that state legislators have
gotten involved in Michigan's largest school district. In March, a
new school board was appointed after the Legislature, controlled by
Republicans, voted to transfer control from an elected school board
to the mayor of Detroit, Dennis Archer, and the governor of
Michigan, John Engler.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Cleveland and five school districts in New Jersey,
state legislatures have similarly removed school boards.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have accused Detroit's school board of being
top-heavy and of mismanaging money and engaging in cronyism as the
schools largely failed their students. Just half the district's
students graduate from high school and only a third of the city's
seventh-graders can read or do math at their grade level.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Archer on Monday night expressed relief over the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real winners will be the children and parents of the
district and those of us who will depend upon the education that
they will receive, because they are the future of our city, state
and nation,'' the mayor said after the settlement was announced.
</P>
<P>
   The union said its strike was not in opposition to changes the
new board sought to help students.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strike was not about opposition to school reform,'' said
Elliott. He denied that the threat from legislators had
jump-started negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   While the Detroit Federation of Teachers initially supported the
new school board's efforts to improve the system, by this fall many
union members became worried that the board was ignoring their
concerns. Members of the union came to resent the refusal of the
board to bring their wages up to the median of teachers in
surrounding suburbs, which would mean raises of 2 percent to 10
percent, depending on seniority.
</P>
<P>
   Although many parents last week suddenly found themselves
searching for child care because of the strike, many parents in
this union town supported the teachers in their walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers last went on strike here in 1992.

STRAWBERRY TRIES AGAIN TO FACE DEMONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Cyclist Lance Armstrong rode out cancer's peaks and
valleys and received a conquering hero's ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Track and field star Ludmilla Engquist attacked cancer as though
it were just another hurdle to clear and was acclaimed far and
wide.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees outfielder and designated hitter Darryl Strawberry hung
in against cancer, fouling off its advances and eventually drawing
a free pass and all the pro-Yankee crowd at Edison Field could do
Friday was boo him.
</P>
<P>
   If Strawberry hasn't enjoyed a groundswell of sympathy these
past few months while battling back to the big leagues, it's on
account of the other progressive and often fatal disease he has
been battling in addition to colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, 37, was an alcoholic long before he felt the first
stabbing stomach pains that would lead to his cancer diagnosis this
past October 1.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, before he had finished his chemotherapy
sessions and shortly after he found out he hadn't made the Yankees'
opening-day roster, Strawberry was arrested in Tampa on drug and
solicitation charges.
</P>
<P>
   His body was cleansed of cancer, but it clearly continued to
crave the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry takes after his father that way. When the L.A. native
was 13, Henry Strawberry returned to the family's home in the
Crenshaw District in a drunken stupor, brandishing a gun. That
night Henry walked out of his family's life.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, Strawberry would follow his father into
alcohol's death trap. He started drinking fresh out of high school,
after the Mets made him the No. 1 pick of the 1980 draft and
promptly anointed him the next Willie Mays.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated stints in rehab, sobriety has eluded Strawberry
_ and, not coincidentally, so has Mays' legacy.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of hours before his second game of the 1999 season,
Strawberry sat in the visitors' clubhouse at Edison Field and
addressed his rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking in spiritual terms, not in the sports
vernacular, and his tone was so earnest you desperately wanted to
believe the old Darryl _ the one with nine lives and an apparent
death wish _ is gone for good.
</P>
<P>
   But the past is as insidious as cancer; it can never be
eradicated, it can only be kept at bay with due vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that even as Strawberry gave thanks for his faith and
the friends who have stuck by him, your mind was rewinding. It
stopped at this same spot five-and-a-half years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, then a Dodger, failed to show up for the club's
final spring exhibition game against the Angels, sending club
officials and his family into a panic.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry would surface the next day and promptly enter a
rehabilitation clinic. You ask him about that time and this place
and Strawberry brushes it off, this dirt on his soul, as
unselfconsciously as he would the soil on his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've moved away, moved on,'' he says. ``At this point, I'm
doing what I'm supposed to do and not what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't help but notice he looks you in the eye as he speaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a horrifying year Darryl's just gone through,'' says
Yankees manager Joe Torre, who knows firsthand of what he speaks.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Torre underwent surgery for prostate cancer and missed
the first 36 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``A doctor told me during my recovery, and it made sense to me,
that cancer is like diabetes. It's a condition you have to learn to
live with,'' Torre said. ``It's liable to show up any time. It
could come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the big ``C'' can hang above its survivors like a noose.
Every stomach ache, any little pain at all, transports you to the
dark place where fear resides. It creeps into your mind no matter
how hard you try to shut it out. You wonder, do you have the flu or
has the cancer come back to get you?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people,'' Strawberry says solemnly, ``don't understand
the magnitude of having cancer. It's not something you just get
over.''
</P>
<P>
   However sorry he was feeling for himself, there's no explaining
away the pain Strawberry inflicted on wife Charisse and everybody
who believed in him with his arrest in April. He served a 120-day
suspension levied by Major League Baseball, then worked himself
back into shape by playing 20 games with the Yankees' Triple-A
affiliate in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got weak, what can I tell you?'' Torre says wearily. ``He's
a human being. I know he'd like to turn the page, close that
chapter of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Strawberry and his wife are rehashing the whole
horrible experience. They are co-authoring a book, ``Recovering
Life,'' that is scheduled for publication in mid-November. Baseball
fans probably will find the subject matter _ Strawberry's quest for
spiritual centeredness _ a tad too dry.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. For Strawberry, the dry life is the only one worth
living. The high life is gone, replaced by endless AA meetings _
200 in a recent span of 90 days, Strawberry says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had taken care of myself better,'' he says. ``This
time around I looked at the enemy and it was me.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows he is lucky to be here talking at all, much less
playing baseball at its highest level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gift to be able to make it back and I accept that,''
Strawberry says.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a home run against the Angels on Sunday, his first since
August of 1998, and is batting a healthy .444 after five games.
</P>
<P>
   His swing has always been pure. Now if Strawberry can just
follow through on his intentions, there'll be no end to the
cheering. &QL;

CITY EXPANDS PESTICIDE CAMPAIGN AGAINST DANGEROUS MOSQUITOES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS spelling of repellent in 16th graf) (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City officials battling an outbreak of St. Louis
encephalitis expanded their campaign of aerial pesticide spraying
Monday to hundreds of acres of Bronx parkland along the East River
and Long Island Sound up to Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded spraying effort, which until Monday had included
the scattering of pesticides across parts of northern Queens and
the South Bronx, came as the number of suspected cases of St. Louis
encephalitis in the city rose Monday to 37 from 34, and the number
of confirmed cases held at five.
</P>
<P>
   Two elderly people have died of the mosquito-borne viral disease
and three other elderly people stricken with it remain in serious
but stable condition in city hospitals, city health officials said.
So far, the virus has afflicted people only in northern Queens. It
is possible that cases exist in the Bronx, but no cases have been
confirmed there, or in any other parts of the city or nearby
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani tried to ease residents' concerns about
the spread of both the virus and the spraying on Monday, calling
the broadened effort a preventive step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next couple of days we'll be doing some additional
spraying in the northern part of the Bronx,'' the mayor announced
at the emergency center the city has established near the
Bronx-Whitestone Bridge to help residents of the area. ``Caution
dictates that it would be better to continue to go further north
toward the Westchester border along the water.''
</P>
<P>
   But anecdotal evidence suggested Monday that public unease about
the spread of the virus was growing as people returned to the city
from the holiday weekend. City officials said an emergency phone
number they established to answer questions about the outbreak has
received over 11,000 calls _ the most of any such number in the
city's history.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The virus also became a political issue Monday with the Bronx
borough president, Fernando Ferrer, blaming budget cuts by the
Giuliani administration for eliminating mosquito spraying that
might have prevented the current outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of years ago there was spraying that was stopped in
the Soundview section of the Bronx,'' said Clint Roswell, a
spokesman for Ferrer.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Mullin, a city Health Department spokeswoman, said that
officials with knowledge of past spraying in the Bronx were not
available Monday. But she said that the Giuliani administration had
made efforts to control the mosquito population with pellets that
release a bacteria that kills the larvae in stagnant water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Health Department does respond to complaints about
mosquito problems,'' she said. ``Pellets are dropped in pools of
stagnant water.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that most mosquitoes did not carry the virus and
that the illness was not always fatal. In general, it was the very
young and the elderly who were most susceptible to the virus, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new aerial spraying in the Bronx on Monday night focused on
all parks between the Hutchinson River Parkway and the East River
and Long Island Sound, Giuliani said. By far the most spraying
occurred in the sprawling, 2,764-acre Pelham Bay Park, which
borders Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Although city officials said that malathion, the pesticide being
used, posed almost no health threat to people or pets, they
instructed residents of areas bordering the parks not to go outside
during the spraying, from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Residents were to turn
off their fans and set their air conditioners so that air only
exits their home.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   In the northern Queens and Bronx neighborhoods where aerial
spraying took place Friday and Saturday _ Whitestone, Auburndale
and College Point in Queens and Soundview, Classons Point, Harding
Park and Ferry Point Park in the Bronx _ city officials directed
their attack Monday against pools of stagnant groundwater where
mosquito larvae can hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters surveyed the area for stagnant family swimming pools
and officials offered to haul away used tires, in which water can
also pool and stagnate. Officials said that water should be emptied
from lawn decorations, jars, cans and clogged gutters and that
window screens should be checked for holes.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of anxious residents streamed into the command center
Monday that the city's Department of Emergency Management has set
up in College Point to explain the outbreak and hand out mosquito
repellent. By late afternoon, a tent that had held hundreds of
cases of repellent was nearly empty as city officials handed out
instructions in English, Chinese, Korean and Arabic on how to
combat the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been bitten by mosquitoes will not know for 10 to
15 days whether they have contracted the virus, according to city
officials. The symptoms can involve only a slight fever and a
headache. Or they can be far more serious, with severe headaches,
high fever, coma, convulsions, paralysis and even death.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said they were frightened by both the disease-carrying
mosquitoes and the pesticides sprayed across the neighborhood. John
Didio, 43, who grew up in College Point and has a 7-year-old
daughter and a 5-year-old son, said he was frightened by the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn off your fans and stay inside,'' he said, paraphrasing
instructions residents were given during the spraying. ``It's kind
of like germ warfare.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A nervous Enrica Naccarato, 45, a sixth-grade schoolteacher who
moved to the neighborhood last summer, said she was having her
8-year-old daughter stay at her mother-in-law's house in Long
Island until school begins on Thursday. ``It's a little scary,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another worried mother asked whether the bug repellent she had
put on her children in the morning would last through their
recesses at school. (City officials said it would.)
</P>
<P>
   Marie Cantatore, who arrived with her daughter Diane to pick up
bug spray and instructions, said she was bitten twice on Saturday.
``It's just scary,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter blamed the city for not stopping the outbreak
before it started. ``They never come to spray,'' she said. ``They
should've come a lot sooner.''

PRO-JAKARTA GUNMEN INTENSIFY REIGN OF TERROR

<P>
   HONG KONG _ Pro-Indonesia gunmen intensified a reign of terror
in East Timor Monday, herding thousands of refugees at gunpoint to
undisclosed locations, and raising fears of the slaughter of East
Timorese who voted for independence last week.
</P>
<P>
   Amid warning signs that vengeful elements of the military might
be creating a refugee crisis to sabotage the ballot results, or
even be plotting mass executions, pressure mounted on the United
Nations to send in peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses interviewed by telephone from East Timor's capital,
Dili, said hundreds of locals who had fled their homes were
captured and marched off at gunpoint Monday, while thousands more
were seized from shelters and loaded onto trucks bound for West
Timor, the Indonesian half of the island.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Kelly, a UN spokesman in Dili, said, ``We are being
informed that in the case of the evacuations it is a premeditated
scenario where authorities said that they expected to evacuate
200,000-300,000 refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, apparently moved to action by
the groundswell of international criticism, signed an order early
Tuesday imposing martial law in the disputed island territory.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, meanwhile, Monday endorsed an offer by
Australia to send its own troops to help quell the violence, as
long as Indonesia approves. The Australian prime minister, John
Howard, put troops on alert Monday, cutting the time needed to send
peacekeepers to nearby East Timor to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Australia-based East Timorese International Support Center
said more than 170 people were slaughtered by pro-Indonesia forces
Monday, but the figures were impossible to confirm. Witnesses in
Dili described the noise of frequent automatic gunfire,
rocket-propelled grenades, and bazookas.
</P>
<P>
   US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said the Indonesian
government must either ``take care of the violence or let the
international community be of assistance.'' But she did not suggest
that troops be sent against Indonesia's will or without UN backing.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia has said it would consider peacekeepers only after its
national assembly, due to meet next month, revokes a 1976 law
annexing East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   As the unarmed UN mission in East Timor evacuated nonessential
staff Monday, diplomats and East Timor resistance leaders
complained that the UN Security Council's reaction to the
post-ballot violence has been slow and weak. The Security Council
voted Sunday to send only a small team of ambassadors to Jakarta to
discuss the crisis with Indonesia's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Secretary General Kofi Annan, who briefed the five
envoys _ from Namibia, Britain, Slovenia, Malaysia, and the
Netherlands _ before their departure for Jakarta, said the
``present chaos in East Timor cannot be allowed to fester any
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   If Indonesia's declaration of martial law did not produce
results within 48 hours, he said, the ``international community
will have to consider what other measures it can take to assist the
Indonesians.''
</P>
<P>
   Ana Gomes, envoy to Jakarta from Portugal, East Timor's former
colonial ruler, accused the Security Council of inertia in the face
of slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is East Timor different with many other places where the
Security Council did not forget to fulfill its mission?'' she
asked. ``How many more people killed do you want to start acting?''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats acknowledged Monday that they had underestimated the
furious response of Indonesia loyalists to the landslide 79 percent
victory for independence in last week's UN-sponsored referendum on
East Timor's future.
</P>
<P>
   Jakarta must realize that it will pay ``a very high cost'' for
letting gunmen run rampant after a peaceful UN vote, said a senior
Western diplomat. ``They had to make a calculation _ how far are
they willing to go? Farther than we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   This morning, Indonesia released longtime resistance leader
Xanana Gusmao from house arrest in Jakarta, commuting the sentence
of the man widely seen as East Timor's most likely first president.
But supporters said going back to Dili now would be a death
sentence for Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, a seven-month campaign by pro-Indonesia forces to
derail the vote had crossed all previous boundaries. Gunmen burst
into the Dili home of Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, a Nobel Peace
laureate, firing automatic weapons and removing a few thousand
people who had been sheltered there, before burning the bishop's
residence to the ground, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pray for us _ please just tell the world what's going on,''
one man who was in the house said by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's official Antara news agency said about 30 people
died in the attack, and quoted East Timor police chief Colonel
Timbul Silaen as saying militias were looking for pro-independence
politicians in Belo's compound.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Robinson, a UN political officer holed up in the
besieged UN compound in Dili, said he tried frantically to reach
Belo by telephone when he heard the bishop was under siege. ``By
the time we got through to him, he was basically screaming down the
line to us, `We're under attack!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Police then took Belo by helicopter to the home of another
bishop in the eastern town of Baucau, authorities said. Bishop
Basilio de Nascimento told Portuguese radio that Belo arrived ``in
a state of shock.''
</P>
<P>
   In a predominantly Roman Catholic territory, the gunmen have a
``sense of complete impunity,'' Robinson said. ``Our growing
suspicion is that these are not the same militias . . . they are
not local lads. They are well-trained members of Kopassus,'' the
military's special forces.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats described Dili as a war zone, empty of civilians and
controlled by armed men. Gunmen fired Monday at the Australian
ambassador and at a UN convoy on its way to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Military observers said they believe Indonesian military forces
are orchestrating chaos to overturn a peaceful ballot that went
against Jakarta's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen militias and, it looks like, the military, going
into safe havens _ certain towns, churches, the Red Cross _ and
grabbing people who were taking refuge,'' said a Western diplomat
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It's not chaos and anarchy.
It's directed, very organized, targeted violence and intimidation.
Anarchy might actually be an improvement in some ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers believe elements of the military may be sowing terror
for several reasons: to discredit the referendum, to undermine
Indonesia's civilian government, to scare other restive provinces
out of demanding independence, or to lay the ground for a partition
of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   But any of those scenarios, diplomats say, would translate into
international sanctions and condemnation for Indonesia. Already
Monday, worries over violence pushed Indonesia's currency and its
stock market down.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's national police chief, Roesmanhadi, who like many
Indonesians uses only one name, admitted Monday that things were
``out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunmen Monday attacked seven places in Dili that were sheltering
an estimated 25,000 refugees, witnesses said. The UN mission
estimates that 150,000 people have been displaced from their homes
throughout the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said gunmen also burst into the Dili office of the
International Committee of the Red Cross and searched the bags of
people taking shelter there for evidence of their political
leanings. When they found an independence flag, they rounded up the
owner and marched him out at gunpoint, one witness said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen divided the people into two groups _ Indonesia
loyalists and independence-seekers _ before ``marching them onto
the beach and up towards the Jesus statue on the hill'' for unknown
reasons, said Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``A return to the 1975 scenario is almost taking place _ that
once the international eyes are gone, once the journalists are
threatened away, that Indonesia will do exactly as it did then,''
Robinson warned.
</P>
<P>
   The 1975 invasion set off a civil war and several years of
starvation and disease that claimed 200,000 lives _ one-fourth of
the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the months leading up to the vote, authorities said to
people, `After the vote, it'll be just like 1975,' '' Robinson
recounted. ``But in spite of that, people went out and voted their
conscience. When you consider that people probably knew what would
happen, it's all the more amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   All 22 remaining foreign observers from the International
Federation for East Timor's Observer Project were trying to flee
the territory Monday.

HIGH COURT OUTLAWS TORTURE IN QUESTIONING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel's Supreme Court Monday outlawed interrogation
methods that had been authorized for Israeli security services for
the last 12 years, ruling in favor of rights groups' petitions to
stop the systematic use of methods they decried as torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court declares the Shin Bet'' security service ``does not
have the authority to shake a person, to force him into a''
contorted ``position or to kneel in a frog-like position or deprive
him of sleep,'' an expanded nine-judge panel of Israel's High Court
for Justice said in a unanimous ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups estimate that the interrogation tactics,
which an Israeli judicial commission authorized in 1987, were used
on more than 10,000 Palestinian prisoners in the last 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was at stake here is the very nature of Israel as a
democracy,'' said Eitan Felner, executive director of the Israeli
human rights group B'tselem, which participated in the petition to
the high court.
</P>
<P>
   ``A country cannot be called a democracy if it resorts to
torture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Balancing democracy and security is more than an academic
question for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The justices issued the ruling just as Israel braces for what it
fears will be a new wave of attacks by militant Palestinian groups
aimed at derailing an interim peace deal signed on Saturday. On
Sunday, two apparently botched car bombs exploded in northern
Israel, killing three people in the vehicles and wounding two
passersby.
</P>
<P>
   Shin Bet has maintained that the use of what it calls ``moderate
physical pressure'' is necessary to extract information that can
save lives by thwarting attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Radio quoted Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh as
saying the ruling would damage Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limiting the Shin Bet's capabilities does not help protect
Israel's citizens in the reality in which we live,'' Sneh said.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Aharon Barak, the court president, wrote in the
decision that if Israel is to be a democracy, ``not all means are
acceptable to it. . . . Although a democracy must often fight with
one hand tied behind its back, it nonetheless has the upper hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruling was hailed as a landmark decision by
human rights activists who had brought repeated legal petitions
against the methods since they were codified in 1987 by the special
judicial commission, headed by Moshe Landau, former head of the
High Court for Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took 30 years of human rights abuse to get to this,'' said
an Israeli human rights lawyer, Leah Tsemel, outside the court.
``It will stop torture and make Israel abide by international
law.''
</P>
<P>
   The Landau Commission authorized the Shin Bet to use ``a
moderate amount of physical pressure'' against suspects believed to
have information that could prevent imminent attacks against the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   This became known as the ``ticking bomb'' justification, and the
Shin Bet used it systematically against Palestinian suspects while
investigating the militant Islamic underground. But human rights
lawyers said that with the questioning often being conducted over
months, the investigations could not be claimed to be urgent or
immediate.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups argued that the Landau commission's
guidelines had in effect created a bureaucratic infrastructure that
legitimized and gave a ``legal blessing,'' as Felner put it, to
torture methods that violate international human rights law.
</P>
<P>
   International human rights workers said the commission made
Israel, while not the only country to use torture, the only one to
openly authorize its use.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups estimated that more than 850 detainees a
year were subjected to such interrogation techniques. Thousands
have been hospitalized and 10 have died during such interrogations
since 1987, rights groups said.
</P>
<P>
   Nawwaf Qaysi described the ordeal he suffered at the hands of
the Shin Bet during detention in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested after he had been shot in clashes with Israel
police in 1996. Qaysi, 24, said he was held without any formal
charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   He was shackled with handcuffs to a chair in a contorted
position, and forced to wear a urine- and vomit-soiled mask over
his head. In this manner, he was grilled for up to six hours a day
for three months about his suspected membership in the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   The officers tried to force him to sign a confession to bombing
attacks. He refused, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at the offices of B'tselem, Qaysi said he still
has intense back pain and only 70 percent mobility of his left leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an effort to break you as a person,'' he said, ``an
effort to destroy and take away who you are.''

 (CORRECTS 12 to 9 in 12th graf) 
in ROGERS HURLS SHUTOUT AS METS DOWN GIANTS  
(rk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bit by bit, Kenny Rogers puts dings in the myth, each
strong outing burying the notion that there is something a little
different about him, something that prevents him from succeeding in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the cloak-and-dagger personality, the enigmatic hushed
answers, were left in the Bronx, because since arriving at Shea
Stadium in July, Rogers has been a mystery almost exclusively to
opposing hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the San Francisco Giants shook their heads at Rogers the
way the Yankees once did. Moving his pitches inside and out,
lulling the Giants with pitches that dotted the outside corner of
the plate only to freeze them by banging his best fastball of the
last month inside, Rogers threw a four-hit shutout and the Mets
won, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Mets' first complete-game shutout in a year and just
their third complete game of the season; Rogers has two.
</P>
<P>
   In his eight starts for the Mets, Rogers is 4-0 and the team is
7-1. The Mets remained four games ahead of the Cincinnati Reds in
the wild-card race and two games behind the Atlanta Braves in the
National League East before Atlanta's game Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine this success from Rogers, the man who admitted upon his
return to New York that it was important for him to prove to
himself he could succeed here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had an issue with where I pitched,'' said Rogers, who
pitched for the Yankees in 1996 and '97 and was acquired by the
Mets from Oakland. ``I think it was everybody else's hang-up. It's
New York, it's always different. Maybe it's a little more intense.
Sometimes you need this. I knew I could pitch here. I thought it
wasn't where I pitched. I thought it was how I pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be little doubt how he is pitching now, with
confidence and ease.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said that one of the most important things a pitcher can
do when he joins a new team is to earn his teammates' trust. Then
they will be relaxed when playing behind him and may even swing
more easily when they are at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel it when they have confidence in you and there's a
reverse,'' Rogers said. ``You can feel it when nobody has
confidence in you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers is familiar with both sensations, but with the Mets he
has given his teammates nothing but reason to relax and scoop up
the groundballs he produces. Since he suffered back spasms that
shortened his outing to three innings on Aug. 21, Rogers has
allowed just two runs in 241/3 innings, plunging his earned run
average as a Met to 3.15.
</P>
<P>
   Monday he had complete control of his fastball, sinker and
curve. Rogers struck out nine _ Barry Bonds went down three times _
and walked just one. He was moving the ball around the plate so
successfully _ particularly the sinker _ that the Giants were
helping him expand the strike zone, swinging at pitches that were
off the plate. And, because he is a groundball pitcher anyway,
Rogers was the beneficiary of the Mets' stellar infield, which
recorded nine outs on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers held the Giants at bay while Rickey Henderson generated
enough offense to win the game. He hit a leadoff double and later
scored the Mets' first run in the sixth inning, then hit a two-run
single to shallow center in the seventh. ``This is a new Rickey,''
manager Bobby Valentine said. ``A reborn guy, a hitter who looks
like he has a lot left in the tank.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the report Valentine got about Rogers when the Mets
traded for him. Valentine was unconcerned about Rogers' history in
New York _ he was 18-15 with a 5.11 ERA as a Yankee _ only worried
about his arm. But Valentine said the people he talked to told him
Rogers' ``arm would have plenty of tosses left.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of them worked against the Giants, and his mastery of
Bonds, by keeping the ball bouncing around the plate like a
pinball, was exceptional. On the first strikeout, Rogers got Bonds
to chase an 87 mph fastball up. In the fourth inning, he stunned
Bonds with a four-seam fastball on the outside corner that Bonds
took for a called third strike. ``That's as good a pitch as I can
throw,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Mike Piazza said: ``The pitches Barry was looking for,
he was giving them to him. But they were a few inches from where he
expected them and he couldn't do anything with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' best inning was the ninth, when he retired the heart of
the Giants' lineup and, by his own admission, threw harder than
usual. He struck out Bonds first, this time by spinning him around
when he reached for an 88 mph fastball that was up. Jeff Kent went
next: after sinker after sinker, the strikeout pitch was a slider
that dropped away. Finally, Ellis Burks lined out to Robin Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, reliever Pat Mahomes walked by to give Rogers a tap,
and Rogers said to him, ``I told you I would give you the day
off.''
</P>
<P>
   He has had better stuff before, Rogers said, but this time he
moved the ball better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used both sides of the plate so well,'' Piazza said.
``Maybe there are two or three hitters in the history of the game
who can, but I don't think a hitter can cover both sides of the
plate. If he is hitting inside and outside and he throws the curve
for strikes, what do you look for?''
