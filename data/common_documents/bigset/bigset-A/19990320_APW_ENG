<HEADLINE> Oscars Look Back on World History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- This weekend's Academy Awards ceremony will  
offer a history lesson and a lesson from history. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be plenty about World War II, with ``Saving Private  
Ryan,'' ``The Thin Red Line'' and ``Life is Beautiful.'' And there 
is the Elizabethan era, as represented by ``Shakespeare in Love'' 
and ``Elizabeth.'' All five films are best picture nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	The 71st awards ceremony is also haunted by Hollywood's own  
history, with an uproar over the lifetime achievement award for 
director Elia Kazan, whom many have never forgiven for naming names 
before the House Un-American Activities Committee a half-century 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It all sets the stage for an intriguing Oscar ceremony. The  
suspense over who's going to win in many close races is matched by 
the question of what will happen when the 89-year-old Kazan takes 
the stage in front of thousands at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the year the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and  
Sciences was trying hard to bring more attention to the awards, 
though the Kazan flap was clearly not what it had in mind. It 
scheduled the ceremony on a Sunday for the first time, instead of 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony caps months of fierce Oscar campaigning by studios  
in the Hollywood trade papers -- a dramatic change from last year's 
onslaught by ``Titanic,'' which amassed 11 awards to tie 
``Ben-Hur'' for the record. 
</P>
<P>
	The marquee matchup is the best-picture duel between  
``Shakespeare in Love,'' with a leading 13 nominations, and 
``Saving Private Ryan,'' with 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a film is in the past and has a historical feel to it, it  
seems to have more weight and substance than modern-day stories for 
the Academy, and I think Academy voters look for films that have a 
certain amount of substance,'' said Oscar historian Robert Osborne. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on earlier peer awards, Steven Spielberg has the inside  
track for best director (for ``Saving Private Ryan'') and the 
writers of ``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Out of Sight'' were the 
front-runners for the original and adapted screenplay honors. 
Gwyneth Paltrow was a favorite for best actress for ``Shakespeare 
in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the other races were tossups.  
</P>
<P>
	The best actor category looked like Tom Hanks' to lose (for  
``Saving Private Ryan''), but then Roberto Benigni picked up a 
Screen Actors Guild award for ``Life is Beautiful.'' The supporting 
actor and actress races also were question marks.

<HEADLINE> Top 4 Percent Guaranteed at UC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The University of California Board of  
Regents has adopted a plan that makes the top 4 percent of high 
school graduates automatically eligible for admission. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, approved 13-1 in committee Thursday, was passed by the  
full board Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Students who become eligible through the plan will have to take  
college board tests -- they will be contacted their junior year by 
UC staff who will help them complete admission requirements -- but 
will not have to achieve a minimum score. 
</P>
<P>
	UC officials said the plan only ensures eligibility, though the  
school has a policy of placing all eligible students at one of its 
eight undergraduate campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan takes effect in fall 2001. It is not expected to bring  
in significantly more blacks and Hispanics, whose numbers have 
dropped since UC scrapped affirmative action four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, it adds relatively few students. A study found that of  
10,200 students in the top 4 percent, all but 3,600 were already 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents say the real value of the plan is that it gives  
students at schools that traditionally send few graduates to UC a 
chance for admission.

	Serbs Attack Ethnic Albanian Rebels  
</P>
<P>
	DJENERAL JANKOVIC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Taking advantage of the  
departure of international monitors from Kosovo, the Yugoslav army 
launched a furious offensive today against outgunned ethnic 
Albanian rebels today. Houses were ablaze and villagers reportedly 
were driven from their homes by troops in black ski masks as the 
situation in Kosovo deteriorated dramatically, a day after peace 
talks in Paris failed. The attacks appeared certain to solidify 
NATO's resolve to respond with airstrikes.

	Caucasas Searches for Bomb Suspects  
</P>
<P>
	VLADIKAVKAZ, Russia (AP) -- Hospital medics fought today to save  
the wounded survivors of a massive bombing in southern Russia, 
while politicians warned against a new explosion of inter-ethnic 
violence in the tense north Caucasus region. Police launched a 
search for a man and woman they suspect of planting the deadly bomb 
in the central market of the provincial capital Vladikavkaz 
yesterday. The bomb killed at least 51 people and severely wounded 
104, said a duty officer at the local Interior Ministry office.

	Clinton Announces Anti-Gun Directive  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In his weekly radio address today, President  
Clinton directed federal law enforcement officials to work more 
closely with local authorities to curb illegal gun sales. Clinton 
said that the Justice and Treasury departments would report to him 
with ``a plan to reduce gun violence by applying proven local 
strategies to fight gun crime nationwide.'' Clinton said his budget 
for the next fiscal year proposes to help cut gun-related crime by 
spending $5 million for dozens of new federal prosecutors and $23.8 
million for more than 120 new ATF agents.

	GOP Pledges Better Schools, Lower Tax  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pledged today to deliver  
``retirement security, economic security and national security'' by 
protecting Social Security, improving schools, lowering taxes and 
strengthening the military. To do it, Congress will have to reorder 
President Clinton's budget priorities, Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart 
said. ``Washington has collected more taxes from working Americans 
than it needs to run the government,'' he said.

	First Lady To Tour North Africa  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary and Chelsea Clinton set off this  
weekend on an ``Arabian Nights'' spring-break tour of camel rides 
across Saharan dunes and visits to the wonders of North Africa -- 
both ancient and modern. In advance of her departure today, the 
first lady said she intended her 12-day travels through Egypt, 
Morocco and Tunisia, whose populations total almost half of all the 
Arabs, to dispel distrust that has strained relations with some 
Arab states since the 1991 Persian Gulf War.

	Balloonists Celebrate Record  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- There was exhausted jubilation in the air and  
chaotic celebrations on the ground after two balloonists completed 
their around-the-world odyssey today and neared the end of their 
adventure. Champagne corks popped, cheers erupted and tears flowed 
at the balloon's Geneva airport control center as Swiss doctor 
Bertrand Piccard and British pilot Brian Jones crossed the ``finish 
line'' in the skies above Mauritania in North Africa. They hoped to 
land early tomorrow in Egypt.

	Worst Movies of 1998 'Honored'  
</P>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- ``An Alan Smithee Film: Burn,  
Hollywood, Burn!'' was dishonored today with a Golden Raspberry 
Award as the worst movie of 1998. The movie by writer Joe Eszterhas 
was ``a tasteless, laugh-free Tinseltown satire,'' declared the 
Golden Raspberry Foundation. It took five Razzies, besting the 
record of three set by Kevin Costner for ``The Postman.'' Bruce 
Willis was named worst actor for ``Armageddon,'' ``Mercury Rising'' 
and ``The Siege,'' while the Spice Girls were collectively named 
worst actress for ``Spice World.'' Leonardo DiCaprio was chosen 
worst screen couple for his role as twins in ``The Man in the Iron 
Mask.''

	Lady Vols Beat Va. Tech 68-52  
</P>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Top-seeded and three-time defending  
national champion Tennessee forced Virginia Tech into 25 turnovers 
and a season-low point total in a 68-52 victory today in the 
semifinals of the NCAA East Regional. The result extended 
Tennessee's winning streak in the NCAA tournament to 21 games. The 
lady Vols turned up its defensive pressure to suffocate the upstart 
Hokies and move within one game of still another Final Four.

<HEADLINE> Swamp Wins Everglades Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIALEAH, Fla. (AP) -- Swamp won the $100,000 Everglades Stakes  
for 3-year-olds on grass today at Hialeah, and Golden Missile took 
the $200,000 Widener Handicap for 4-year-olds and up. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth consecutive Widener victory for rider Pat Day.  
</P>
<P>
	Swamp took the lead on the turn and won the Everglades by a  
length over Monkey Puzzle, a 34-1 shot who came from last. Valid 
Reprized was third, three-quarters of a length behind Monkey 
Puzzle. Senor Fizz was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Richard Migliore, the homebred son of Slew City Slew  
ran 1 1/8 miles in 1:42 1-5 and paid $3.60, $2.80 and $2.10. Monkey 
Puzzle returned $13.60 and $4. Valid Reprized was worth $2.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Swamp cruised to the lead nearing the three-eighths pole and  
withstood challenges in the drive. In the final stages, Migliore 
shook the stick at him and did not have to hit him. 
</P>
<P>
	The colt is nominated for the Triple Crown races, although all  
of his victories have been on turf. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1 1/8-mile Widener,  
</P>
<P>
	The lightly raced Golden Missile drew even with Early Warning  
turning for home and outgamed him by a half-length in the 1 1/8-mile 
Widener. Sir Bear, the odds-on choice, moved into contention at the 
top of the stretch but hung in the drive, finishing two lengths 
behind Early Warning. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner, carrying 109 pounds, was timed in 1:47 3-5 and paid  
$7.80, $3.60 and $2.10. Early Warning was worth $5.20 and $2.10. 
Sir Bear returned $2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Day's Widener streak began with Mecke in 1996, followed by  
Tejano Run in 1997 and Frisk Me Now last year.

<HEADLINE>  Oscars Cap a Year of 'Unexpected' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It was the year that Jim Carrey got serious  
and DreamWorks became a serious studio. It was the year an Italian 
comic told a Holocaust story, space rocks came at us from all 
directions and size didn't matter so much after all. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was the year that a movie about a sinking ship sank old  
box-office records. 
</P>
<P>
	But mostly, 1998 at the movies -- the year that provided the  
nominees for Sunday's Academy Awards ceremony -- was the year of the 
unexpected in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading Oscar contender was released during the summer  
popcorn season. A veteran leading man from big studio movies 
garnered his first Oscar nod for a supporting role in a small film. 
That Italian comic, little-known in America, pulled off a historic 
Oscar feat. 
</P>
<P>
	On the economic side, an expensive movie scored at the box  
office, but everyone was talking about cost controls. Theater 
business boomed, but studios worried about profits, and the 
entertainment industry showed signs of a slowdown after years of 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, though, 1998 may be remembered as a charming  
interlude between what could go down as two of the biggest years in 
Hollywood history: 1997 with ``Titanic'' and 1999 with ``Star Wars: 
Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So before the Force is with us, here is a recap of the year that  
led to the Oscars: 
</P>
<P>
                             	 *FACES   	
</P>
<P>
	Carrey suffered perhaps the biggest snub of the Oscars; his work  
in ``The Truman Show'' was overlooked while director Peter Weir, 
co-star Ed Harris and screenwriter Andrew Niccol were nominated. 
Still, his restrained performance established him as much more than 
a clown who talks with his buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Another comic actor, Adam Sandler, never stood a chance at an  
Oscar for the surprise hit ``The Waterboy.'' No matter. With the 
low-budget movie rocketing past $100 million, Sandler was propelled 
to A-list status -- and the $20 million-a-picture paychecks that go 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Also making a big splash was the exuberant Italian comedian  
Roberto Benigni. With his nominations for actor, director and 
screenwriter for ``Life Is Beautiful,'' Benigni joins a small list 
of Hollywood royalty: only Orson Welles, Warren Beatty and Woody 
Allen met or surpassed that triple play. 
</P>
<P>
	James Coburn, meantime, has long been a familiar face as a  
tough-guy leading man. But it was his two-week job as Nick Nolte's 
boozing, abusive father in the low-budget ``Affliction'' that 
brought his first nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor having the toughest time in 1998 had to be George  
Clooney, whose ``Out of Sight'' won critical raves -- and a 
nomination for the screenwriter -- but tanked at the box office. 
Oprah Winfrey also struggled. Her much anticipated ``Beloved'' 
couldn't find a big audience. 
</P>
<P>
                          	 *THE STUDIOS   	
</P>
<P>
	Five years after it was formed amid much hype, DreamWorks  
finally got a film to match the reputations of the studio's 
partners, Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan,'' directed by Spielberg and released in  
the summer escapist period, became the studio's biggest financial 
and critical hit. It's up for 11 Oscars on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But the clear winner of 1998 was Miramax Films, which cemented  
its already firm reputation as the studio of quality by releasing 
two of the five best-picture nominees, ``Shakespeare in Love'' and 
``Life Is Beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a mixed year for another art house label. Gramercy had a  
best-picture nominee in ``Elizabeth,'' though the studio's future 
is clouded. Its parent, PolyGram, was bought by Seagram Co., and 
now Gramercy may be sold or merged with another Seagram-owned 
label. 
</P>
<P>
	At Seagram-owned Universal Studios, an 18-month stretch of  
box-office duds, capped by ``Babe: Pig in the City'' and ``Meet Joe 
Black,'' led to a management shakeup, though the studio showed 
signs of recovery at year's end with the success of ``Patch 
Adams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warner Bros. also limped along until a late boost from ``You've  
Got Mail,'' while MGM couldn't score outside its James Bond 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
                       	 *MONEY, MONEY, MONEY   	
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood finances, confusing and contradictory in the best of  
times, were even more unusual in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Titanic,'' the most expensive movie ever produced at more than  
$200 million, also became in 1998 the highest-grossing movie of all 
time, making more than $600 million in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the film was held up as an aberration, with studios  
expressing nervousness over big-ticket films. 
</P>
<P>
	``Godzilla'' (which promoted itself with the slogan ``Size does  
matter''), ``Armageddon'' and ``Deep Impact'' made profits, but 
didn't reach the box-office stratosphere in a year in which the 
spoils were spread out. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine 1998 films had gross earnings topping $100 million, two  
over $200 million (``Armageddon'' and ``Ryan'') and none over $300 
million. That was good news for audience members and for the box 
office overall, which had a U.S. record (in non-inflation adjusted 
dollars) of nearly $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But for studios, reeling under increasing production and  
marketing costs, the watchword was moderation. 
</P>
<P>
	Studios are now focusing on lower-budgeted films with targeted  
audiences as the model. The poster child was ``There's Something 
About Mary,'' a cheap comedy with medium-level stars that made a 
fortune.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Baseball Team Relies on Speed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Speed will be the strength of the Cuban team that  
will face the Baltimore Orioles March 28 at Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	Benito Camacho, head of Cuba's baseball commission, said the  
27-player team will be a mixture of youngsters and veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those selected was third baseman Omar Linares, considered  
Cuba's best player. Pitcher Jose Ibar, the first pitcher to win 20 
games in a Cuban league season, also was selected, but he is 
recovering from a knee injury which could limit his performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The players were selected primarily from the eight teams that  
already have been eliminated from the first round of the Cuban 
baseball tournament, plus several others. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the main concern of the team is to prepare for the Pan  
Am Games at Winnipeg, Manitoba, during the summer, but the Orioles 
game will require the players to learn to work as a team as quickly 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Orioles will have the advantage of having already  
played about 20 exhibition games and being accustomed to using 
wooden bats. Cuban players use aluminum bats. But he said the Cuban 
team will have greater speed. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the first major league game in Cuba in 40 years.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Has Crowd on Its side </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- If Kentucky has enjoyed one constant advantage  
in its extraordinary run of 20 wins in its last 21 NCAA tournament 
games, it's the loud and faithful horde of fans who follow their 
Wildcats everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 12,000 were in the TWA Dome for Friday's semifinal  
victory over Miami of Ohio and even more are expected for Sunday 
night's Midwest Regional finale against top-seeded Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time we're playing a dome we get a huge following from our  
fans,'' said forward Scott Padgett. ``In a dome or a big arena, our 
fans are probably going to outnumber most of the other team's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats' last six victories have come in domed stadiums.  
And if they get to the title game for the fourth straight year, 
they'll play three more games in domes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every dome we've played in this year ... we just feel a lot  
more comfortable,'' said guard Wayne Turner. ``We get a lot of fans 
there. The atmosphere just feels great to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State, which hasn't been to the Final Four since the  
Magic Johnson team won the 1979 national championship, can only 
admire Kentucky's following. 
</P>
<P>
	``I swear Kentucky could play in Hawaii or Japan and they're  
still going to draw a ton of people,'' said Michigan State coach 
Tom Izzo. ``That's what we're trying to do. We're just in the 
embryo stages of it. But we're trying to build it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *EERIE FEELING OF DEJA VU:* If Rip Van Winkle were a Kentucky  
fan just now stirring from a 21-year slumber, he'd not think 
anything was amiss. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, the Wildcats beat Miami of Ohio in the Mideast Regional  
semifinals and then met Michigan State in the regional finals. And 
whom did they eventually meet and beat in the championship game 
that year? None other than the Duke Blue Devils, the heavy favorite 
to capture this year's title. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GRIEVING FOR JOHN:* Kentucky coach Tubby Smith attended the  
wake in Indiana for John Stewart, the Indiana high school star who 
collapsed in a game and died. The youngster had signed a letter of 
intent with Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he flew to the wake ``just to show my respect and my  
love for John Stewart and his family. When you lose a son -- I can't 
imagine the emptiness, having sons of my own. You just don't know 
when it's coming but you know it's coming. It was important for us 
to be a part of that grieving period, to help me get over it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE MAGIC TALK:* Magic Johnson led Michigan State to the 1979  
NCAA title. He hopes Mateen Cleaves can do the same this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has visited with the Spartans this season and given them  
pep talks. He was in the crowd Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He helps me out a lot,'' Cleaves said. ``He's somebody I  
always looked up to. As a kid, who didn't look up to Magic Johnson? 
It's a blessing for somebody like that to help you with your game. 
Everything he tells me, I listen to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FULFILLING A FANTASY:* Players who reach the Final Four are not  
the only ones living out a childhood dream. Michigan State coach 
Tom Izzo has always yearned for this moment also. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to dream it before you achieve it,'' he said. ``I  
laid in bed last night and say, `Boy, would this be something...now 
you're one game away.' It's exciting. It really is. Yet, that one 
game is a big distance. So we're trying to take it in perspective. 
I've been blessed. I've been lucky. I've been in the right place at 
the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SETTING A SPECIAL STANDARD:* Advancing to the Final Four the  
past three years and being in their fifth consecutive regional 
championship game has given Kentucky's players a perspective that 
other teams just can't match. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they get to the sweet 16 or elite eight, a lot of teams  
are kind of celebrating and happy with that,'' said Wildcat senior 
Scott Padgett. ``We look at it we're happy for 30 minutes after the 
game. After that point, we're thinking about our next opponent. You 
won't see us celebrate or get too excited 'til we win the national 
championship.''

<HEADLINE> Fire Ravages Braves Coach's Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- When Glenn Hubbard was offered a coaching  
job with the Atlanta Braves, he quickly accepted. But when it was 
time to report for spring training, he was hesitant to leave home. 
</P>
<P>
	What was left of it, that is.  
</P>
<P>
	A couple of weeks before Christmas, the suburban Atlanta house  
where Hubbard, his wife, Lynn, and their three sons had lived since 
1983 was destroyed by a Dec. 15 fire, engulfing a lifetime worth of 
memories. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the toughest spring training I've had in a long time as  
far as leaving because of the unfinished business,'' said Hubbard, 
who is coaching first base for the Braves. ``I learned a long time 
ago that when you come out of that clubhouse and cross the lines, 
that's it. You have to block everything out. But it was a tough 
winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbard's championship trophy from the 1989 World Series with  
Oakland was lost. So was a silver champagne server he received for 
playing in the 50th anniversary All-Star game. And a baseball card 
from Nolan Ryan's rookie season, worth a couple of thousand dollars 
on the open market but invaluable from Hubbard's perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	Clothes to wear, sofas to sit on, dishes to eat from, assorted  
keepsakes from an interesting life -- all of it consumed by the 
unforgiving flames. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had collected a lot of things over the years, and the Lord  
chose to take them away,'' said Hubbard, who apparently caused the 
fire when he discarded some 2-day-old ashes from the fireplace into 
a container on the back deck. ``But he didn't take my wife and 
kids, so I feel fortunate about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hubbard home was decorated for Christmas, dozens of presents  
already under the tree, when the blaze erupted. Thankfully, no one 
was at home except for the family's Dalmatian, and firefighters 
were able to rescue the dog from the garage. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire had been burning for a couple of hours when the  
Hubbards arrived, forced to come to grips with the reality that the 
clothes on their backs was about all they had. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was wearing an Adidas soccer training suit,'' Hubbard  
recalled. ``When you wake up the next day, that's what you've got. 
Everything else is gone. It's a heck of a feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbard was able to salvage his World Series ring, safely  
encased inside a desk drawer while the fire raged. Some of his 
wife's jewelry also was retrieved. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Hubbard left for spring training, his wife reached  
a settlement with the insurance company, clearing the way for the 
family to rebuild on the same site. The family, now renting a home 
about three miles away, hopes to be in their new quarters around 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Hubbard can focus on his new role with the  
Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his adeptness at turning the double play, Hubbard was  
a fixture at second base for the Braves for nearly a decade. When 
his playing career ended, he returned to the Braves organization as 
a coach in 1990. He spent the past nine seasons working with young 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after another postseason failure by the Braves, general  
manager John Schuerholz decided to shake up the major-league 
coaching staff. Hubbard got the call to return to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not pushing for this,'' he said. ``My goal as a coach in  
the minor leagues was to get the player here. I've been here. It 
was never in the back of my mind when I took the field to work with 
a kid that one day I was going to be in the big leagues as a 
coach.''

<HEADLINE> Court to Reconsider Student Prayer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- After voting to allow students to lead  
prayer at high school graduations, a federal appeals court has 
withdrawn its decision and passed the issue on to a larger panel of 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Last May, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals upheld the policy of heavily Mormon school district in 
Idaho that allows the top students in each senior class to decide 
whether to include a prayer in their graduation speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges said no one's rights were violated as long as the  
students were free to decide on the prayer without interference 
from the district. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the appeals court said Friday a majority of its active  
judges had voted to refer the case to an 11-judge panel for a new 
hearing. The court apparently took the vote at the request of one 
of its judges. 
</P>
<P>
	James B. Lynch, a lawyer for the Madison, Idaho, school  
district, said he wasn't sure what issues the judges wanted to 
consider. He declined comment on the court's order. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Pevar, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer whose  
clients challenged the policy, said he was surprised and cautiously 
hopeful. Pevar said his clients were two non-Mormon students who 
felt ``like outcasts'' at graduation ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court covers nine Western states.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pledges Better Schools, Low Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pledged Saturday to deliver  
``retirement security, economic security and national security'' by 
protecting Social Security, improving schools, lowering taxes and 
strengthening the military. 
</P>
<P>
	To do it, Congress will have to reorder President Clinton's  
budget priorities for the next fiscal year, Rep. Lincoln 
Diaz-Balart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately for working Americans, the president this year  
sent Congress a budget that raises taxes, increases government 
spending, cuts Medicare benefits, and neglects the needs of our 
nation's military,'' Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., said in the GOP's weekly 
radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Congress is getting to work resetting the budget  
priorities to reflect the wishes of the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz-Balart said Congress is ``locking away every penny of  
Social Security money for Social Security. ... For the first time 
ever, Washington will no longer raid Social Security to pay for 
other government programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he said, ``the hard work and productivity of  
the American people'' have caused the economy to grow faster than 
anticipated, and with more people working and earning more money, 
tax receipts also increased. 
</P>
<P>
	``Washington has collected more taxes from working Americans  
than it needs to run the government,'' he said. ``Just as when you 
overpay any other bill, you deserve a refund of your tax 
overpayment. This Republican Congress is going to return some of 
that payment to the taxpayers, staring this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have said Republicans would do nothing to reinforce  
Social Security and Medicare for baby boomers' retirements and 
would bestow overly large tax cuts and force deep spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Vice President Al Gore accused the GOP of putting  
``risky tax schemes first and Social Security last.'' Such 
economics, he said, hark back to President Reagan's 1980s budgets 
that Gore said ``created the deepest recession since the Great 
Depression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the radio address, Diaz-Balart said Republican spending plans  
also reflect ``America's priorities of improving our public schools 
and maintaining a strong national defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will ensure that more federal dollars get through the  
bureaucracy and to the classroom, where they can be spent on 
teachers, technology and textbooks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the armed forces, the congressman said: ``Our young men and  
women in the military today are being asked to do more and more 
with less and less. Our troops are spread around the world without 
all the training and equipment they need to do their job safely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a moral obligation to see that our men and women in  
uniform are properly trained and equipped for the missions they 
undertake on behalf of America's security.''

<HEADLINE> Funeral for Ind. Hoops Star Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- In the same gymnasium where John Stewart  
once drew cheers, Lawrence North High School students crowded 
bleachers Friday for an emotional farewell to the athlete they knew 
as ``Big John.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, a 7-foot Kentucky recruit, collapsed and died during a  
regional tournament game last week. An autopsy revealed he died 
from complications of an enlarged heart, a rare condition known as 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop Edgar Allen of the Cathedral of Praise Bibleway Church  
told the estimated 4,000 mourners who packed the gym that Stewart's 
death on the brink of a promising adulthood shows that life is 
brief and shouldn't be squandered. 
</P>
<P>
	``He accomplished his purpose in a short time. He finished it  
soon, and finished it young,'' Allen said. ``You may be sitting 
here as a young person with time on your side. But one of these 
days time is going to catch up with you. Time is running at your 
side right now. Don't wait until the finish line to do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral service in the gymnasium ran more than three hours,  
featured dozens of speakers, live music and -- at times -- even 
cheering. 
</P>
<P>
	When one of the clergymen who led the students in a cheer yelled  
``53,'' the number on Stewart's jersey, the crowd responded, ``Big 
John! Big John!'' 
</P>
<P>
	A banner running along the back of the gym read ``This is John's  
House.'' Below rested a basketball with an NCAA logo on it nestled 
in a bouquet of roses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence North basketball coach Jack Keefer struggled to keep  
his composure as he delivered his speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made a joy out of something I thought was just the greatest  
thing in the first place,'' Keefer said. ``John had a way of making 
every day a good situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's closed casket sat near center court of the school's  
gymnasium, draped in a bouquet of flowers. Two framed jerseys 
sporting the number 53 -- one was Stewart's high school jersey, the 
other a blue and white Kentucky jersey -- were draped across nearby 
easels. 
</P>
<P>
	The gym was filled with pictures of Stewart with his team,  
friends, and family. Decorative bows in the school colors of red, 
white, and green were tied around the bleachers' upper hand 
railing. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant coach James Etherington described Stewart as a special  
person who handled his rise to basketball prominence with 
composure. 
</P>
<P>
	When he finished his speech, Etherington turned to Stewart's  
parents, John and Felecia, and said with a wavering voice, ``I 
loved your boy. I loved him so much. I'll miss him forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence North, ranked No. 2 in Class 4A, was playing top-ranked  
Bloomington South the night of March 12 when Stewart was stricken 
5:35 into the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	After being treated on the court, he was taken to a local  
hospital, where he was pronounced dead. His teammates, not knowing 
he was already dead, voted to continue the game. Lawrence North 
lost the game and finished 24-2 for the season.

the 50th minute made it 1-0 and Moreno made it 2-0 in the 54th

	Jefferson Gottardi scored Tampa Bay's goals in the 67th and 88th

I feel our team was capable of, we didn't play,'' Mutiny coach Tim 
Hankinson said. ``On the most exciting day of the year, our guys 
did not give us their fight.''

<HEADLINE> Duke, Temple Have Little in Common </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The teams are nothing alike and  
neither are their basketball histories. The coaches, except for 
impressive winning percentages and respect of their peers, have 
little in common. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe all those differences are what makes Sunday's East  
Regional final between top-ranked Duke and sixth-seeded Temple so 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils (35-1) have won 30 straight games and lead the  
nation in scoring (93.2 points) and margin of victory (26.1 points 
per game). Their 51.6 percent shooting is second in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Temple (24-10) has won three straight games and average just  
66.7 points per game. The Owls' 52.7 shooting in their regional 
semifinal win over Purdue was only the third time this season they 
made more than half their shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke is trying to reach the Final Four for the 12th time, the  
eighth under coach Mike Krzyzewski and first since 1994. Temple is 
looking for its third trip there and first for coach John Chaney. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't even get Chaney started on the difference between the  
teams' talent levels, especially on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there is another team in the country that has  
the ability of the Duke basketball team,'' Chaney said Saturday. 
``In all my years I have rarely seen a team that can go to the 
bench and get an apple for an apple. When we go to the bench we 
might take away an apple and bring a lemon in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski isn't buying the fruit analogy from Chaney, whom he  
considers a good friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can tell Cosby's been around today,'' Krzyzewski said  
referring to longtime Temple fan Bill Cosby who was visiting his 
favorite team Saturday. ``He gave John a few lines for the press 
conference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These same schools met in the same situation in the same  
building 11 years ago with some strange similarities. 
</P>
<P>
	In that game, top-ranked Temple brought an 18-game winning  
streak and 32-1 record into Continental Airlines Arena. 
Second-seeded Duke won 63-53 as Temple star Mark Macon was held to 
6-for-29 shooting, including eight airballs. It was Krzyzewski's 
second trip to the Final Four and the first of three times Chaney 
fell one game short of the national semifinals, the others coming 
in 1991, also in East Rutherford, and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without question everyone would like to get to the top of the  
hill,'' Chaney, 67, said. ``Getting to the field of 64 is a mark of 
success. We've been there a number of years and that will be my 
mark of success if I don't get to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't get there before I retire I'd like to think I've  
had a smidgen of success and I'll feel good about the men I've 
dealt with all my years at Temple. But that would be having peanut 
butter all my life and getting the bicycle I always wanted. I'd be 
a happy man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting there for Duke would be a chance to make up for last  
season when the Blue Devils blew a 17-point lead against Kentucky 
in the regional final. This year's Final Four is in St. Petersburg, 
Fla., in the same building as that game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really haven't talked about it much, it's a different  
situation,'' sophomore forward Shane Battier said. 
</P>
<P>
	While only two teams have come within 20 points of Duke since  
Feb. 11, including Southwest Missouri State in the regional 
semifinals, Temple's famed matchup zone makes Sunday's games 
interesting. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to make outside shots and if you try quick shots  
you're not as open as if you work like you do against any good 
defense,'' Krzyzewski said. ``We have to get more of a team shot 
than an individual shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That even goes for Trajan Langdon, a 43 percent shooter from  
3-point range who had 24 points on 9-for-14 shooting against 
Southwest Missouri State. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their zone is different than a lot of zones in that you don't  
get as many open looks,'' the fifth-year senior said. ``You have to 
work really hard. Instead of one or two passes you might have to 
make six or eight before you get an open look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Temple won't make any changes because of the opponent or the  
importance of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our defense tries to force guys to make a decision,'' Chaney  
said. ``We say very clearly that we design how we're going to win 
and design how we're going to lose. If we lose a game we'll lose it 
by you shooting from the outside, you're not going to beat us from 
both places on the floor. When you do slip over to my bench. I'll 
have a couple of Tylenols and a baseball bat.''

<HEADLINE> Escaped Slave Settlement Celebrated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP)-- Which American colonies were the first to win  
freedom from Britain? Not the 13 that became the United States in 
1776, but two settlements of escaped slaves on the Caribbean island 
of Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian Institution has put together a traveling show,  
with music and pictures, to celebrate those Jamaicans and other 
communities of escaped slaves. Isolated settlements of ``maroons'' 
-- from a Spanish word for an unbroken horse -- still dot the 
hemisphere from Brazil to Brackettville, Texas 
</P>
<P>
	Opening today at the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis,  
Tenn., the exhibit will travel around the United States into the 
year 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Brackettville, fewer than 100 people now live in what may  
be the only settlement in the United States descended from escaped 
slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminole Indians of Florida owned some slaves and others  
escaped to them from white masters. All fought alongside one 
another in the Seminole wars against the federal government more 
than 150 years ago. They had some successes. But, overwhelmed by 
the army and its cannon, the Seminoles eventually were moved to 
``Indian territory'' in what is now Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Many black Seminoles fled to Mexico in fear of slave-hunters.  
Some returned to Texas after emancipation and became soldiers in 
the U.S. Army's Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Some black Seminoles still live in the Mexican village called  
Nacimiento de los Negros, in the Santa Rosa Mountains about 150 
miles southwest of Brackettville. 
</P>
<P>
	The scouts served against border bandits, hostile Indians and  
Mexican rebels who tried to operate from Texas. The unit, dissolved 
in 1914, has its own cemetery near Brackettville. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we get from the federal government is the headstones,''  
William ``Dub'' Warrior, their 72-year old historian, said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the unit won four Medals of Honor. One of them went  
to Warrior's his great-uncle, Sgt. John Ward, for rescuing a major 
under heavy fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The story of the escaped slaves is told in ``The Black  
Seminoles'' by Kenneth W. Porter, Thomas B. Senter and Alcione M. 
Amos, published by the University Press of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Long before the escaped American slaves found refuge in Mexico,  
the maroons who had escaped slavery in Jamaica signed treaties with 
Britain. That was in 1739, nearly a half-century before the United 
States did. They received land and some self-government, remnants 
of which still survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Two maroon colonies still elect their own ``colonels,'' although  
their authority now is mostly ceremonial. One, called Accompong 
with 1,100 people, is about 20 miles from the tourist resort of 
Montego Bay, Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
	Other communities can still be found in Suriname, French Guiana,  
Colombia and Brazil. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> 2 Bodies Found in Sightseer Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIERRA VILLAGE, Calif. (AP) -- It was news the Carringtons had  
dreaded for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	A month after their daughter, Carole Sund, her daughter and a  
family friend from Argentina disappeared while sightseeing near 
Yosemite National Park, authorities found two bodies in the charred 
hulk of the women's rental car. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI would not identify the victims or their cause of death.  
A third victim was not found. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund's parents, Francis and Carole Carrington, made a brief  
and tearful statement before retreating into a Modesto hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to find the animals that did this. They're terrible  
people. We don't want them to do this to anyone else's daughter or 
granddaughter,'' Mrs. Carrington said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies were discovered Friday morning, a day after the  
burned red Pontiac Grand Prix was found off a highway in California 
Gold Rush country. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI believes Mrs. Sund, 42, Julie Sund, 15, and Silvina  
Pelosso, 16, were either kidnapped or carjacked late Feb. 15 or 
Feb. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``The car was consumed by fire. Everything in the car was  
consumed by fire,'' said James Maddock, the FBI agent in charge of 
the investigation. ``That's really all I can tell you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrington, whose family made millions of dollars in Northern  
California real estate and now mostly lives in Eureka, had offered 
a $300,000 reward for information leading to the safe return of the 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	Jens Sund, Carole's husband and Julie's father, was with his  
other children in Eureka when he got the news, said family friend 
Lee Ulansey. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a nightmare for the family, friends and the  
community from the very beginning. It's just a horrifying 
situation,'' Ulansey said. ``We hoped for the best, but expected 
the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities continued to search the woods with dogs on Friday  
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The spot where the victims were found is nearly three hours away  
on winding roads from Cedar Lodge in El Portal, at the western 
entrance to Yosemite. The last confirmed sighting of the women was 
at the lodge's restaurant on Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of Mrs. Sund's wallet was found along the side of a road in  
Modesto, two hours west of Yosemite, on Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Shopkeepers in Twain Harte, near where the car was found, said  
they had called the FBI to report seeing the women on Feb. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Penny Mann, owner of the Cedar Cottage gift shop, said she  
believes the three visited her shop that day. She said she called 
the FBI hot line about three days later, but couldn't get through. 
She called a week ago and was able to pass on her information.

<HEADLINE> J&AMP;J Sues Bausch &AMP; Lomb Over Lenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the world's largest seller of  
contact lenses, on Friday sued rival Bausch &AMP; Lomb, accusing the 
eye wear maker of making false claims about its new seven-day 
continuous wear lens. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit is the second in two weeks to be filed against Bausch &AMP;  
Lomb over its highly touted extended-wear lens. Ciba Vision, the 
nation's No. 2 maker of contacts, filed a patent infringement suit 
against third-ranked Bausch last week. On Wednesday, a federal 
judge ordered the two sides to try to negotiate a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Bausch officials say the new lens, called PureVision, is safer  
and more comfortable than any other extended-wear lens on the 
market. It hopes an aggressive marketing campaign targeting doctors 
and patients will convert existing contact lens wearers and 
eyeglass wearers who've been hesitant to hassle with contact 
lenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rochester, N.Y.-based Bausch is about to begin testing the new  
lens for continuous monthlong use -- or four times as long as 
existing lenses can be worn without being cleaned or discarded. 
Ciba is also working on a monthlong continuous-wear lens. The 
development of such a lens would mark the biggest breakthrough 
since the development of soft contact lenses 28 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J controls about 40 percent of the world's contact lens  
market, though its share has been shrinking in recent years amid 
competition from new and old rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bausch &AMP; Lomb is trying to say everyone else's lens is  
obsolete, and everyone else is saying no we're not,'' said Richard 
Leza, an analyst with John G. Kinnard &AMP; Co in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, about 33 million people wear contact  
lenses, but fewer than 20 percent wear extended-wear lenses 
designed for continuous wear of up to a week. One reason 
extended-wear lenses have not caught on even more is because 
patients and doctors are concerned about the added risk of 
infection and other eye disorders caused by leaving contact lenses 
in while sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J's lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York, seeks an  
order blocking Bausch from continuing the campaign and asks for 
triple damages. It asks the court to determine how much J&AMP;J 
suffered from the PureVision campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J contends Bausch's own studies show PureVision is not safer  
than Acuvue, J&AMP;J's brand. ``There is no clinical data to support 
Bausch &AMP; Lomb's claims that this new product offers a safety 
advantage for patients,'' said Philip Keefer, president 
Vistakon/J&AMP;J Vision Products Inc., which is based in Jacksonville, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bausch officials say studies show Pure Vision improves  
the flow of oxygen though the contact lens into the eye, a critical 
feature of comfort and safety. In one head-to-head study with J&AMP;J's 
extended-wear lens, PureVision was significantly less likely to 
cause corneal swelling, a measure of oxygen deprivation, according 
to Bausch. J&AMP;J's Keefer said corneal swelling is not an indicator 
of patient safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Bausch officials also point to the company's study of 200  
patents tested with PureVision and Acuvue, which said patients 
prefer PureVision by a more than two-to-one margin. Keefer said he 
was not familiar with that research. 
</P>
<P>
	PureVision will sell for about $300 a year, nearly $100 more  
than existing extended-wear lenses. Bausch, which won federal Food 
and Drug Administration approval for PureVision last month, 
officially launched the product Friday at the International Vision 
Expo held in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Bausch spokeswoman Holly Houston said the company is confident  
that all it claims about PureVision are well substantiated. ``Its 
obvious our breakthrough technology is making our competitors 
nervous,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Second Choice Wins Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- Lightly raced Etbauer put away  
Temperence Time with solid fractions, opened a clear lead at the 
top of the stretch and had enough left to hold off fast-closing 
Desert Demon for a three-quarter-length victory in the $125,000 
Rebel Stakes, Oaklawn Park's final prep for the Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	The second choice in the field of 11 3-year-olds, Etbauer  
returned $8.20, $3.40 and $3.00. Desert Demon, the 8-5 favorite, 
paid $3 and $2.60 It was another 2 1/4 lengths back to Kutsa, an 18-1 
shot who paid $7.40. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the third straight for Etbauer, who covered 1  
1-16 miles in 1:44. 
</P>
<P>
	Etbauer broke alertly along the rail and maintained inside  
position. Down the backstretch, Temperence Time edged in front. 
When longshot Big Rascal began moving toward the leaders, jockey 
Mike Smith couldn't wait any longer and Etbauer quickly disposed of 
Temperence Time going into the turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Etbauer opened a clear advantage in the turn and was three  
lengths in front early in the stretch drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Heading into the final turn I was feeling very confident and  
was only worried about Julie's horse,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Krone was aboard Desert Demon, who was eighth after a half  
mile. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the top of the lane I looked around trying to see where she  
(Krone) was at but couldn't find her,'' Smith said. ``Through the 
lane I had to stay busy on him because he started looking around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders went a half mile in 46 1-5 and six furlongs in 1:10  
4-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the quarter pole, I had to make a sudden and sharp move to  
the outside and making that ... move cost my horse a lot of 
momentum and may have cost him the race,'' Krone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fantastic Finish was fourth, followed by Cayman Cat, Middleworth  
Bay, Jim'smrtee, Air Rocket, Temperence Time, Warhead and Big 
Rascal.

<HEADLINE> Synchro Diving To Be in 2000 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Synchronized diving will make its  
debut as a medal sport at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney after being 
approved by the International Olympic Committee's executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	Confirmation came on Saturday from Gunnar Werner, secretary of  
FINA, swimming's world governing body. 
</P>
<P>
	A demonstration event at Atlanta three years ago, synchronized  
diving becomes an official Olympic sport 16 years after 
synchronized swimming made its debut at Los Angeles in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	In the diving version, divers jump from either the 10-meter  
platform or from parallel 3-meter springboards. They are judged on 
individual technical skills and the ability to coordinate their 
movements and enter the water together. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight men's and eight women's teams will compete.

<HEADLINE> China 2, US 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOULI, Portugal (AP) -- China used a second-half goal to edge the  
United States women's soccer team 2-1 today to win the prestigious 
Algarve Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Americans, who beat the Chinese in the 1996 Olympic  
gold medal game, outplayed their opponent for much of the day -- and 
even had a penalty kick -- they still haven't won this tournament in 
five tries. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory for China was its first against the United States  
since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	China got the winning goal on a counter-attack in the 65th  
minute, just moments after the U.S. team switched from a 4-3-3 to a 
3-4-3 formation in search of the winning goal. Instead, Jin Yan 
took advantage of open space down the right wing and finished her 
breakaway smartly, sliding the ball past onrushing goalkeeper 
Briana Scurry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely frustrating to not win this tournament  
again,'' said U.S. captain Carla Overbeck, who played despite a 
strained neck suffered in a 
</P>
<P>
	victory over Norway in the final match of group play. ``We hate  
to lose any match, but this is a great tournament with great teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to look at the big picture, and the most important  
time to win is in June and July at the World Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That event will be played in the United States.  
</P>
<P>
	The Americans outshot China 16-7 for the match, but as in the  
Norway game two days ago, went down a goal early. In the 16th 
minute, Sun Wen got behind the U.S. defense on the right side and 
floated a cross into the middle. Pu Wei outjumped several U.S. 
players to place her header into the right corner from 8 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be the final shot of the first half for China as the  
Americans pressed forward. The territorial superiority finally paid 
off just before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy Parlow took Brandi Chastain's long throw-in from the right  
side and headed the ball downfield to Tiffeny Milbrett, who placed 
her volley into the right corner of the net from 7 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett was the highest scorer at the Algarve Cup with four  
goals and now has 51 in her career. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Americans blew a great chance to take the lead as Mia  
Hamm was taken down from behind by goalkeeper Gao Hong. Chastain 
drilled her penalty shot off the top of the crossbar two minutes 
into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Parlow was stopped on a breakaway by Gao after China went ahead.  
</P>
<P>
	``China is a great team with skillful players who are very good  
on the ball,'' Parlow said. ``It's unfortunate that we lost, but we 
can take a lot of positives from this tournament, go back to 
training camp and get better so we can win the World Cup this 
summer.''

<HEADLINE> NHL Trading Speeds As Deadline Nears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The New York Islanders pulled off deals with three teams on  
Saturday and the Edmonton Oilers and Chicago Blackhawks pulled off 
a blockbuster among two as trading activity picked up in the NHL 
with Tuesday's deadline looming. 
</P>
<P>
	The Islanders traded goaltender Tommy Salo to Edmonton, center  
Robert Reichel to Phoenix and left wing Ted Donato to Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Oilers general manager Glen Sather, who promised that changes  
would be made in Edmonton, not only acquired Salo from the 
Islanders but four players in a seven-player swap with Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a major shakeup for the team and it is unfortunate to do  
it at this time of the year, but we felt we needed to inject some 
life into the club,'' Sather said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers, battling Calgary for the eighth and final playoff  
spot in the NHL's Western Conference, were winless in six games 
entering Saturday's home game against the Vancouver Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sather sent defenseman Boris Mironov, forward Dean McAmmond and  
prospect Jonas Elofsson to the Blackhawks for center Chad Kilger, 
left wings Daniel Cleary and Ethan Moreau and defenseman Christian 
Laflamme. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have enough depth up front that we can afford to do  
something like this,'' Blackhawks general manager Bob Murray told 
WMAQ-AM in Chicago. ``We're giving up a lot of young potential in 
this deal and I just felt we were deep enough that the time was now 
to do something with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonton got Salo from the Islanders for forward Mats Lindgren  
and an eighth-round pick in this year's entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	In Salo, the Oilers finally obtained the No. 1 goaltender  
they've been seeking since losing Curtis Joseph to Toronto via free 
agency last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Salo will be making a clean start in Edmonton after an unhappy  
season with the Islanders. Salo was miffed when Islanders general 
manager Mike Milbury acquired goalie Felix Potvin from Toronto 
earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Potvin had a rough start and Salo got more work when Bill  
Stewart replaced Milbury as coach. Potvin has been out recently 
with an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could see it coming,'' Milbury said of trading Salo. ``It  
hasn't worked for him or the team and when it doesn't work, it's 
time to move on. I wish him the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Islanders sent Donato to Ottawa in exchange for a  
fourth-round pick in the 1999 draft, and Reichel to the Coyotes 
along with two draft picks in exchange for left wing Brad Isbister 
and a Phoenix draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Donato, 29, has eight goals and 14 assists in 69 games with the  
Islanders and Boston Bruins this season, his seventh in the NHL. 
The 27-year-old Reichel was the Islanders' leading scorer with 19 
goals and 37 assists for 56 points. 
</P>
<P>
	In eight NHL seasons with New York and Calgary, Reichel has  
amassed 202 goals and 292 assists for 494 points, along with 302 
penalty minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	In other deals Saturday, the Philadelphia Flyers acquired left  
wing Mikael Andersson and right wing Sandy McCarthy from the Tampa 
Bay Lightning in a trade for left wing Colin Forbes and a 
conditional draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL trading deadline is 3 p.m. on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Diggins Wins Next Move States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Trainer Mark Hennig sent out his second  
consecutive winner of Aqueduct's $81,525 Next Move Stakes when 
Diggins took Saturday's test for fillies and mares. 
</P>
<P>
	Hennig saddled Panama Canal to victory last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Diggins, who carried 113 pounds with Jose Espinoza, outdueled  
favored Biogio's Rose in the stretch, winning by a head. It was 
another 1 3/4 lengths to Powerful Nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dewars Rocks, Surina Star, Smashing Review and Sudden completed  
the order of finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Diggins covered 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 4-5 to earn $48,915 for  
December Hill Farm while remaining undefeated in two starts this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner returned $8.10, $3.30 and $2.70. Biogio's Rose paid  
$2.40 and $2.10 and Powerful Nation was $3.40 to show.

<HEADLINE> Coppola To Open California Bistro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Francis Ford Coppola, already a purveyor of  
fine wines and pasta sauces, is adding a bistro to his list of 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Niebaum-Coppola Cafe opens March 28 in San Francisco's North  
Beach neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The wine bar and cafe will feature wines from the filmmaker's  
Northern California winery, and pasta and sauces from his packaged 
food business. The food will be Italian fare, like pizza and 
calzones. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of a crazy idea because it looks very much like a  
French cafe . . . but the food is more Italian,'' Coppola said. 
``What I want is that kind of relaxing and inviting and warm 
environment you get in some of the better cafes in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bistro is on the ground floor of the building that houses  
Coppola's production company, American Zoetrope.

</P>
<P>
	PAGO PAGO, American Samoa (AP) -- Former Samoa Prime Minister  
Tofilau Eti Alesana died Friday at his home in Apia. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Tofilau, who served 15 years as prime minister of the former  
Western Samoa, resigned in November after undergoing cancer 
treatment in New Zealand. He was succeeded by Tuilaepa Sallele

                          *A. Doak Barnett    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A. Doak Barnett, one of the nation's foremost  
scholars and advisers on China who pushed for renewed relations 
with the Asian country, died March 17. He was 77 and had suffered 
from lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Shanghai to missionaries, Barnett went on to author or  
edit more than 20 books on China and to play an influential role in 
shaping U.S. policy in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	After a long period of severed ties between the two nations,  
Barnett advocated in 1966 that the United States reevaluate its 
overall approach to communist China. At a key Senate hearing on the 
issue that year, Barnett called for ``a policy of containment but 
not isolation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett's thinking gained support with President Lyndon B.  
Johnson, as China split from its alliance with the Soviet Union, 
and laid the groundwork for eventual renewal of relations initiated 
by President Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	Banett returned to the United States as a teen-ager. He  
graduated from Yale University in 1942 and later received a 
master's degree there in international relations. He served in the 
Marines, emerging after World War II as a captain. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked in China as a correspondent for a Chicago newspaper in  
the late 1940s, and went on work for the State Department. Barnett 
taught at a number of universities and think-tanks. 

</P>
<P>
                             *Bob Cato    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bob Cato, who helped turn record album covers  
into a form of contemporary art and won two Grammy awards for his 
designs, died Friday due to complications of Alzheimer's disease. 
He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined CBS-Columbia Records in 1960, serving as art director  
and vice president of creative services for 10 years. He worked 
with musicians including Miles Davis, Janis Joplin and Leonard 
Bernstein, and painters Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol. 
</P>
<P>
	His cover designs for Barbra Streisand's ``People'' (1964) and  
``Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits'' (1967) won him Grammy awards from the 
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. He received the 
academy's President's Merit award in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Cato's career spanned 50 years, beginning in 1947 at Harper's  
Bazaar magazine. There he was exposed to a mixture of photography, 
Modernist art, open space and sharp typography that would help 
define his later work. 
</P>
<P>
	His final 10 years were largely devoted to fine art, photography  
and producing books, including ``Joyce Images'' (1994).

</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Doris M. Drury, the first woman to head the  
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, died Tuesday. She was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Drury, a longtime professor at the University of Denver and  
Regis University, also was a pioneer in helping women get bank 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Drury served on the board of the Federal Reserve Branch in  
Denver in 1979 and 1980. She was chairwoman of the Kansas City fed 
in 1983 and a board member of the bank from 1980 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is not that I'm the first, but that I'm not the  
last,'' she said then. 
</P>
<P>
	She was a prominent member of the DU faculty for more than two  
decades. A generation of students learned about money and banking 
from her as professor of economics from 1965 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Drury was the first female full professor at DU, serving as  
chairwoman of the economics department and public affairs program 
and director of the division of research at the school of business. 
Ms. Drury was director of the master of business administration 
program at Regis University from 1990 to 1997.

 *Patrick Heron    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Patrick Heron, Britain's foremost abstract  
painter, died Saturday at the age of 79, the director of London's 
Tate Gallery said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tate Gallery held a retrospective exhibition of Heron's work  
last year, confirming his prominent place in the British art world, 
said gallery director Nicholas Serota, a longtime friend of the 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
	Heron studied briefly at London's Slade School of Art. But he  
was quoted recently as saying it had been a waste of time: ``Almost 
nobody there was aware of 20th-century painting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he went to school in Welwyn Garden City, 20 miles north  
of London, Heron moved back to Cornwall with his wife, Delia Reiss, 
whom he married in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	Heron went on to become a principle member of the St. Ives group  
of artists, and received the CBE, the Commander of the Order of 
British Empire, for his work in 1977.

 *Elizabeth Paisley Huckaby    	
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Elizabeth Paisley Huckaby, an English  
teacher who kept a diary of the tumult that surrounded the racial 
integration of Little Rock's Central High School in the late 1950s, 
died of heart failure Thursday. She was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	During the upheaval, she wrote a book, ``Crisis at Central  
High,'' based on her diary, and the work was later turned into a 
television movie, starring Joanne Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
	As dean of girls at Central High, Ms. Huckaby assumed the role  
of protector of the six black girl students who, along with three 
black male students, were the first blacks to integrate the school. 
</P>
<P>
	The students drew the wrath of anti-integrationists, and Ms.  
Huckaby also was threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	``My uncle took to carrying a shotgun around with him because of  
all the phone threats he got,'' said Ms. Huckaby's niece, Liz 
Humeston of Danville, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Huckaby got mixed reviews for the job she did, some saying  
she could have done a better job of sheltering the students and 
others saying she did too much.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wilbur L. Pritchard, a radio satellite  
pioneer, died Thursday of lung cancer. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1950s, Pritchard helped develop a system for sending  
information via microwave transmissions and helped develop the 
first microwave oven as an engineer for the Raytheon Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s he directed a team that produced the nation's first  
operational military satellite system and assisted NATO with its 
satellite program. 
</P>
<P>
	An early advocate of using satellites in broadcasting, Pritchard  
joined the Communications Satellite Corp. in 1967 and established 
its Comsat Laboratories. In the 1970s he headed companies and 
consulting firms that designed communications satellites and worked 
in the area of cellular and mobile phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, he was producing telecommunications  
economic and technical studies as a consultant to private companies 
and governments, including Russia and Tonga.

	Serb Forces Attack Albanian Rebels  
</P>
<P>
	DJENERAL JANKOVIC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Yugoslav army took  
advantage of the departure of international monitors from Kosovo 
today, launching a furious offensive against outgunned ethnic 
Albanian rebels that sent thousands of people fleeing. Houses were 
ablaze and villagers reportedly were driven from their homes by 
troops in black ski masks as the situation in Kosovo deteriorated 
dramatically, a day after peace talks in Paris failed. The attacks 
meant Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was once again defying 
NATO, and they appeared certain to solidify the alliance's resolve 
to respond with airstrikes.

	Allied Prepare To Strike Serbs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An allied fleet of warships and attack planes,  
including the U.S. Air Force's most powerful, is ready for a 
possible bombardment of Yugoslavia. Defense Secretary William Cohen 
ordered seven additional Air Force planes to Europe to join roughly 
200 other American warplanes awaiting orders to attack. That is all 
the air power U.S. military officials in Europe say they need for 
punishing assaults on Yugoslav military targets. President Clinton 
declined to say whether NATO would set a deadline for acting in 
Kosovo.

	VENICE, Italy (AP) -- Seeking to boost trade ties and counter

Jiang Zemin arrived in Italy today on the first leg of his European 
tour. Jiang's departure for Italy, Switzerland and Austria came 
ahead of the U.N. Human Rights Commission's annual meeting in 
Geneva, at which China could face rebukes. Jiang is expected to 
defend his government's rights record during his 11-day tour in the 
face of European unease over the recent jailing of dissidents who 
were trying to set up an opposition party.

home today after Saudi officials refused to use frozen Iraqi funds 
to pay for the pilgrimage. The kingdom provided the pilgrims with 
visas and made all arrangements to house and transport them, but 
they left without performing any of the rituals, Saudi Interior 
Minister Prince Nayef said. Iraq's state-run television reported

	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan and Egypt today backed the  
Palestinian National Authority's right to proclaim statehood but 
shied away from saying whether it should do so on May 4 -- a date 
set by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. A joint statement by 
Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians urged the world to ``support

along the shore of Cape Cod. New England Aquarium officials 
coordinating the rescue effort said 34 Atlantic white-sided 
dolphins died yesterday, 16 of which were euthanized. An additional 
20 became stranded this afternoon, officials said. The cause of 
such beachings remains unknown. Some biologists believe that a new 
moon coupled with unusually high tides could contribute to the 
phenomenon.

but had to hold on as St. John's -- in its first regional final 
since 1991 -- got within a point in the final minute. The Red Storm 
was down just 76-74 with under 10 seconds left when Erick Barkley 
lost control and had his only turnover in 37 minutes of action.

	PHOENIX (AP) -- Gonzaga's NCAA tournament magic disappeared in  
the frantic final few minutes today against Connecticut's 
relentless defense and as the Big East champions pulled out a 67-62 
victory. Connecticut's All-American, Richard Hamilton, scored 21 
points and Khalid El-Amin gained redemption after a horrendous 
0-for-12 shooting game to make two free throws with 34.4 seconds 
remaining. Kevin Freeman, who had 13 points and 15 rebounds, iced 
it with two free throws with 6.2 seconds to play.

<HEADLINE> Train Fuel Leaked Despite Safeguard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Investigators of the Amtrak wreck where  
11 people died inside a sleeper car that caught fire want to know 
why fuel spilled and ignited when the engines were specifically 
designed to prevent that from happening. 
</P>
<P>
	The City of New Orleans hit a truck loaded with steel Monday  
night at a crossing in this community about 50 miles south of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Both locomotives were General Electric Genesis models, which  
have four fuel tanks cradled deep inside the frame and reinforced 
with steel. The tanks are also farther from the rails than earlier 
designs to reduce the risk of puncture. 
</P>
<P>
	The locomotive was built in response to a 1992 federal  
government request to improve designs to prevent fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak investigators initially believed the tanks did not  
rupture in the crash, but spokeswoman Deborah Hare said Saturday 
that may not be the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board has determined that  
fuel leaked from both locomotives that had been pulling the train, 
although the spill from the second engine likely contributed more 
to the fire in the sleeper car, said NTSB spokesman Phil Frame. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fuel leak was the cause of the fire, but the question is,  
did the fire kill the passengers, or did the impact of the crash 
kill the passengers?'' Frame told the Chicago Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials also returned for another look at the rail crossing  
signals to check out a four-minute difference in recordings of the 
moment of impact between the truck and train, the Chicago Tribune 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The event recorder on the locomotive showed the time at 9:47  
p.m. Monday, while the signal box at the side of the tracks 
indicated the train reached the crossing at 9:51 p.m., the 
newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Victim May Have Targeted Clinic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- A man killed when a pipe bomb accidentally  
exploded in his lap was apparently planning to blow up an abortion 
clinic to keep someone he knew from ending her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Hill, 24, suffered massive injuries when the bomb  
detonated Wednesday as he was finishing constructing it, police 
said. A second bomb was found in his home with a container of 
gunpowder. 
</P>
<P>
	Police refused to reveal the connection between Hill and the  
woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents said  
Hill, who had made comments to friends about his plans to blow up 
the clinic, was not part of ``a group or larger political 
conspiracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This did not seem to be an attack aimed at a person, but  
towards the facility,'' ATF agent Bob Dowlen said Friday. ``From 
the very beginning, everything indicated that he was acting alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``His family didn't seem to know anything about this. They feel  
very badly about losing their son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police would not release the name of the clinic Hill planned to  
bomb, but officials did say the clinic received a threat on March 
4. Hill had been seen near the clinic on at least two occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came to the clinic irate, demanding entrance, and he was  
seen near the clinic during a protest,'' said police spokesman Bill 
Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill had an extensive criminal history, with several convictions  
for aggravated assault. He was never charged with anything related 
to bomb-making. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion in a back bedroom set his parents' house on fire  
and forced the evacuated of the neighborhood. Hill's parents 
escaped without injury.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Expected To OK Production Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Now comes the hard part.  
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia and other key OPEC members, which recently agreed  
to slash oil production by 2 million barrels a day, must find a way 
to back up their bold words with action to keep crude prices 
climbing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,  
meeting Tuesday in Vienna, Austria, will be under pressure to honor 
the commitment if they are to end the global oil glut that has sent 
prices plunging to a 12-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference is something of an anticlimax, however, since  
Saudi Arabia and other members announced March 12 after a meeting 
in the Netherlands that they had agreed with two non-OPEC exporters 
to slash production. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting has ``had the wind taken out of its sails by prior  
agreement between some major players, and all that's left for the 
conference is to get some kind of ratification,'' said Leo Drollas, 
chief economist at the Center for Global Energy Studies in London. 
</P>
<P>
	If, as expected, the oil ministers formally approve the new  
output caps, analysts will be anxious to see whether OPEC can 
muster the will to enforce them, and for how long. Cheating on 
production quotas has been a chronic problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Talk is cheap. Whether OPEC can really make these cuts remains  
to be seen,'' said Mark Redway of the London brokerage T. Hoare and 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference comes at a time of slack global demand for oil,  
due largely to financial turmoil in Asia and a mild winter that 
lessened demand for heating oil in North America and Western 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has contributed to an excess supply of crude by exporting  
larger volumes under a U.N.-sponsored oil-for-food program. Iraq is 
barred from freely exporting its oil by United Nations sanctions 
imposed after its invasion in 1990 of Kuwait, a fellow OPEC member. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall oil inventories in January were only slightly lower than  
October's record level of 2.82 billion barrels, said David Knapp, 
editor of a monthly market report for the Paris-based International 
Energy Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without some action,'' he said, oil tankers ``are going to  
start backing up at the ports because nobody wants them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts agreed to by OPEC members would take effect April 1.  
Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi has said they would be added to 
existing OPEC and non-OPEC reductions of 3.1 million barrels a day 
set last June. 
</P>
<P>
	Cartel members Saudi Arabia, Iran, Algeria and Venezuela,  
together with Mexico, which is not a member, thrashed out the 
production-cut agreement, and Oman -- also not a member -- has 
committed to it, Naimi said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The surprise has been the willingness of Saudi Arabia to take  
the lead in initiating cutbacks,'' said Mehdi Varzi, an analyst 
with the investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia would take the biggest production cut -- 585,000  
barrels a day, according to OPEC sources. At the same time, the 
kingdom seems to have accepted the argument that Iran should be 
allowed to make its cut from a base level of 3.9 million barrels a 
day instead of Iran's official quota of 3.6 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	This Saudi concession to Iran, the cartel's No. 2 producer, was  
the key to the agreement, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new quotas, which have yet to be made official, the 11  
OPEC members would produce a total of 25.4 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices have jumped almost $2 a barrel since the accord was  
announced, and some analysts foresee a possible rise to $16 a 
barrel by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for April  
delivery rose 24 cents to $15.46 a barrel on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a bit premature, all this excitement,'' Drollas  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the possible pitfalls to firmer prices would be a decision  
by Indonesia, Nigeria or Venezuela to break ranks and continue 
producing at current levels or beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	These three countries are seen as the OPEC members with the  
biggest immediate needs for money from oil sales, due to economic 
crises in Indonesia and Nigeria and the strength of oil worker 
unions in Venezuela. Yet each of them has apparently committed to 
curtailing production. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they may have seen the wisdom of the longer-term  
deal,'' said Barney Gray, an oil analyst with the brokerage 
Williams De Broe. ``The second quarter's going to be tough, but 
perhaps by the end of the year, they'll start to see the 
benefits.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Freestyle Skiing Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Ann Battelle added a national title to  
her impressive list of accomplishments this season by winning the 
moguls competition in Saturday's U.S. Freestyle Championships at 
Deer Valley Ski Resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Battelle, of Englewood, Colo., won the moguls world  
championships last week in Switzerland. She finished well in front 
of Michelle Roark and Emiko Torito for her fourth national title in 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Cabral of South Lake Tahoe, Calif., won the men's moguls  
championship. He was followed by Caleb Martin and Tony Basile. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action, Katie Monahan and Daron Rahlves won  
International Ski Federation downhill races on the Wildflower run 
at Snowbasin Ski Resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Monahan, who was fifth behind Kirsten Clark in Friday's downhill  
national championships, beat Jonna Mendes by two-hundredths of a 
second in 1 minute, 19.49 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Rahlves finished second to Chad Fleischer for the U.S. downhill  
title, but took advantage of Fleischer's absence Saturday to post a 
solid victory over Casey Puckett and Dane Spencer in 1:14.12. 
Fleischer sat out because of an eye infection. 
</P>
<P>
	The national alpine championships continue on Sunday with the  
women's super-G at Snowbasin, while the dual moguls championship 
will be contested at Deer Valley.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Rumor Angers Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Marion County Prosecutor Scott Newman is  
angry about reports that heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson might be 
eligible for release from a Maryland jail as early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 5, Tyson entered into an agreement with Newman and  
other Marion County authorities to serve an additional 60 days in 
Maryland for violating his parole in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect a 60-day jail sentence to be served following the  
Maryland sentence,'' Newman said told the Indianapolis Star late 
Friday. Under ``good'' time provisions, if Tyson behaves in custody 
and accomplishes education and work credits, that time can be 
reduced to 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be in touch with Maryland correctional authorities on  
Monday,'' Newman said, insisting Tyson has not started serving any 
of that minimum 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	If released Friday, Tyson would be placed on work release or  
home detention to serve out the remainder of his sentence, 
according to one of his attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	James Voyles of Indianapolis, an attorney for Tyson, said a  
Washington Post article about the possibility of Tyson's release as 
early as Friday is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	The story said Stephen P. Johnson, a judge in Montgomery County,  
Md., told Tyson's attorneys and the Maryland state's attorney 
during a private meeting this week that he will rule March 26 on a 
request to reduce Tyson's one-year Maryland assault sentence to 
eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	Voyles said that under Maryland law, that state's Department of  
Correction determines through a grid system how much actual jail 
time an inmate must serve under a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Maryland judge reduces the sentence to eight months,  
Voyles said, the jail time could be between three and 30 days.

<HEADLINE> Loren Has Award Waiting for Benigni </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Sophia Loren has the drill down for Oscar night, if  
the foreign film award she hands out Sunday goes to fellow Italian 
film star Roberto Benigni: a big hug. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to make him a winner,'' Loren, speaking from in Los  
Angeles, says in Saturday's edition of Italy's Corrierre della 
Sera. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be me that hugs him,'' she said. ``I'll beat him to  
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ever exultant at his own success, Benigni gave actress Helen  
Hunt an exuberant onstage lift-and-twirl earlier this month when 
she presented him with the Screen Actors Guild award for best 
actor. 
</P>
<P>
	Film legend or no, Loren will get the same treatment if she  
declares his ``Life Is Beautiful'' a winner, Benigni makes clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want her to cradle me in her arms,'' Benigni told reporters  
last week. ``I want to lose myself between her breasts -- that would 
be beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benigni's ``Life Is Beautiful'' -- a tragic comedy about an  
Italian Jew who tries to shield his son from the horrors of the 
Holocaust -- is up for seven awards, a record for a foreign film. 
</P>
<P>
	Nominations for the film include his own for best actor. Only  
one person in Oscar history has won best lead for a foreign 
language film -- Loren herself, for ``Two Women'' in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life Is Beautiful'' deserves to share the glory, Loren says,  
to show the world a different Italy than just ``pizza, the Mafia 
and spaghetti.''

<HEADLINE> Washington Wizards Chief Scout Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Funeral services will be held Monday for  
William ``Bill'' Gardiner, the chief scout for the NBA's Washington 
Wizards since 1974 and former basketball coach at Loyola of New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardiner, 77, died Friday at Our Lady of the Lake Regional  
Medical Center in Baton Rouge following a brief illness. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Washington, D.C., Gardiner was in his 25th season  
with the Wizards, formerly the Washington Bullets, after spending 
four years as a scout with the Milwaukee Bucks. The highlight of 
his career was a championship ring won in 1978 when the Bullets 
defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he scouted college talent all across the country,  
Gardiner was a fixture along press row at LSU and Southern 
University basketball games during the 15 years he lived in Baton 
Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the pro ranks, Gardiner was a coach for 23 years  
at the college level -- 13 at Springhill (Ala.), eight at Loyola and 
two at Catholic University in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	At Springhill, Gardiner was also the athletic director and in  
1969 was president of the National Association of Basketball 
Coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a great passion for basketball,'' said Gardiner's son,  
Jay, an associate athletic director at Tulane. ``Not everybody gets 
to enjoy their avocation the way he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his second wife, Elaine, four sons, 12  
grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	A burial Mass was scheduled Monday followed by burial in Port  
Hudson National Cemetery in Zachary, La.

<HEADLINE> Past Recipients of Honorary Oscars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Motion Picture Academy has instituted honorary awards for  
lifetime achievement from the very beginning. The idea was to 
recognize accomplishments that might be overlooked in the 
year-to-year categories. Some were given for achievements before 
the academy was founded. Others were recognized as great actors and 
directors who had never won Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	Rarely have the honorary awards gone to those who have already  
received Oscars. This year's controversial recipient, Elia Kazan, 
is one of the exceptions; he was named best director in 1947 for 
``Gentleman's Agreement'' and in 1954 for ``On the Waterfront.''

the key to the agreement, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new quotas, which have yet to be made official, the 11  
OPEC members would produce a total of 25.4 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices have jumped almost $2 a barrel since the accord was  
announced, and some analysts foresee a possible rise to $16 a 
barrel by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for April  
delivery rose 24 cents to $15.46 a barrel on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a bit premature, all this excitement,'' Drollas  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the possible pitfalls to firmer prices would be a decision  
by Indonesia, Nigeria or Venezuela to break ranks and continue 
producing at current levels or beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	These three countries are seen as the OPEC members with the  
biggest immediate needs for money from oil sales, due to economic 
crises in Indonesia and Nigeria and the strength of oil worker 
unions in Venezuela. Yet each of them has apparently committed to 
curtailing production. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they may have seen the wisdom of the longer-term  
deal,'' said Barney Gray, an oil analyst with the brokerage 
Williams De Broe. ``The second quarter's going to be tough, but 
perhaps by the end of the year, they'll start to see the 
benefits.''

</P>
<P>
	PAGO PAGO, American Samoa (AP) -- Former Samoa Prime Minister  
Tofilau Eti Alesana died Friday at his home in Apia. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	His nephew, American Samoa Gov. Tauese Sunia, confirmed the  
death. Tofilau died at about 10:45 a.m. at Nafanua, the official 
residence of the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Tofilau, who served 15 years as prime minister of the former  
Western Samoa, resigned in November after undergoing cancer 
treatment in New Zealand. He was succeeded by Tuilaepa Sallele 
Malielegaoi. 
</P>

	Tofilau retained his seat in Parliament and was leader of the  
government's ruling Human Rights Protection Party.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A. Doak Barnett, 77, one of the nation's  
foremost scholars and advisers on China who pushed for renewed 
relations with the Asian country, died March 17. 
</P>
<P>
	He suffered from lung cancer.  
</P>
<P>
	Born in Shanghai to missionaries, Barnett went on to author or  
edit more than 20 books on China and to play an influential role in 
shaping U.S. policy in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	After a long period of severed ties between the two nations,  
Barnett advocated in 1966 that the United States reevaluate its 
overall approach to communist China. At a key Senate hearing on the 
issue that year, Barnett called for ``a policy of containment but 
not isolation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett's thinking gained support with President Lyndon B.  
Johnson, as China split from its alliance with the Soviet Union, 
and laid the groundwork for eventual renewal of relations initiated 
by President Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett returned to the United States as a teen-ager. He  
graduated from Yale University in 1942 and later received a 
master's degree there in international relations. He served in the 
Marines, emerging after World War II as a captain. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked in China as a correspondent for a Chicago newspaper in  
the late 1940s, and went on work for the State Department. Barnett 
taught at a number of universities and think-tanks.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bob Cato, who helped turn record album covers  
into a form of contemporary art and won two Grammy awards for his 
designs, died Friday due to complications of Alzheimer's disease. 
He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined CBS-Columbia Records in 1960, serving as art director  
and vice president of creative services for ten years. He worked 
with musicians including Miles Davis, Janis Joplin and Leonard 
Bernstein, and painters like Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol. 
</P>
<P>
	His cover designs for Barbara Streisand's ``People'' (1964) and  
``Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits'' (1967) won him Grammy awards from the 
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. He received the 
academy's President's Merit award in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Cato's career spanned 50 years, beginning in 1947 at Harper's  
Bazaar magazine. There he was exposed to a mixture of photography, 
Modernist art, open space and sharp typography that would help 
define his later work. 
</P>
<P>
	His final ten years were largely devoted to fine art,  
photography and producing books, including ``Joyce Images'' (1994).

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wilbur L. Pritchard, a radio satellite  
pioneer, died Thursday in Bethesda, Md., from lung cancer. He was 
75. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1950s, Pritchard helped develop a system for sending  
information via microwave transmissions and helped develop the 
first microwave oven as an engineer for the Raytheon Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s he directed a team that produced the nation's first  
operational military satellite system and assisted NATO with its 
satellite program. 
</P>
<P>
	An early advocate of using satellites in broadcasting, Pritchard  
joined the Communications Satellite Corp. in 1967 and established 
its Comsat Laboratories. In the 1970s he headed companies and 
consulting firms that designed communications satellites and worked 
in the area of cellular and mobile phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, he was producing telecommunications  
economic and technical studies as a consultant to private companies 
and governments, including Russia and Tonga.

<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Jaime Sabines, considered to be among the top  
Spanish-language poets, died Friday of cancer at age 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabines' writings were considered sparse and stark and vivid in  
imagery. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote mostly about love and death, but focused on other  
subjects as well, such as a small ode to Johann Sebastian Bach. 
</P>
<P>

For,'' ``I Don't Know If For Certain,'' ``The Poet and Death'' and 
``Of Death.''

Institutional Revolutionary Party from 1976 to 1979 and in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the prizes he won were the Chiapas Prize in 1959, the  
Xavier Villaurrutia in 1972, the Elias Sourasky in 1982 and the

	NATO Ready To Bomb Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An allied fleet of warships and attack planes  
is ready for a possible bombardment of Yugoslavia. An attack would 
likely begin with dozens of pilotless cruise missiles fired at 
critical points in the country's air defense network. Defense 
Secretary William Cohen ordered seven additional Air Force planes 
to Europe to join roughly 200 other American warplanes awaiting 
orders to attack. That is all the air power U.S. military officials 
in Europe say they need for punishing assaults on Yugoslav military 
targets. President Clinton declined to say whether NATO would set a 
deadline for acting in Kosovo.

	DJENERAL JANKOVIC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Houses were ablaze and  
ethnic Albanian villagers were reportedly driven from their homes 
by Yugoslav troops in black ski masks as the situation in Kosovo 
deteriorated dramatically today. Kosovo Liberation Army leaders 
implored NATO to launch airstrikes. ``If NATO will not intervene, 
we will continue our fighting. We have not many solutions: war or 
death,'' rebel spokesman Jakup Krasniqi said. As the violence in 
Kosovo escalated, international monitors left Kosovo today, 
signaling that the threat of NATO action was credible.

	Russia Searches for Bomb Suspects

<P>
	VLADIKAVKAZ, Russia (AP) -- Composite sketches of two suspects  
have been broadcast on television, and a nationwide search has been 
launched in the deadly bombing of a market in the capital of North 
Ossetia yesterday. The blast killed at least 51 people and severely 
wounded 104, according to the local Interior Ministry office. 
Meanwhile, the borders separating North Ossetia from other Caucasus 
regions were closed today. Russian Interior Minister Sergei 
Stepashin said the bombing was an ``act of sabotage aimed at 
destabilizing the situation in the North Caucasus and throughout 
Russia, at instigating a clash between the peoples.''

set by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. A joint statement by 
Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians urged the world to ``support 
this right and recognize the independent Palestinian state upon 
declaration.'' Arafat is touring European capitals and is due to 
meet with President Clinton on Tuesday to muster support for 
statehood.

	3 Hurt in Suicide Bombing in Turkey

<P>
	DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) -- A suicide bomber believed to be a  
Kurdish rebel detonated a bomb today, killing himself and wounding 
two police officers. Authorities stepped up security across Turkey, 
fearing more attacks timed to the Kurdish New Year. Police in the 
province of Sirnak managed to foil a second attack, stopping and 
arresting a rebel before she set off two grenades strapped to her 
waist. Authorities have intensified security around the country 
after a spate of violent attacks following last month's arrest in 
Kenya of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.

	BILBAO, Spain (AP) -- More than 60,000 demonstrators marched in  
northern Spain today to protest the recent arrests of alleged 
members and supporters of an armed Basque separatist group. Led by 
members of Herri Batasuna, the political wing of the ETA separatist 
group, protesters marched peacefully through downtown Bilbao, 220 
miles north of Madrid. A spokesman for Batasuna said the arrests of 
dozen of alleged ETA members two weeks ago were ordered by 
opponents of peace and accused the Spanish and French governments 
of oppressing the Basque region in northern Spain.

	PHOENIX (AP) -- Gonzaga's NCAA tournament magic disappeared in  
the frantic final few minutes today against Connecticut's 
relentless defense and strength on the offensive boards as the Big 
East champions pulled out a 67-62 victory. Connecticut's 
All-American, Richard Hamilton, scored 21 points and Khalid El-Amin 
gained redemption after a horrendous 0-for-12 shooting game to make 
two free throws with 34.4 seconds remaining. Kevin Freeman, who had 
13 points and 15 rebounds, iced it with two free throws with 6.2 
seconds to play.

<HEADLINE> Victim May Have Targeted Clinic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- A man killed when a pipe bomb accidentally  
exploded in his lap was apparently planning to blow up an abortion 
clinic to keep someone he knew from ending her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Hill, 24, suffered massive injuries when the bomb  
detonated Wednesday as he was finishing constructing it, police 
said. A second bomb was found in his home with a container of 
gunpowder. 
</P>
<P>
	Police refused to reveal the connection between Hill and the  
woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents said  
Hill, who had made comments to friends about his plans to blow up 
the clinic, was not part of ``a group or larger political 
conspiracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This did not seem to be an attack aimed at a person, but  
towards the facility,'' ATF agent Bob Dowlen said Friday. ``From 
the very beginning, everything indicated that he was acting alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``His family didn't seem to know anything about this. They feel  
very badly about losing their son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police would not release the name of the clinic Hill planned to  
bomb, but officials did say the clinic received a threat on March 
4. Hill had been seen near the clinic on at least two occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came to the clinic irate, demanding entrance, and he was  
seen near the clinic during a protest,'' said police spokesman Bill 
Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill had an extensive criminal history, with several convictions  
for aggravated assault. He was never charged with anything related 
to bomb-making. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion in a back bedroom set his parents' house on fire  
and forced the evacuated of the neighborhood. Hill's parents 
escaped without injury.

<HEADLINE> Prostitution Ring Preyed on Young </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Authorities say they have crushed a prostitution  
ring whose ringleader allegedly lured young, troubled girls to the 
city with promises of sympathy, money and dancing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	James Coleman, 39, was arraigned Friday on charges of  
transporting minors across state lines for prostitution and sex. 
Some girls were as young as 12, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four others were also named in federal warrants, but it was  
unclear Saturday if any had been arrested or arraigned. The FBI did 
not immediately return a call for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal affidavit says Coleman used numerous aliases as he  
befriended girls while traveling through West Virginia, Florida, 
Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Girls told investigators they left troubled homes after Coleman  
promised them money and jobs in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Once there, promises were replaced with 10- to 12-hour shifts as  
prostitutes in motels or as call girls in the Detroit area, 
according to the affidavit. Coleman employed as many as 20 girls at 
a time, investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls were confined in houses, supplied with drugs and  
subjected to beatings and threats, the affidavit said.

<HEADLINE> Bus Driver Accused of Molesting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- With a box full of candy and a pocket full of cash,  
a 65-year-old man driving a private school bus lured his victims -- 
some as young as 7 years old -- onto his lap where he would sexually 
abuse them, police say. 
</P>
<P>
	Bus driver Cesar Gonzalez-Rubio of North Miami Beach was denied  
bond Friday on charges he molested four young female passengers. He 
is scheduled to be arraigned April 7 on charges of sexual battery, 
lewd and lascivious behavior and threatening a witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have interviewed at least 13 other possible victims and  
say they expect more charges to be filed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This just keeps mushrooming,'' said officer Warren Hardison, a  
North Miami Beach police spokesman. ``One child gives us names of 
other kids. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez-Rubio, owner and operator of Ceasar's Bus Service, was  
arrested Wednesday. The school district, which contracts with 
private bus operators, will consider making information about bus 
drivers available to parents, said county school board member 
Demetrio Perez. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were alerted after sisters ages 7 and 11 told their  
father of more than a year of abuse by Gonzalez-Rubio, who they 
said swore them to secrecy. Police surveillance Wednesday allegedly 
caught Gonzalez-Rubio using candy to coax a boy into performing 
sexual favors. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Miami-Dade Police charged Gonzalez-Rubio with lewd and  
lascivious acts on an 11-year-old girl, but a plea bargain was 
reached after the child gave conflicting accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	That deal allowed Gonzalez-Rubio to avoid conviction as a sex  
offender and allowed him to continue operating his bus. 
</P>
<P>
	John Edwards, a state probation and parole administrator, said  
Gonzalez-Rubio ``would have been under a much more stringent set of 
rules'' if he was a sex offender. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably wouldn't have let him drive a school bus,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> El-Amin Cold in Huskies' Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Khalid El-Amin didn't care that he had played  
possibly his worst game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 0-for-12.  
</P>
<P>
	He made a key turnover in the last two minutes that almost did  
in his team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't score a bucket from the field, and we still won,'' he  
said after Connecticut survived Gonzaga 67-62 in Saturday's NCAA 
West Regional final. ``That just shows how much character we 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amin, a sophomore who was an honorable mention All-America,  
picked up two early fouls and played just four minutes in the first 
half. He wound up missing six 3-point attempts and slipped and fell 
on the court with 1:47 to go, giving Gonzaga the ball when the 
Huskies led just 61-59. 
</P>
<P>
	With 34 seconds left and Gonzaga trailing by just 63-62, Amin  
got another chance, and this time he came through, making two free 
throws that finally ended the Bulldogs' wild ride. 
</P>
<P>
	His five points on 5-for-6 shooting from the free-throw line was  
his second-lowest point total this season. After scoring 21 points 
in each of his previous two games, he went completely cold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wasn't making them,'' he said. ``I wasn't paying that  
much attention to detail.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OH, NO, NOT AGAIN!:* After watching Connecticut lose three  
regional finals and two regional semifinals in the 1990s, coach Jim 
Calhoun finally made it to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that he didn't have some worries. Connecticut finally had  
pulled way from Gonzaga, taking a 53-47 lead with 7:43 remaining, 
but the Bulldogs tied it within a minute on Quentin Hall's 
off-balance 3-pointer and Hall's three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lid fell down with that one-handed jump shot,'' Calhoun  
recalled. ``It's `Purgatory, here I am.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Khalid El-Amin was happy Calhoun finally made it to the national  
semifinals. El-Amin says he wanted the tag on Calhoun to be, ``Not 
the best coach not to get to the Final Four, but one of the best 
coaches ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SHOOTING BLANKS:* Gonzaga was 32-for-63 (.508) from 3-point  
range in its first three games during the NCAA tournament. Against 
Connecticut, the Bulldogs were 5-for-21, missing their first eight 
3s in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team isn't just a 3-point-shooting freak show,'' Gonzaga  
coach Dan Monson said. ``They've won games where they haven't shot 
well before.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BOARDING SCHOOL:* Perhaps the biggest difference in the game  
was rebounding. Connecticut outrebounded Gonzaga 47-33, including 
21-13 on the offensive boards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies had a 25-14 rebounding advantage in the second half,  
including 13-4 on their own missed shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're in a zone against a team like that, they're just  
piranhas on the boards,'' Gonzaga coach Dan Monson said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ALL-TOURNAMENT TEAM:* Connecticut's Richard Hamilton was picked  
as the most outstanding player in the West Regional. He was joined 
on the all-regional team by teammates Kevin Freeman and Ricky 
Moore, and by Gonzaga's Quentin Hall and Casey Calvary.

<HEADLINE> Forest Service Orders Oil Paint Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- The Forest Service, citing concerns about  
possible health problems for its workers, has ordered an end to the 
use of oil-based paint to mark trees for logging. 
</P>
<P>
	The order, effective May 15, comes a week after a worker  
advocacy group filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington 
D.C. seeking an injunction to ban the use of the paint. The group 
blames the paint for increased rates of miscarriages and other 
ailments among Forest Service employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was announced Friday despite objections from within  
the agency, including an offer from the chairman of the Forest 
Service's paint committee to resign in protest, according to 
internal memos obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``This direction is necessary because of the uncertainty  
regarding safety to employees,'' Phil Janik, the Forest Service's 
chief operating officer, said in a memo to regional foresters and 
station directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Unused paint will be kept in storage.  
</P>
<P>
	Skip Garrett, the paint committee chairman and an engineer at  
the agency's research center in San Dimas, Calif., believes the 
paint is safe. Garrett did not return telephone messages at his 
office on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move drew a skeptical response from the head of the group  
that filed the lawsuit and accuses the agency of using the paint 
illegally for years without conducting an environmental impact 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a decade of broken promises from the Forest Service  
on tree paint,'' said Andy Stahl, executive director of the 
Association of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics. 
</P>
<P>
	Stahl said he's not dropping the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
	Oil-based paint has been used widely in national forests over  
the past 10 years. The solvents in the paint allow it to be sprayed 
outdoors during freezing weather, when other paints might thicken 
or freeze. 
</P>
<P>
	A study by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and  
Health found an increased risk of miscarriage among Forest Service 
foresters who used various brands of tree-marking paint. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers in Oregon and the Lake Tahoe basin began complaining to  
supervisors in the early 1990s of blurry vision, confusion, nausea, 
fatigue, chronic sinus irritation, headaches and diarrhea.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Kamieniecki Misses Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Operating on the theory that it's  
better to be safe than sorry during spring training, Baltimore 
Orioles pitcher Scott Kamieniecki skipped his scheduled start 
Saturday because of a strained left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamieniecki, who said he felt a twinge in the leg while running  
Friday, expects to reclaim his spot in the rotation the next time 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	He was replaced Saturday by Doug Linton, who pitched three  
scoreless innings in the Orioles' 3-2 victory over the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to hurt myself further, so I'm just taking a day  
off,'' Kamieniecki said before the game. ``Why push it at this 
point? That's stupid. I've come too far to push it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kamieniecki is attempting to rebound from a horrid 1998 season  
in which he made only 11 starts because of a variety of injuries, 
including a herniated disk in his neck that forced him to the 
sidelines for good in August. 
</P>
<P>
	He underwent surgery in September and arrived at spring training  
claiming to be in perfect health. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamieniecki, who's expected to fill the No. 4 spot in the  
rotation, has yet to give up a run in two starts this spring while 
limiting the opposition to a .238 batting average over six innings. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander figured missing one start wouldn't hurt his  
effort to be in peak form in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not bad, but if I try to run hard in a game situation I  
could pop it and I'd be out for at least a couple weeks,'' 
Kamieniecki said. ``This way I'll just take a couple days off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was just fine with manager Ray Miller, who saw no need to  
push the 34-year-old pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``He probably could pitch but I don't want to rush him,'' Miller  
said. ``I sure don't want to take any chances with him. The last 
thing I want is for him to tear it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kamieniecki wasn't the only Oriole to take the day off because  
of an injury. Second baseman Jeff Reboulet, who has been bothered 
by tendinitis in his left foot, missed a second straight game -- 
quite by design. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller intends to give Reboulet liberal amounts of rest this  
spring, in part because starting second baseman Delino DeShields 
will miss the first week of the regular season with a broken hand 
and Reboulet needs to be ready for opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The foot is) getting better but it's a setback every time he  
plays,'' Miller said. ``This will just give us a chance to look at 
the other two kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Hairston Jr. started at second base and Jesse Garcia, a  
second baseman by trade, started at shortstop.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Bengal Sentenced to 22 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former running back Stanley Wilson, whose NFL  
career with the Cincinnati Bengals was plagued by drug problems, 
was sentenced to 22 years in prison Friday for stealing about 
$130,000 worth of property. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, 37, was convicted last month of stealing jewelry, camera  
equipment and other valuables from a Beverly Hills home on Jan. 24, 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the state's ``three strikes'' law, prosecutors were  
seeking a 25 years to life term because Wilson had already served 
time for burglarizing two homes in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Frank J. Johnson eliminated one of the  
``strikes'' against Wilson, but sentenced him to the maximum on two 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	In throwing out the third strike, Johnson cited Wilson's  
``mental problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to battling a cocaine habit, Wilson suffers from  
bipolar disorder, defense attorney H. Clay Jacke said. The 
affliction is characterized by alternating states of mania and 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacke said Wilson is ``a very good man with a very big (mental)  
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, who lives in nearby Westchester, sobbed during much of  
the hearing in West Los Angeles Superior Court, and as he began to 
make remarks to the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I left prison (the first time), I truly believed I wasn't  
going to do it anymore,'' he said. ``I believed it in my heart. ... 
I have always been against all these things I am charged with. ... 
It's so strange. The person sitting here is not the person who ... 
did these things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Wilson told the judge: ``All I'm asking is ... you do  
what you have the power to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen people appeared to support Wilson, including his  
father, son and wife. Also there was the Rev. William T. Ervin, who 
played football with Wilson at Banning High in nearby Carson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wilson has good character,'' Ervin said. ``He comes from a  
family of good character. If he's given another chance at this 
point, he can run for the goal line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson told authorities he burglarized the home because he  
needed money to feed his cocaine habit, deputy district attorney 
Suzanne Tragert said, adding that for about a year before the 
burglary, Wilson had done construction and landscaping work at the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, who attended Oklahoma before joining the Bengals, was  
suspended for the 1985 and 1987 NFL seasons for drug violations. 
</P>
<P>
	In his lowest NFL moment, he missed the Super Bowl in January  
1989 after being found the night before in a stupor at a Miami 
motel. The Bengals lost to the San Francisco 49ers 20-16. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson was banned from the NFL later in 1989 for his repeated  
drug offenses.

<HEADLINE> Blues Send Carey Back To Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Jim Carey is back in the minor leagues again,  
and the St. Louis Blues don't know when or if he'll return. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey, signed a two-year deal with the Blues on March 1 -- one  
day after agreeing to a buyout with the Boston Bruins. On Saturday, 
he was assigned to the Cincinnati Cyclones of the International 
Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's only 24 years old. Whether he can play in the NHL is up  
to him to prove,'' general manager Larry Pleau said. ``It's not for 
me to decide, it's up to him to prove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Vezina Trophy winner appeared in four games with the  
Blues and was 1-2 with a 3.86 goals-against average, often 
appearing out of sync. The Blues lost confidence in him after a 
spectacular flame-out against Calgary March 9, when he allowed four 
third-period goals in a 7-4 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``He probably thought the bottom of the barrel was when he left  
Boston,'' Pleau said. ``But the bottom of the barrel for me was 
when he played against Calgary in the third period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carey played only one game after that, a 5-2 victory over the  
Chicago Blackhawks, getting the start because Grant Fuhr had played 
the previous night and had soreness in his surgically repaired 
right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Pleau doesn't regret signing Carey for $800,000 for the  
remainder of this season and next season, even though it hasn't 
worked out so far. The team made the move while Fuhr was recovering 
from knee surgery and with other candidates struggling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were still looking for a No. 1 goalie and the contract was  
very reasonable under the situation,'' Pleau said. ``We did it, and 
the rest is history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues sent Carey to Cincinnati because they already have two  
goalies at their Worcester, Mass., affiliate in the AHL, Brent 
Johnson and Rich Parent. Pleau said Carey likely will get regular 
work in Cincinnati due to goaltending injuries there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked to some IHL teams and felt this was his best  
situation,'' Pleau said. ``It'll be good experience for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pleau wouldn't rule out Carey competing for the No. 1 job next  
season as the Blues search for a successor to Fuhr, 36. Fuhr is 
signed through next season and likely will share the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't expect Grant to be No. 1,'' Pleau said. ``We just  
want this guy to get us through until we can find one, and he's 
been doing a pretty good job of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carey won the Vezina as the NHL's top goalie in the 1995-96  
season with the Washington Capitals. He played in 71 games that 
season, with a 35-24-9 record and 2.26 goals-against average. 
</P>
<P>
	He was traded to Boston during the 1996-97 season, struggled and  
lost his job to Byron Dafoe before being sent to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey played 30 games this season with Providence of the  
American Hockey League, where he posted a 17-8-3 record and 2.34 
goals-against average.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Says Farrakhan Resting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Under doctor's orders, Nation of Islam leader  
Louis Farrakhan is taking four months off to recuperate from cancer 
treatment side effects, the flu and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Abdul Alim Muhammad strongly denied reports that the  
65-year-old Farrakhan was on his deathbed: ``Some of you who have 
black hair now -- your hair will be silver before he leaves the 
scene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no death vigil. There is no death watch,'' Muhammad  
said Friday at a news conference at Farrakhan's Salaam restaurant. 
``The minister's life is not in imminent danger from any medical 
cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan did not attend, but representatives said only that he  
was not in a hospital. The Rev. Jesse Jackson said he spoke with 
Farrakhan on Friday and found ``his voice vibrant and strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nation of Islam's official publication, The Final Call,  
recently reported that Farrakhan has struggled to overcome ``the 
forces of death'' since coming down with a mysterious illness in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper quoted the minister as saying Feb. 28 that he had  
lost 20 pounds in two weeks and had ``no appetite, night sweats ... 
the after-effects of radiation therapy and other things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan was first treated for what his doctor called ``garden  
variety prostate cancer'' in 1991, using a hormonal therapy. Three 
years later, doctors began planting bits of radioactive metal in a 
bid to kill cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan has 238 such seeds, his doctor said. Muhammad said  
Farrakhan's score on a prostate specific antigen test has ranged 
from an ominous 16 to below one -- a level shown by men who are free 
of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	He has suffered intestinal discomfort as well as anemia as side  
effects of the treatment, Muhammad said. Two bouts of the flu last 
September and 40 years of leading his Nation of Islam have left 
Farrakhan in a weakened condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan is used to rising long before dawn, practicing his  
violin for two hours, working out for two hours and then putting in 
a long, physically demanding day, Muhammad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan will stay out of sight and rest for four months before  
returning to go on a 35-city tour of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``You all will have to wait four months before you see him, and  
then you can judge for yourself,'' Muhammad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan has sparked controversy with his outspoken support of  
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, whom he has visited several times, 
and his negative comments about Jews, Christians, white people and 
the government.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Anti-Gun Strategy / Presidential Speech  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Saturday directed federal  
law enforcement officials to work more closely with local 
authorities to thwart illegal gun sales and expand the prosecution 
of criminals who use guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Seated by Attorney General Janet Reno, two city police chiefs  
and other officials, Clinton said in his weekly radio address that 
the Justice and Treasury departments would report to him with ``a 
plan to reduce gun violence by applying proven local strategies to 
fight gun crime nationwide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an example, he cited a program run by the Bureau of Alcohol  
Tobacco and Firearms and federal prosecutors in Richmond, Va. 
``Project Exile'' uses current federal laws to deny bail to gun 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun murders dropped in Richmond by 41 percent between mid-1997  
and mid-1998, Clinton said. Richmond's police chief, Jerry Oliver, 
attended Clinton's address, as did Chief Robert Olsen of 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guns have magnified the malevolence of crime,'' Clinton said,  
adding that disarming criminals remained his top crime-fighting 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wayne Lapierre, executive vice president of the National  
Rifle Association, who also voiced support for ``Project Exile,'' 
rejected the president's approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has magnified the level of crime is the fact that we are  
not doing the most common sense thing at all, which is confronting 
criminals directly and take them off the street,'' Lapierre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lapierre accused Clinton of introducing the measures to fend off  
expected criticism of his administration's gun-crime prosecution 
record at a Senate hearing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orin Hatch, R-Utah, said Friday the hearing would examine  
firearms prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted that the nation's crime rate has dropped by more  
than 20 percent since he took office in 1993. But he said too many 
people still are killed by guns -- 14,000 in 1997, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	The president directed Reno and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin,  
who oversees the ATF, to: 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase investigation and prosecution of significant firearms  
violations, including illegal possession and the trafficking of 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	--Expand the tracing and mapping of ``crime guns'' and coordinate  
the sharing of ballistics identification technology. 
</P>
<P>
	--Strengthen law enforcement coordination and compliance with  
federal gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
	--Improve coordination of probation and parole supervision of  
such offenders and implement swift punishment for such parole and 
probation violators 
</P>
<P>
	--Promote community-based ways of identifying gun criminals and  
removing weapons from juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said his budget for the next fiscal year proposes to  
help cut gun-related crime by spending $5 million for dozens of new 
federal prosecutors and $23.8 million for more than 120 new ATF 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	As he lobbied for his $1.3 billion ``21st Century Policing  
Initiative,'' Clinton also criticized the Republican majority in 
Congress for wanting to deny more than $1 billion of that total.

	H. George Taylor, 68, was killed as he pulled his Mercedes-Benz  
into his driveway Thursday. His wife, identified as Lynda by 
neighbors, was found in her bathrobe on the floor of the garage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly at this point, it could be anything,'' said Chip  
Patterson, a San Bernardino County Sheriff's spokesman. ``There was 
no note left, nothing left to indicate the motive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators didn't believe anything was taken from the home,  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Larry Waggoner said he ran to the Taylor house after  
hearing about five shots. The area is usually quiet, neighbor Betty 
Pinkerton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then you have a double murder. It is disconcerting,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor became a commissioner in March 1986. Court commissioners  
hear divorce, custody and estate cases, as judges do. The 
difference is that commissioners are hired by the court and preside 
over a case only if all parties agree to the arrangement.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Sightseer Case Vexes FBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PORTAL, Calif. (AP) -- Looking for clues in the disappearance  
of his wife, daughter, and a young family friend from Argentina, 
Jens Sund pushed the photos across the bar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Have you seen them?'' he asked the owner of the Cedar Lodge  
restaurant. ``This would have been Monday night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sund knew they had stayed at the Cedar Lodge that night, his  
wife had called him and said she and the girls had been to Yosemite 
that day. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner remembered them. They'd been in for dinner.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the last confirmed sighting of the three women.  
</P>
<P>
	What happened to Mrs. Sund, 42, her 15-year-old daughter Julie  
and 16-year-old Silvina Pelosso has become a mystery with twists 
and turns as jarring as the roads in the rugged wilderness where 
they were last seen alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Their disappearance Feb. 15 prompted a massive search in this  
mining country just outside Yosemite National Park. Hopes faded 
days later when Mrs. Sund's wallet was found in the middle of a 
busy intersection two hours away. Then nothing for almost a month, 
until someone spotted the burned-out shell of their rental car 
earlier this week. Two burned bodies were discovered in the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Where was the third body?  
</P>
<P>
	So far, officials haven't found it. The discovery was just one  
more angle in a twisted mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	There's the sleepy backwater towns and remote mountain enclaves  
being turned inside out for clues. There's Mrs. Sund's half-eaten 
meal, which sat in a box at the end of the Cedar Lodge bar, waiting 
for her return. Her billfold was found with unused credit cards. 
Two ex-cons, one a night janitor at the lodge, have been questioned 
and thrown in jail on unrelated parole charges. Wealthy relatives 
put up a $300,000 reward for information. The rental car was dumped 
in a national forest three hours from the lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of the bodies has sent family members into  
seclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday was the worst, the very worst,'' said Sund's  
brother-in-law Ron Caton. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI says there are new, strong leads and believe the person  
who torched and abandoned the car clearly knew the area. It was 
found in dense woods off muddy logging roads that are used by 
locals as a dumping ground. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are still no answers.  
</P>
<P>
	Sund reported the women missing on Feb. 17, a few days after he  
and his three other children missed a rendezvous with them at San 
Francisco airport. He said he didn't realize anything was wrong for 
about 36 hours, that it was all just a mix-up. 
</P>
<P>
	They had planned to meet at the airport gate, where Sund, his  
three adopted children and Silvina would go to the Grand Canyon. 
Mrs. Sund and Julie were going to fly from San Francisco back home 
to Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
	But his flight was five hours late, so he and the three children  
rushed to make a connecting flight. In Phoenix he called home that 
night and in the morning. He couldn't track them down but still 
wasn't worried -- maybe he had the day or the plane wrong, he 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
	So he played 18 holes of golf.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're in Phoenix, and you want to go play golf. Yeah, I'm  
guilty about it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	By that afternoon, he was worried. A neighbor who was supposed  
to meet the women for a campus tour at the University of Pacific in 
Stockton said they'd never shown up. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I knew something was wrong, because she's very  
responsible,'' Sund said. ``If she tells somebody she's going to do 
something, be somewhere, you know, she doesn't blow people off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He reported them missing about 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, flying back  
to San Francisco the next morning. He met Caton and they headed to 
El Portal, just outside Yosemite, and began trying to retrace the 
women's route and prod authorities to swifter action. 
</P>
<P>
	They talked to construction crews and workers at the motel.  
Within hours, other family members arrived, some in their own 
planes, to help search. 
</P>
<P>
	When Mrs. Sund's wallet turned up in Modesto on Feb. 19, a good  
two-hour drive west of Cedar Lodge, the investigation picked up 
steam. The FBI took over the case as a possible kidnapping or 
carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
	The families offered rewards for information, and tips began  
streaming in. 
</P>
<P>
	But after a month, the only sighting the FBI confirmed was the  
dinner at the lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	They say the girls came in, grabbed a booth near the front door,  
and waited for their mother to place their order. The girls ate 
hamburgers. Mrs. Sund got a veggie burger. 
</P>
<P>
	She didn't finish it and asked for it to be wrapped, then left  
it behind. The waitress left it at the end of the bar just in case 
she came back for it. She didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Unconfirmed reports had the women casually shopping and buying  
gas the next day in two villages hundreds of miles away, close to 
where their car was found. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said long before the discovery of the bodies that they  
believed the women met violent deaths not long after that meal at 
the Cedar Lodge and focused the investigation in that area. Now the 
search has shifted north, to the area where the car was found. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to find the animals that did this. They're terrible  
people. We don't want them to do this to anyone else's daughter or 
granddaughter,'' Mrs. Sund's mother, Carole Carrington, said.

	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The New York-New Jersey MetroStars  
got two goals from Eduardo Hurtado in regulation and three saves 
from goalkeeper Mike Ammann in the shootout to beat Miami 3-2 in an 
MLS opener. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars outscored Miami 2-1 in the five-round shootout  
after the teams played to a 2-2 tie after 90 minutes. It was the 
MetroStars' first victory in an opener in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurtado's first goal came on a chip from 12 yards in the 36th  
minute. Tab Ramos assisted by dribbling uncontested through the 
center of the defense and passing to Hurtado. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurtado, nicknamed ``The Tank'', made it 2-0 when he one-timed  
Mark Chung's pass from 15 yards past Fusion keeper Dusty Hudock in 
the 52nd minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami tied it on goals by Brazilian newcomer Roberto Gaucho and  
Duke rookie Jay Heaps. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars played the last eight minutes with 10 men after  
defender Arley Palacios was red-carded for a tackle from behind on 
Mario Gori.

<HEADLINE> Civil Rights Cases Rarely Tried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Edward Swans was hogtied and left on his belly in a holding cell  
in the Lansing, Mich., jail. 
</P>
<P>
	It was shortly before noon on a bitterly cold February day in  
1996, and Swans was no stranger there. He'd been arrested 30 times 
in his 40 years, and police knew him to be a chronic drug abuser, 
homeless and mentally ill. He was also a veteran and the father of 
five young children. 
</P>
<P>
	Five hours earlier, he had stumbled into the jail booking room,  
shirtless and shivering. Police had given him coffee and a shirt, 
then took him to a homeless shelter where a worker found him 
``possibly manic'' and ``very, very nervous.'' He walked away. 
</P>
<P>
	It was shortly after that that police got a 911 call: an  
altercation between Swans and a woman. When they responded, Swans 
was foaming at the mouth, talking to God. 
</P>
<P>
	And he kicked and punched one of the officers.  
</P>
<P>
	Returned to the jail, he thrashed as officers tried to strap him  
in a restraining chair. They moved him into an isolation cell to 
hogtie him. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11:43 a.m., a detention officer turned on a video camera. Its  
images show eight officers in the tiny room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't do it,'' Swans kept saying. He urinated on the floor,  
causing the officers to slip. Officers tied Swans' wrists and 
ankles together on his back, restraining his head and shoulders. By 
the time he was tied, Swans wasn't moving. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old black man struggled for a moment. He could not  
breathe in this position. And he died. 
</P>
<P>
	Did the officers, all white, mistreat Eddie Swans because of his  
race? That's the claim of his father. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI investigated and sent its report to federal prosecutors.  
</P>
<P>
	What happened next? Nothing.  
</P>
<P>
	In fact, that's what usually happens.  
</P>
<P>
	In 96 percent of the roughly 2,000 civil rights criminal cases  
referred each year to U.S. attorneys by the FBI or other agencies, 
federal prosecutors take no action. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, these prosecutors go to court nine out of 10  
times when police send them immigration cases, three out of four 
times for drug cases. Across the board, the federal government 
prosecutes about half of all criminal matters referred by police. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press analyzed computer records of all 1.4  
million cases considered by the Justice Department between 1992 and 
'96, and reviewed department reports and case memos obtained 
through the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights crimes are the department's lowest prosecutorial  
priority, the record shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Most civil rights cases involve allegations of abuse, rape or  
homicide by police or other law enforcement figures. Are federal 
prosecutors reluctant to prosecute police? 
</P>
<P>
	No, says Acting Assistant Attorney General Bill Lann Lee, who  
heads the Justice Department's 47-lawyer civil rights section. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vast majority of complaints do not result in prosecution  
because in many cases the evidence indicates that no violation 
occurred, there is insufficient evidence to satisfy the law's high 
burden of proof, or the police department or local prosecutor has 
already taken action against the officer, which removes the need 
for a federal prosecution,'' Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The burden of proof in civil rights crimes includes showing  
intent -- that a perpetrator ``willfully'' deprived someone of a 
civil right. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard constitutional law scholar Laurence Tribe said imposing  
a greater burden of proof when prison guards and police officers 
are accused is not reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indeed, it seems outrageous,'' he said, ``since the gravest  
abuses of power -- and the gravest threats to personal liberty and 
security -- are those in which the very individuals to whom we look 
for the preservation of law and of order turn out to be the 
predators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Edward Swans thinks it's outrageous, too. After his son  
died in the Lansing jail, he sued the city, and in 1997 jurors in a 
federal civil trial awarded his family $12.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, this is blood money, money off of my son's life,'' said  
the elder Swans, who runs a small cinderblock church in the town of 
Covert, near Lake Michigan. ``That's not justice. If there were 
justice, those police would be behind bars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The award was upheld in November by U.S. Chief Judge Richard  
Enslen, who expressed his personal outrage at the city for Swans' 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was almost a case of `justice denied' because, but for  
the video, there would have been no contradictory evidence to the 
testimony of the defendants,'' Enslen wrote. ``This should cause 
court observers to wonder how many similar cases went unproved 
without the awful, but truthful eye of the camera.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City officials are appealing the verdict.  
</P>
<P>
	``The officers were doing their job,'' Lansing Mayor David  
Hollister said, acknowledging, ``I can't sit here in good 
conscience and tell you it won't happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, in 1995 a jury had found the city liable for $1.5  
million in the death of Richard Vine, who died in the same cell as 
Swans after a struggle with guards. 
</P>
<P>
	Why were the police not prosecuted?  
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department attorneys' report closing the Swans case  
said: ``There's not enough evidence to show that the subjects 
intended to cause the death of the victim nor is there enough 
evidence to show that they intended to deprive him of his civil 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last April, Assistant Attorney General Lee was asked about the  
case while attending a forum in Detroit on police misconduct. He 
promised to have prosecutors take another look at the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing has happened since. U.S. Attorney Michael Detmer in  
Grand Rapids said he asked attorneys representing the Swans family 
for the videotape of the jail death and any other evidence they can 
show him and has heard nothing back. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you want me to do? Issue a subpoena?'' he asked. ``I'm  
still happy to look at the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swans' attorney Richard Foster said he wondered why federal  
investigators do not gather the evidence they need. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Department of Justice has appeared to be content with  
private groups and private lawyers fighting the political battles 
against state and local government officials in the civil rights 
arena,'' said Jim Green of West Palm Beach, Fla., a former American 
Civil Liberties Union attorney who makes a living suing communities 
over illegal police searches and beatings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad,'' he said. Lawsuit settlements ``do little to  
discourage abuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Isler at the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in Washington,  
D.C., is a contact point for civil rights complaints of all kinds. 
The most serious allegations -- racist attacks, police brutality, 
prison beatings -- go to the Justice Department's criminal civil 
rights unit. Isler estimates he forwards about 700 of those a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's what happens,'' he said. ``We get a form letter back  
saying that Justice basically does not feel that the complaint is 
in their jurisdiction and encouraging the person to get a private 
attorney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are practical reasons for hesitating to prosecute police,  
according to Roger Clegg, a Reagan administration Justice 
Department official and now general counsel of the Center for Equal 
Opportunity, a Washington, D.C., group that challenges civil rights 
regulation in the business world and racial quotas in education. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights complaints are disproportionately brought by  
criminals, he said. ``Which is not to say that criminals don't have 
rights, but there are some credibility problems with a higher 
percentage of these complaints ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have a much better chance of winning other types of  
cases, which makes drug or immigration prosecutions a better use of 
resources, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights laws grew out of the Civil War and the sweeping  
changes to abolish slavery. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1871, Congress passed the Ku Klux Act so that police who  
escaped local prosecution after recklessly harming black people 
could be brought to justice in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal civil rights law puts teeth in the Constitution's 14th  
Amendment, which guarantees equal protection for all. When 
Americans complain that their civil rights have been criminally 
violated, it falls to the Justice Department to judge whether a 
complaint has merit. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of these cases are meritless. Most of them are,'' said  
Monte Richardson, executive assistant U.S. attorney in Tampa, Fla. 
``We get complaints about police brutality when someone is drunk 
and the police officer grabbed them and arrested them and they got 
a bruise on their arm. They'll take a picture of the bruise and 
send it to us. We get a lot of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If a plausible complaint comes across Richardson's desk, he  
sends it to the FBI for a preliminary investigation. The FBI 
investigation is sent to Richardson and an attorney at the civil 
rights division in Washington, D.C. Then, together, the attorneys 
decide whether to investigate further, prosecute, or drop the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost always, they and their fellow federal prosecutors drop  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Tron Brekke, an FBI spokesman who for six years headed the  
bureau's office of civil rights, said he doesn't dwell on the lack 
of action taken on criminal civil rights cases sent to the 
Department of Justice for possible prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd all be manic-depressives if we looked at the fact that 98  
percent of these cases go nowhere,'' said Brekke. ``We're doing a 
service, we feel, to the extent that we investigate and review all 
the complaints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and other law enforcement agencies typically receive  
about 10,000 complaints a year alleging a civil rights crime. After 
screening, about 2,000 cases annually reach prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez, who oversees  
criminal civil rights, said his attorneys review every case the FBI 
brings them. He could not explain why complaints sometimes are 
ignored for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suggest you go there,'' he said, pointing across the street  
at the FBI. The bureau had pointed to Justice to get the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know of no genre of cases that are more difficult to  
prove,'' said Perez. ``We do our best, and I think we do it 
well.... The law is being vigorously enforced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Justice Department does prosecute civil rights cases,  
it wins convictions 83 percent of the time, a rate 3 percent higher 
than for all cases. But federal prosecutors around the country 
offer several reasons why they decline cases so often. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it can be a more difficult burden even than beyond a  
reasonable doubt because you have a law enforcement officer who 
jurors are going to presume is doing a good job,'' said U.S. 
Attorney William Blagg in San Antonio, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are different credibilities in the two types of  
witnesses we're dealing with,'' agreed U.S. Attorney L.J. Hymel in 
Baton Rouge, La. The FBI brought 285 criminal civil rights 
investigations to prosecutors in Hymel's district between 1992 and 
1996. None were prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	Does this mean likely instances of criminal civil rights abuses  
are turned down? 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, all the time,'' said Mike Gennacoe, an assistant U.S.  
Attorney in Los Angeles. ``A lot of cases are closed when it's just 
the word of an officer against the word of the aggrieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Burnham, co-director of TRAC, a federal records  
clearinghouse in Washington, D.C., said the large sums paid by 
public agencies to defend civil rights lawsuits show that the 
system is not working. 
</P>
<P>
	``When cops and prison guards use their power to brutalize the  
public, the rule of law demands that they be held accountable for 
their crimes,'' said Burnham. They are not, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief complaint heard from the Justice Department's civil  
rights staff is that it can't do more without more funding. This 
year they received a raise, to $6.7 million from $4.9 million last 
year for the civil rights division criminal unit. Some say that's 
still inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Civil Rights Division of Justice is so small it's sort of  
the dance band of the Titanic,'' said Stephen Bright, director of 
the Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta. ``We're always 
referring things up there, and they just don't have the staff to 
deal with them.''

	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Ante Razov had two goals and an assist  
as the Chicago Fire beat the San Jose Clash 3-1 Saturday night in 
the season opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose took a 1-0 lead when Jeff Baicher scored on a diving  
header off a cross from Scott Bower. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Fire rallied in the second half, beginning with Razov's  
first goal 58 minutes into the game. Chris Armas sent a ball to 
Josh Wolff, who passed it to Razov for a shot from the top of the 
penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal ended Clash goalkeeper David Kramer's shutout streak at  
398 minutes, which began last season. The streak is the 
second-longest in MLS history, behind Tony Meola's 414 scoreless 
minutes for the MetroStars in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Razov set up Jerzy Podbrozny for the go-ahead goal in the 66th

<HEADLINE> Court to Reconsider Student Prayer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- After voting to allow students to lead  
prayer at high school graduations, a federal appeals court has 
withdrawn its decision and passed the issue on to a larger panel of 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Last May, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals upheld the policy of heavily Mormon school district in 
Idaho that allows the top students in each senior class to decide 
whether to include a prayer in their graduation speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges said no one's rights were violated as long as the  
students were free to decide on the prayer without interference 
from the district. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the appeals court said Friday a majority of its active  
judges had voted to refer the case to an 11-judge panel for a new 
hearing. The court apparently took the vote at the request of one 
of its judges. 
</P>
<P>
	James B. Lynch, a lawyer for the Madison, Idaho, school  
district, said he wasn't sure what issues the judges wanted to 
consider. He declined comment on the court's order. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Pevar, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer whose  
clients challenged the policy, said he was surprised and cautiously 
hopeful. Pevar said his clients were two non-Mormon students who 
felt ``like outcasts'' at graduation ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court covers nine Western states.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules Pollution Criminal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court ruled that water  
pollution can be punishable by a year in jail if caused by simple 
negligence or carelessness, setting a broad standard for 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-0 ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was  
issued Friday and applies to prosecutions under the Clean Water Act 
in nine Western states. 
</P>
<P>
	Most crimes involving unintentional acts require proof of gross  
negligence or a failure to use even slight care. The court, 
however, said criminal prosecution under the water law can be based 
on ordinary negligence or a failure to use reasonable care. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case, Edward Hanousek Jr. of the Pacific &AMP; Arctic Railway  
and Navigation Co. was convicted of negligently discharging 1,000 
to 5,000 gallons of oil into Alaska's Skagway River in October 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil came from a pipeline ruptured by a backhoe operator  
working on a project overseen by Hanousek. He was sentenced to six 
months in jail, six months in a halfway house and fined $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In upholding his conviction, the appeals court said Hanousek was  
held responsible for his own negligence, not that of the backhoe 
operator. The court cited prosecution evidence that Hanousek was in 
charge and knew of the dangers of operating heavy machinery near 
the pipeline.

<HEADLINE> Ultralight Expert Killed in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKEWOOD, N.J. (AP) -- A 75-year-old ultralight pilot who won  
nationwide acclaim as a leading expert on the unconventional planes 
died Saturday when his ultralight crashed onto a golf course less 
than a mile away from his flight center. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Vitollo's ultralight nose-dived to the ground, killing  
him and critically injuring a passenger, Theodore Koziol of Brick 
Township. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators do not know what caused the plane to crash, said  
Gregory Sakowicz, an executive assistant Ocean County prosecutor. 
Authorities said the weather was clear and the winds were low. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitollo trained thousands of people to fly ultralights, and last  
year won a national award from the U.S. Ultralight Association for 
promoting and advancing the sport, said Richard Dinnerman, an 
ultralight pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash was not the first time an ultralight pilot has died in  
Lakewood. On July 25, 1994, a pilot died when a plane that took off 
from Vitollo's Ultralight Flight Center crashed.

<HEADLINE> Chaney Seeks Temple's 1st Final 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- John Chaney's tie is loosened  
almost from the start of the game, the jacket gone soon after that. 
Sometimes the sleeves get rolled up early, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Let other coaches worry about Armani suits and accessories.  
Chaney is here to coach basketball for Temple and it is a full-time 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't teach classes,'' he said. ``I don't do clinics.''  
</P>
<P>
	He is simply a basketball coach, and that is quite enough. ``I  
love the kids and the challenge of working with kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney has a major challenge on his hands Sunday when  
sixth-seeded Temple bids for its first Final Four berth since 1958 
against No. 1 Duke, a team loaded with talent up and down the 
roster. The coach reduces the problem to a matter of fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	``They go to the bench and get an apple for an apple,'' he said.  
``We go to the bench and might take an apple out and put a lemon 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is matchup of urban against suburban, of hard-scrabble,  
inner-city against rolling hills and Gothic buildings, of 
button-down Mike Krzyzewski against disheveled John Chaney. 
</P>
<P>
	So how do the lemons beat the apples?  
</P>
<P>
	Chaney spent Saturday trying to figure that one out.  
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest challenge in athletics is trying to convince  
players that we know a little bit more about this game than they 
do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And after 27 years in the business, Chaney almost certainly  
does. 
</P>
<P>
	He uses the matchup zone, a defensive set that frustrates other  
teams and requires dedication by his players. They must buy into 
the system or they don't play for Chaney. It is a system that 
includes 5 a.m. practices in the dead of winter. Temple's 
inner-city kids think nothing of it. That is his program and they 
are his people. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney is less concerned with X's and O's than the kids. He is  
full of pride over the fact that Rasheed Brokenborough came to 
Temple as a Prop 48 player, forced to sit out his first year, and 
is graduating in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	That is Chaney's success story, a microcosm of his own success.  
He grew up in Philadelphia, told, like so many of his generation, 
not to even think about college. 
</P>
<P>
	``My counselor told me I was not college material, told me to  
take all vocational courses. That was one reason I didn't get a 
scholarship. I spent my time making cookie cutters and little 
stools. They convinced me I was not bright enough. Counselors used 
to do that. There was a mindset. Get a high school diploma, get a 
9-to-5 job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Chaney got a college education. Encouraged by his high  
school coach, he found his way to Bethune Cookman to play 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was a pretty good player,'' he said. ``I could  
handle the ball. I was selfish. If I were coaching me, I'd drive 
myself crazy, but I could score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney played 10 years in the Eastern League and then started  
coaching, first at Cheyney State, where his team won a Division II 
championship in 1977-78 and, for the last 17 seasons, at Temple. 
</P>
<P>
	His teams have won 604 games and he has taken Temple to 10  
straight NCAA tournaments and 14 in the last 15 years. There has 
never been a Final Four, though, and that is something he'd like 
before he walks away from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether he gets one now depends on how the lemons play on  
Sunday.

	Japan Marks Subway Nerve Gas Attack  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Station employees bowed their heads in prayer and  
victims' relatives placed flowers on subway platforms today in 
ceremonies marking the fourth anniversary of the deadly nerve gas 
attack on Tokyo's subways. At a station in central Tokyo, 30 subway 
workers and a dozen victims' relatives gathered and offered their 
prayers at 8 a.m. local time -- the time that members of the Aum 
Shinri Kyo doomsday cult released the poisonous gas on five Tokyo 
subway lines in 1995. Twelve people were killed and 5,300 were

	PHOENIX (AP) -- In last minute negotiations, flight attendants  
and America West Airlines have reached a contract agreement. The 
move ends a four-year fight over pay that brought the airline to 
the brink of a strike. The 2,300 flight attendants were free to 
strike after 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday, but three days of talks with 
federal mediators in Washington resulted in a settlement. A 
possible strike threatened to leave up to 100,000 passengers 
stranded this weekend.

20th day in their shiny red capsule hanging from a massive silver 
balloon, Brian Jones of Britain and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland 
faced the decision of crossing the finish line and touching down 
soon after, probably in Mali, or riding the jet stream hundreds of

showdown over the future of this rebellious province. Meanwhile in 
Washington, President Clinton warned that the collapse of peace 
talks in Paris had raised the stakes and ``if we and our allies 
don't have the will to act, there will be more massacres.'' NATO 
has threatened massive airstrikes against Serb-led Yugoslavia if 
President Slobodan Milosevic does not accept a peace plan providing 
for sweeping autonomy for Kosovo and NATO troops to police the 
accord.

their work at the site of a deadly Amtrak train-truck accident. 
Officials have released a list of the eleven people who were killed 
in Monday night's collision between a truck and the train. The 
question of when the truck driver entered the track crossing 
remains unanswered. National Transportation Safety Board 
investigator J.S. Dunn said ``a number of people'' claiming to have 
witnessed the crash that killed 11 had come forward and that their

their greatest admirers back in their ancestral home -- Elia Kazan 
gets a very different reception. The filmmaker son of 
Greek-American immigrants won't receive much applause when he 
receives a lifetime achievement Academy Award on Sunday -- his third 
Oscar. Kazan, 89, won Oscars for ``Gentleman's Agreement'' in 1947 
and ``On the Waterfront'' in 1954. But many Greek artists and 
others refuse to forgive Kazan's decision to identify Communist 
Party members in Hollywood during the ``blacklist'' hearings in

	KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. (AP) -- Two comebacks collided Friday, as  
Steffi Graf showed no mercy with a 6-0, 6-1 victory over Jennifer 
Capriati in the second round at the Lipton Championships. ``That's 
the best she's ever played against me,'' Capriati said. The 
29-year-old Graf, slowed by injuries for much of the past two 
years, is seeking her first tournament title since November. Based 
on Friday's performance, she's a threat to upstage such youngsters 
as Martina Hingis and the Williams sisters.

<HEADLINE> Bush's Speech Stock Now Worth $14M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former President George Bush made a smart move  
by accepting stock in a startup company instead of his usual 
speaking fee when he addressed an audience in Tokyo last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush agreed to take shares in Global Crossing Ltd. in lieu of an  
$80,000 fee for speaking to a group assembled by the 
telecommunications business, The Wall Street Journal reported 
Friday. The newspaper said the stock is now worth about $14.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush normally gets $100,000 for an overseas speech, the Journal  
said, but he gave a 20 percent discount to Global Crossing, whose 
co-chairman was an old friend, Lodwrick M. Cook, former chief 
executive of Atlantic Richfield Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said that the day after the speech, Bush expressed  
curiosity about the company over breakfast with Cook and Global 
Crossing's other co-chairman, Gary Winnick. 
</P>
<P>
	Winnick reportedly suggested that Bush take his fee in stock in  
their privately held firm instead of cash, and Bush agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing went public in August, and its stock price has  
jumped fivefold. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Bush, Michael Dannenhauer, confirmed Friday that  
the former president made the speech in February 1998 for Global 
Crossing but declined to say how he was paid. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper attributed its story to people close to the issue.  
The sources were not identified.

<HEADLINE> IOC Wants Info From Member </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch said today he is asking IOC member Phil Coles, the 
Australian's ex-wife and Greek Olympic officials for more 
information regarding expensive gifts the Coles were said to have 
received. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after the International Olympic Committee's executive  
board announced it was investigating the case, Samaranch said the 
committee was sending letters to Coles, his former wife Georgina 
Coles and the Greek Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The case of Mr. Coles is still open,'' Samaranch said at a  
news conference. ``We will take the final decision in a few days or 
weeks. We are sending more letters to ask for more information. 
With this information, the executive board of the IOC will take the 
final decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch was asked whether he felt any sympathy for Coles or  
believed the Australian has been the victim of a media ``witch 
hunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem of Mr. Coles is not about sympathy or not  
sympathy,'' he said. ``We have to act on the facts we get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgina Coles, who split with Coles in a bitter divorce almost  
six years ago, sent a fax to IOC officials Friday in which she said 
the couple received a gold-and-diamond necklace and cufflinks, 
which she turned into earrings, while visiting Athens, which made 
an unsuccessful Olympic bid in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The items have been appraised at $6,300 -- far beyond the IOC's  
$150 limit on gifts from bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Already slapped with a severe censure for accepting lavish  
travel in the Salt Lake City bid scandal, Coles could be expelled 
if the board finds he previously violated the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney Olympics chief Michael Knight has called on Coles to  
``stop the pain'' by quitting the board of SOCOG, the organizing 
committee for the 2000 Games. But Coles said Friday he would not 
resign from the SOCOG board or the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	In giving the matter to the executive board, the IOC abolished a  
five-member investigation panel that produced six expulsions, four 
resignations and 10 warnings in the IOC's worst scandal, the 
million-dollar vote-buying scheme of Salt Lake City's successful 
2002 bid. 
</P>
<P>
	That took the case out of the control of Dick Pound, an IOC vice  
president from Canada who headed the ad hoc panel and is a longtime 
friend of Coles. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles appeared before the executive board Friday and said he  
``appreciated the opportunity to explain the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would remain on leave from the board of the  
organizing committee for next year's Summer Games in Sydney, 
Australia, ``until the matter is resolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch confirmed today that South Korean executive board  
member Kim Un-yong, the highest-ranking official implicated in the 
Salt Lake case, still was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The case of Mr. Kim is still open,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Kim received the most severe degree of warning from the IOC  
inquiry panel and was told he would face expulsion if evidence 
emerged to prove he knew that Salt Lake bidders paid for his son's 
salary at a telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim and Pound are bitter rivals. By taking the case out of  
Pound's hands, Kim's chances of being expelled appear greatly 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	On another issue, Samaranch announced that U.S. Olympic  
Committee president Bill Hybl had accepted his offer to serve on a 
new reform panel -- IOC 2000 -- that will recommend structural 
changes to the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl has been lukewarm in his support for Samaranch and the IOC  
during the crisis. Asked whether there was a rift between the two 
organizations, Samaranch said: ``Not on our side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch defended his decision to head the IOC 2000 reform  
panel, stressing that half of the commission's members will come 
from outside the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``This group must be presided by the head of the IOC,'' he said.  
``This is a problem of the Olympic movement, the IOC, and it must 
be dealt with among us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he hopes to convene the first meeting of the  
reform group in early April or May. The panel will present a 
preliminary report to the IOC assembly in Seoul, South Korea, in 
June and submit final recommendations to a special IOC session at 
the end of 1990 or early 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch also said he had not been formally invited to attend  
the Senate hearings into the Olympic scandal scheduled for April 18 
in Washington. The hearings will be led by Sen. John McCain, 
R-Ariz, who has been a vocal critic of the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I receive an official invitation, I will think about it,''  
Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch also confirmed his view, published today in a Spanish  
newspaper, that he should have left the job seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the best time to withdraw was after the great success of  
the (1992) Barcelona Games,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Samaranch, who received a near unanimous vote of confidence  
from IOC members this week, said he is now determined to stay until 
the end of his mandate in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not thinking about retiring,'' he said. ``I am confident  
I have to remain in my position. I will lead the restructuring of 
the IOC.''

<HEADLINE>  Key Races at the Academy Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	How the key races shape up for Sunday's Academy Awards ceremony:  

</P>
<P>
                          	 *BEST PICTURE   	
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, the conventional wisdom in Hollywood was that this  
race was over: ``Saving Private Ryan'' had it. Then ``Shakespeare 
in Love'' charmed audiences in the fall, making this a two-picture 
race -- unless they cancel each other out. Then it could go to one 
of the long-shots: ``Elizabeth,'' ``Life Is Beautiful'' or ``The 
Thin Red Line.'' 

</P>
<P>
                           	 *DIRECTOR   	
</P>
<P>
	The favorite has to be Steven Spielberg for ``Saving Private  
Ryan.'' He was honored by his peers in the Directors Guild of 
America earlier this month. The other nominees are Roberto Benigni 
for ``Life Is Beautiful,'' John Madden for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' 
Terrence Malick for ``The Thin Red Line'' and Peter Weir for ``The 
Truman Show.'' With the best-picture race so close, this could be 
that rare year in which the winning director didn't direct the 
winning film. 

</P>
<P>
                             	 *ACTOR   	
</P>
<P>
	The early favorites were Tom Hanks as the squad leader in  
``Ryan'' and Ian McKellen as the aging homosexual director in 
``Gods and Monsters.'' Then the Screen Actors Guild honored Benigni 
for ``Life Is Beautiful,'' seemingly throwing the race wide open. 
Also with strong chances are Nick Nolte for ``Affliction'' and 
Edward Norton for ``American History X.'' 

</P>
<P>
                            	 *ACTRESS   	
</P>
<P>
	The clear favorite is Gwyneth Paltrow as Shakespeare's muse in  
``Shakespeare in Love'' to beat Cate Blanchett for ``Elizabeth,'' 
Fernanda Montenegro for ``Central Station,'' Meryl Streep for ``One 
True Thing'' and Emily Watson for ``Hilary and Jackie.'' 

</P>
<P>
                        	 *SUPPORTING ACTOR   	
</P>
<P>
	Impossible to call. The race is full of respected actors in  
strong performances, though Robert Duvall, the tough corporate 
lawyer in ``A Civil Action,'' gets a narrow edge by virtue of his 
SAG award. But the statue could easily go to James Coburn for 
``Affliction,'' Ed Harris for ``The Truman Show,'' Geoffrey Rush 
for ``Shakespeare in Love'' or Billy Bob Thornton for ``A Simple 
Plan.'' 

</P>
<P>
                       	 *SUPPORTING ACTRESS   	
</P>
<P>
	Another tossup. The lone American nominee, Kathy Bates of  
``Primary Colors,'' is another SAG winner, which helps. Judi Dench 
had perhaps the most memorable performance as Queen Elizabeth in 
``Shakespeare in Love,'' but she was only on the screen for a few 
minutes, which could hurt. The others have equal shots: Brenda 
Blethyn for ``Little Voice,'' Rachel Griffiths for ``Hilary and 
Jackie'' and Lynn Redgrave for ``Gods and Monsters.''

``Shakespeare in Love,'' but she was only on the screen for a few 
minutes, which could hurt. The others have equal shots: Brenda 
Blethyn for ``Little Voice,'' Rachel Griffiths for ``Hilary and 
Jackie'' and Lynn Redgrave for ``Gods and Monsters.''

<HEADLINE> Tyson Rumor Angers Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Marion County Prosecutor Scott Newman plans  
to contact Maryland correctional authorities Monday to discuss 
reports that heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson might be eligible for 
release from a Maryland jail as early as this Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 5, Tyson entered into an agreement with Newman and  
other Marion County authorities to serve an additional 60 days in 
Maryland for violating his parole in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect a 60-day jail sentence to be served following the  
Maryland sentence,'' Newman told the Indianapolis Star late Friday. 
Under ``good'' time provisions, if Tyson behaves in custody and 
accomplishes education and work credits, that time can be reduced 
to 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	If released Friday, Tyson would be placed on work release or  
home detention to serve out the remainder of his sentence, 
according to one of his attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	James Voyles of Indianapolis, an attorney for Tyson, said a  
Washington Post article about the possibility of Tyson's release as 
early as Friday is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	The story said Stephen P. Johnson, a judge in Montgomery County,  
Md., told Tyson's attorneys and the Maryland state's attorney 
during a private meeting this week that he will rule March 26 on a 
request to reduce Tyson's one-year Maryland assault sentence to 
eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	Voyles said that under Maryland law, that state's Department of  
Correction determines through a grid system how much actual jail 
time an inmate must serve under a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Maryland judge reduces the sentence to eight months,  
Voyles said, the jail time could be between three and 30 days.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter  
Chelsea's 12-day trip to North Africa got off to a rocky start 
Saturday, including an engine fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned departure from Andrews Air Force Base in suburban  
Maryland was delayed an hour because the Air Force Boeing 707 
jetliner carrying the president's wife and daughter, staff aides 
and journalists was found to be overweight with cargo and luggage. 
</P>
<P>
	Then as the plane raced down the runway for takeoff, flames shot  
out the rear of the outboard engine of the left wing. The jetliner 
skidded to a stop and taxied back to the terminal, where a dozen 
Air Force personnel scrambled to repair what a crew member 
described a minor engine compressor problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane took off about two hours after its originally

<HEADLINE> America West, Union Avoid Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- America West Airlines and its flight attendants  
have reached a new labor agreement, ending a fight that brought the 
nation's ninth-largest carrier to the brink of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative deal was struck after midnight EST Friday, when  
the 2,300 flight attendants were free to walk off the job. Both 
sides met with federal mediators in Washington over three days this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	America West Chairman William Franke said the contract  
``addresses the principal concerns of both parties.'' Union 
executive Bill McGlashen said the deals gives flight attendants 
``fair wages, a per diem and work rules that will improve our 
quality of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Details were not immediately disclosed. The deal is subject to  
approval by union members. 
</P>
<P>
	The Association of Flight Attendants had threatened a series of  
random worked stoppages, dubbed CHAOS, for ``Creating Havoc Around 
Our System.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A strike would have left up to 100,000 passengers stranded this  
weekend. America West, with hubs in Phoenix, Las Vegas and 
Columbus, Ohio, serves 53 domestic destinations and eight cities in 
Mexico and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants have been without a contract since they  
unionized in 1994 -- three years after America West filed for 
bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
	During the bankruptcy reorganization, flight attendants took a  
10 percent pay cut. They said it had not been restored though the 
company posted record profits in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants had demanded pay on par with the average  
of the top-10 carriers. About two-thirds of America West's flight 
attendants earn the top-scale salary of $23,800. Top-scale flight 
attendants at rival Southwest Airlines earn $41,200. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants also wanted the same daily expenses that  
pilots receive, $1.80 per hour away from their base city. 
Currently, America West flight attendants get no per-diem 
allowance. 
</P>
<P>
	There were cheers among flight attendants outside the suburban  
Tempe headquarters of the airline when word of the agreement was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled. We're happy. And we want America West to  
succeed,'' flight attendant Caroline Robertson said early today.

<HEADLINE> Accused Man Sues Prosecutors, Cops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- Through 14 years, seven veteran cops and  
prosecutors doggedly pursued Rolando Cruz for the killing of a 
little girl. They testified against him, argued his guilt, helped 
send him to death row twice. 
</P>
<P>
	They pressed on despite evidence that another man may have been  
the killer, despite repeated losses in appeals courts, despite a 
campaign by religious leaders, law school deans and journalists who 
were convinced Cruz was innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the four DuPage County sheriff's deputies and three former  
county prosecutors are about to face Cruz in court again -- this 
time, as defendants. And he is a witness against them. 
</P>
<P>
	In a trial expected to begin this week, the seven men sworn to  
uphold justice are charged with doing the opposite: lying, creating 
evidence and conspiring to railroad Cruz for the 1983 rape and 
bludgeoning death of 10-year-old Jeanine Nicarico. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fairly apparent that what's operating here is a very  
high-pressure case with very high stakes, and a tragically mistaken 
belief that they had the right guy. And a willingness to go beyond 
the line to secure a conviction because of that belief,'' special 
prosecutor William Kunkle said before a judge imposed a gag order. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrongful conviction cases are not rare; neither are public  
corruption indictments. But legal experts say they cannot recall 
anything like the DuPage case, in which law officers are charged 
with crimes for ostensibly carrying out their official duties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically these guys are accused of cooking a case. It's a  
breathtaking allegation,'' said Tim O'Neill, a professor at John 
Marshall Law School in Chicago and former public defender. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in 1985, juries twice found Cruz and fellow defendant  
Alejandro Hernandez guilty of murder. Every decision was overturned 
on appeal. Then, during Cruz's third trial in 1995, came a stunning 
turnabout. 
</P>
<P>
	A supervisor in the sheriff's department reversed his previous  
testimony, casting doubt on a cornerstone of the prosecution -- that 
Cruz revealed incriminating details to detectives in a 1983 
statement describing a ``vision'' or ``dream'' about the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Ronald Mehling didn't even need to hear the  
defense. He found Cruz innocent in a scathing decision that added 
judicial force to years of criticism of authorities' handling of 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody is not telling the truth,'' he told a packed  
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Cruz was freed and before charges against  
Hernandez were dismissed, Kunkle -- best known for prosecuting mass 
murderer John Wayne Gacy -- was appointed to investigate the 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1996, a grand jury indicted three former DuPage  
County assistant state's attorneys: Thomas Knight, now in private 
practice; Patrick King, now an assistant U.S. attorney; and Robert 
Kilander, now a DuPage County judge. Also indicted were detectives 
Thomas Vosburgh and Dennis Kurzawa and lieutenants James Montesano 
and Robert Winkler of the county sheriff's department. 
</P>
<P>
	All are charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice and  
conspiracy to commit official misconduct. The police face 
additional charges, including perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys contend it's unbelievable that seven men, some  
of whom did not know each other well or like each other much, would 
engineer a decade-plus conspiracy through three separate 
administrations in the state's attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not the best-run investigation in the world. There  
were mistakes made,'' said Terry Ekl, Knight's attorney. ``Kunkle 
put this investigation under a microscope and he has found nothing 
to justify this indictment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Kunkle's case relies on past trial testimony and court  
statements from the defendants. He has no recordings or witnesses 
to outline how the alleged conspiracy developed. Instead, he cites 
actions that he contends must have been done in concert. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution's star witness is expected to be Cruz, whom  
Kunkle admits was a ``world-class liar'' in 1983. At the time, Cruz 
filled cops' ears with tidbits -- true and false -- about Jeanine's 
death. He later claimed he was trying to win reward money. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way you can right this wrong,'' Cruz said earlier  
this year. ``But you can punish them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors' version of the crime evolved to include another  
man, Brian Dugan, who had pleaded guilty to raping and killing a 
woman and a 7-year-old girl. Dugan claimed he alone killed Jeanine, 
and DNA tests ultimately pointed at him. But he refused to make a 
formal confession because prosecutors refused to agree they 
wouldn't seek the death penalty. Prosecutors argued Cruz also was 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys have attacked Cruz as if he were on trial  
again. But they are concerned about a recent flurry of media 
coverage of innocent defendants convicted of murder in Illinois. 
The developments have invigorated death penalty opponents, who see 
Cruz as a symbol of their cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, a judge overturned the murder convictions of  
a man who came within two days of execution. A week earlier, Cook 
County officials agreed to a $36 million settlement with four men 
who were freed after spending 18 years in prison for a double 
murder they didn't commit.

<HEADLINE> New Team Headed to Final Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Somebody new is going to the Final Four. It  
figured to be Connecticut, although Gonzaga sure has a way of 
spoiling things for the bigtime programs. 
</P>
<P>
	UConn, the top seed in the NCAA West Regional, faced No. 10  
Gonzaga today for a trip to St. Petersburg, Fla., next weekend. The 
Huskies have been close all too often under coach Jim Calhoun, 
while the Bulldogs could only dream of the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason to stop when we're 40 minutes away,'' said  
Gonzaga's Casey Calvary, whose tip-in with 4.4 seconds left 
eliminated Florida in the regional semifinals. ``We didn't come in 
thinking we're here in the NCAA and we're a small school and now 
it's time for us to get stomped by somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, if anybody is capable of stomping an opponent, even one  
on as magical a ride as Gonzaga, it would be the Huskies. 
Connecticut is quick, strong, agile, deep and tournament-tested. 
This is Connecticut's fourth journey this far under Calhoun. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't feel that is a burden at all. We have no control over  
the past Connecticut teams that got here and not to the Final 
Four,'' Huskies point guard and leader Khalid El-Amin said Friday. 
``We definitely have a good shot of making it. They are going to 
see a feisty bunch ready to take care of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, everyone would see what the Huskies have been  
all along. And what the Bulldogs have been, too. 
</P>
<P>
	While UConn brought a 31-2 mark into today's game and was ranked  
first or second for most of the season, Gonzaga was 28-6. The 
Bulldogs, who would be the first No. 10 seed to get to the Final 
Four, weren't lacking for any faith heading into the biggest game 
in the school's history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no time to question our confidence now,'' Matt Santangelo  
said. ``If we allow questions about it, we have no chance against a 
team like Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	`We have nothing to lose and we'll come out and play hard for 40  
minutes and give it our best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their best has been enough to upend Minnesota (of the Big Ten),  
Stanford (Pac-10) and Florida (Southeastern Conference). That 
brought the Bulldogs into the matchup with the beast of the Big 
East, UConn. 
</P>
<P>
	To win it, Gonzaga needed to maintain its scrappy identity, hit  
loads of 3-pointers, stay out of foul trouble, get its inside 
players more involved and ... 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to have a cut-loose attitude when it's you against  
everybody,'' sharpshooter Richie Frahm said. ``It doesn't bother us 
that the media and the nation is viewing us as a Cinderella team. 
We don't have that attitude. We feel we can play with anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UConn isn't anybody.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have a group of guys who love to play on the road,'' said  
Richard Hamilton, an All-America forward and two-time Big East 
player of the year. ``We love to have our backs to the wall and 
everyone cheering for the opposing team. We let the scoreboard do 
the talking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scoreboard has said some very nice things this season -- for  
UConn and for Gonzaga.

<HEADLINE> Exxon Battling To Return Tanker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) -- When the Exxon Valdez first sailed into  
Valdez in December 1986, the little town threw a party. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were quite proud of having that tanker named after the city  
of Valdez,'' recalls former mayor John Devens. 
</P>
<P>
	The 800-mile trans-Alaska oil pipeline ends here, and the town's  
fortunes are wedded to oil. 
</P>
<P>
	But pride turned to horror three years later when the Exxon  
Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef, spilling 11 million gallons of 
crude oil into Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the infamous tanker is barred by federal law from  
returning to Alaska. Sailing under a new name, SeaRiver 
Mediterranean, it carries crude from the Middle East to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The restriction, included in the federal Oil Pollution Act of  
1990, closes the sound to any vessel that spilled more than one 
million gallons of oil into the marine environment after March 22, 
1989. It was tailor-made for the Exxon Valdez, which spilled its 
oil on March 24, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon agreed to the unusual restriction to settle spill-related  
lawsuits. But for four years, it has been in federal court fighting 
to bring the ship back. 
</P>
<P>
	It strikes a nerve with some Alaskans.  
</P>
<P>
	``That would be like letting them get away with the whole thing.  
It's no fun having somebody thumb their nose at you,'' said Jack 
Hopkins, a fisherman in the Prince William Sound town of Cordova. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon says the restriction is costly because the ship was  
purpose-built for the more profitable Alaska trade. Its identical 
sister ship, the SeaRiver Long Beach, still carries crude from 
Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
	Art Stephan, spokesman for Exxon's shipping arm, SeaRiver  
Maritime, said the hostility is understandable -- up to a point. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is only a vessel, an inanimate object,'' he said. ``Until  
you put people on board, the vessel itself can't be guilty of 
something.''

<HEADLINE> Coyotes Send Isbister to Islanders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Phoenix Coyotes, hoping to beef up  
their scoring for the playoffs, acquired center Robert Reichel from 
the New York Islanders on Saturday for left wing Brad Isbister. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal also involved the swap of draft choices. The Coyotes  
received a third- and a fourth-round draft choice from the 
Islanders this year, and sent the Islanders their third-round pick. 
The fourth-round pick going to the Coyotes was acquired by the 
Islanders in a trade earlier in the day with the Ottawa Senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix has been looking for a solid second-line center to  
bolster its offense since the all-star break. Reichel leads the 
Islanders in scoring with 19 goals, 37 assists and 56 points in 70 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Reichel, 27, has twice recorded 40 goals in a season and has  
scored at least 20 goals five times in his career. The eight-year 
veteran has played in 168 consecutive games dating to March 9, 
1996, when he was with Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
	Isbister, 21, has missed 29 games due to injury this season. He  
had four goals, four assists and eight points in 32 games with the 
Coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
	Isbister made his NHL debut last season, appearing in 66 games  
with nine goals and eight assists.

<P>
	HOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) -- The CART FedEx Championship Series will  
have a pit stop contest this season, beginning with Sunday's 
Marlboro Grand Prix of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The Craftsman Pit Crew Challenge will use CART's Omega Timing &AMP;  
Scoring to compile cumulative time on pit stops, from each car's 
entry onto pit road until its exit. Scoring will be identical to 
the point system used to determine the PPG Cup champion, with the 
top 12 finishers in each race earning points. 
</P>
<P>
	The point totals will accumulate for the first 19 races, with  
the top four teams then competing in a head-to-head series during 
the weekend of the season-finale at Fontana, Calif., for a $50,000 
first prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good pit stops have become more and more crucial,'' team owner  
and former driver Bobby Rahal said. ``A season-long competition 
like this recognizes the value of our crews and the work they do. 
This gives them even more incentive to save that fraction of a 
second that can be the difference between winning and losing.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TV TIME:* A commercial that never will be shown on American  
television was the hit of the weekend in the PacWest team compound. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-minute ad for Hollywood cigarettes, made for Brazilian TV,  
features a PacWest Reynard being air-dropped from a cargo plane, 
then driving relentlessly across the Mojave Desert and an Alaskan 
glacier before finally landing on an American aircraft carrier at 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The car was driven by former Champ Car driver Dominick Dobson,  
who still works with the team in an advisory capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	It took 32 days to make the commercial, which was filmed on  
location. The carrier was leased from the government and that part 
of the video was shot in the Gulf of Mexico near Corpus Christi, 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WORKPLACE LUXURY:* PacWest, the team owned by wealthy Seattle  
businessman Bruce McCaw, has a new home away from home for the 
racetracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Featherlite has produced the largest unit in its history for the  
CART team. It's a 53-foot trailer that has 960 square feet inside. 
At the track, three tents, made in England, are used to create 
4,000 square feet of hospitality space surrounding the trailer. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside are two luxurious meeting rooms and two work rooms  
complete with printers, copiers and fax machines. The unit comes 
with four satellite receivers and eight 20-inch televisions with 
built-in VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SPECIAL GUEST:* Tony George, president of the Indianapolis  
Motor Speedway and founder of the rival Indy Racing League, showed 
up Saturday as a guest of NASCAR president Bill France Jr., whose 
International Speedway Corp. is part owner of Miami-Homestead 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying this year to go to some of the racetracks where  
I've never been,'' George said. ``I'm here today, and tomorrow I'll 
be at Darlington (for a Winston Cup race).'' 
</P>
<P>
	George walked the pits during CART's qualifying, chatting  
amiably with several people, and stuck around to watch the NASCAR 
sanctioned truck race on the 1 1/2-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FATHER FIGURE:* Cristiano da Matta, last year's Indy Lights  
champion, will make his CART debut Sunday, starting fifth in the 
27-car field. 
</P>
<P>
	If Da Matta, a 25-year-old Brazilian, winds up a star in the  
Champ Car series, his father can take a lot of credit for good 
blood lines and for being an excellent role model. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony da Matta is a 15-time Brazilian Touring Car champion.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny,'' his son said. ``Everybody in my country knows my

<P>
	``But there was an important stage to go through, the IOC  
centenary, and that took another four years. Then in 1997, I was 
convinced that I should continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch's comments come after he received a vote of confidence  
from IOC members to continue his mandate as president until 2001, 
and after the unprecedented expulsion this week of six members in 
the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always say that it is very difficult to reach a position of  
such responsibility as I now have,'' said the 70-year-old 
Samaranch, who has led the IOC since 1980. ``But the most difficult 
thing is to leave at the right time. I didn't do it and that was a 
mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Salt Lake City corruption scandal has meant the  
worst moment of his Olympic career. 
</P>
<P>
	But Samaranch, who inherited an organization facing bankruptcy  
and turned the Olympics into a multibillion-dollar industry, 
defended his record and assured that he would see better days for 
the IOC after gaining his members' confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel stronger than some months ago, but my mandate has  
always been very calm,'' he said. ``This crisis has opened our 
eyes. We have seen that the existing structure which has 105 years, 
must be changed.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Scandal Lampooned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans in clown suits bungle verdicts. Al  
Gore, desperate for popularity, begs to be impeached. Bill Clinton 
is safely ``com-part-ment-a-lized.'' And the chief justice wears so 
many gold stripes he can hardly be seen for the gleam. 
</P>
<P>
	Like cherry blossoms with blight, Saturday night's annual  
ruining of journalism's white-tie Gridiron dinner had so much 
material to work with from the headlines of the year that even some 
of the introductions had sharp elbows. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in the audience, said syndicated columnist Mark Shields,  
are from the old school: ``They long for the days when the Oval 
Office was used to raise money and the Lincoln Bedroom was used for 
sex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Elizabeth Dole and the endorsement of Viagra by her husband,  
Bob: ``With her husband wolfing down those little blue pills, the 
question is, `Is Mrs. Dole running for the White House or away from 
Bob?''' 
</P>
<P>
	A squad of Monica Lewinskys, each with an angled beret and a  
soiled blue dress, paraded on stage. And columnist Carl Rowan, who 
is black, dragged out a portrayal of Linda Tripp, who is not. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trial of the century,'' screamed the ``Monica-ettes.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Who dreamed that it would star reams of naughty prose, a  
girl's DIR-ty clothes, and Gekas, McCollum and Barr,'' three of the 
13 House impeachment managers. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton got his own chance for a few shots at the end,  
but rounded out the evening by saying ``I had a wonderful time 
tonight -- you did singe but you did not burn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting on the warm reception that greeted previous  
performers and speakers, Clinton he was reminded of an old country 
song, ``I Don't Know Whether to Kill Myself or Go Bowling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He allowed that 1998 ``was an awful year. It was a year I  
wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after a pause: ``I take that back.''  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he is about ready to come out with his memoirs and  
added that he is ``doing it for the money.'' He added that some of 
the titles he though about included ``Beyond Hope'' and ``I'm OK, 
You're OK, They're Out to Get me.'' But said he settled on ``My 
Story and I'm Sticking to It.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One big hit was former astronaut and Sen. John Glenn, outfitted  
in full NASA regalia and singing in a fine baritone to senators who 
wished they, too, could have been shot into space. ``This may sound 
a little trite,'' he sang, ``you don't have the stuff that's 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gridiron Club has been roasting presidents in mostly  
lighthearted lampoonery for 114 years. With the exception of Grover 
Cleveland -- who stiffed the club through two disconnected terms -- 
every president since Benjamin Harrison has put up with it. 
</P>
<P>
	This year the club's 60 members, and the professional singers  
and musicians who help out, found Chief Justice Rehnquist and his 
gold stripes irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
	The stripes were an inspiration that dawned on Rehnquist while  
attending a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta shortly before he 
presided over the president's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gridiron twisted the Gilbert and Sullivan portrayal of ``the  
modern major General'' to suit the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	As in:  
</P>
<P>
	``I am the very model of a Justice quite superior, a graduate of  
Stanford to which Harvard is inferior. 
</P>
<P>
	``A man of rare sartorial flair as seen by my exterior, A robe  
bereft of golden heft would certainly be drearier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``... I sat through endless quorum calls without a sign of  
calluses, I'm properly conservative but not the least political. 
</P>
<P>
	``... To say that I was less than wise is left-wing  
reprehensible. To keep this country moving right, I'm damn near 
indispensable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the griddle:  
</P>
<P>
	--Hillary Rodham Clinton, dressed as the Statue of Liberty: ``My  
Whitewater blues, are washing away ... I'll show those right-wing 
nuts, this broad's got more than guts. Come on. Come through. New 
York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Independent Counsel Ken Starr: ``We did our duty, we squeezed  
Clinton's cutie. ... I've put my ethics on call-waiting, while 
Linda's on the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The press: ``There's a new journalism that's ragin'. Scandal  
sells. So does sex! Get on line! Let 'er rip!''

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Rising in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- When economic restructuring got family members  
laid off, the troops of the People's Armed Police in the rust-belt 
Chinese city of Anshan began to fret about the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with a plunge in morale, commanders had the troops see for  
themselves. Soldiers and officers were given tours of Anshan's 
struggling steelworks and lectured that layoffs were key to the 
huge plant's survival. 
</P>
<P>
	The miseries of mounting unemployment are starting to spread  
from China's work force to the ``Great Wall of Iron and Steel'' -- 
the army and paramilitary units that guard the ruling Communist 
Party against festering social unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The tough job market also is snarling efforts to trim the  
People's Liberation Army, the world's largest, into a leaner, 
modernized fighting force. Partly because it is hard to find 
demobilized soldiers other jobs, the army only reached two-thirds 
of its target to shed 150,000 to 200,000 men in 1998, the first 
year of a three-year program to cut 500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Disgruntlement in pockets of the army and paramilitary police  
raises questions about whether troops whose loved ones are out of 
work can be relied on to quell frequent protests by jobless workers 
and overtaxed farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Communist leaders need only look to the 1989 Tiananmen Square  
democracy protests to see the danger. A small minority of soldiers 
and officers, reportedly including the commander of China's 38th 
Army -- whose daughter was involved in the protests -- balked or 
questioned orders to crush the demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
	That the army followed the orders, despite many officers'  
misgivings, was testimony both to its discipline and its 
commanders' loyalty to then-paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. But 
Deng's successor, President Jiang Zemin, lacks the late leader's 
clout. 
</P>
<P>
	The army's backing ``is now conditional,'' Ellis Joffe, an  
expert on the Chinese military, wrote recently in Hong Kong's South 
China Morning Post newspaper. ``If things go well, it will be 
forthcoming. If there is a serious downturn, it will not be 
guaranteed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While China's economy is still growing, unemployment is rising.  
State factories have shed millions of workers who once were 
promised jobs for life. Almost 16 million urban residents -- 11 
percent of the urban work force -- will be jobless this year, state 
news media have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite efforts to avoid it, some relatives -- generally wives --  
of low-paid soldiers have been among those to lose their jobs. 
Reports in China's tightly controlled state and military media 
indicate that morale, particularly in hard-hit areas, is suffering 
as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, even loyal Communist Party officials are  
expressing doubts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I earn the only wage and look after three people, as well our  
parents on both sides, two of whom are sick. I've got quite into 
debt because of this,'' said Fu Jiayong, an army political 
instructor whose wife was fired from an ailing factory in the 
depressed northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Fu, speaking on a TV program about unemployed army wives, said  
that as a party member he backed government policies that are 
forcing state factories to become more efficient, according to a 
transcript of the program published in the military-run Liberation 
Army Daily. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I also am puzzled,'' Fu added. ``As reforms deepen, the  
benefits for the people should get greater. Why must there be 
layoffs and staff reductions?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Anshan, 310 miles northeast of Beijing, the steelworks fired  
half its 400,000 workers. Some 126 relatives of troops in a local 
People's Armed Police unit lost their jobs, which ``a few officers 
and soldiers found hard to understand,'' the Liberation Army Daily 
said in another report. ``They were all talking about it for a 
while. Some became quite low-spirited and worried about the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of 1998, 78 percent of family members who followed  
soldiers to their postings had jobs, a figure that rose to 82 
percent by the beginning of this year after concerted government 
and army efforts to find them jobs, the Liberation Army Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	But employment is patchy. In northern Hebei province, 31 percent  
of 1,500 army wives polled in an internal survey were unemployed. 
In the depressed northeast and border areas, the figure is 
estimated as high as 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That means many families must rely on army wages that, despite a  
20 percent raise at the start of the year, are not generous. 
Captains, for instance, get about 800 yuan ($96) a month, with free 
housing and medical care and small subsidies for food. Managers in 
the business sector earn several times that and also get benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Western experts say morale problems are not spread evenly across  
the whole military. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sure that those people who are being groomed for possible  
services in the Spratlys or against Taiwan get better treatment,'' 
said Dr. June Teufel Dreyer, an expert on the Chinese military at 
the University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	To help soldiers' relatives find work, the army has given  
thousands of them classes on computer use, tailoring, hairdressing, 
animal husbandry and other skills. They also have been allowed to 
open laundries, canteens, reading rooms and telephone-calling 
centers for troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulations introduced in some cities forbid companies from  
firing the wives of soldiers or threaten punishment for bosses who 
refuse to employ them. In Fushun city in the depressed northeast, 
special privilege cards entitle army wives to tax breaks and 
priority in jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, small factories where soldiers' relatives make  
things like shoe polish and rations appear to have been exempted 
from a decree last year requiring the military to withdraw from 
business and hand over its thousands of factories and other 
enterprises to civilian control. 
</P>
<P>
	While highlighting efforts to find them work, state media also  
are stressing that times are tough for everyone and there are 
limits to how much officials can do. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some places where civil servants haven't been paid  
for months. Some factories have totally shut down, with no workers 
getting wages. Is it possible to only give wages to servicemen's 
wives?'' Yan Jianren, an army official, said on a TV program.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Get Two Wings in Tampa Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers acquired left wing  
Mikael Andersson and right wing Sandy McCarthy from the Tampa Bay 
Lightning today in a trade for left wing Colin Forbes and a 
conditional draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Flyers general manager Bob Clarke said today that Andersson  
``will be as good or better penalty killer than what Forbes has 
been for us.'' Andersson has been out for the last 18 games due to 
a sprained knee and will not be ready to play for at least another 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Andersson, 32, had two goals and three assists in 40 games for  
Tampa Bay this season. He has scored 93 goals in 699 career games. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke said McCarthy, at 6-foot-3, 225 pounds, would give the  
Flyers ``some team toughness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy, 26, had 12 points and 138 penalty minutes in 67 games  
for the Lightning this season. He has racked up 35 goals and 37 
assists for 72 points and 939 penalty minutes in 357 NHL career 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, 23, had nine goals and 16 points in 66 games for the  
Flyers this season.

<HEADLINE> Woman Admits Embezzling Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The controller of a computer consultant  
firm has acknowledged she is guilty of stealing between $8 million 
and $12 million from her employer, her lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors allege that Mary Adams Collins, 31, stole the money  
to purchase real estate, jewelry and automobiles. She was charged 
Thursday with federal bank fraud and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Collins has signed a plea agreement saying she is guilty of  
the two charges and will make full restitution, said her attorney, 
Thomas Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney James B. Comey said no court date had  
been set for Ms. Collins' plea and it is not known how much money 
will be recovered. She was not placed under arrest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Collins repeatedly embezzled from Halifax Technology  
Services Inc. in her position as the company's controller, 
according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court. 
From April 1, 1996, to March 8, 1999, she allegedly wrote corporate 
checks to herself and others and used the stolen funds herself, the 
complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the property, jewelry and autombiles, Ms. Collins and  
her husband, Shawn, 44, owned diverse enterprises, including an 
ostrich farm. In 1998, they bought a race-car team and began 
competing on the National Hot Rod Association stock car circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Collins told the Richmond Times-Dispatch in an interview  
last year that he had sunk at least $1 million into the racing 
team, which had three cars and five full-time crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Collins was not charged. He sold the team this month.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials of Halifax Technology reported the embezzlement to  
Henrico County police and the FBI about a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Stock Exchange halted trading on the firm's parent  
company, Alexandria-based Halifax Corp., on Wednesday after the 
fraud was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation is obviously a distraction,'' said Frank  
Ostronic, Halifax Corp.'s vice president of corporate business 
development.

<HEADLINE> GOP Trumpets Budget Plan on Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As budget season opens in the capital,  
Republican Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida said today his party 
will work to bring Washington's priorities in line with those of 
the American people. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP budget gives precedence to such concerns as improving  
public schools and maintaining a strong national defense, 
Diaz-Balart said in the weekly Republican radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	Topping the list is a commitment to shore up Social Security and  
make sure that money set aside for the program is not diverted for 
other federal spending, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time ever, Washington will no longer raid Social  
Security to pay for other government programs,'' Diaz-Balart said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the GOP plan also guarantees more resources for  
Social Security than President Clinton does in the administration's 
budget proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also want to return money to taxpayers through such  
means as eliminating the ``marriage penalty'' tax, cutting federal 
estate taxes and reducing taxes on retirement savings, Diaz-Balart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's your money,'' he said. ``You ought to keep more of it.''  
</P>
<P>
	He promised to get more federal dollars to the schools to spend  
on teachers and books. 
</P>
<P>
	On national security, Diaz-Balart said the nation has a ``moral  
obligation'' to ensure that men and women in uniform are equipped 
properly and have the necessary training.

<HEADLINE> Surprise Teams Meet in South Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Ohio State Buckeyes didn't forget  
their forgettable season. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of dismissing their 8-22 record and last-place finish in  
the Big Ten last season, the Buckeyes let the embarrassment smolder 
for a year, let the humiliation burn until it generated enough 
steam to carry them within a game of the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the season started, it crossed my mind I could go  
through Ohio State without even having a winning season,'' senior 
forward Jason Singleton said. ``I never expected us to be in the 
Elite Eight or even the Sweet 16. I never imagined it. I was just 
hoping to make the tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such modest goals notwithstanding, all that stands between the  
Buckeyes and the Final Four is the St. John's Red Storm. The teams 
meet in the South Regional final Saturday at 6 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're actually here?'' Buckeyes senior center Ken Johnson  
said. ``I'm still in shock to even be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The player given the most credit for Ohio State's remarkable  
turnaround is point guard Scoonie Penn, who transferred from Boston 
College to follow coach Jim O'Brien. He sat out last year under 
transfer rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest part was watching the guys go through an 8-22  
season and knowing there was nothing I could do to help them out,'' 
Penn said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Buckeyes (26-8) added more than Penn. They added the  
knowledge that 8-22 stunk, and they didn't want to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as last season ended, we went to work every single  
day,'' Johnson said. ``It's a personal thing in each one of us. 
That season definitely helped us. We know what it's like to be on 
the bottom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's wasn't on the bottom last year, when the Red Storm  
finished 22-10. They lost in the first round of the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Storm (28-8) have a balanced, patient attack under  
first-year coach Mike Jarvis. They've bucked the tournament trend 
by shooting well through three games (49 percent), and like most 
teams left at this time of the year, they have good guards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither team would be here without their guards,'' said  
Jarvis, trying to guide the Red Storm into the Final Four for the 
first time since 1985 in his first year since moving to New York 
from George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whichever team advances to the Final Four will represent their  
school well because of them. You cannot get to this point without 
them. It especially comes to light in the tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's starts Erick Barkley at the point. The 6-foot-1  
freshman is tied with backcourt mate Bootsy Thornton as the 
Johnnies' leading scorer in three NCAA tournament games at 15.7 
points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State relies more heavily on its backcourt for points.  
Shooting guard Michael Redd leads the way at 21.3 points in the 
tournament. Penn is averaging 16 points in the tournament and 
scored 13 of the Buckeyes' final 26 points in the 72-64 win over 
Auburn on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had my druthers, I'd prefer to have four double-figure  
scorers instead of two around 20 like we do,'' O'Brien said. 
``We've been concerned about that all year. Teams often try to take 
Scoonie and Michael out. We've been fortunate. We always seem to 
find someone to take up the slack, and that changes from game to 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's offense defines ``balanced.'' Barkley, Thornton, Ron  
Artest and Lavor Postell are all averaging in double figures in the 
tournament, and the fifth starter, Tyrone Grant, averages nine 
points. All five averaged in double figures during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The versatile Artest, in fact, pulls a lot of backcourt duty at  
6-7. He was the trigger man in St. John's successful approach to 
Maryland's full-court pressure in the Red Storm's 76-62 semifinal 
victory Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Kazan Rap Recalls Oscar Controversies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- This year's tempest over the honorary Oscar  
for director Elia Kazan, who named names of colleagues during the 
red scare 50 years ago, adds another chapter to the colorful 
tradition of Academy Award brouhahas: 
</P>
<P>
	It took only a year after the Oscars were first handed out for  
the fireworks to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Pickford won as best actress for the 1929 film  
``Coquette.'' But it was a much disliked movie, and one columnist 
accused the academy of ``handing out its cups on a political or 
social basis.'' (Miss Pickford had been one of the academy's 
founders.) 
</P>
<P>
	The awards had been chosen by a blue-ribbon committee. In  
response to the protests, the Academy changed the system so all 
members-- then almost 300-- could vote. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	When a furor arose in 1934 over the academy's failure to

	Some say it lasted 45 minutes, but in later life she claimed

appeared onstage to sing ``There's No Business Like Show

and clowned while the bewildered stars tried dancing, some

in ``Julia'' created a furor, since she had been sharply critical 
of Israel. Pickets appeared outside the Music Center with signs 
``Vanessa is a murderer.''

<P>
	When John Travolta presented the award to Miss Redgrave, she was  
greeted with restrained applause. But when she remarked that the

<HEADLINE> Tax Hike May Pay for Killer Appeals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAMBERT, Miss. (AP) -- Dean Parker shoved his hands into his  
jeans pockets and stared downward. Four identical brown-granite 
stones, each with an oval portrait, each with the same date carved 
on it: Feb. 2, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``Died on my birthday, buried on my wife's birthday,'' he said  
in a trembling voice, a scowl warping his face. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneath the stones lie his father, Carl ``Bubba'' Parker; his  
stepmother, Bobbie Jo; his 12-year-old half-brother, Gregory; and 
his 9-year-old half-sister, Charlotte Jo. After surprising two 
burglars ransacking their home, all four were shot, and their house 
was burned down on top of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker, 37, said his family spent $23,000 on the burials and  
stones. If a friend hadn't given them an extra plot, they wouldn't 
have been able to bury his parents side by side. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine years later, the two men convicted of the murders, Robert  
Simon Jr. and Anthony Carr, have yet to pay the price set by 
justice: execution. But the Parkers and other residents of one of 
the nation's poorest counties just keep paying and paying. 
</P>
<P>
	Quitman County had to raise taxes and take out a loan to cover  
the nearly $250,000 cost of their trials and automatic appeals 
granted all death row inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the county must hike taxes again or cut services in order to  
afford to hire lawyers for their second round of appeals, following 
a decision last month by the Mississippi Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost, estimated at up to $30,000 a year for each case, may  
seem small, but every public dollar counts in this Mississippi 
Delta county, where unemployment is around 14 percent and 91 
percent of the school children get free lunches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how the law goes,'' said Scott Parker, Dean's  
34-year-old brother. ``But now I know that I work 60 hours a week, 
and they take money out for my taxes. Part of that money is going 
to the guys who killed my daddy. That's not right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If raising taxes would speed the killers' execution, he said  
he'd favor it. But he doubts it will do more than cost folks money 
they don't have. ``You can drive all over Quitman County and see 
how broke we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Marks, the county seat split down the middle by railroad  
tracks, the inscription on the domed courthouse reads: ``OBEDIENCE 
TO THE LAW IS LIBERTY.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quitman, a county of about 10,500 residents an hour south of  
Memphis, Tenn., is a patchwork quilt of cotton and soybean farms, 
many still referred to as plantations. There is little industry, 
aside from a pool cue factory and specialty necktie plant. Many 
people ride shuttles to work at the casinos of nearby Tunica. 
</P>
<P>
	In this out-of-the-way setting, two outsiders committed a crime  
that one prosecutor said ``read like the script of a horror 
movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was pouring rain that Friday when Bubba Parker and his family  
returned home from Bible study. Prosecutors said Simon and Carr 
were there loading a pickup truck with everything they could steal, 
even the nuts and screws from a ceiling fan. 
</P>
<P>
	The killers tied Greg's hands behind him and shot him in the  
back. His mother was shot in the chest on a bed. Charlotte Jo was 
sodomized and raped. Dean Parker believes his father was forced to 
watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had just about tore his wrists in two with the extension  
cord trying to get loose,'' he said as he stood on the pile of 
smashed brick and scorched wood -- all that remains of the home. 
Someone cut off Carl Parker's finger to get his wedding band. 
</P>
<P>
	The county paid for three trials. (Simon was reindicted and  
tried twice). Taxes were raised for three years, and it took the 
county more than five years to retire the loan used to cover 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	People here thought they were through paying until the Supreme  
Court ruled in an unrelated case that indigent death row inmates 
had a right to counsel in a second round of appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Folks wouldn't object, said Bessie Sbravati, slicing bologna at  
the S+W Grocery and Fish Market, if the expense were for 
``something that's important to the county ... where everybody 
benefits from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone does benefit from the law's protection against being  
improperly convicted and unjustly punished, said C. Jackson 
Williams, the Oxford attorney who argued the case before the 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had hoped the state would be held responsible for the  
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly have no desire to see poor counties burdened by  
the administration of justice,'' Williams said. ``But the truth of 
the matter is, if a prosecutor's going to make the determination 
that the death penalty is in order, then one thing he needs to take 
into consideration is that there is a real price attached to that 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People at Welch's Restaurant in Lambert, where the sign promises  
``country cookin' makes you good-lookin','' have a hard time 
swallowing that argument after what was done to their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when this kind of stuff would have been dealt with  
in short order,'' antiques dealer Glenn Lamar said over a plate of 
beans, corn and ``noodle surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To further complicate things, the Parkers were white and their  
killers black. 
</P>
<P>
	In the circuit clerk's record room, one can still see red  
leather-bound volumes of ``white'' marriage records. Still, most in 
town insist race plays no role in this case. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to do what they need to do to those people,''  
Cleotha Saddler, a black first-grade teacher, said at The Dining 
Room, restaurant on Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in Marks. ``... 
Black or white or whatever. A crime is a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the restaurant's owner, Valmadge Towner, who is also black,  
said race plays a role too often in arrests and convictions to deny 
anyone a proper appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of times we have a tendency to convict rather  
quickly,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two bills pending before the Legislature would fund a statewide  
team of public defenders just to handle death row appeals. Attorney 
General Mike Moore's office supports the idea, hoping it will speed 
the process. There are 63 people on Mississippi's death row, but 
there hasn't been an execution since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the bills pass, they are not expected to apply  
retroactively to the Parker case. 
</P>
<P>
	So, as folks grumble about the price of justice, they also find  
ironic humor. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Lambert Cemetery, Dean Parker noticed the American flag  
at the gate: faded, tattered and in need of a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey,'' he said with a grin. ``They're going to have to raise  
taxes.''

<HEADLINE> Some Expected NTSB Criticisms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	While the National Transportation Safety Board will not decide  
until this week whether to recommend that the Federal Aviation 
Administration order more changes to the rudder system of the 
Boeing 737, high-level sources at the board say the members are 
expected to chastise the FAA on other points: 
</P>
<P>
	--The agency's 1997 decision to begin certifying a new generation  
of 737 models with the same rudder control concept -- primary 
systems that merge in a single power control unit -- as that used on 
USAir Flight 427, a 737 that mysteriously plunged to the earth 
outside Pittsburgh in September 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	--The agency's decision to balk at the NTSB's 1995 recommendation  
to require that airlines immediately install upgraded flight data 
recorders on all aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The one on Flight 427 recorded only 11 pieces of flight  
information but not the position of the rudder pedals. The FAA gave 
airlines until August to install units that record at least 17 
flight parameters, including pedal position, on all commercial 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a MetroJet 737 started an uncommanded roll, but  
investigators were not able to determine the cause. The plane's 
flight data recorder had yet to be upgraded.

<HEADLINE> Safety Panel To Rule on USAir Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was a mystery then and remains one: Why  
USAir Flight 427 plunged from the sky on Sept. 8, 1994, spiraling 
into a ravine in suburban Pittsburgh, killing all 132 aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The government investigated. The manufacturer inspected. The  
plane -- a Boeing 737, the world's most common jetliner -- was 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Then last month a 737 with the updated equipment started a  
sudden, ominous roll. The pilots recovered, thanks in part to new 
training, but a new question arose. 
</P>
<P>
	Now what? asked government safety regulators.  
</P>
<P>
	Some answers may come this week, when the National  
Transportation Safety Board meets to determine the cause of the 
1994 crash in Aliquippa, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The repercussions could be enormous.  
</P>
<P>
	There is public confidence in the 737, the twin-engine workhorse  
of the civil aviation fleet. More than 3,100 are flying worldwide, 
with one taking off every six seconds around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	There is the economic viability of the Seattle-based Boeing Co.,  
a $56 billion company that has struggled with production problems 
but is the nation's leading exporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The reputation of the Federal Aviation Administration, the  
nation's chief guarantor of air safety, may also be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation has made informal allies of Boeing and the FAA.  
They contend changes to the 737's rudder and other steps taken 
since Flight 427 have corrected problems that may have contributed 
to the crash. Further changes might cast doubt on Boeing's product 
and the FAA's decision to certify it for passenger use. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, the NTSB is unsure about the fixes but wary about  
recommending new ones that could cost U.S. airlines $100 million -- 
or far more -- and create new safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
	When the hearing gavels to order on Tuesday, the question for  
everyone is what happened on that balmy, late-summer evening to 
Flight 427, a Chicago-to-Pittsburgh trip now dubbed ``the widow's 
flight'' because so many of those killed were businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	The principals agree on key details: The plane's rudder, a panel  
that runs up the back edge of the tail and sweeps the nose left and 
right, went to its full left position just after Flight 427 flew 
through turbulence from the plane ahead of it. The rudder remained 
that way during the 28-second, 6,000-foot plunge to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	What caused the problem?  
</P>
<P>
	Boeing mentions the pilots. The first officer was flying the  
plane, and the company says he was surprised by the bumpy wake and 
inadvertently held the left rudder panel to the floor as he tried 
to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Unexpected events, Boeing said in a submission to the NTSB,  
``can startle a pilot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some crash investigators think the 737's rudder control reversed  
itself amid the turbulence, so a pilot pressing on the right pedal 
to straighten the nose would have unknowingly held a rudder facing 
leftward -- the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA believes the precise cause never will be known.  
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the agency says three post-crash modifications have  
corrected the plane's problems: a redesign of the plane's rudder 
control unit to prevent a reversal, new training to help crews 
handle aircraft upsets and a reduction in the amount of rudder a 
pilot can apply in high-risk situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the approach we've taken, we've solved three potential  
accident scenarios,'' said Thomas McSweeny, associate FAA 
administrator for regulation and certification. 
</P>
<P>
	Until last month, there was speculation the NTSB might accept  
the Boeing/FAA fixes. But on Feb. 23, a 737 flown by MetroJet, the 
discount carrier of the renamed US Airways, suddenly started to 
roll while cruising from Orlando, Fla., to Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew used its post-Flight 427 training to straighten the  
plane and land safely in Baltimore, yet investigators were troubled 
to learn the plane had the modified rudder control unit. 
</P>
<P>
	While the rudder did not reverse, and the redesigned control  
unit showed no flaws upon later examination, the fact that the 
panel made an uncommanded, 8.5-degree move off center indicates the 
possibility of other problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Three high-level safety board officials, all speaking on  
condition of anonymity, said there have been disputes among board 
members themselves and between the members and their staff over two 
points: the need for further corrective action and how specific the 
board should be in making suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board only can recommend changes; the FAA alone has  
the power to order them. 
</P>
<P>
	One NTSB faction supports wholesale changes in the 737's rudder,  
including installing dual power controls to push it left and right, 
the sources said. The planes now have two primary rudder control 
systems, but they merge in a single device called the power-control 
unit. That is the unit that was redesigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Separating the systems would mean rigging a second set of  
hydraulic and electrical lines to the rudder, costing the airlines 
an estimated $60 million to $100 million. Another proposed repair, 
splitting the rudder itself, could require strengthening the 737's 
tail assembly at a far higher cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``A big-deal undertaking,'' is how Mike Denton, Boeing's former  
chief 737 engineer, termed the potential price tag. 
</P>
<P>
	Such costs could threaten a carrier like Southwest Airlines, a  
discount airline whose entire 230-plane fleet consists of 737s. 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern is that the changes would be made at different  
airline repair stations, perhaps not matching the quality control 
of a single factory assembly line. That could harm other aircraft 
systems and create new safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The other NTSB faction favors vague language recommending the  
FAA create redundancy in the 737's rudder system, a feat the agency 
and Boeing could argue has been accomplished with the recent 
modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of that approach note that the 737 has more than 91  
million flight hours, yet only a handful of aircraft incidents are 
traceable to the rudder system. The NTSB has yet to set the cause 
of the 1991 crash of United Airlines 737 on approach to Colorado 
Springs, Colo., but Boeing blames bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Those interviewed said the four board members hearing the case  
(the fifth, John Goglia, is not participating because he is a 
former USAir mechanic) will likely conclude that despite the fixes, 
unknown problems with the plane remain. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than specifying a split rudder or dual control system,  
which would put the board in the position of endorsing a change 
that may not work, the members simply may recognize the need for 
more change and leave the rest to Boeing and the FAA.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Rape Not Prosecuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WOODBOURNE, N.Y. (AP) -- Handcuffed to pipes in the chief of  
security's office, his pants yanked to his ankles, Maurice Mathie 
knew exactly what was happening to him. He just didn't want to 
believe it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an inmate. He's the man in the uniform. He's not supposed  
to rape me,'' Mathie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathie reported the alleged sodomy to everyone from prison  
security to the FBI, but local and federal investigators decided 
not to prosecute Sgt. Roy Fries citing a lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathie sued Suffolk County and won more than $450,000 in civil  
damages. A federal judge said Fries had committed ``an outrageous 
abuse of power and authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Mathie spends his time investing that money from a cell in  
the Woodbourne Correctional Facility in New York's Catskill 
Mountains. He expects to be paroled in 2009. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I've got a lot of money,'' he said. ``I'd give it all up  
to have never been in this situation in the first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he was 21, Mathie and three others killed Paul Vincent  
Lamariana, 49. They clubbed him with a wrench, choked him with an 
electrical cord, and while he was still alive, stuffed him into a 
plastic bag. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a terrible thing that got completely out of control,''  
said Mathie. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathie and his codefendants told police they killed Lamariana  
because he allegedly molested, harassed and threatened one of the 
suspects and her daughter. Police and prosecutors said they didn't 
find evidence that the girl was being abused. 
</P>
<P>
	It was while he was waiting trial in the Suffolk County Jail  
that Fries, chief of jail security, sodomized him, Mathies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fries would not speak with The Associated Press.  
</P>
<P>
	During the civil trial, Fries testified that Mathie was in his  
office ``probably much more than any inmate'' but denied any sexual 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathie said Fries was his first friend in jail.  
</P>
<P>
	``At first I trusted him. He was compassionate. Understanding,''  
said Mathie, whose prior criminal record consisted of four traffic 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, said Mathie, Fries began making sexual advances.  
</P>
<P>
	``He would wheel his chair in front of mine where I was sitting  
and put his hands on my thighs and start talking to me, rubbing my 
thighs, grabbing my hand to hold my hand, and with each visit it 
just kept progressing,'' Mathie would later testify. 
</P>
<P>
	An internal investigation at the jail showed that Mathie, who  
was still awaiting trial, spent ``seven times the time of any other 
prisoner'' locked in Fries office. 
</P>
<P>
	In mid-March, 1990, Mathie said Fries locked him into his  
office, as usual, then grabbed him from behind in a bear hug, 
handcuffed him to vertical pipes, undressed and rubbed lotion on 
both of them and penetrated Mathie from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``He raped me, it seemed like, forever,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Back in his cell, Mathie sobbed. Then he broke everything he had  
-- cassettes, tape recorder, shampoo bottles, bars of soap. He tried 
to slash his wrists. 
</P>
<P>
	He reported the crime to the FBI. The FBI investigated and found  
prison staff, inmates and psychologists confirming that Fries had 
been spending an inordinate amount of time locked in his office 
with Mathie. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation found that Fries had been in trouble for  
having relations with young male prisoners before. A jail 
psychologist told investigators that Fries overstepped his rank 
``to acquire sexual gratification from homosexual inmates in the 
institution,'' said the FBI report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Justice said there wasn't enough evidence to  
file charges against Fries, but prosecutors refused to discuss 
specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathie's case was investigated as a possible civil rights  
violation because the alleged attack came while he was in custody. 
Federal civil rights law permits prosecution when an ``agent of 
government'' deprives someone of civil rights ``under color of 
law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fries retired from the jail with a pension in 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Here are brief descriptions of other civil rights claims and  
actions taken by federal prosecutors in recent years: 
</P>
<P>
	DECLINED TO PROSECUTE:   	
</P>
<P>
	-- Christopher Kinneer, 27, of Nelsonville, Ohio, died Dec. 31,  
1994 after being arrested, hog tied and maced by Columbus, Ohio, 
police. Police said Kinneer had been arguing with his girlfriend. 
The Justice Department declined to file charges against the 
officers. The city of Columbus paid Kinneer's parents $805,000 to 
settle a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Craig Thomas, 29, of Wortham, Texas, died June 5, 1993, after  
a car in which he was riding was stopped by Corsicana police for an 
expired registration. Police said Thomas, who is black, ran from 
the car, fell in a ditch and struggled with two white officers when 
caught. His death was ruled accidental. A medical examiner said 
contributing factors included the method by which he was restrained 
and drugs and alcohol in his system. The Justice Department 
declined to prosecute. The city of Corsicana agreed to pay Thomas' 
family $522,000 to settle a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Aaron Williams, 35, of San Francisco, died June 4, 1995, after  
a struggle with 11 police officers who had gone to his home to 
arrest him for burglary. Witnesses said the officers beat Williams, 
pepper sprayed him and hog tied him before throwing him face down 
into a police van. The Justice Department decided not to prosecute 
in March 1996. A year later, an officer at the center of the 
incident was fired for lying to authorities about federal lawsuits 
in his past. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Jeanie Mentavlos and Kim Messer, among the first female cadets  
at the Citadel in Charleston, S.C., said male students violated 
their rights. During their plebe year in 1996, they said their 
clothes were lit on fire, they were screamed at and forced to 
consume nauseating amounts of tea and other drinks. Male students, 
they said, told them to get out of the school, and eventually they 
did. The Justice Department investigated for 13 months, concluding 
that male cadets received the same type of abuse. In a memo closing 
the case, prosecutors termed it ``highly questionable whether it 
would be a wise expenditure of resources to attempt federally to 
criminally prosecute and imprison these cadets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	PROSECUTED:   	
</P>
<P>
	-- Prince George's County, Md., police officer Timothy Moran, 34,  
pleaded guilty on March 9, 1998, to beating a handcuffed man with a 
nightstick. Moran admitted that he violated federal civil rights 
statutes when he repeatedly struck Peter Peluso in May, 1994. Moran 
was sentenced to five months in prison followed by five months of 
home detention. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Eight Corcoran State Prison officers were indicted on criminal  
civil rights charges in California on Feb. 26, 1998, for allegedly 
pitting inmates in deadly gladiator-style fights for the guards' 
amusement.

<HEADLINE> Coppola To Open California Bistro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Francis Ford Coppola, already a purveyor of  
fine wines and pasta sauces, is adding a bistro to his list of 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Niebaum-Coppola Cafe opens March 28 in San Francisco's North  
Beach neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The wine bar and cafe will feature wines from the filmmaker's  
Northern California winery, and pasta and sauces from his packaged 
food business. The food will be Italian fare, like pizza and 
calzones. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of a crazy idea because it looks very much like a  
French cafe . . . but the food is more Italian,'' Coppola said. 
``What I want is that kind of relaxing and inviting and warm 
environment you get in some of the better cafes in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bistro is on the ground floor of the building that houses  
Coppola's production company, American Zoetrope.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Wins Wrestling Title, Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Once again, it's Iowa.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hawkeyes -- who looked vulnerable after losing four dual  
meets and their first Big Ten Tournament in a quarter-century -- won 
the NCAA Division I wrestling championships Saturday, 100 1/2-98 1/2 over 
Minnesota in the first tournament to be decided by the final match 
in more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa's second-year coach Jim Zalesky called this title more  
satisfying than last year's. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this group, it's sweeter because nobody expected it,'' he  
said. ``Last year, we had the horses to win it, everyone knew we 
had the horses. We had guys who'd been here. This year, we only had 
one guy who'd been here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa's fifth straight national title -- its eighth in the past  
nine years -- came down to the heavyweight final, the most 
anticipated showdown of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Neal, Cal State-Bakersfield's heavyweight and the  
defending champion, won his 83rd straight match 3-2 against 
Minnesota's Brock Lesnar to the cheers of the Hawkeyes faithful. 
</P>
<P>
	``I waited for him to make a mistake,'' Neal said. ``He made one  
and I made none.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm amazed,'' Lesnar said afterward. ``I just -- I gave all I  
had and I'm just really disappointed. I wrestled 110 percent and I 
wouldn't ask more of myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Gophers -- who have never won a national title, but  
beat the Hawkeyes in the Big Ten Tournament this month -- started 
the finals two points ahead of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Hawkeyes had two finalists win: Doug Schwab at 141, beat  
Michael Lightner of Oklahoma 4-2 on a takedown with 18 seconds 
left; and T.J. Williams at 149, improved to 40-0 with a 5-3 win 
against Mount Carmel (Ill.) High School teammate Tony Davis of 
Northern Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're in the national finals, that's enough in itself,''  
Schwab said. ``The team title, putting us back in the lead, that's 
extra incentive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zalesky said his team peaked at the right time.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had some concerns in the middle part of the season,'' he  
said. ``That's why I didn't try to get them emotionally high until 
the last two weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those early victories by Schwab and Williams turned the tide for  
Iowa and put pressure on Minnesota's three finalists. Only one 
Gopher won a final. 
</P>
<P>
	``Couple of our guys didn't wrestle up to their seeds and Iowa's  
did,'' said Minnesota coach J Robinson. He had thought the Gophers 
could win it with Lesnar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neal took one shot. That's how close it was,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	To set up the tournament-deciding heavyweight match, Minnesota's  
Tim Hartung at 197, the 1998 champion, pulled out a dramatic 2-1 
victory against 1997 champ Lee Fullhart. Hartung finished his 
season 39-0 and won the last 55 matches of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartung took Fullhart down with 34 seconds left to finish his  
career 9-1 against the Iowa wrestler. Fullhart nearly reversed 
Hartung in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota's Brandon Eggum was the second of Minnesota's three  
finalists to lose, 6-1 to Iowa State's Cael Sanderson (39-0). 
Sanderson, a redshirt freshman, was named the tournament's most 
outstanding wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma State -- No. 1 coming into the nationals with two  
defending champs, another No. 1 seed and a No. 2 seed -- finished 
third with 84 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys sent only one wrestler into the finals, Eric  
Guerrero, who won his third national title at 133 by taking down 
Iowa State's Cody Sanderson 55 seconds into overtime for a 3-1 
victory. He is the 13th three-time champion at Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
	``To accomplish a little of what they've accomplished in their  
lives, it's an unbelievable feeling. It probably won't hit me until 
I'm 60 years old,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Penn State's three finalists, only Glenn Pritzlaff at 174  
won, 10-4 against Otto Olson of Michigan. Unbeaten Jeremy Hunter at 
125 lost 7-4 to Stephen Abas of Fresno State. Clint Musser at 157 
lost to Casey Cunningham of Central Michigan, 2-1. Cunningham is 
Central Michigan's first national champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk White, No. 2 at 165, became Boise State's first national  
champion by beating Rodney Jones of Oklahoma 3-1 despite suffering 
a pinched neck nerve and numbness during parts of the last two 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Larry Quisel placed third at 157 after being upset in  
his first match, which included a controversial timekeeping call. 
He had to win eight straight matches, including five seeded 
wrestlers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great accomplishment to be the first one. I'm not going  
to be the last one,'' White said.

<HEADLINE> Law Bars Rights Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	More than two out of three civil rights cases sent to federal  
prosecutors fall under the Ku Klux Act, passed after the Civil War. 
That law makes it a crime for agents of the government to use their 
legal authority to intentionally violate a person's rights and 
increases potential penalties if an agent hurts or kills that 
person in the process. The law says, in part: 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever, under color of any law, ... willfully subjects any  
person ... to the deprivation of any rights ... protected by the 
Constitution or laws of the United States ... shall be fined ... or 
imprisoned not more than one year, or both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It provides that ``if bodily injury results from the acts  
committed,'' the penalty increases to as much as 10 years in 
prison, plus a fine. 
</P>
<P>
	It adds that ``if death results from the acts committed ... or  
if such acts include kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, aggravated 
sexual abuse, or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or 
an attempt to kill,'' the maximum penalty is life in prison or 
execution.

reported early today near Adak, in the Aleutian Islands, according 
to the Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	The center of the earthquake at 1:48 a.m. was 50 miles southwest

<HEADLINE> 'Trench Coat Robber' Gets 24 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TACOMA, Wash. (AP) -- A man convicted in what authorities call  
the biggest bank robbery in U.S. history has been sentenced to 24 
years and seven months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Lewis Bowman, 54, of Parkville, Mo., was also ordered to pay  
$5.2 million and to forfeit 112 guns at his sentencing on Friday. 
He could have been sentenced to a maximum of 30 years behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleged that from 1982 to 1997, Bowman and  
William Arthur Kirkpatrick of Hovland, Minn., pulled off 28 bank 
robberies that netted more than $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In most of the jobs, the robbers wore disguises, including  
trench coats, earning them the title of the ``Trench Coat 
Robbers.'' Authorities said the pair would slip into banks, often 
at opening or closing, surprise employees and quickly make off with 
large amounts of cash. The two rarely left behind fingerprints or 
other evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman was convicted in November of bank robbery, conspiracy to  
commit bank robbery, use of a firearm in the commission of a crime 
and transporting stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial centered on the Feb. 10, 1997, robbery of nearly $4.5  
million -- approximately 335 pounds of cash -- from the Seafirst bank 
branch in suburban Lakewood. The U.S. attorney's office said it was 
the biggest U.S. bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Trench Coat Robbers were among the most successful  
stickup men in the country, authorities had no idea of their 
identities until 1997. Small acts of carelessness -- waving cash 
around, falling behind on a storage bill, speeding -- ultimately led 
to the two arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Bowman failed to pay a bill at a Missouri storage  
company. When an auctioneer found guns inside, federal agents were 
called in. 
</P>
<P>
	That same year, a Nebraska state trooper pulled Kirkpatrick over  
for doing 7 mph above the limit. Inside his car, police found four 
pistols, ski masks, phony police badges, locksmith tools and $1.8 
million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges against Kirkpatrick in the Lakewood robbery were dropped  
last year after a judge ruled the trooper's search was illegally 
conducted. However, Kirkpatrick still faces trial for the 1993 
robbery of First Bank in Burnsville, Minn., and is charged with 
eight counts of money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison last year for  
illegally possessing gun silencer parts.

<HEADLINE> Angels Lose Walbeck, Dickson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Anaheim Angels right-hander Jason Dickson  
has a torn labrum in his pitching shoulder and might be sidelined 
for the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickson, who turns 26 later this month, had been experiencing  
soreness in his shoulder, and felt a new pinch this week, prompting 
team physician Dr. Lewis Yocum to perform an MRI. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickson, who was a candidate for the fifth spot in the Angels'  
starting rotation, may have surgery, depending on whether he shows 
improvement within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on what the doctors see in surgery, if it is needed,  
Yocum said Saturday Dickson's recovery could take as little as 
3-to-4 months or as long as the whole season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This news hit him pretty hard,'' Yocum said. ``He has a lot of  
thinking to do. Shoulder surgery is always difficult for a pitcher 
to contend with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In three exhibition appearances, Dickson pitched 5 2-3 innings,  
allowing 15 runs and 15 hits. He was 10-10 with a 6.05 ERA in 27 
games last season -- 18 of them starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels also learned they will be without catcher Matt  
Walbeck for at least a month. Walbeck has a fractured right hand 
and will wear a removable splint for the next 3-to-4 weeks and 
won't be able to catch or hit during that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Walbeck said he felt burning in his wrist after a minor league  
game Wednesday and his wrist started to swell. Since he has had two 
broken bones in the same hand and he has been playing with pain for 
four years, he didn't think anything of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Angels head athletic trainer Ned Bergert did, though, and he had  
Walbeck get an X-ray. Walbeck thought the pain would go away, but 
now he has to deal with another injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is kind of a drag,'' he said. ``I was kind of in shock,  
but there is nothing I can do. I can't get depressed about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walbeck is hitting .250 (4-for-16) with one run scored, one  
double and one RBI in seven games this spring.

	The 28-year-old brother of country music singers Luciano and  
Zeze di Camargo was kidnapped on Dec. 16 in Goiania, state capital 
of Goias, 840 miles northwest of Rio. 
</P>
<P>
	The public profile of the crime escalated last week when TV  
presenter Carlos Massa, whose nightly show is watched by millions, 
offered to create a hotline to raise money for the ransom. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, kidnappers upped the ransom demand from $300,000 to  
$2 million in a note left by a studio of the TV station that Massa 
works for. They left a piece of Wellington Camargo's ear with it.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Ninety percent of Venezuelans say  
former coup leader and now President Hugo Chavez is doing a 
``fair'' to ``very good'' job so far, according to a poll published 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the question, ``How would you evaluate the  
government's performance so far?'' about 17 percent said ``very 
good,'' 52 percent said ``good'' and 21 percent said ``fair to 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey by independent pollsters Datanalisis, appearing  
Saturday in the Caracas daily El Nacional, questioned 1,000 people 
between Feb. 24 and Feb. 28 and had a 3 percent margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
	The results underline the affection many Venezuelans feel for  
Chavez despite a series of setbacks suffered by the new leader 
since his inauguration Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	A Supreme Court decision Thursday blocked Chavez's decree  
calling for a national referendum to decide whether to rewrite the 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition leaders and landowners were outraged when the  
president refused to bring in the National Guard to halt a 
nationwide wave of squatting. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, who staged an unsuccessful coup attempt against the  
government seven years ago, was swept to power on an 
anti-corruption and fervently populist platform last December.

	DALLAS (AP) -- Jason Kreis scored three second-half goals as  
Dallas beat Kansas City 4-0 in an MLS opener Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Kreis assisted on Mickey Trotman's goal in the 53rd minute, and  
Trotman returned the favor two minutes later on Kreis' first goal. 
Kreis has seven goals and four assists in 12 career games against 
the Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 80th minute, Kreis took advantage of a poor clearance by  
Kansas City's rookie goalkeeper, Cesar Delgado, signed as a 
discovery player on Friday by the Wizards, who spotted him during 
their preseason training in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 84th minute, Kreis scored again off a cross by playmaker  
Oscar Pareja, who stepped over the ball with his left foot and 
struck a right-footed cross through the legs of Wizards defender 
Alexi Lalas, with Kreis running on to the ball and burying his 
third goal of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	In three previous season openers, Dallas had scored just one  
goal in regulation and went 2-1, with both victories decided by the 
shootout tiebreaker.

	First World Balloon Flight Is Complete  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones are now the first  
balloonists to soar around the world non-stop. After 19 days aloft, 
the Swiss doctor and British pilot and their silvery Breitling 
Orbiter 3 floated past longitude 9 degrees west at 4:54 EST to 
complete the 26,500-mile, nonstop circumnavigation, a feat that had 
challenged and eluded dozens of balloonists before them. Triumphant 
but weary, the record-making duo sped on toward a landing probably

showdown over the future of this rebellious province. Amid ominous 
signals of a resumption of all-out war, fighting was reported in 
the north today and Yugoslav tanks and other armored vehicles were 
on the move west of the provincial capital, Pristina. In Washington 
yesterday, President Clinton warned that the collapse of peace

four-year fight over pay that brought the airline to the brink of a 
strike. The 2,300 flight attendants were ready to strike late last 
night, but three days of talks with federal mediators in Washington 
resulted in a settlement. A possible strike threatened to leave up

about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky against ``hundreds and 
hundreds and hundreds of times'' when he did ``not abuse my

people.'' Clinton offered his accounting yesterday at an hour-long

	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Southeast Asian finance ministers  
announced a broad framework today for restructuring the world 
financial system, while saying their region's economic crisis has 
bottomed out. The ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations, after a two-day meeting, pledged to continue economic 
reforms in their own countries to ensure the region's recovery. 
They also recommended changes to the international financial 
structure. Large outflows of speculative capital are widely

	HOUSTON (AP) -- The first man on the moon will be the last to

<HEADLINE> Friends Are Opponents in East Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Don't be surprised to see Temple  
freshman center Kevin Lyde smiling and yapping any time he gets 
near Duke's Elton Brand or William Avery in the East Regional 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	While they might be opponents on the court with a Final Four  
berth at stake on Sunday, they're also friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyde and Avery attended Oak Hill Academy in Virginia after high  
school and continued their friendship after going off to college. 
</P>
<P>
	When Avery wasn't around to answer Lyde's calls, Lyde talked to  
his roommate, Brand. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're good friends of mine. We talk old times and  
basketball,'' said Lyde, who hit all six of his shots and scored 14 
points in the first half of the Owls' impressive 77-55 victory over 
10th-seeded Purdue on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The performance came right after No. 1 Duke (35-1) had somewhat  
of an off night in beating Southwest Missouri 78-61. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand had 14 points and eight rebounds in that game and his  
presence inside was something Southwest Missouri couldn't handle. 
</P>
<P>
	At 6-foot-9, Lyde not only has the size and bulk to play the  
6-8, 260-pound Brand, he also has the personal experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyde, of Washington, D.C., went 1-on-1 against Brand, of  
Peekskill, N.Y., in AAU ball a couple years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't intimidate me,'' Lyde said of Brand, who averaged  
17.8 points and 9.7 rebounds this season. ``We became friends in a 
short period of time. I just look at it like I'm playing against a 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he'll play hard and leave it there and I'll play hard  
and leave it out there. It will be a tough game. We'll go after 
each other but after the game we're going to shake hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand doesn't mind mentioning that he got the best of Lyde in  
their AAU meeting, but he also notes that playing against Temple 
means he'll be going more against the Owls' zone than anyone in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather play against a man-to-man team,'' Brand said.  
``That's what we run and that's what we're accommodated to play 
against. it will be a different type of change for us to play 
against a zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand said the key won't be changing his game but having the  
team make a couple of extra passes to get the same shot. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Avery, of Augusta, Ga., comes in at the point.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a floor leader,'' Lyde said. ``He's leading Duke, a great  
team. He's scoring, playing defense, making smart decisions with 
the basketball. He's just leading that team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Avery and Lyde talked a lot during the season, they  
haven't spoken since the tournament started. They will on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never thought we would have this opportunity to play each  
other, especially for a game like this,'' Avery said.

<HEADLINE> IVillage Stock Soars in IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of iVillage tripled on their first day of  
trading Friday after the operator of Web site for women raised $88 
million in an initial public offering, proving that the fervor for 
new Internet stocks has scarcely waned. 
</P>
<P>
	The new stock was priced at $24 a share, but soared as high as  
$100 before closing at $80.12 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	iVillage operates a Web site geared toward women with  
information and entertainment ranging from health and fitness to 
fashion. About 1 million people have signed on as members, with 2.7 
million visiting the site in December 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sold 3.65 million shares, or about a 16 percent  
stake. It plans to use the proceeds to invest in other Web 
companies, pay for more promotions and expand its features and 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based company is the latest money-losing venture to  
cash in on a rush to buy stocks with promising futures on the Web. 
Brushing aside huge risks, investors have focused on the infant 
medium's seemingly limitless potential for new uses. 
</P>
<P>
	iVillage, with an audience that's more than 80 percent female,  
says women represent a particularly big growth area on the Internet 
because they influence many purchase decisions by families. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet iVillage has lost $76.3 million since it was started in July  
1995 and says it needs to generate huge revenue increases from 
advertising to cover its steep costs. 
</P>
<P>
	It also faces growing competition from other Web sites targeted  
at women, such as Women.com Networks, Microsoft's 
womencentral.msn.com and Oxygen Media's Web sites.

<HEADLINE> Bosox' Garciaparra Undergoing MRI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Nomar Garciaparra left the Boston Red  
Sox on today to head to Los Angeles where he will undergo an MRI on 
his right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra will be examined by Dr. Tony Daley and Dr. Lewis  
Yokum on Monday 
</P>
<P>
	``Nomar has been suffering from a muscle strain and a strained  
ligament,'' team physician Arthur Pappas said. ``If all goes well 
we expect he will be back Wednesday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pappas describes Garciaparra's injury as ``something you see a  
lot in spring training.'' The areas involved, according to Pappas, 
are the flexor muscle in the right forearm and the ligament inside 
the right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, the 1997 Rookie of the Year and runner-up in last  
season's AL MVP voting, suffered the injury in a game March 11 
against the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made an awkward throw to the plate and has been bothered  
with the condition since then,'' said Pappas. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Garciaparra has not played in the Red Sox last two  
games he has appeared as a designated hitter in four games since 
the injury and was 3-for-15 with a home run and four RBIs in those 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing wrong when he swings the bat, he only  
experiences pain when he tries to throw the ball,'' said Pappas. 
</P>
<P>
	Pappas said he encouraged Garciaparra to get a second opinion  
after looking at him Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's his right and it helps me in treating him because I  
have additional information, from specialists, on his condition,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra was unavailable for comment prior to leaving the Red  
Sox spring training facility.

<HEADLINE> Duke, Temple Have Little in Common </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The teams are nothing alike and  
neither are their basketball histories. The coaches, except for 
impressive winning percentages and respect of their peers, have 
little in common. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe all those differences are what makes Sunday's East  
Regional final between top-ranked Duke and sixth-seeded Temple so 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils (35-1) have won 30 straight games and lead the  
nation in scoring (93.2 points) and margin of victory (26.1 points 
per game). Their 51.6 percent shooting is second in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Temple (24-10) has won three straight games and average just  
66.7 points per game. The Owls' 52.7 shooting in their regional 
semifinal win over Purdue was only the third time this season they 
made more than half their shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke is trying to reach the Final Four for the 12th time, the  
eighth under coach Mike Krzyzewski and first since 1994. Temple is 
looking for its third trip there and first for coach John Chaney. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't even get Chaney started on the difference between the  
teams' talent levels, especially on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there is another team in the country that has  
the ability of the Duke basketball team,'' Chaney said Saturday. 
``In all my years I have rarely seen a team that can go to the 
bench and get an apple for an apple. When we go to the bench we 
might take away an apple and bring a lemon in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski isn't buying the fruit analogy from Chaney, whom he  
considers a good friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can tell Cosby's been around today,'' Krzyzewski said  
referring to longtime Temple fan Bill Cosby who was visiting his 
favorite team Saturday. ``He gave John a few lines for the press 
conference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These same schools met in the same situation in the same  
building 11 years ago with some strange similarities. 
</P>
<P>
	In that game, top-ranked Temple brought an 18-game winning  
streak and 32-1 record into Continental Airlines Arena. 
Second-seeded Duke won 63-53 as Temple star Mark Macon was held to 
6-for-29 shooting, including eight airballs. It was Krzyzewski's 
second trip to the Final Four and the first of three times Chaney 
fell one game short of the national semifinals, the others coming 
in 1991, also in East Rutherford, and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without question everyone would like to get to the top of the  
hill,'' Chaney, 67, said. ``Getting to the field of 64 is a mark of 
success. We've been there a number of years and that will be my 
mark of success if I don't get to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't get there before I retire I'd like to think I've  
had a smidgen of success and I'll feel good about the men I've 
dealt with all my years at Temple. But that would be having peanut 
butter all my life and getting the bicycle I always wanted. I'd be 
a happy man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting there for Duke would be a chance to make up for last  
season when the Blue Devils blew a 17-point lead against Kentucky 
in the regional final. This year's Final Four is in St. Petersburg, 
Fla., in the same building as that game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really haven't talked about it much, it's a different  
situation,'' sophomore forward Shane Battier said. 
</P>
<P>
	While only two teams have come within 20 points of Duke since  
Feb. 11, including Southwest Missouri State in the regional 
semifinals, Temple's famed matchup zone makes Sunday's games 
interesting. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to make outside shots and if you try quick shots  
you're not as open as if you work like you do against any good 
defense,'' Krzyzewski said. ``We have to get more of a team shot 
than an individual shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That even goes for Trajan Langdon, a 43 percent shooter from  
3-point range who had 24 points on 9-for-14 shooting against 
Southwest Missouri State. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their zone is different than a lot of zones in that you don't  
get as many open looks,'' the fifth-year senior said. ``You have to 
work really hard. Instead of one or two passes you might have to 
make six or eight before you get an open look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Temple won't make any changes because of the opponent or the  
importance of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our defense tries to force guys to make a decision,'' Chaney  
said. ``We say very clearly that we design how we're going to win 
and design how we're going to lose. If we lose a game we'll lose it 
by you shooting from the outside, you're not going to beat us from 
both places on the floor. When you do slip over to my bench. I'll 
have a couple of Tylenols and a baseball bat.''

<HEADLINE> Midwest Final: Matchup of Opposites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The championship game of the NCAA Midwest  
regional is a matchup of flash against force, blueblood against 
blue collar. 
</P>
<P>
	On one side is Kentucky, a sleek group that isn't flustered by a  
slow tempo. The third-seeded Wildcats (28-8) won the national 
championship in 1996 and 1998 and were runners-up in '97. They have 
won 20 of their past 21 NCAA tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there is top-seeded Michigan State (32-4), which likes to  
run but is perfectly comfortable pounding opponents in a halfcourt 
game. The Spartans, who have bumped and grinded their way to 21 
straight victories, are one more ugly win away from their first 
Final Four since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be an up-and-down game,'' Mateen  
Cleaves, Michigan State's All-America guard, said. ``But I think 
the key is going to be who can execute in the halfcourt offense. 
Both teams have good athletes and do a good job of playing 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves looks and occasionally plays like a linebacker. He  
rammed into Oklahoma forward Eduardo Najera in Friday night's 
semifinal, when, while running into a pick he didn't see, his head 
smashed into Najera's jaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves is at his best in the open floor or when he is able to  
penetrate. He was only 3-of-14 against Oklahoma, but he wasn't 
alone. The Spartans shot 40 percent as a team. 
</P>
<P>
	However, they held Oklahoma to 17-of-51 and were especially  
effective defending the perimeter. The Sooners had made 23 
3-pointers in their first two NCAA tournament games, but had only 
four Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans have gotten this far by dominating opponents on the  
backboard, but Kentucky figures to give them a battle. The Wildcats 
outrebounded Miami of Ohio 34-17 in the regional semis. 
</P>
<P>
	``That'll be a big key to the game,'' Kentucky coach Tubby Smith  
said. ``Finding them to put a body on them will be a big challenge 
for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another key could be perimeter shooting. Michigan State doesn't  
rely on the 3-point shot very much, so Kentucky may use its zone 
defenses to force the Spartans outside. The strategy worked well 
against Miami of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky, on the other hand, has made 60 more 3-pointers than  
the Spartans and has attempted nearly 200 more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some success taking away what the opponents do  
best,'' Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said. ``I think that's a 
little more of a problem against Kentucky because they do a lot of 
things in different ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats have four starters who score in double figures, led  
by Scott Padgett with 12.7 points per game. Cleaves is the only 
Michigan State starter who averages double-figure points. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky also has a deep bench -- nine players average 11 or more  
minutes per game, and no one averages more than 29 minutes. But 
Michigan State's bench is proficient as well, with eight who play 
15 or more minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans have scored 80 or more points 10 times and have  
topped 90 three times. So they won't blink if it's a quick tempo 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of apologizing for what we do,'' Izzo said. ``You've  
got to remember what it's all about. It's about winning games and 
that's what we've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State players also say they aren't intimidated by  
Kentucky's name, history or record of NCAA tournament success. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just another team that we have to face,'' Antonio Smith  
said. ``If we're in awe of them, we're going to end up down 15 five 
minutes into the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tubby Smith, asked whether a season at Kentucky can be  
considered a success without a national title, said, ``Absolutely 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was kidding, although the Wildcats' mindset was very clear.  
</P>
<P>
	``When they get to the Sweet 16 or the Elite Eight, a lot of  
teams celebrate and are happy with that,'' Padgett said. ``We might 
celebrate for 30 minutes. After that, we're thinking about our next 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``You won't see us celebrating or getting too excited until we  
win the national championship.''

<HEADLINE> Georgia Women Win Swimming Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Georgia's swimmers already sensed their first  
national championship after the morning preliminaries. The Lady 
Bulldogs were able to celebrate in style after a dominating 
performance in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheered on by a raucous home crowd, Georgia got surprising  
victories from Julie Varozza and Keegan Walkley in the first two 
races Saturday and cruised to victory at the NCAA women's swimming 
and diving championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Runner-up Stanford, which had won the title five of the last six  
years, extended its remarkable run of finishing no lower than 
second since 1988. But this year belonged to Georgia, which had 
never finished higher than third in the national meet but swam away 
from the field with 504.5 points -- 63.5 ahead of the Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Bulldogs captured only one victory through the first  
two days but still managed to build a lead over Stanford because of 
solid performances throughout the team. That trend continued in the 
preliminaries Saturday morning, when Georgia put enough swimmers 
into the finals to all but ensure victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a pretty good feeling it was over,'' Varozza said. ``A  
lot of swimmers went out this morning with all their guts and did 
what we needed to do. That inspired me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Varozza, who missed most of the season while suffering from  
mononucleosis, was more than just inspired. She was downright 
remarkable in the 1,650-yard freestyle, shaving nearly 14 seconds 
off her personal best to win easily with a time of 15 minutes, 
59.66 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping (for victory) but I really didn't think so,''  
said Varozza, who received her award from Janet Evans. ``When I was 
out sick with mono, I really didn't know how I would do. I just 
wanted to score as many points as I could for the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then it was Walkley's turn in the 200 backstroke, which featured  
two-time defending champion Lindsay Benko of Southern California, 
who already had won two other events at this meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Walkley came on strong at the end to nip Stanford's Misty Hyman,  
while Benko faded to third. Georgia, which entered the night with 
an 11.5-point lead over the Cardinal, stretched its advantage to 
59.5 points with those two victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just having fun out there,'' Walkley said. ``I was real  
excited but real relaxed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Bulldogs weren't through. Martina Moravcova of Southern  
Methodist won the 10th individual title of her brilliant career in 
the 100 freestyle, but Georgia got second- and seventh-place 
finishes from Courtney Shealy and Stefanie Williams to extend the 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in the only race Georgia was expected to win, Kristy Kowal  
picked up her second title of the meet in the 200 breaststroke with 
an NCAA record of 2:07.66, shaving more than two seconds off the 
mark set by Penny Heyns of Nebraska in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have a time in mind going into the race,'' said  
Kowal, whose other victory came in the 100 breaststroke Friday. 
``At one of my turns, I heard that I was on American pace. But I 
thought I was hearing things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moravcova, who won three individual titles at the meet, captured  
the 100 freestyle for the third year in a row and finished with the 
most individual titles of the modern era. The Slovakian native was 
surpassed only by Tracy Caulkins, who won 12 titles from 1982-84 
before the NCAA limited swimmers to three individual events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy it's over,'' Moravcova said. ``I guess it's a  
lot. It take two hands to count them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Limim Liu of Nevada, a silver medalist at the 1996 Olympics,  
broke Summer Sanders' 7-year-old NCAA record in the 200 butterfly 
with a time of 1:53.36 -- six-hundredths of a second ahead of the 
previous mark. Hyman picked up her second runner-up finish of the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The other winners were Laura Wilkinson of Texas in platform  
diving and Arizona in the 400 freestyle relay. 
</P>
<P>
	SMU finished third in the team standings with 370.5 points,  
followed by Arizona with 332, California 315, Southern California 
245, Michigan 163, Florida 147, Northwestern 145 and Virginia 140. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia became only the fifth school to win in the 18-year  
history of the women's swimming and diving championships, joining 
Stanford, Texas, Florida and Southern Cal.

<HEADLINE> Exxon Valdez Wounds Still Fester </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LATOUCHE ISLAND, Alaska (AP) -- As waves of clear water lap at  
the shoreline of Sleepy Bay and seagulls wheel overhead, Bruce 
Wright nudges a rock with the toe of his rubber boot. 
</P>
<P>
	The rock rolls over, revealing a thick mat of oil turned to  
asphalt, hard as highway paving. It is spread along the beach like 
a bathtub ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it warms up you can smell it. It smells like diesel  
fuel,'' says Wright, a biologist and oil-spill expert with the 
National Marine Fisheries Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Sleepy Bay, on the northern tip of Latouche Island in Prince  
William Sound, looks like untouched paradise of craggy shoreline 
and dense forest beyond. Bald eagles perch in towering spruce 
trees. In late fall, shallow streams are choked with spawning pink 
salmon. 
</P>
<P>
	Until you pick up a stone and find oil, there is no visible hint  
that 10 years ago and just 50 miles away, the nation suffered its 
worst oil spill when the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground and 
hemorrhaged 11 million gallons of crude. 
</P>
<P>
	Sleepy Bay became a zone of death, its shore slathered with a  
thick mousse of oil and water, littered with carcasses of 
oil-coated birds. The spill fouled 1,300 miles of Alaska coastline 
and unleashed multibillion-dollar litigation. Congress banished the 
Exxon Valdez from Prince William Sound. Skipper Joseph Hazelwood 
was fired and the following year was convicted of negligence. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade later, anger and a sense of unsettled scores still  
haunt the fishermen, Alaska natives and property owners of the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Even now, there is no consensus on whether the environmental  
wounds have healed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see Prince William Sound as having essentially recovered  
from the spill. The sound is healthy, robust and thriving,'' said 
Frank Sprow, vice president for environment and safety at Exxon 
Corp., the tanker's owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil spills have short-term, acute impacts that largely disappear  
within a few years, Sprow said. ``Mother Nature, if you will, has 
remarkable powers of recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government scientists are more guarded.  
</P>
<P>
	``The sound is well on its way to recovery, but it is not fully  
recovered,'' said Stan Senner, science coordinator for the state 
and federal trustees overseeing its restoration. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agree that it's hard to define recovery and separate  
the effects of the oil from those of climate change and El Nino. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon maintains that natural change far outweighs the oil's  
effects. But government scientists say the oil combined with other 
factors to create cumulative problems for the species that have 
seen steep declines. 
</P>
<P>
	About 250,000 seabirds, 2,650 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, 250  
bald eagles, 400 loons and more than 1,000 cormorants were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 23 species hurt, the trustees have declared only two --  
bald eagles and river otters -- fully recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Sockeye salmon, pink salmon, mussels and the common murre -- a  
small seabird -- are still recovering. Harbor seals, killer whales 
and some sea otters show no signs of recovery, trustees say. 
</P>
<P>
	At Sleepy Bay, the seaweed, mussels, starfish and other  
organisms that were killed off by high-powered jets of hot water 
during the cleanup have returned to the tidal pools. 
</P>
<P>
	But people in the nearby Alutiiq village of Chenega Bay say  
waters once plentiful with wildlife are quieter since the spill. 
</P>
<P>
	``The seals and sea lions are few and far between now,'' said  
Larry Evanoff, a village councilman. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the 2,200 Alaska natives living in the affected areas  
rely on fish, birds and marine mammals for food. These days, they 
say, they have to travel farther and work harder to find them. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are concerned about the oil that's still out there,''  
said Daryl Totemoff of Chenega Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the spilled oil has disappeared from Prince William  
Sound, evaporated or decomposed. But small pockets of pollution, 
like that at Sleepy Bay, persist throughout the spill area. And 
scientists are learning that even a decade later weathered oil 
still is highly toxic and can harm wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	It was fishery managers with the Alaska Department of Fish and  
Game who first noticed that salmon spawning in some of Prince 
William Sound's streams seemed to be suffering ill-effects as long 
as four years after the disaster -- far longer than was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the number of pink salmon that return to Prince William  
Sound each summer has rebounded to pre-spill levels, but there are 
localized effects in the streams still exposed to oil, scientists 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Alaska's winter storms can remake an entire shoreline,  
rearranging boulders and rerouting the mouths of streams, oil that 
has been hidden for years can be exposed and damage salmon eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Conventional wisdom held that this weathered oil wasn't  
particularly harmful because most of the volatile compounds -- 
benzene, toluene, ethylene and xylene -- had evaporated long ago, 
said Jeffrey Short, a research chemist with the National Marine 
Fisheries Service. 
</P>
<P>
	But fertilized salmon eggs in Prince William Sound were dying at  
unusually high rates in the first years after the spill. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies of the effects of oil on fish focused on oil's  
volatile compounds. So scientists at the fisheries' service 
laboratory at Auke Bay, near Juneau, took a different approach. 
</P>
<P>
	They ``weathered'' quantities of Alaska North Slope crude to  
remove the volatile compounds and focused on what remained -- 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists allowed tens of thousands of fertilized pink  
salmon eggs to incubate in gravel contaminated with weathered oil. 
</P>
<P>
	When the fish returned to their spawning grounds after two  
years, scientists found, those exposed to even small amounts of oil 
were more likely to die or grow up stunted. 
</P>
<P>
	Their conclusion: The hydrocarbons left in weathered oil are  
toxic to fish -- even at levels as low as one part per billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers say what they've learned from the spill could  
help explain the declines in fish and marine life in some of the 
nation's busiest harbors and waterways. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everywhere you're using petroleum products, it doesn't take  
much to get a part per billion. Just little spills or exhaust or 
runoff from a parking lot and you're impacting fish resources,'' 
said Wright, the biologist. ``Any place that has chronic oiling, 
you can kiss your fish goodbye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon disputes the findings.  
</P>
<P>
	``All of the published studies on oil impacts on salmon are  
completely different than those reported by the Auke Bay group,'' 
said Exxon's Sprow. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wright says it's the only major study to focus on the less  
volatile components of oil. Had there been more pollutants in 
Prince William Sound, the researchers might have looked in the 
wrong direction, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't have done this study anywhere else,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The sound may be recovering, but those who live and work there  
still wait for some sense of resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The salmon and herring fisheries that had long sustained the  
2,500 people of Cordova on the western sound went into a tailspin 
after the spill. Fishermen went bankrupt, shops closed, people 
moved away, and the divorce rate went up. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmon harvests are back to pre-spill levels, but prices are  
down sharply due to a glut on the world market. Herring continue to 
show signs of disease, but it's not clear if the spill is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of Cordova's five canneries have closed and the value of  
fishing permits has plunged. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon, meanwhile, has seen its fortunes grow and is poised to  
become the world's largest oil company with its $73.7 billion 
acquisition of Mobil Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordovans celebrated a moral victory in 1994 when a federal jury  
found Exxon guilty of recklessness and ordered it to pay $5 billion 
in damages to those whose livelihood was affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Payouts to each of some 35,000 claimants could range from a few  
thousand dollars to more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, has spent the past five years  
appealing the verdict, and the fight has taken a toll on Cordova. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a relentless, never-ending thing in a psychological  
sense,'' said Cordova fisherman Ross Mullins. ``I think most 
fishermen are feeling this litigation is a divisive thing. It's 
really keeping people from getting on with their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But until Exxon pays, Cordova won't let go.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to make us feel whole again, but it's the only  
way we can get to this corporate entity,'' said Sylvia Lange, 46, 
who was born in Cordova and, like her parents, has fished the sound 
since childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon contends it has paid enough: $2.2 billion on the cleanup,  
$1 billion to settle state and federal civil charges and $300 
million for lost wages to 11,000 fishermen and business operators. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Exxon Valdez spill left Alaskans angry with Exxon, it  
also instilled the kind of vigilance born of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had all grown rather complacent,'' said John Devens, who  
was mayor of the oil town of Valdez at the time of the spill and 
who now heads a citizens' oil industry watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, as oil flowed from the crippled tanker, cleanup  
equipment was buried under several feet of snow, crews were up to 
18 hours late in responding and there was confusion about who was 
in charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, dozens of barges, tugs, skimmers and crews wait in Prince  
William Sound around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's a port in the world that's watched as  
much as this one,'' said Lt. Chris Holmes of the Coast Guard at 
Valdez. ``The spill still haunts people. People look back on it as 
a wake-up call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 1995 study for the owners of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline  
says the likelihood of another spill of such magnitude is down by 
75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably have the safest oil transportation system in the  
world today. Unfortunately, it required a major oil spill to 
develop it,'' Devens said. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which had been stalled in  
Congress for nearly 15 years, was enacted within 18 months of the 
Exxon spill. The law increased the financial liability of oil 
companies and shippers, required stronger prevention measures and 
set up a fund to combat oil pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	And, in an unusual twist, the act barred Exxon from returning  
the offending tanker to Prince William Sound. Renamed the SeaRiver 
Mediterranean, it now carries crude from the Middle East to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon is fighting in court to bring the tanker back, maintaining  
that it was purpose-built for Valdez and is not cost-effective 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Former skipper Hazelwood, now a claims adjuster for a maritime  
lawyer in New York City, has been ordered to return to Alaska to 
begin serving 1,000 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Hazelwood who ordered the tanker to shift position to  
avoid icebergs. He then went to his cabin, leaving the third mate, 
Gregory Cousins, in control. Minutes later, the ship slammed into 
Bligh Reef. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonized as a drunk, Hazelwood was acquitted by an Alaska jury  
of a charge of operating a tanker while intoxicated, but was 
convicted of a misdemeanor charge of spilling oil. 
</P>
<P>
	After eight years of appeals, Hazelwood has agreed to return to  
Alaska to serve his sentence. The judge had suggested it include 
cleaning oil off the beaches of Prince William Sound, but the 
cleanup ended years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Hazelwood will be picking up trash along the highways  
of Anchorage.

<HEADLINE> Crop Insurance Reforms Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Since late 1998, lawmakers have stressed the  
need to reform the federal crop insurance program. But with 
commodity prices continuing to remain low, many in Congress are 
embracing the idea of a relief package to compensate farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	That sentiment contrasts sharply with lawmakers' desire last  
year to strengthen crop insurance so they could avoid big bailouts. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, Congress passed $7 billion in emergency aid after  
farm prices plummeted, due largely to the Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline then spread to livestock, with hog farmers getting  
the lowest prices in four decades. That led the Agriculture 
Department to give producers $50 million in hopes of boosting the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, experts have predicted that while the agricultural  
economy will rebound, it is not likely to revive this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government last month projected farm exports will drop to  
$49 billion, compared with $53.6 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could say we are about to turn the corner,''  
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	It is all enough to change minds on Capitol Hill about the best  
way to help farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reforming crop insurance will not be enough,'' said Rep. Wes  
Watkins, R-Okla. ``We're going to have to have more disaster aid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Rep. Leonard Boswell, D-Iowa: ``I agree there will  
probably be another disaster bill. As I look down the line, I don't 
see anything that says we're not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the House Agriculture Committee chairman, GOP Rep. Larry  
Combest of Texas, said he ``believed strongly'' there would be 
another relief package for farmers this year. But he warned 
farmers: do not count on it because nothing is guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	Combest's Senate counterpart, Republican Richard Lugar of  
Indiana, has not publicly embraced the idea of compensating farmers 
for low prices. But he has questioned whether crop insurance is the 
right way to help farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not yet convinced. . . that such a course is in the best  
interests of farmers and ranchers,'' Lugar said a hearing on the 
issue last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Crop insurance became even more vital to farmers after the 1996  
farm law began phasing out years of government subsidies for 
farmers. But many farmers do not have crop insurance, saying it is 
too expensive or inadequate. Taxpayer dollars cover 60 percent of 
the cost while farmers' premiums cover the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the government help, crop insurance remains costly for  
small family farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Cyre, a farmer in Hazel, S.D., said he pays about $17,000 a  
year in crop insurance, but found the program inadequate this year 
when he began having trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Crop insurance is a part of what is needed to help producers,  
Cyre said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a smaller part than current rhetoric would lead you to  
believe,'' Cyre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi State University agricultural economist Keith Coble  
indicated during a Senate hearing that reducing farmers' cost of 
crop insurance by 20 percent likely would increase participation 
only by about 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am doubtful about there being a panacea waiting in the  
wings,'' Coble said. ``Rather difficult analysis and sound 
decisions will be required to achieve programs which are workable 
and useful to the good producer desiring truly effective risk 
management tools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cyre and some other farmers are hoping lawmakers embrace a plan  
pushed by Democrats and some Republicans that would increase price 
supports for farmers. That idea, however, could cost billions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers also want reforms such as mandatory livestock price  
reporting and country-of-origin meat labeling, which they believe 
will boost American producers. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of Republicans -- Reps. John Thune of South Dakota, Jo  
Ann Emerson of Missouri, Rick Hill of Montana and Watkins -- has 
been meeting with GOP leadership to push for more than just crop 
insurance reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we're going to have to provide more disaster  
assistance,'' Emerson said. ``I really believe they (GOP 
leadership) want to do whatever is possible to help our farmers.''

<HEADLINE> Hockey Player Tried for Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. CLAIR SHORES, Mich. (AP) -- Playing in a sport where brawling  
long has been tolerated, a hockey player has a legal fight on his 
hands: a felony assault count accuses him of slashing an opponent's 
face with the metal hook of his prosthetic arm. 
</P>
<P>
	John Fields, 38, who plays in an adult hockey league in his  
suburban Detroit hometown on Friday was ordered tried on a charge 
that he assaulted James Barr with intent to maim. 
</P>
<P>
	Macomb County prosecutors said Fields' use of the hook last  
month on Barr caused a wound that required 200 stitches to close 
and plastic surgery on the 31-year-old man's cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	Fields' lawyer, Stephen Rabaut, said his client never meant to  
injure Barr. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where is the intent to maim?'' The Macomb Daily of Mount  
Clements quoted Rabaut as saying. ``Where is the intent to cause a 
disfigurement? It was merely an altercation in a hockey arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such prosecutions are rare, and the case comes as the number of  
adult -- or ``senior'' -- leagues is mushrooming nationwide. Senior 
teams affiliated with U.S.A. Hockey Inc. in Colorado jumped from 
2,663 in 1991-92 to 4,168 in 1997-98, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such leagues, with members often in their 30s and 40s, emphasize  
nonviolent play, with even a rough hip check frequently taboo. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, former University of Michigan hockey player Chris Fox  
was sentenced to three years of probation for deliberately swatting 
an opponent in the face with a hockey stick during an adult-league 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	In Fields' case, he was arrested at the arena moments after the  
Feb. 5 game when a player called police. 
</P>
<P>
	Fields and Barr had fought earlier in the game, and both served  
four-minute penalties. When they returned to the ice, they bumped 
into each other again. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Barr testified that his back was turned when he felt  
a sharp pain in his face. Barr's teammate, Terry Adam, said he saw 
Fields come up behind Barr, wrap his arms around Barr's face and 
then pull away. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a scuffle, Adam testified, and ``when Jim got up, his  
face was cut and bleeding very badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barr testified he didn't realize until after the fight that  
Fields had a prosthesis, with which he was fitted after losing his 
left arm in a car crash years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam also said he didn't notice it until Fields skated off the  
ice after the fight and held up his gloves to the opposing bench to 
reveal the metal poking through. 
</P>
<P>
	``He turned to the bench and said, `Who's next?,''' Adam said.  
Another witness said he didn't hear Fields make the comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Adam: ``If Jim had lost a fight to a man with two fists, we  
wouldn't be where we are today.''

<HEADLINE> Pro-Life Tag Angers Bush Opponents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The decision by the nation's largest  
anti-abortion group to certify George W. Bush as ``pro-life'' has 
angered some abortion opponents who say the Texas governor does not 
deserve the label. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, early favorite for the Republican presidential nomination  
in 2000, supports abortion, in all three trimesters, in cases of 
rape, incest or threat to the mother's life. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Right to Life Committee last week urged GOP  
presidential contenders who oppose abortion not to attack each 
other but instead focus on Vice President Al Gore, the likely 
Democratic nominee and an abortion rights supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way his stance can be described as pro-life,''  
said Colleen Parro, director of the Republican National Coalition 
for Life, a Dallas-based group organized by conservative activist 
Phyllis Schlafly. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRLC, with 3,000 chapters nationwide, issued a statement to  
clarify what it said was a misunderstanding about Bush's position 
on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush's position would eliminate about 98 percent of  
all abortions currently being performed, and we would certainly 
regard that as a pro-life position,'' said Carol Tobias, head of 
NRLC's political action committee. ``We are not going to fight with 
someone who agrees with us on 98 percent of the cases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One GOP candidate, Gary Bauer, has attacked Bush's abortion  
stand as vague. ``I don't see how a 'compassionate conservative' 
can be ambiguous about protecting unborn children,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush describes himself a ``pro-life person'' and has said he  
would back a constitutional amendment to ban most abortions if 
there were support for passage. Until then, he believes the country 
should focus on ways to reduce the number of abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	A Bush spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker, said the governor  
``appreciates the National Right to Life leadership recognizing his 
commitment to life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Parro said the group's statement was ``tantamount to an  
endorsement,'' while others accused the NRLC of political 
expediency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they realize the Republican Party would rather have  
George W. Bush at the top of the ticket than anybody else,'' said 
Patrick Mooney, chairman of the American Right to Life political 
action committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tobias responded: ``That's ludicrous.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said he doubted Bush would gain at the expense of other  
Republican candidates, some of whom oppose abortion in all cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nominee of this party is going to have to make clear what  
their views are on a whole host of issues from the sanctity of life 
to China,'' said Bauer, a national co-chair of the Republican 
National Coalition for Life. 
</P>
<P>
	``And no one is going to get away with saying `That's a  
hypothetical question' or `We can't do anything until hearts are 
changed,''' he said, repeating Bush's earlier comments on abortion.

<HEADLINE> Temple's Chaney Wary of Duke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Temple coach John Chaney's press  
conference on Saturday could have doubled as an audition for a 
stand-up routine if he ever gets out of coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	Evaluating the Owls' depth compared to No. 1 Duke in the East  
Regional final at the Continental Airlines Arena, Chaney said: 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there is another team in the country that has  
the ability of the Duke team,'' he said. ``In all my years I have 
rarely seen a team that can go to the bench and get an apple for an 
apple. When we go to the bench we might take away an apple and 
bring a lemon in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On getting to the Final Four for the first time after 27 years  
of coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly what a great feeling it would be,'' Chaney said.  
``I'd have all the peanut butter I wanted my whole life and I'd 
have the bicycle I never got. It would be a very happy day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When told of Chaney's comment on the depth of his team, Duke  
coach Mike Krzyzewski laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can tell (comedian Bill) Cosby's been around giving him a  
few jokes for his press conferences,'' Krzyzewski said of Cosby, a 
Temple product who was at the arena on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DUKE's ROAD:* Duke's regional road to the Final Four has been  
the fifth easiest since the NCAA tournament expanded to a 64-team 
field in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-ranked Blue Devils have beaten 16th seeded Florida A&AMP;M,  
eighth-seeded Tulsa, 12th seeded Southwest Missouri State and they 
will face sixth-seeded Temple on Sunday at the Continental Airlines 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The easiest road to the Final Four was the one UNLV took in 1990  
en route to the national title. The Runnin' Rebels beat No. 16 
Arkansas-Little Rock, No. 8 Ohio State, No. 12 Ball State and No. 
11 Loyola-Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski has won four previous regional finals  
at the Continental Airlines Arena, beating Navy in 1986, Temple in 
'88, Georgetown in '89 and Connecticut in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney is 0-for-3 in regional finals, losing to Duke here in 89,  
North Carolina here in '91 and Michigan in Seattle in '93. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BRAND INJURY:* Duke center Elton Brand practiced on Saturday  
with his left wrist taped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I drove baseline and missed a layup with about 10 minutes left  
in the first half,'' he said of Friday night's injury sustained 
against Southwest Missouri State. ``I was maybe pushed a little bit 
and fell down on my left wrist. It's not a major injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PRICE OF FINAL FOUR:* Temple senior guard Rasheed Brokenborough  
knows the price of going to the Final Four and it's steep. 
</P>
<P>
	He had to pay for his education during his freshman year because  
he did not meet NCAA requirements for playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm leaving school with a pretty big debt,'' said  
Brokenborough who will graduate on time despite have three majors. 
``If I wasn't a college athlete there would have been no way I 
could have afforded college. My family couldn't pay for me to go to 
college. I'm going to have to find a way to get out of it (debt).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brokenborough did not know how much money he would owe after  
school. He knows some of the loans he took will have to be paid off 
starting in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to get some revenue by then,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HIGHER MATH:* Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski begged to differ with  
those who felt he could split his team in two and have two great 
sides, noting he only has nine scholarship players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our second team would not advance very far in the NCAA  
tournament,'' Krzyzewski said. ``I would bet against it if I was 
not opposed to gambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski said the Blue Devils create the impression they have  
waves of players because they play eight guys. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year we were more wavy, we had 11 guys and we substituted  
a lot more,'' Krzyzewski said. ``This year we are a little more 
solid, but we're deep. We're not wavy, we're deep. That would be my 
interpretation of my basketball team.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ZONES:* While everyone says Temple and John Chaney employ a 2-3  
zone, his players say otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our main defense is called `Rover,''' senior guard Rasheed  
Brokenborough said. ``That's the defense we play the whole game. 
It's kind of confusing because teams really don't know exactly what 
we're in. Some think we're in a 2-3 and we're not, and some times 
they think we're in a 3-2 or a 1-3-1 and we're not. Coach has a 
ways of disguising the defense where it confuses teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brokenborough said the only time the Owls play a 2-3 is when  
opponents are having success from 3-point range.

<HEADLINE> Man Acquitted of Four Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A man who admitted he gunned down four people  
after one of them banged on his front door in the middle of the 
night and punched him in the chest has been acquitted of capital 
murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Narit Burin ``Archie'' Bunchien, 22, chased the visitor 70 feet  
down his driveway and pumped four to seven bullets into each of the 
victims, including a 15-year-old girl, outside his home in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they had no reason to doubt that Bunchien  
feared for his life. But they contended his behavior was not 
self-defense because of the number of victims and the nature of 
their wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, a jury cleared Bunchien. He had been held in Harris  
County Jail for more than two years while awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the victims, An Phong Ngoc ``Nick'' Nguyen, 21, had come  
pounding on Bunchien's door at 3 a.m., demanding that he apologize 
for jokingly calling the girl a prostitute weeks earlier, according 
to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Bunchien said he agreed to apologize but that Nguyen hit him in  
the head anyway. The others were outside the home near a car. 
</P>
<P>
	Bunchien pulled a pistol and chased Nguyen. Nguyen called to the  
girl to get a gun, according to Bunchien. Two young men who had 
gotten out of the car jumped back in, and Nguyen followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bunchien emptied his pistol into the four. None was armed, and  
no weapon was found in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury foreman was quoted anonymously by the Houston Chronicle  
as saying he agreed with defense attorney Dick DeGuerin that 
anybody who pounds on someone's door at 3 a.m. is ``up to no 
good.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Official, Wife Slain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif. (AP) -- Investigators say they have few  
leads in the shooting deaths of a Los Angeles County court 
commissioner and his wife, who were slain outside their home in 
this affluent community. 
</P>
<P>
	H. George Taylor, 68, was killed as he pulled his Mercedes-Benz  
into his driveway Thursday. His wife, identified as Lynda by 
neighbors, was found in her bathrobe on the floor of the garage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly at this point, it could be anything,'' said Chip  
Patterson, a San Bernardino County Sheriff's spokesman. ``There was 
no note left, nothing left to indicate the motive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators didn't believe anything was taken from the home,  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Larry Waggoner said he ran to the Taylor house after  
hearing about five shots. The area is usually quiet, neighbor Betty 
Pinkerton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then you have a double murder. It is disconcerting,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor became a commissioner in March 1986. Court commissioners  
hear divorce, custody and estate cases, as judges do. The 
difference is that commissioners are hired by the court and preside 
over a case only if all parties agree to the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rancho Cucamonga is about 50 miles east of Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Golf Star Ballesteros To Be Honored  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. (AP) -- A crystal cone in the World Golf Hall  
of Fame will soon contain Seve Ballesteros' signature, image and 
career highlights. 
</P>
<P>
	He won the British Open three times and the Masters twice,  
becoming the youngest man to wear the green jacket until Tiger 
Woods. Ballesteros won 78 tournaments around the world, led the 
European tour money list six times and was on nine Ryder Cup teams, 
the last as the winning captain. 
</P>
<P>
	But sheer numbers tell only half the story of the stylish  
Spaniard with the charisma of Arnold Palmer and an unequaled 
imagination. With a mighty slash of a swing, he can find trouble in 
just about every corner of the course. With brilliant touch and 
shots only he can visualize, Ballesteros always seems to find a way 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a man who got into trouble. Only for Seve, there was no  
such thing as trouble,'' Gary Player said. ``He could manufacture 
shots like a genius. This man, from 100 yards in, had as good a 
touch as anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Ballesteros will be inducted into the Hall of Fame,  
along with Amy Alcott of the LPGA Tour and the late Lloyd Mangrum, 
who won two Purple Hearts in World War II and the U.S. Open in 
1946. Their crystal cones will be on display with those of the 
other 72 members of the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcott will be the first woman inducted since Betsy King in  
1995. Some felt King might have been the last to get in from the 
LPGA had it not revamped its stringent criteria by going to a 
points system. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcott, whose 29 victories include five major championships, and  
Beth Daniel easily qualified when the new requirements were 
approved last month. Daniel will be inducted next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mangrum was elected in October with the minimum 75 percent of  
votes from a panel of golf writers, dignitaries and Hall of Fame 
members. One of the coolest customers in golf but toughened by an 
Army career that took him to Omaha Beach on D-Day, the Texan won 36 
times. He retired after the 1962 season and died in 1973 following 
his 12th heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballesteros was elected last year on the international ballot  
along with Nick Faldo. He deferred his induction until Monday 
because of prior commitments, although he was said to be upset that 
the PGA Tour failed to invite him to The Players Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be in the field next week on the Stadium Course of the  
TPC at Sawgrass, although past form indicates it might be nothing 
more than a ceremonial appearance. Ballesteros last won in 1995, at 
the Peugeot Open in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	The induction will be more about the celebration of a man who  
meant as much to European golf as Palmer meant to the United 
States, and whose desire to beat the U.S. helped turn the Ryder Cup 
into the biggest event in golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``Arnold Palmer did a lot for the game of golf, not only in  
America but all over the world,'' Ballesteros said. ``If people 
compare me to him ... that's a great honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ernie Els found another comparison to Ballesteros, the first  
European player to take his game around the globe and an Open 
champion in nine countries on three continents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when he came down to South Africa. It was like the  
Beatles,'' Els said. ``He was the biggest attraction in golf. He 
put us on the map, those who play golf worldwide, because he won 
all over the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That also describes Ballesteros' game. He's been in bunkers and  
the rough, in the trees and even a parking lot. He's been all over 
the map but always looks right at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He invented shots around the green,'' Jack Nicklaus said.  
``You don't find many big hitters like him with that kind of 
imagination and touch around the green. He's been a big inspiration 
to golf in continental Europe, more than anyone has. He's been good 
for the game of golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight reel of Ballesteros could show any number of  
shots, not many from the short grass of the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps his most famous came in the 1979 British Open at Royal  
Lytham &AMP; St. Annes, when his drive ended up in a parking lot. He 
had a car moved, rifled his approach into the green and made birdie 
to clinch the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Irritated by American comments that he was more lucky than good  
-- the ``Car Park Champion'' was one reference -- Ballesteros came to 
the Masters the following year and dominated Augusta National in a 
way he says was ``pretty similar'' to what Woods did in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He took a seven-stroke lead into the final round and it swelled  
to 10 strokes before he started spraying the ball all over Augusta 
and won by four. Still, his 23 birdies that week remain a record. 
</P>
<P>
	But for all the heroics of Ballesteros, his intensity in the  
Ryder Cup may be his legacy. He was the spiritual leader of the 
team for two decades, from a player who accounted for 20 points in 
37 matches, to a captain who seemed to will his team to victory 
without playing a shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``His desire to beat the Americans was paramount, and probably  
the reason they beat us,'' Tom Watson said. ``The Ryder Cup became 
the focus of world golf, and Seve was right there as the leader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mangrum won only one major championship in a career interrupted  
by World War II. He was awarded his Purple Hearts for wounds in his 
leg, chin and shoulder, and the experience served him well when he 
returned to golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't suppose that any of the pro or amateur golfers who  
were combat soldiers, Marines or sailors will soon be able to think 
of a three-putt green as one of the bad troubles in life,'' Mangrum 
said after the war. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the 1990s, Alcott was the example of why the LPGA  
Hall of Fame was the toughest in sports to enter. It required 40 
wins and no majors, 35 wins and one major or 30 wins and two 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Only nine women have won more majors than Alcott, and all of  
them are in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The new system requires 27 points -- two points are awarded for  
majors, one point each for a victory, Vare Trophy for lowest 
average score or player-of-the-year honor. Alcott would have 
qualified 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it was worth the wait.  
</P>
<P>
	``It validates me in the world of golf,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Alford Now Pushing Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Steve Alford grew up respecting defense. So the sideline  
chestbumps with his players are just as enthusiastic when his team 
makes a steal as when it nails a 3-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
	When long-shot Southwest Missouri State shook up all the NCAA  
tournament brackets by holding Wisconsin to 32 points, then beating 
Tennessee by 30, Alford discarded zones and man-to-man defense to 
try something a little different. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Monday,'' he said, ``we played Wiffleball.''  
</P>
<P>
	It seemed a trifle unusual for a team at this stage. Alford  
didn't think so, any more than he thinks it's strange for him to 
have his father, Sam, working as one of his assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford follows his own heart when it comes to coaching  
basketball. He has taken something from everyone he's played for -- 
his father in high school, Bob Knight at Indiana, John MacLeod and 
Don Nelson in the NBA -- and turned it into a pretty attractive 
package, one that has a number of big-time programs looking at him. 
</P>
<P>
	And why not? He's young. He's energetic. And he's devoted to the  
game, devoted enough to have started at the bottom in college 
coaching -- Division III with no scholarships and recruiting budgets 
to match. 
</P>
<P>
	After being cut by the Sacramento Kings in 1991, Alford went  
home to Indiana and started working as a volunteer high school 
coach for his father. ``When you're used to an NBA salary, 
volunteering doesn't bode very well,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was then that Manchester (Ind.) College called.  
</P>
<P>
	Alford wasn't sure about the opportunity, but his father helped  
him make up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have two options,'' Sam Alford told his son. ``Work for me  
for free or work for Manchester and get paid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Put in those terms, the choice was simple and a coaching career  
began for this basketball lifer, who remembered how, when he was in 
grade school, his mother used to take him to every free-throw 
shooting contest she could find. 
</P>
<P>
	Manchester had only five winning seasons in its history, so  
Alford had nothing to lose. He inherited a team that was 0-8 at 
midseason and a year later had it at 20-8 with a new logo, improved 
marketing and a fresh attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford stayed for four years, going 31-1 in his final season.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was an opportunity to learn as a coach and I learned a  
great deal,'' he said of the Manchester years. ``It helped me grow 
as a coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Alford moved up to Division I and Southwest Missouri State,  
he wanted to bring his father along as an assistant. Sam Alford had 
the right credentials, including 300 wins in 20 years at New Castle 
Chrysler High School. 
</P>
<P>
	The transition was easy for Alford's father. ``It was more  
nerve-wracking watching him play from the stands than it is on the 
bench,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the head coach had a wedge. ``If he wanted to see his  
grand-kids, he had to come along,'' Steve Alford said. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement has worked out well.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of fun going to work together and going home  
together,'' the younger Alford said. ``Sharing the wins and the 
losses, it's been an incredible experience. It's special. He'll 
come up with things I'm already thinking. He really, really enjoys 
camp. I really enjoy camp. The difference is an extra `really.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Alford has been consistent. His teams won 78 games in four years  
at Manchester and 78 games in four years at Southwest Missouri 
State. Is it time to move on? He's not saying. Not now. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he came up with the Wiffleball practice.  
</P>
<P>
	In some circles, this would be considered outrageous. Here were  
the Bears, breathing in the heady air of the Sweet 16 and instead 
of practicing Xs and Os, Alford had them fooling around. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did something special,'' he said. ``We wanted to relax  
and enjoy each other after what we had done in the first two 
rounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So how did the Wiffleball game come out?  
</P>
<P>
	``Team Sweet had 12 and Team 16 had eight,'' Alford said. ``I  
was on Team 16. Our trainer did a poor job pitching and my dad 
relieved and wasn't much better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Practicing Wiffleball didn't help the Bears for their Sweet 16  
game against Duke. The Blue Devils beat Southwest Missouri State 
78-61, ending the Bears' dream season.

<HEADLINE> Sather Shakes Up Oilers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Edmonton Oilers general manager Glen  
Sather hinted last week that he would make some changes if his team 
continued to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	Sather delivered Saturday, completing a seven-player deal with  
the Chicago Blackhawks and acquiring starting goaltender Tommy Salo 
from the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers, battling Calgary for the eighth and final playoff  
spot in the NHL's Western Conference, were winless in six games 
entering Saturday's home game against the Vancouver Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a major shakeup for the team and it is unfortunate to do  
it at this time of the year, but we felt we needed to inject some 
life into the club,'' Sather said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sather sent defenseman Boris Mironov, forward Dean McAmmond and  
prospect Jonas Elofsson to the Blackhawks for center Chad Kilger, 
left wings Daniel Cleary and Ethan Moreau and defenseman Christian 
Laflamme. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have enough depth up front that we can afford to do  
something like this,'' Blackhawks general manager Bob Murray told 
WMAQ-AM in Chicago. ``We're giving up a lot of young potential in 
this deal and I just felt we were deep enough that the time was now 
to do something with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray is high on Mironov.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good player,'' he said. ``He plays everywhere. He's  
very good offensively, and that's something I've been looking for 
because we haven't had that type of player in a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray is familiar with McAmmond, who was the Blackhawks' top  
draft choice in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helped that I knew Dean,'' Murray said. ``Dean can skate  
and he can handle the puck, and he's turned into a good penalty 
killer. I've always liked the kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall on the trade, Murray said, ``We have toughness, we have  
the brawn. We just have to get a little speed and intelligence to 
go with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonton got Salo from the Islanders for wing Mats Lindgren and  
an eighth-round pick in this year's entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	In Salo, the Oilers finally obtained the No. 1 goaltender  
they've been seeking since losing Curtis Joseph to Toronto via free 
agency last summer. Salo, who was miffed when New York acquired 
Felix Potvin earlier this season, should bring stability in goal 
for the Oilers, who entered the season using Bob Essensa and 
Mikhail Shtalenkov in goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Shtalenkov was shipped to Phoenix last week, while Essensa  
watched as rookie Steve Passmore was called up from the AHL's 
Hamilton Bulldogs last month and played a majority of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Salo was 17-26-7 with the Islanders with a 2.62 goals-against  
average and a .904 save percentage. Lindgren had five goals and 12 
assists in 48 games with the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kilger, Moreau and Cleary are all former first-round draft  
picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Kilger had 14 goals and 11 assists in 64 games with Chicago.  
Moreau had nine goals and six assists in 66 games. Cleary had split 
this season between Chicago and its AHL affiliate in Portland. He 
had four goals and five assists in 35 games with the Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Laflamme had 70 penalty minutes with two goals and 11 assists in  
62 games. Mironov is the key to the deal for the Blackhawks. The 
offensive defenseman was highly soughtr by several teams around the 
league. He had 11 goals and 29 assists in 63 games. 
</P>
<P>
	McAmmond was traded by Chicago to Edmonton in 1993. He had nine  
goals and 16 assists in 65 games this season. Elofsson is playing 
with Farjestad in Sweden this season.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Senator Still Going Strong at 96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Once, after a frustrating day of running the  
place, Sen. Mike Mansfield was heard to observe: ``You can do 
anything in the Senate, provided you have the patience and live 
long enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mansfield's patience is legendary.  
</P>
<P>
	And he just turned 96.  
</P>
<P>
	He met his own tests. He served as Senate majority leader longer  
than anyone else. After retiring from the Senate in 1976, he became 
U.S. ambassador to Japan for 12 years. Since retiring, again, he 
has been a senior adviser on Asian affairs to Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., 
the investment firm. He's in the office five days a week after a 
brisk morning walk and home by midafternoon to be with Maureen, his 
wife of 66 years, whom he credits for all of it, as the partner who 
pushed him from dropout to college professor to Congress as a 
Democrat from Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, with the Montana Legislature considering a Mansfield  
statue at the state Capitol in Helena, he said he wasn't interested 
in it, unless it is of both Mansfields. She got him where he is and 
she deserves the credit, Mansfield said over a birthday lunch last 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the U.S. Capitol, a reception room just off the Senate floor  
was named the Mansfield Room in his honor the year after he left 
Congress, ending his 16 years as majority leader. He rarely returns 
to the Capitol, although his office is only seven blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
	No need, Mansfield always said. When it was time to go, it was  
best to be gone. 
</P>
<P>
	His tenure as leader spanned the tumultuous years of civil  
rights demonstrations and legislation, of the escalating war in 
Vietnam, of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society and Richard Nixon's 
downfall in Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mansfield played a major role in all those issues, but he  
ventures no list of achievements and long ago rejected the idea of 
writing a memoir. He said that's up to historians and that he 
doubted they would say much of him. 
</P>
<P>
	He has that wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	In the history of the Senate, the years of his leadership are  
described as ``Mike Mansfield's Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A book entitled ``Mike Mansfield, Majority Leader: A Different  
Kind of Senate,'' is being published this spring. Another, on his 
role in U.S. policy toward Asia, in a year or so. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the one issue that gets him talking past the terse  
comments that were his trademark in the Senate years. China policy, 
for example, which he says should be handled issue by issue, not by 
tying trade, human rights, strategic concerns and now alleged 
nuclear espionage into a single package. 
</P>
<P>
	But he doubts it will be pried apart and figures that the  
nuclear spying allegations will be a political issue without 
waiting for facts on what really happened. 
</P>
<P>
	While Mansfield is a Democrat, he reached beyond party lines.  
</P>
<P>
	In his book, Francis R. Valeo, who was secretary of the Senate  
while Mansfield was the leader, recalls the senator's unwavering 
advice to Johnson against expanding the U.S. role in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1968, Mansfield, asked his advice, told Johnson not to fill a  
military request for 200,000 more troops, saying the way out of 
Vietnam was negotiation, not escalation. 
</P>
<P>
	Valeo recounts what followed:  
</P>
<P>
	``As he was going out the door, Johnson called after him: 'I  
would appreciate some support from my majority leader.' Mansfield 
turned and replied: 'Mr. President, I'm not your majority leader. 
I'm the Senate's majority leader.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	He had, of course, succeeded Johnson in that role. But he saw it  
differently. Valeo writes that Mansfield inherited a split 
Democratic Party ``masquerading as a majority'' in a Senate marked 
by suspicion and mistrust, sown by Johnson's way of playing 
factions and feeding internal ambitions to get things done his way. 
</P>
<P>
	Mansfield's style was different, a quiet, patient effort to  
unite his majority and to restore the trust that could bind a deal, 
as on the landmark civil rights legislation that could not have 
passed without an alliance with Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Even now, Mansfield speaks of the Senate with a special  
resonance in his voice. As he did in praising the way the 
impeachment trial was conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the Senate at its best,'' he pronounced. From Mike  
Mansfield, there is no higher praise. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Espionage at Other Labs Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says he knows of no alleged  
espionage at U.S. nuclear weapons labs during his administration, 
but government officials are looking into at least two cases that 
may involve security breaches on his watch. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Friday, Clinton said his administration  
responded quickly to close security gaps after it learned of 
alleged espionage that occurred in the late 1980s. He has 
repeatedly emphasized that those incidents -- if they indeed 
occurred -- date to the Reagan administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the best of my knowledge, no one has said anything to me  
about any espionage which occurred by the Chinese against the labs 
during my presidency,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The main focus is on a case involving a Taiwanese-born scientist  
who worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and was 
suspected of leaking information about the W-88 nuclear warhead to 
China during the Reagan administration. He was fired this month but 
has not been charged with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Energy Department is reviewing whether scientists at  
other U.S nuclear weapons labs may have disclosed sensitive neutron 
bomb and electromagnetic pulse technology to China, several 
government officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, cautioned  
that many of the incidents being examined may never result in 
criminal charges and many allegations have already been dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	In closed-door briefings on Capitol Hill over the past week, key  
lawmakers were told of the expanding investigations, including one 
case of suspected espionage at the Argonne National Laboratory, 
which has facilities in Illinois and Idaho, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional sources said the Argonne probe involves the  
possible disclosure to China of neutron bomb technology by an 
Asian-American scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Argonne case involves a nuclear lab safety expert who does  
not work on weapons technology, and federal law enforcement 
investigators found no evidence of espionage, according to two 
senior law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The separate allegation that electromagnetic pulse technology  
was given to China also collapsed when investigated, a senior law 
enforcement official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the law enforcement community there is sharp skepticism  
about the seriousness of the emerging cases. Officials said the 
only serious case to arise from a welter of allegations was the Los 
Alamos matter. 
</P>
<P>
	One senior law enforcement official said the Energy Department  
has referred dozens of tips to the FBI about possible security 
lapses, but ``99.9 percent of them turn out not to be criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional officials said the Argonne case is believed to  
have begun before Clinton took office, but investigators are 
checking into whether the loss of sensitive data may have continued 
into his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, sharply critical of Clinton's response to the Los  
Alamos case from the 1980s, are eager to find examples of alleged 
espionage during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference, Clinton also rejected accusations by GOP  
critics that he was slow to respond to the Chinese espionage 
allegations because of campaign contributions allegedly flowing 
from Asian sources to the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can say categorically that it never crossed my mind that I  
should not disclose some inquiry being undertaken by the United 
States government for reasons of commercial or other gain. That is 
not true,'' the president said. ``If we think we have got a 
security problem, we ought to fix it.'' He added: ``Plainly, the 
security was too lax for years and years and years at the labs. And 
a lot of important changes have been made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China has repeatedly denied any spying at the nuclear labs.  
</P>
<P>
	One senior congressional official said the unidentified Argonne  
employee has been under clandestine monitoring as 
counterintelligence officials try to develop their suspicions into 
a solid case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Argonne lab, oldest of the nation's nuclear research  
facilities, is primarily devoted to pure scientific research. But 
weapons labs such as Sandia and Los Alamos conduct weapons-related 
work at Argonne facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The lab is run by the University of Chicago under contract with  
the Department of Energy. The research center is about 25 miles 
southwest of Chicago, but some of its key research infrastructure, 
including a neutron accelerator, is at a site in the Snake River 
Valley west of Idaho Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	The neutron bomb, developed and deployed late in the Cold War,  
was designed to kill enemy forces and knock out electronics without 
doing extensive physical damage or creating an overwhelming fallout 
cloud. The weapons are no longer deployed.

Saturday over breakfast at the home of former state Labor Secretary

	OPEC Expected To OK Production Cuts  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Saudi Arabia and other key OPEC members, which  
recently agreed to slash oil production by 2 million barrels a day, 
must find a way to back up their bold words with action to keep 
crude prices climbing. Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries, meeting Tuesday in Vienna, Austria, will be 
under pressure to honor the commitment if they are to end the 
global oil glut that has sent prices plunging to a 12-year low. The 
conference is something of an anticlimax, however, since Saudi 
Arabia and other members announced March 12 after a meeting in the 
Netherlands that they had agreed with two non-OPEC exporters to 
slash production.

Chelsea's 12-day trip to North Africa got off to a rocky start 
Saturday, including an engine fire. The planned departure from 
Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland was delayed an hour 
because the Air Force Boeing 707 jetliner carrying the president's 
wife and daughter, staff aides and journalists was found to be 
overweight with cargo and luggage. Then as the plane raced down the

victory over the Florida Panthers. Mattias Norstrom ended a 64-game 
goal drought and Russ Courtnall scored on a breakaway for the 
Kings, who have won four of their last five games and climbed 
within three points of idle Calgary for the last Western Conference 
post-season berth.
