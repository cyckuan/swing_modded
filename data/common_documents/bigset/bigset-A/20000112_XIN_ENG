<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Open New Consulate-General in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday gave
the go-ahead for Cambodia to open a new consulate-general in the
northeastern Thai province of Sa Kaew, a Government House press
release said.
</P>
<P>
The plan was initially discussed at the second Thai-Cambodian
Joint Commission meeting in March 1997 which was aimed at
expanding cooperation on trade, tourism and cultural ties along
the common border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Originally, Cambodia wanted to set up consulate-general offices
in three provinces, but the Thai government only approved the
current one.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's National Security Council and its related agencies
reportedly delayed the approval for the Cambodian consulate-
general's office last year for fear it would only benefit casino
operations in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Gambling in casinos on the Cambodian side of the border has
become popular among some Thais.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has assured that the new consulate-general's office
would not encourage gambling.
</P>
<P>
In return for allowing the opening of the Cambodian consulate-
general, Bangkok has asked Phnom Penh to give approval for opening
a Thai office in the western Cambodian city of Battambang, when
the Thai government "can afford the budget," the press release
said.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Khmer Rouge Draft Law to Be Revised Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia will again revise
some points of a draft law on trial of former Khmer Rouge leaders,
Minister of Cabinet Sok An said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The draft law has already been approved by the Cambodian
cabinet on January 6.
</P>
<P>
The decision to revise the draft law was announced by Sok An
after a meeting between Prime Minister Hun Sen and visiting
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen told Obuchi during the two-hour meeting that he would
consider having co-Investigating Judges composed of both foreign
and Cambodian judges. "We will make some amendment. It's very
important," Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
The current version of the draft law spells out that the
Investigating Judges and the reserve Investigating Judges shall be
appointed by the Supreme Council of the Magistracy among the
Cambodian professional judges.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi expressed his appreciation for the efforts made by the
Cambodian government in this regard and said Japan will cooperate
with the international community on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also hoped the Cambodian government will have good
cooperation with the United Nations and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Sok An said Cambodia plans to invite an experts' team from the
U.N. Secretariat to Phnom Penh to continue negotiations on the
draft law and to listen to the explanation by Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi arrived here Monday for a three-day official visit. It
is the first visit to Cambodia by a Japanese prime minister in 43
years.

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy Expected to Grow 4.4 Pct in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Thai economy is expected to
grow 4.4 percent in the year 2000 with the expansion of export,
investment and private consumption, the National Economic and
Social Development Board of Thailand said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government's planning agency said in a report submitted to
the Thai cabinet at its weekly meeting that it expects the
inflation rate in 2000 to climb to two percent from 0.3 percent in
1999.
</P>
<P>
The interest rates in 2000 will be at the same level as 1999.
The deposit rates of Thai banks stand at 2.75 percent now and
minimum lending rates range from 8.25 to eight percent, both the
lowest levels in decades.
</P>
<P>
The liquidity situation in the financial sector this year will
be eased and the export will grow about 6.5 percent, the board
said.
</P>
<P>
It said the gross domestic products (GDP) of Thailand in the
first three quarters of 1999 indicated that the growth rate for
the whole year would be 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign reserve has accumulated to 32 to 34
billion U.S. dollars, or equal to seven to eight months of import
volume.
</P>
<P>
However, a report submitted by Bank of Thailand to the cabinet
said the Thai economy in 2000 will only grow four percent, with
manufacturing expanding by 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank predicts that the non-agricultural sector will
expand by 4.3 percent and the agricultural sector will grow by 2.1
percent, the same rate as 1999.
</P>
<P>
It said the private sector will play a more important role in
stimulating the economy while public spending will drop as the
budget deficit will be cut from 5.5 percent of GDP to five percent.

<HEADLINE> Matthaeus's Career Ends at End of Year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- 39-year-old german famous
footballer Lothar Matthaueus hints Tuesday he would end his longer
football career at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
This veteran sweeper said to reporters: "The year 2000 may be
my last as a player."
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that this outstanding football player
with brilliant feats determined a date for his possible retirement.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s Matthaeus began his professional career at
Borussia moenchengladbach, and then he was transfered to Bayern
Munich, the excellent football club in Germany that had won
championship of Bundesliga and DFB-Cup many times, in the late
1980s and the early 1990s Matthaeus went to Italy and played for
Inter Milan.
</P>
<P>
As captain Matthaeus had won the champion title of World Cup in
Italy in the summer of 1990. During a quite long period of 1990s
he returned to Bayern Munich and won the championship of
Bundesliga and DFB-Cup for several times.
</P>
<P>
Originally he calculates to leave Bayern Munich in March for
the New York/New Jersey MetroStars.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Power Generating Capacity Ranks 20th Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran's electricity generating
capacity has reached 25,500 megawatts, ranking the 20th in the
world, an official from the Iranian Power Generation and
Distribution Company announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The company's Director General of the Public Relations Office of
Akbar Nematollahi said that over 106 billion kilowatts-hour of
electricity have been generated in the country since the beginning
of the current Iranian calendar year, which ends on March 20.
</P>
<P>
The official said that 600,000 new subscribers were added to the
network during this Iranian year and electricity subscription has
increased by 7.5 percent on average annually, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Nematollahi said that currently about 200 megawatts of
electricity are exported to Armenia, Azerbaijan and Turkey, earning
some 30 million U.S. dollars for the country annually.
</P>
<P>
The generation capacity of thermal and hydro-electric power
stations under construction is about 15,000 megawatts, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran's electricity output reached 102 billion kilowatts-hour
last Iranian year with its power generating capacity at 25,000
megawatts.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Energy Minister for Electricity Affairs Mohammad
Mallaki said last April that the country's electricity output would
increase to 108 billion kilowatts-hour in the current Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Mallaki said that the country needs an
investment of some 8,000 billion rials (about 2.67 billion dollars)
to boost its electricity sector in the coming Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
He said that 4,000 billion rials (about 1.33 billion dollars)
should be invested for generation, 2,300 billion rials (about 0.77
billion dollars) for transmission and over 1,700 billion rials
(about 0.57 billion dollars) for distribution of power in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
By the next summer an extra 725 megawatts of electricity will be
generated by new power stations and connected to the national grid,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President to Visit Georgia Later This Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel will pay an official visit to Georgia on January 14-15 at
the invitation of Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, Turkish
Foreign Ministry announced here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Demirel will exchange views with his Georgian counterpart on
regional and international issues of mutual concern and look into
ways to further strengthen bilateral and regional economic
cooperation, said the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The visit is regarded as part of Turkey's new year diplomatic
drive in the Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Demirel hosted Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliyev in
Ankara. The two leaders focused their discussions on the security
in the region.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Tbilisi, Demirel is expected to raise the
issue of the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline project, for which Azerbaijan has
expressed complaints about the delays on the part of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan signed an agreement in Istanbul
last November to establish a 1,730-kilometer pipeline running from
Baku, Azerbaijan, to Ceyhan, Turkey. The 2.4-billion-U.S.-dollar
project is expected to be completed by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Azerbaijan, two of the host countries for the
pipeline, have already concluded agreements with relative companies
regarding their part of the pipeline construction work whereas
Georgia has yet to complete its talks with the companies.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the Georgian authorities and the companies
have centered on tariffs, land-acquisition and liability issues.
</P>
<P>
The most complicated issue is liabilities, in which oil
companies demand that Georgia be responsible for the safety of the
section of pipeline passing through Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Tbilisi, on the other hand, has asked the companies to share
some of the burdens, citing the country's vulnerability.

<HEADLINE> Iran Kills 3 MKO Members near Border with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian forces killed three
members of the outlawed Mujahedin Khalq Organization (MKO)
Wednesday evening when they were trying to escape into Iraq, the
Intelligence Ministry announced.
</P>
<P>
The MKO members were surrounded and then killed by the military,
security and intelligence forces as they were fleeing the country,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. But the ministry did not
mention where they were netted.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the three were responsible for the recent
armed attack on the Iranian city of Ilam in the border province of
Ilam, in which three Iranian civilians were killed and five others
injured.
</P>
<P>
The MKO members had fired three mortars from a village into
residential areas in Ilam city Saturday night and opened fire when
they were chased by local people, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Iran celebrated the Eide Fitr Saturday to mark the end of the
Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, a famous political-military group which fought against
the former shah's regime, was outlawed in 1981 and sought shelter
in rivaling Iraq and set up bases there following wranglings with
the post-Islamic revolution government dominated by clerics.
</P>
<P>
Labeled by the Iranian government as a "terrorist group," the
MKO has launched cross-border attacks against Iranian targets in
recent years, including assassinating senior Iranian officials.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Supports Azerbaijan, Armenia to Improve Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkey expressed Wednesday its
support for its two rivaling neighbors, Azerbaijan and Armenia, to
improve ties, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his weekly press briefing, Deputy Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that "Turkey is ready to support the
decisions and positive steps that will be taken by Azerbaijan and
Armenia about the solution of the Upper Karabakh conflict."
</P>
<P>
"It is natural that the positive developments that will be
recorded in this issue will also have positive repercussions on the
relations between Turkey and Armenia," Atacanli added.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and Armenia have long been at odds over the
sovereignty of Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave in Azerbaijan populated
mostly by ethnic Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
Armed clashes erupted in 1994, which claimed about 7,000 lives
and produced hundreds of thousands refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The two countries reached a ceasefire agreement in 1994 with the
mediation of the international community. But bilateral talks on
the future of the disputed region have yet to produce any
substantial results.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Azerbaijan had recently made efforts to
ease its attitude toward Armenia. During his visit to Turkey last
week, Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliyev said that relations
between Turkey and Armenia and the opening of border crossing
between the two neighbors will not cause any problems for his
country.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem in his New Year statement
said that the Caucasus region would become a major concern of the
Turkish foreign policy.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Russia Likely to Ratify START II Before March 26 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
said Wednesday that Russia is expected to ratify the second stage
of Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty before the March 26
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
"This is quite possible," the minister said, referring to the
1993 treaty with the United States that calls for further cuts in
the two countries' nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ratification of the treaty, known as START II,
by the Russian State Duma, or lower house of parliament, "will be
one more serious factor discouraging the United States from
withdrawing from the 1972 ABM Treaty."
</P>
<P>
The ABM treaty bans systems designed to shoot enemy missiles
out of the sky, under the logic that allowing such defenses would
have tempted Cold War-era foes to stockpile ever larger arsenals
of nuclear missiles to pierce the enemy's umbrella.
</P>
<P>
Washington is pressing Russia to agree to amend the ABM Treaty
so it could deploy a proposed new missile defense system. Moscow
remains staunchly against the idea.
</P>
<P>
"We must ratify this document and we shall do so," Sergeyev
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that U.S. attempts to ditch the ABM Treaty "are being
resisted by Western European states, first of all France."
</P>
<P>
The West thinks that "these moves by the United States will
violate NATO's main principle of equal security of the states,"
the Interfax news agency quoted Sergeyev as saying.

WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday

"We think it's important that they do so," State Department

to co-chair the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said if Syria and Lebanon decided to attend the meeting,
it would be the first time since the 1991 Madrid talks as a way of
promoting peace and cooperation between Israel and Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt, Israel and the Palestinians had decided to

<HEADLINE> NAM Unveils High-Tech Agenda for 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- the U.S. National
Association of Manufacturers (NAM) unveiled Wednesday a high-tech
agenda to promote productivity, economic growth and innovation in
the 21st century, urging national policymakers and presidential
candidates to engage in a serious dialogue on forward-looking
technology issues to ensure America's continued economic vitality.
</P>
<P>
"Sustaining America's remarkable global leadership in growth,
productivity and technology should be a national priority," said
NAM President Jerry Jasinowski at a press conference, where he
unveiled the high-tech agenda targeting training and skills
strategies, global trade and investment, taxes and investment,
electronic-based business and commerce, technology policy and
policies that foster innovation.
</P>
<P>
According to the agenda, the NAM is committed to gaining
permanent Normal Trade Relations status for China and meaningful
Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturers have a huge stake in America's technological
success. Technology is the single biggest contributor to U.S.
economic growth, and manufacturing is the single biggest
contributor to technology," Jasinowski said.
</P>
<P>
He said that business-to-business electronic commerce is the
biggest opportunity for ensuring America's global technological
leadership, and the lack of skilled new workers is the biggest
threat.
</P>
<P>
"The dramatic increase in business-to-business commerce
applications, ranging from crating new exchange communities, to
streamlining the supply chain, to increased application of on-line
training, will continue to drive productivity and quality
improvements in American industry. The challenge is finding new
workers with adequate skills to keep up with all the rapid changes
in the workplace," he said.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Russian Army to Focus on Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said Wednesday that the country's armed forces would pay
special attention this year to the modernization of weapons and
hardware.
</P>
<P>
He said 153 types of weapons and hardware were expected to be
tested this year, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
When the current offensive against rebels in Chechnya was over,
a motorized infantry division would be deployed in the breakaway
republic on a permanent basis, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said major efforts would be pooled to upgrade the various
armed services, and to improve their interoperability, besides the
modernization of weapons and hardware.
</P>
<P>
Such measures were needed especially following the fighting in
the North Caucasus and the bombing of Yugoslavia last year by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, Sergeyev praised Acting President Vladimir
Putin's plans to strengthen the social guarantees for the
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
"This will have a decisive influence on the development of the
armed forces and on enhancing their combat readiness," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Speaking about the revival of Russia as a strong power, Putin
does not mean a comeback to an overstaffed army or the production
of a large amount of weapons," Interfax news agency quoted the
minister as saying.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rules Out Role in Mediating Chechnya Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asked if the United States may be a "middle man" between the
rebels in Chechnya and Moscow, State Department spokesman James
Rubin told a regular briefing: "We haven't seen ourselves in that
role."
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman added that "the good offices of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) can be
helpful in promoting a long-term solution to this crisis."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's so much a lacking of a mediator or an
interlocutor between the two so much as that we haven't gotten to
a point where discussions have begun on a meaningful political
solution. I mean, we think that's what the Russians ought to do,"
Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE has been involved in the discussions between Chechens
and Russians about developments in Chechnya. "So they have a past
history of being able to operate there. It's more a question of
will than mechanisms or procedural devices," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reaffirmed that the U.S. respect the territorial
integrity of Russia including Chechnya within Russia.
</P>
<P>
But he called both sides to respect the fundamental rights of
civilians in the fighting.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Telecommunications
Company (ZAMTEL) is expected to spend about 15 million U.S.
dollars by September this year in adopting Global Mobile Service
(GSM) cellular phone system.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian President Meets Chinese State Councillor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ACCRA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings
Wednesday spoke highly of the Ghana-China relationship while
meeting with a visiting Chinese government delegation led by State
Councillor Wu Yi.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting at the Presidential Palace here, Rawlings
expressed his government's gratitude to the Chinese government and
people for their kind assistance to Ghana.
</P>
<P>
It might be easy for Ghana to get the kind of technology and
expertise from other countries, but not with the same kind of
prices and kindness China could provide, said the president of the
West African country.
</P>
<P>
That is why a close economic cooperation between the two
developing countries is of great importance for Ghana's
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also called for joint efforts by the two
countries in bringing about a more secure and just world.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi said her visit, which started on Monday evening, is part
of Chinese government's effort to find new ways and areas to
expand economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the belief that the two countries would enjoy
even more dynamic and fruitful ties in economic and political
fields.
</P>
<P>
Wu will leave Ghana for Benin on Thursday morning. Ghana is the
first leg of her six-nation African tour.
</P>
<P>
Economic ties between China and Ghana have seen significant
improvement since 1972, when the two countries resumed diplomatic
ties.
</P>
<P>
According to figures provided by the Chinese Embassy in Accra,
the volume of bilateral trade amounted to 120 million U.S. dollars
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
So far China has invested in 78 projects in Ghana, which makes
China the number two investor in terms of the number of investment
projects in this country.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Coalition Leaders Rack brains on Ocalan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish coalition partners met
Wednesday afternoon to discuss whether to put on hold the death
sentence against Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan or submit it
to the Parliament for approval as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The long-overdue debate came amid reports that Turkish unity and
Turkish relations with the European Union are at stake. The
European Union has told candidate Turkey that hanging Ocalan would
be a grave mistake.
</P>
<P>
If the government complies with the appeal of the European Court
of Human Rights (ECHR) for a stay of execution of Ocalan's death
sentence for two years, it may risk a breakup of the 7-month-long
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Bulent Ecevit, chairman of the Democratic Left Party and prime
minister, supported by Chairman of Motherland Party Mesut Yilmaz,
firmly stands for an ECHR decision before sending the case to the
Parliament, which most likely approves the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Delvet Bahceli, chairman of the Nationalist Action Party and
deputy prime minister, wants the capital punishment to be
immediately enforced.
</P>
<P>
Hours before the meeting, Ecevit described the scheduled debate
as an occasion when a relationship between national law and
international law is focused on.
</P>
<P>
Addressing "Law Congress 2000" organized by the Ankara Bar,
Ecevit said that "fairness of law, independence of jurisdicton,
accord between laws and human rights and homogeneity between
national law and supranational law, have been high on agenda of
Turkey in recent years."
</P>
<P>
"Leaders of political parties forming the coalition government
will convene later today. The meeting will mainly focus on the
relations between the national law and the supranational law," he
said. "As our relations with the European Union deepen, we will be
more aware of this fact."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the three-party coalition leaders held a
high-level meeting before which was also attended by key government
ministers. No details were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe, despite a tense atmosphere, the leaders
may at the end find a compromise solution, acceptable to all, to
overcome the difficulties as no one can afford a government crisis.
</P>
<P>
Turkish outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) leader Ocalan was
sentenced to death in June last year and the PKK rebels he led have
been fighting a guerrilla was since 1984 for an independent Kurdish
state in southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Iran Ready to Export Gas to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of National
Iranian Gas Company (NIGC) Hamdollah Mohammadnejad announced on
Wednesday that Iran is ready to export 3 billion cubic meters of
gas to Turkey annually according to a contract signed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Mohammadnejad said Iran has made all
necessary preparations to supply gas to Turkey from the beginning
of the year 2000 and the NIGC has injected gas into the pipeline
laid to carry gas to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said the Turkish Botas company is still busy laying the
pipeline inside Turkey and has asked Iran to extend the term of the
contract to 25 years from 22 years, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1996 contract, Turkey should complete construction of
the pipeline on its soil by early 1999 for the initial gas delivery
of 3 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Botas Managing Director Gokhan Yardim informed Iran that the
Turkish side could not complete the pipeline on its soil on
schedule for financial reasons and the pipeline would be ready by
September 2001, Mohammadnejad said.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that Turkey should pay compensation for the delay
in carrying out its obligations as stipulated in the contract,
saying that Iran has spent 200 million U.S. dollars to set up the
pipeline in the Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
The bank financing the project expects Iran to pay back the loan
from the beginning of the year 2000 in installments, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the amount of Turkish compensation, he said that
the two sides should hold negotiations to reach a clear result in
this respect.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Iran might demand 120 million dollars'
compensation from the Turkish side for the delay.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian, Israeli Ministers Discuss Bilateral Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian and Israeli trade
ministers vowed Wednesday to remove all obstacles to increase trade
volume between the two countries to a record 100 million U.S.
dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Industry and Trade Minister Mohammed Asfur and his
Israeli counterpart Ran Cohen, who arrived here earlier in the day
for a one-day visit made the vow in their meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference after the meeting, Asfur said
discussions with Cohen focused upon means of promoting bilateral
trade, such as facilitating commodities movement and reducing cost.
</P>
<P>
Asfur described his talks with Cohen as "constructive and
fruitful."
</P>
<P>
Cohen is the first Israeli minister to visit Amman after the
Labor party headed by Prime Minister Ehud Barak came to power last
July.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said Israel is committed to increasing its trade volume
with Jordan, the one of the only two Arab states that signed a
peace treaty with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between the two countries reached 27.5 million
dollars in the first nine months of 1999 with Jordan's exports to
Israel recorded at 13.5 million dollars, according to the latest
statistics by the Israeli embassy in Amman.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also agreed to set up a joint committee of
officials and experts to work on removing specific obstacles
hindering bilateral trade and on the establishments of free trade
zones between the countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian businessmen complained that the 1994 peace treaty
failed to bring enough peace dividends to the kingdom, and they
accused Israel of blocking Jordanian goods from entering Israel and
Israeli-controlled Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel agreed last December to stop asking Jordanian
drivers to unload their goods for security check before entering
Israel and Palestinian territories.

<HEADLINE> Mandelson Says IRA Arms Scrapping to Start Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson said on Wednesday that he expected the
first steps towards scrapping guerrilla arms to start soon.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson told the parliament that he expected a fresh report
from the head of the province's independent disarmament body,
retired Canadian army General John de Chastelain, later this month,
the Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Sunday Telegraph newspaper said Irish Republican Army
or IRA guerrillas would allow de Chastelain to observe the blowing
up of a small number of firearms but wanted the rest of their
arsenal to be sealed in monitored bunkers in the Irish republic to
the south.
</P>
<P>
If true, the move by the guerrillas would be the first time
even one of their guns was removed from the province's politics.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said the method of putting arms out of action was up
to de Chastelain. All that the government required was for weapons
to be destroyed or made permanently inaccessible and for that to
be independently verified, he said.

<P>
ROME, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The need to step up the fight
against international terrorism and organized crime was the focus
of talks here Wednesday between Italian and Indian foreign
ministers Lamberto Dini and Jaswant Singh.
</P>
<P>
"We had a wide-ranging discussion which started from an
assessment of the recent hijacking of the indian airliner," Dini
said.
</P>
<P>
"We stressed the need to fully activate all the instruments at
our disposal to fight international terrorism, wherever it comes
from," he said, highlighting the importance of exchanging
information on the subject.
</P>
<P>
Singh explained to Dini the complex ethnic and religious mix in
India and voiced the hope that bilateral cooperation could be
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Dini for the solidarity shown during the hijacking
and noted that all countries have their own areas of instability.
</P>
<P>
Dini described bilateral relations as good and said India and
Italy had many common interests in the political and economic
field. They should therefore have more frequent contacts, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers ended the meeting by pledging to table more
frequent consultations. As a sign of this, Indian Prime Minister
Atal Behari will be in Italy at the beginning of next month.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Send Crew to Mir Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Russian space agency said
Wednesday that it would send cosmonauts to the empty Mir space
station at the end of March if the government approved.
</P>
<P>
Mir, partially shut down since August, is now empty. The
station will be crashed into the Pacific Ocean if no funds were
found for it to remain afloat in space.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Alexander Gorbunov said director and chief designers
of the agency had agreed on a plan to use non-budgetary financing
to pay for the mission.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mir's mission control center in Korolyov outside
Moscow is ready to switch on the on-board computer and prepare the
station for receiving cosmonauts and cargo, the Interfax news
agency quoted deputy mission chief Viktor Blagov as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the cabinet is expected to convene a meeting later this
month to confirm the space agency's decision to operate the
orbital complex and to send a long-term expedition to it.
</P>
<P>
"The mission control services are tuned to normal work.Training
session has been held and a plan of operations has been drawn,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mir was launched in 1986 and has ensured Russian predominance
in long-term manned space flight. Russia is taking advantage of
those skills to build the living quarters for the new
International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
The 60 billion U.S. dollar new station has been repeatedly
delayed and the United States wants Russia to abandon Mir and
focus resources on the new orbiter.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the Progress M-1 cargo ship has been scheduled
for between January 31 and February 3.
</P>
<P>
Progress M-1 is a modified version of the standard Progress
cargo ship in which the compartments for dry cargo and water tanks
are replaced with fuel tanks. As a result, the amount of fuel to
be taken into orbit has increased two times to over two metric
tons.
</P>
<P>
A Soyuz-TM with cosmonauts on board is expected to be launched
to Mir in March. One more cargo ship carrying scientific equipment
and food will be launched in April, Interfax said.

ATHENS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Although the number of flu cases
in Greece are limited, sales of flu vaccines and anti-inflammatory
medicine have peaked sharply in recent days in the country.
</P>
<P>
Believing vaccines provide immunity against type B flu, Greeks

pharmacists have warned that vaccines might begin to run out
unless the current level of demand decreases.
</P>

So far, the cases of type B flu traced in Greece are only a few

claimed at least 18 lives in Europe and left millions of people
bedridden.
</P>
<P>
While being on full alert, the Greek Health Ministry insists
that there is no flu epidemic in the country, and called on people

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council
Wednesday expressed its unhappiness with Bosnia's failure to fully
implement the "New York Declaration," released here on November 15
last year, calling on the three-member Bosnian Joint Presidency to
carry out the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by the Council president for the month
of January, Richard Holbrooke who is the U.S. permanent
representative to the United Nations, following a closed-door
meeting by the 15-nation Security Council on the current situation
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Presidency members came to the Security Council in
November last year to declare their cooperation and their
adherence to the Dayton peace agreement and the "New York
Declaration," said Holbrooke, who brokered the Dayton accord to
put an end to the bloody war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
But one member of the Presidency claimed that he did not sign
the accord and it has no validity, Holbrooke said, voicing his
opposition to the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council was unanimous this morning, and calling
on the Joint Presidency to implement the agreement," he said,
adding that the Council will be sending the representative of the
U.N. Secretary-General to the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, ask him
to "solve directly" the problem and urge the Joint Presidency to
move forward.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Presidency released the "New York Declaration" on
November 15 here after they briefed the Security Council on the
current situation in the country at the invitation of the Council.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for the three presidency members to hold
the meeting with the Security Council since its 1995 establishment.
The meeting also took place on the eve of the four anniversary of
the Dayton Peace Accords, which guide the peace process in the
Balkan country.
</P>

In 1995, concerned parties signed the Dayton accords in Dayton,
Ohio State of the United States.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Divided on Candidate for Chief Arms Inspector for Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The 15-member United
Nations Security Council is still far from reaching an agreement
on the candidate for the Chairman of the United Nations Monitoring,
verification and Inspection Commission(UNMOVIC), U.N. diplomats
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday held consultations
with the Security Council on the candidate and no agreement
reached, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General has a list of candidates for the post but
none can be approved by the full members of the Council, said the
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Russia is against any candidate from a NATO
country, thus excluding disarmament experts of mark Moher of
Canada and Istvan Gyarmati of Hungary, who are on the U.N.chief's
list.
</P>
<P>
France is said to favor Celso Amorim, Brazil's former U.N.
Ambassador, now at the United Nations in Geneva, who was opposed
by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
China is reported to prefer a candidate from the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council last month narrowly adopted
a resolution which created UNMOVIC to replace the United Nations
Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction. UNSCOM withdrew from Iraq days before
the U.S.-led military strikes against Iraq in December 1998. Iraq
has barred it from returning.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, the Secretary-General is requested
to appoint the chairman of UNMOVIC within 30 days after the
adoption of the resolution, with the approval of the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Annan, after meeting with the Security council, said Tuesday
that he would announce the candidate soon.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Privatizes Road Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government is
transforming its state-owned provincial road construction and
maintenance companies (ECMEPs) into limited companies in a bid to
make them more efficient and competitive.
</P>
<P>
The change in the legal status of these companies should be
concluded shortly, according to a source from the National road
administration (ANE) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The perspective is to privatize in the ECMEPs, so that they
can compete on a footing of equality with other companies in
tenders for the construction and/or maintenance of roads," the
source said.
</P>
<P>
The ECMEPs were set up shortly after Mozambique won
independence in 1975, and there is one in each province.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the country, the work of the ECMEPs has been
regarded as below expectation, and as contributing to the current
state of degradation of much of the Mozambican road network.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan has contributed 3.4
million U. S. dollars to Ethiopia to assist the people affected by
war and food shortage, the United Nations World Food Program (WFP)
announced here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Of all the package aid, about 2.1 million U.S. dollars is
designated to provide food for those internally displaced by the
Ethio-Eritrea border conflict which began in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The balance would be used to support those Ethiopians affected
by crop failure and drought, the WFP said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Japan made the contribution in response to an appeal made by
the WFP to the world community, Japanese ambassador to Ethiopia
Taehisa Nogami was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 20-month-old border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea
has displaced more than 384,000 people, mainly women and children.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Not Objects to Denktash's Contact With outside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government said
Wednesday it does not object to contacts between Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash and foreign officials, provided there are no
messages of recognition of the breakaway state in the north of the
island.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports of an invitation by German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer to Denktash, government spokesman Michalis
Papapetrou said there were no indications that Fischer intends
anything other than assisting efforts for a solution to the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he sees any danger in contacts between Denktash
and Europe, Papapetrou said the Cyprus government will take all
necessary measures and explain its position.
</P>
<P>
He noted that any attempt to encourage Denktash in his efforts
toward the recognition of his breakaway state would negatively
affect the settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Denktash should not get the message that there is even indirect
recognition of his "puppet regime," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 the
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by
Turkey, against the internationally acknowledged Republic of Cyprus
in the south.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Killed in U.S.-British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 12 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi civilian was killed and
another injured Wednesday in U.S. and British warplanes attacks on
some civilian and service installations in northern Iraq, an Iraqi
military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 11:00 (0800 GMT) seven formations of
U.S. and British warplanes coming from Turkish airspace made 14
sorties over northern Iraq's Dohuk, Neineva and Erbil provinces.
</P>
<P>
These planes bombed some civilian and service facilities in the
region, he said, adding that Iraqi air defenses fired back.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in three days that civilian casualties
were reported in U.S.-British bombardment of Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, three Iraqi civilians were injured during the U.S.
and British warplanes' shelling of Iraqi public service facilities
in southern Iraq, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and British air strikes against Iraq in December
1998, their warplanes have made 17,532 sorties over the two no-fly
zones in Iraq and have regularly attacked Iraqi civilian and
military targets, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led Western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south against possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize these restricted zones for their lacking
of the United Nations Security Council authorization.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM to Visit Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi will visit Turkey on January 17-19 at the invitation of
his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem, Turkish Foreign Ministry
announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Security dialog between Ankara and Tehran continued last year,
raising hopes for better ties between the two neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
During Kharrazi's visit, both side will discuss "bilateral,
regional and international issues of common concerns," the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
The Turko-Iranian ties had been strained since last July when
Turkey accused Iran of supporting its rebel, the Kurdistan Workers'
Party (PKK), near the common borders, and launched cross-border
anti-PKK campaign which caused alleged casualties on Iranian side.
</P>
<P>
There had been a flurry of claims from Tehran that Turkish jets
violated Iranian air space and bombed one of its border posts.
Tehran requested for compensation and rejected Turkish claim that
there were some 50 PKK bases inside Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, both sides started security talks last August in order
to prevent bilateral relations from worsening. The latest sign of
rapprochement between two sides was the recent visit to Tehran by a
Turkish delegation to discuss Iran's supplying of natural gas to
Ankara.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- President of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan met here Wednesday
with visiting Bahraini Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa on
bilateral relations and other issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Zayed also welcomed the recent agreement
between Bahrain and Qatar to solve their border dispute peacefully,
UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed
Al-Nahyan said in a statement after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The president reiterated the UAE's willingness to exert all
efforts to strengthen solidarity between friendly countries,"
Hamdan was quoted by the official WAM news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The emirs of Bahrain and Qatar agreed in the Bahraini capital of
Manama earlier this month to exchange ambassadors and set up a
joint committee chaired by their crown princes to discuss ways to
settle their border dispute through cordial means.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Bahrain have been locked in a dispute over several
small but potentially oil- and gas-rich Gulf islands, including the
Hawar islands, controlled by Bahrain since 1930s but also claimed
by Qatar.  The issue has been taken to the International Court of
Justice, which is expected to begin hearings on it next May. But a
joint statement issued after the Manama meeting said the two emirs
agreed that the case will be withdrawn if an acceptable solution is
reached before the court's verdict by the joint committee.
</P>
<P>
The UAE, Bahrain and Qatar are all members of the regional
alliance Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which also groups Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait and Oman.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini emir arrived here Wednesday afternoon as part of
the continued consultations between GCC members, WAM said.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Denies Report on Plea Bargain Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
Wednesday denied reports that his lawyer and state prosecutors are
working on a deal in which he would resign to avoid a potential
investigation into a funding scandal surrounding him.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported earlier Wednesday that Weizman's attorney,
Yaakov Weinroth, had suggested the plea bargain deal to Justice
Ministry officials, under which the state would agree not to launch
a criminal investigation against the president in return for
Weizman's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein also denied the radio report
after a meeting Wednesday with Weizman's personal attorney, Hanina
Brandes who deals with the president's financial issues.
</P>
<P>
The career fate of Weizman is in the hands of State Attorney
Edna Arbel since he on Tuesday passed to her office all documents
related to a large sum of money allegedly he received from a French
businessman.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli public were shocked late last month when
investigative journalist Yoav Yitzhak broke the story that Weizman
had received about 453,000 U.S. dollars from French millionaire
Edouard Saroussi between 1988 and 1993 without reporting or paying
taxes.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, who was elected president in 1993 and is on his second
five-year term, has been since under increasing pressure to resign.
But he said he would decide the next step only after the
investigation ends.
</P>
<P>
The president has admitted that he received the money from
Saroussi, a long-time friend of his, but stressed that the money
was received only as a nontaxable personal gift before he was
elected president. He also contended that Brandes had told him
accepting the money was legal.
</P>
<P>
Arbel has promised to make a swift ruling on the case.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Opening Transit Routes With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chairman of the
Federation of Iraqi Chamber of Commerce Abdul Ghafour Younes on
Wednesday called for the opening of transit routes with Iran in
order to boost trade between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with his Iranian counterpart Ali Naqi Khamoushi,
Younes said the transit routes would be a good opportunity to
expand bilateral trade, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. efforts to tighten the embargoes imposed on Iraq will
only be neutralized through the collaboration between Iranian and
Iraqi officials and their private sectors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Younes crossed the border into Iran on Tuesday with a business
delegation, aiming to explore ways to expand trade relations with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors signed three contracts last November covering
their trade of food, medicine, agricultural and industrial
products, transport and communications.
</P>
<P>
Thanking Iranian businessmen for their efforts to export food
and medicine to Iraq under the U.N. oil-for-food program, the Iraqi
official called for further Iranian presence in Iraqi markets and
voiced his federation's readiness to provide assistance to Iranian
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Khamoushi termed the proposed transit routes as an "important
measure" to boost bilateral trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He voiced Iran's readiness to help reduce international
pressures on Iraq and said that exchange of commercial delegations
between the two countries will help towards that aim.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iran's efforts to normalize relations with Iraq and
its efforts to help Baghdad get out of its current crisis, he said
that officials of the two countries are working toward that end.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq, which fought a bloody war in 1980-1988, agreed to
open their common border in 1997 and encouraged their businessmen
to use the border points for flow of foodstuffs.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Receives Invitation to Multilateral Talks in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat received an invitation letter to the planed Mideast
multilateral talks next month in Moscow, Israel Radio reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The letter, presented to Arafat in the West Bank city of
Ramallah by U.S Consul General in Jerusalem John Herbest, was
jointly signed by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, whose countries are the
sponsors of the multinational peace conference.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether Arafat will accept the invitation.
</P>
<P>
Representatives on the foreign ministerial level from U.S.,
Egypt, Israel, Jordan, the Palestinian National Authority, Saudi
Arabia, Tunisia, Syria, Lebanon, the European Union, Canada, and
Japan will be invited to the talks scheduled for February 1.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a Syrian official source had announced that Damascus
will not take part in the multilateral talks unless there is
tangible progress in recently-resumed peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss also refused to participate
in the talks, saying such negotiations should wait for progress in
the Israeli-Syrian peace talks which have just concluded their
second round in the U.S. after a nearly four years of break.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Aviv Shir-On had
said that Israel will certainly agree to join the conference.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, accompanying former Russian President Boris Yeltsin for
a three-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas,
revealed in Jerusalem last Thursday that Moscow and Washington plan
to co-sponsor the first Mideast multinational talks in more than
three years.
</P>
<P>
The multilateral peace negotiations will focus on key issues
concerning the entire Middle East region, such as water,
environment, arms control, refugees and economic development.
</P>
<P>
The first multilateral negotiations were convened in Moscow in
January 1992 within the framework of a Mideast peace conference
held in the Spanish capital of Madrid in 1991, which kicked off the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
But the talks were frozen, together with the bilateral
negotiations, in early 1996 as the whole peace process was derailed
following a series of terrorist attacks in Israel carried out by
Islamic militants.

<HEADLINE> 1.4 Million Hit by Flu Wave in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- After the Christmas storm and ``
black wave'' oil pollution on its western coast, France has been
hit by a flu wave which has made 1.4 million people consult their
doctors and tens of thousands hospitalized in the past five weeks.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the most serious flu attacks in France in 10
years, although the number of people infected by the epidemic is
much lower than the 5 million who were affected 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Some 861 out of 100,000 people in France have got the disease,
surpassing the official danger line which limits the number of
patients to 158 in 100,000, according to Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
The region of Champagne-Ardenne in the northeast was most
touched by the flu, with five percent of its population infected.
</P>
<P>
But doctors said that the virus this year, which was also found
years ago in Moscow and Sydney, does not seem to be the most
ferocious.
</P>
<P>
France was most severely hit last century by two flu epidemics,
one in 1918-1919 when 20 million people were killed in a flu wave
in Europe, and another in 1968, when 20,000 people were killed by
a flu wave in France alone.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Make Car-free in Cities on Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 12 (Xinhua) -- In response to pollution levels,
the Italian government Wednesday launched a scheme to make Italian
cities car-free zones on four Sundays over the next four months.
</P>
<P>
Italian Environment Minister Edo Ronchi said thirty cities had
already agreed to ban cars on February 6, March 5, April 9 and May
7 - but added that as many as a hundred could sign up later.
</P>
<P>
Large areas of cities will be closed to cars for at least eight
hours, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m..
</P>
<P>
Eco-vehicles and buses will be allowed into limited-traffic
areas on the edge of the pedestrian zones.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 billion lire (about 26 million U.S. dollars) of
government funding is available for the city schemes, which must
be presented by the end of this month, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
All of Italy's biggest cities except Bologna are on board,
Ronchi added.
</P>
<P>
Ozone levels are particularly worrying in Rome, Milan, Florence,
Venice, Genoa and other cities, while carbon dioxide levels are
causing concern in Naples and Rome.
</P>
<P>
Polluting dust is a problem across the country, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Health Organisation, 80,000 Europeans
die of smog every year, more than 15,000 of them in Italy.

comment on a possible release of former Chilean President Augusto
Pinochet by Britain.

Meanwhile, a French judge has asked London to let him question
Pinochet as quickly as possible on the disappearance of five
French-Chileans during the rule of the military regime in the
1970s.

French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said

The spokeswoman said that France has taken note of the elements
but considers as very importance the law suits against Pinochet
made by the families of the five French-Chileans.
</P>
<P>
The British Home Secretary Jack Straw announced Tuesday evening
that he was ``inclined'' to release Pinochet and stop the
procedure of his extradition toward Spain, because of the poor

</P>
<P>
However, the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office was quoted as
saying that it is still confident that the goal of eradicating the
disease by the year 2003 can be achieved despite of the marked
increase last year.
</P>
<P>
"The long-term trend is quite clear. BSE in Switzerland is on
the decline," said a specialist at the office, adding that the
higher numbers last year could be due to the new control program,
more media coverage on the subject and the possibility that some
cases were not reported in earlier years.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Swiss authorities banned the use of animal fodder.
This leads them to believe that cases of BSE in cows born in 1997
and after are now less likely.

<HEADLINE> Sergeyev: No Suspension of Actions Against Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Instead, the campaign against the rebels will be brought to its
logical end, Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no suspension of hostilities against the
militants in Chechnya," the minister said, in an apparent response
to a plea made Tuesday by Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said he was opposed to negotiations with Chechen
leaders because Maskhadov has little authority in Chechnya, noting
that even some Western leaders critical of the Russian military
action in the North Caucasus republic find it difficult to name
any concrete participants from the Chechen side in the proposed
talks.
</P>
<P>
The military campaign was launched last September following two
waves of Chechen armed incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a
series of apartment bombings, also blamed on Chechen militants,
that killed over 300 people in Moscow and two other cities.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said that federal troops "were successfully advancing
toward the southern mountain districts of Chechnya" and that
paratroopers, who had landed on the heights near the Argun gorge
Tuesday, enabled them to take full control of one third of the
strategically important position, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Grozny, Sergeyev said that special assault
groups trained for street battles would be used in the liberation
of the Chechen capital, with massive air and artillery support.
</P>
<P>
Following rebel counter-attacks against federal troops in the
past several days, Sergeyev said, acting president Putin, also the
country's prime minister, on Wednesday approved a new plan of the
military operation against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Chechnya has changed dramatically lately, and
the expansion of the security zone in Chechnya requires a new
style and new methods of troops control," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 15-nation Security Council is expected to ponder over Annan
's recommendation to expand the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone,
known as UNAMSIL, in the wake of the scheduled withdrawal of the
Nigerian-led West African peacekeepers, called ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, issued here
Wednesday, Annan said that "The situation in Sierra Leone has
remained difficult, and progress in the implementation of the Lome
Agreement has been very slow."
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that, despite the progress made, the peace
established in Sierra Leone is still very fragile," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no justification for non-compliance or delays in
the implementation of the Lome Agreement, for the continuing human
rights abuses or for not allowing humanitarian aid to reach those
in need," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led ECOMOG helped end Sierra Leone's civil war
and pave the way for the July 7 cease-fire accord signed by the
government and rebels. But the U.N. force has been slow in
arriving, with only several hundred Kenyan and Indian peacekeepers
in the West African country.

eradication.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by a senior government official at

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Launches New Income Tax System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The South African Revenue
Service (SARS) on Wednesday announced the introduction of its new
income tax system which will allow SARS to give better service to
the South African tax payers.
</P>
<P>
At the announcement SARS commissioner Pravin Gordhan said the
system will ensure greater levels of tax compliance, introduce a
new emphasis on the audit component of revenue collection and
increase levels of administrative efficiency within SARS. It
would also lead to additional revenue for the state.
</P>
<P>
The system was implemented on December 17 and has already
started to have an impact, Gordhan said, adding that there were
6.5 million registered individual taxpayers and over 600,000
registered companies.
</P>
<P>
Individuals contributed more than half of South Africa's annual
tax revenue of around 193 billion rand.
</P>
<P>
Gordhan said the tax system had previously only focused on the
first world component of South African society. He said there were
lots of informal economic activity and more informal traders
needed to be brought into the income tax net.
</P>
<P>
Gordhan said the introduction of NITS would have benefits in
this fiscal year. He said in time the broader tax base and
improved revenue collection that will result from the introduction
of NITS could have a beneficial impact on personal tax levels.
</P>
<P>
He said that once it was operating at full efficiency the new
system would cut down the time between the submission of tax
re-turns and to finalize assessments from about 90 days to around
10 days.
</P>
<P>
 It would cut the time taken to issue directives to pension
funds from 17 days to one day. It would also ensure that SARS
officials followed up outstanding issues efficiently.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army (SPLA ) leader John Garang said here Wednesday
that he has won South African President Thabo Mbeki's support for
his peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Garang told reporters that Mbeki has agreed to further involve
South Africa in efforts to bring peace to Sudan, embroiled in a
16-year civil war. The plan would involve African countries -- led
by South Africa, Nigeria and Egypt -- in efforts to reconcile
Khartoum and Sudan's southern-based rebels, according to Garang,
who is on a visit to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's office said that South Africa had long lent support to
Sudan's peace process and had met with both sides of the conflict
"more than once".
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot we can learn from South Africa in terms of
reaching a solution that is based ... on a form of government in
which all the nationalities, all the religious groups, all the
various cultures are represented and which they rightfully call
their own," Garang said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Reduce Population Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government on
Wednesday decided to bring down the country's population growth
rate to 1.2 percent from 1.6 percent by bringing 71 percent of the
able couples from the existing 51 percent under the family
planning program in the current 1999-2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at a meeting of the Health and Family
Welfare Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which also decided to work for reducing the infant
and mother mortality rate from 4.3 to 2.6 per 1,000 during the
period, underlined the need for setting up condom, pill and
plastic coil factories in the country under government and private
initiatives to make contraceptives easily available to the users.
</P>
<P>
Terming the population explosion as one of the major problems
of the country, Health and Family Welfare Minister Sheikh Fazlul
Karim Selim urged concerned officials to work with utmost
sincerity and dedication to make the family planning movement
successful.
</P>
<P>
With an area of more than 148,000 square kilometers, Bangladesh
has a population of about 126 million, 43 percent of which are
below 15 years old and as a result, the potential for future
growth in the South Asian nation is tremendous, the United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) said.
</P>
<P>
Under the most optimistic assumption, the country's population
would reach 170 million when stabilization of population happens
in 40-45 years' time and if the level for replacement - two
children per couple - is reached by 2005, according to the UNFPA.

<HEADLINE> Syria Not to Attend Multilateral Mideast Talks in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Syria will not participate in
the multilateral Middle East talks in Moscow next month before it
sees progress in its bilateral negotiations with Israel, well-
informed Syrian source said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Progress must be realized first on the Syrian-Israeli peace
track before Damascus can take part in these talks, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow talks, scheduled to start on February 1, are expected
to cover refugees, arms control, economic issues, environment and
water rights.
</P>
<P>
This would be the first multinational talks on Middle East peace
process in more than three years. Russia and the United States are
both sponsors of the multilateral talks launched in Madrid, Spain,
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, Syria's ally in the region, has already refused to
participate in the Moscow talks.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon, both technically still at war with Israel,
have boycotted the multilateral Middle East talks from the outset,
saying such talks would be meaningless if they have not achieved
peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Israel and Syria, as well as those between Israel
and Lebanon, stopped in February 1996 after a series of attacks
carried out by Islamic militants in Israel in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Syria-Israel talks were revived last December in the United
States to tackle the Golan Heights which Israel seized from Syria
in the 1967 Mideast war, sharing of water, security arrangements
and normalization of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to start the third round of
negotiations on January 19.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Israel and Lebanon have not been resumed yet.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Police Wednesday arrested
opposition leaders Karpal Singh and Marina Yusoff along with the
editor and printer of the newspaper Harakah run by the opposition
party PAS (Islam Party of Malaysia), Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Karpal, deputy chairman of the opposition party Democratic
Action Party (DAP), was detained when he surrendered at the Dang
Wangi police station here in the evening after a warrant of arrest
was issued against him earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
DAP Chairman Lim Kit Siang, who was present at the station,
told reporters police had telephoned Karpal about the arrest
warrant.
</P>
<P>
"Karpal told me the arrest was probably connected with the
Anwar Ibrahim arsenic poisoning accusation made by him in court
last year," Lim was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Police confirmed the arrest but declined to give details.
</P>
<P>
Marina, vice-president of the opposition Parti Keadilan
Nasional (National Justice Party), also surrendered at the Cheras
police station Wednesday morning after a warrant of arrest was
issued against her.
</P>
<P>
"She was later released on police bail of 5,000 ringgit (1,315
U.S. dollars) posted by her friend Ng Lum Yong," Cheras district
deputy police chief Aman Hussain was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The arrest warrant was issued in connection with a speech she
made last September 29 alleging that police sparked off the racial
riots of May 13, 1969, the police officer said.
</P>
<P>
Police would charge Marina, a lawyer, on Friday at a Magistrate
's Court in the northeastern state of Pulau Pinang under the
Sedition Act 1948 which carries a fine of 5,000 ringgit (1,315 U.S.
dollars) or three years' imprisonment or both upon conviction for
a first offense, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
Harakah editor Zulkifli Sulong and the newspaper's printer Shea
Lim Thye were arrested at the Sentul police station.
</P>
<P>
Zulkifli, who went to the station after being asked to do so,
was freed minutes later on police bail of 3,000 ringgit (789 U.S.
dollars), Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
The arrest was in connection with an allegedly seditious
article published by Harakah in August last year, Zulkifli said.
</P>
<P>
Zulkifli will be charged in the Sessions Court here Thursday
morning while Shea is expected to be charged at the Sessions Court
in Petaling Jaya near here, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
PAS, DAP and Parti Keadilan Nasional (National Justice Party)
along with the People's Party formed an alliance known as
Alternative Front during the general election held on November 29
last year in which the Barisan Nasional (National Front) led by
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad won a two-thirds majority.

<P>
BERLIN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A former East German swim
federation doctor is accused of doping young swimmers in mid-1970s
appeared in court on Wednesday facing charges of causing bodily
harm.
</P>
<P>
Lothar Kipke, 72, is accused of giving illegal substances
surreptiously to 54 teenage swimmers between 1975 and 1985 when he
was head physician of the mighty East German swim team that
produced an astonishing number of world champions.
</P>
<P>
Kipke admitted being involved in East Germany's doping system
from the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
The charge sheet against Kipke said the doping had caused
dramatic changes in the bodies of the women swimmers, leaving many
with deep masculine voices, excessive hair growth on their bodies
or shrinkage of their breasts.

Six former East German coaches and doctors were convicted and

<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing municipal
government has decided that it will no longer approve the
establishment of new solely state-funded industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
This move is aimed at reducing the industrial proportion of the
city's economy and the number of state-owned enterprises engaging
in industry, said Li Yanling, who is in charge of the city's
economic committee.
</P>
<P>
He said Beijing will focus on increasing the gross domestic
product (GDP) by inspiring the use of capital, accelerating the
pace of modern enterprise system construction, and accumulating
more capital through the stock market and property-rights market.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the city's industrial policies issued
hereafter will be applicable to all the local enterprises without

<HEADLINE> Barak: Israeli-Syrian Talks Reach Crucial Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli-Syrian peace talks
have reached a "crucial stage" and are demanding tough decisions in
the future, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli negotiating team did not make promise on all key
issues discussed during the second round of talks in the United
States, but the progress made in various committees will enable the
parties to forge ahead in the coming rounds, Barak told the Israel
Radio.
</P>
<P>
Barak returned home Tuesday from the United States after winding
up his week-long talks there with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two sides discussed all key issues such as
borders, water, security arrangement and normalization of ties
between the two countries, but no final agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
They are scheduled to hold another round of talks in the United
States starting January 19. The new round is expected to last about
a week, and will probably take place at a military base in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Barak spoke highly of the "flexibility" showed by the Syrian
side during the second round, but refused to say when a final
agreement could be concluded.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, Barak granted his first interview to local
television stations, in which he said "the moment of courageous
decision-making is near" for the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that any border Israel agrees to discuss with Syria
would "reflect the depth of normalization and Israel's vital
interests in terms of water and security."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkish Coalition Government Faces Test  on Ocalan Case  By Xing Guoxin Huai Chengbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Whether to execute the death
sentence against the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) leader
Abdullah Ocalan has posed a major test for Turkey's ruling
coalition which will hold a tripartite summit on the issue here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit insists that the government
should hold the file, sent by the Justice Ministry earlier this
month, and wait for the ruling by the European Court of Human
Rights (ECHR) which might take some 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Such an opinion by Ecevit's Democratic Left Party (DSP) has been
echoed by the Motherland Party, a liberal ruling partner led by
former prime minister Mesut Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
However, another partner, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP) led
by Deputy Premier Devlet Bahceli, is under strong grassroots'
pressure for a speedy execution of the separatist chieftain. It has
requested that the ruling be forwarded immediately to parliament
for debate.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was sentenced to death in June for leading a 15-year war
for autonomy in the predominantly Kurdish southeastern Turkey. Some
37,000 people, mostly Kurds, have been killed.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here have warned that if the summit fails to produce a
consensus on the controversy, which has undermined stability among
the coalition partners, there is a danger that the government may
collapse.
</P>
<P>
Over the past month, Ecevit and his coalition partners have
repeatedly delayed response to the ECHR appeal on the Ocalan case,
saying that the judicial process in Turkey was not yet fully
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
However, the transfer of the file by the Justice Ministry to the
government indicates that the domestic judicial process on the case
has come to an end. It is now up to the government to decide on the
case and ECHR's ruling.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that during the summit, Ecevit will try to
convince other partners that if the ruling by the high court is
forwarded to the parliament for debate, the parliament may make a
quick decision on upholding the ruling as a result of the feeling
prevailing in the country.
</P>
<P>
Demirel expressed concern that this scenario will lead to an
escalation of separatist terrorism, interrupt Turkey's bid for full
membership in the European Union (EU) and worsen the country's
economy, which is currently showing positive signs following
Turkey's EU candidacy.
</P>
<P>
The death sentence on Ocalan will not be carried out until being
approved by both parliament and the president.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Intensifies Inside Security Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 12 (Xinhua)-- Fighting inside the security
zone in south Lebanon intensified Wednesday as Israel Defense
Forces (IDF) and its ally the South Lebanon Army (SLA) exchanged
gun-fire with Hezbollah in almost all sectors of the zone.
</P>
<P>
Since early Wednesday morning, the Lebanese military group
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been launching massive attacks on
the IDF and SLA positions along the northern border of the security
zone and the IDF and SLA have fired back in retaliation, Israel
Radio quoted sources at the Northern Command of the IDF as
reporting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli warplanes were called to join in the military
operation by blasting Hezbollah positions and hideouts in south
Lebanon and all jets returned to their bases safely.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of casualties so far from both sides, the
radio added.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, two SLA soldiers were wounded when Hezbollah gunmen
attacked with rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and automatic
weapons simultaneously on the SLA outposts of Taher, Tohra, Soweida
and Dabshe, a string of adjacent villages on the edge of the
security zone, IDF said earlier.

<P>
The IDF retaliated by attacking Hezbollah positions in the
villages of Habboush and Arab Slim, just of east of Nabatiyah.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
self-proclaimed purpose of protecting its north from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah apparently mobilized more forces to mount attacks
on the IDF and SLA positions inside the security zone during the
break of the Israeli-Syrian peace talks, and the IDF was well
prepared for such eventualities, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria just ended their second round of week-long
talks in the United States on Monday. The two sides are to continue
their talks in the United States again on January 19.
</P>
<P>
Israel on Tuesday accused Iran of continuing to support
Hezbollah to escalate attacks on the IDF and SLA, which Israel said
is aimed at foiling the renewed Israeli-Syrian peace process.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Agrees to Allow IAEA to Carry Out Routine Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Undersecretary Nazar Hamdoun said that a team of
four or five members from IAEA will be allowed to carry out checks
of Iraqi facilities over a week starting from January 21.
</P>
<P>
The inspection of Iraq's uranium stockpile is not related to the
inspections of Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological programs
under the U.N. Security Council resolutions adopted after the 1991
Gulf War, Hamdoun said.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has given a "favorable answer to a request from the IAEA
in the framework of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty" which
Iraq signed in 1969, said Hamdoun.
</P>
<P>
The Vienna-based IAEA had planned to send a team to Iraq last
December to perform its annual inspection, as required under the
1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but the planned trip was
postponed because Iraq did not reply to the agency's request.
</P>
<P>
IAEA spokesman David Kyd said in Vienna that since the Iraqi
government did not answer the first letter of the agency requesting
visas and other assistance for inspections, the agency sent a
second letter reminding Baghdad of its obligations under the non-
proliferation treaty.
</P>
<P>
U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq have been suspended since
December 1998 when the U.S. and Britain launched four-night attacks
on Iraqi targets to retaliate what they said Iraq's non-cooperation
with inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's cooperation with IAEA had been smooth before the U.S.-
British air war, and IAEA declared in its report to the U.N.
Security Council in October 1998 that it had found no evidence that
Iraq had produced nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted resolution 1284 last December
which calls on Iraq to allow a new arms control body called the U.
N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) to
return to the country in exchange of possible suspension of the 10-
year-old sanctions imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has declared its rejection to this resolution, saying it
will not allow the return of U.N. arms inspectors unless the
Security Council moves toward lifting the sanctions.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration Tuesday proposed a two-year, 1.3
billion dollars aid program aimed at stemming the flow of
Colombian cocaine and heroin into this country.
</P>
<P>
-- Augusto Pinochet is too sick to stand trial on the human
rights charges against him, the British government announced
Tuesday night, a conclusion that means the former Chilean
President could go home in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, speaking in a
television interview, said the peace talks with Syria had reached
a decisive stage in which both sides would have to make difficult
decisions.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian officers provided accounts of the fighting in Shali
that has alarmed Moscow and prompted a close review of Russia's
military strategy in Chechnya. The rebel offensive has raised
questions of whether Chechnya can ever be made fully secure for
Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- America Online and Time Warner shares fell 9.5 percent and 5.
7 percent respectively, cutting nearly 15 billion dollars from
their proposed merger's valuation, to 141.35 billion dollars.
Investors fretted that AOL's growth will slow after acquiring the
"old World" assets of Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
-- Oil-producing nations aren't likely to boost output in March
because concerns over unused supplies, a refining slowdown and a
warm U.S. winter have raised questions about demand.

<HEADLINE> Milutinovic Gives Prescription for Beleaguered Chinese Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavian Bora Milutinovic
has thought that China's continued failure to qualify for the
World Cup finals lies chiefly with the lack of experience of
international competition.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic, who is set to take the helm of the Chinese
national squad, said that China need to take part in more
competitive matches to improve their performances.
</P>
<P>
"It is very abnormal that the national squad have not competed
in any Class A international matches during the past year. They
have to play more matches if they want to gain better records,"
said Milutinovic.
</P>
<P>
The globe-trotting coach is the only one to take four different
teams into the second round of the World Cup finals, which has
been a far cry for the soccer-crazy China.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic concluded the talks with the Chinese Football
Association (CFA) on Tuesday and he is expected to put his
signature to the deal in the Southern Chinese city of Guangzhou
where a four-national friendly tournament will be staged from
January 14-16.
</P>
<P>
"All details have been settled. If nothing else happens, we
will sign the agreement soon in Guangzhou," said CFA spokesman
Dong Hua on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic also said that there is "no problems" with the
talks and he is very likely to take over after the four-nation
tournament.
</P>
<P>
With the deal, Milutinovic would become the third foreign head
coach of China after German Klaus Schlappner and Briton Bobby
Houghton who both were fired for continued disappointing record.

highest growth rate among all provinces, municipalities, and
autonomous regions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that the city's per capita GDP will exceed 4,

<HEADLINE> China to Step up Anti-Corruption Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese leader vowed
today that the Communist Party of China (CPC) will fight against
corruption this year with a firm hand.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, also claimed victory over
corruption in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said that Party discipline inspection and supervision
departments completed investigations into 130,414 cases and
punished 132,447 corrupt officials last year.
</P>
<P>
Wei, also secretary of the CPC Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection, said at the commission's fourth plenary
session that among those punished, 17 were minister-level
officials, and more than 4,400 had responsibilities for bureaus,
prefectures, departments, division offices, or counties.
</P>
<P>
Several officials including the former Party secretary of the
city of Ningbo Xu Yunhong, the former deputy governor of Jiangxi
Province Hu Changqing, and the deputy chairman of the China
International Trust And Investment Corporation Jin Deqin were all
punished for bribery or embezzling public funds.
</P>
<P>
Wei also revealed that the country closed 110 illegal medicine
markets and 7,594 medicine plants, and investigated 8,745 related
cases in order to rectify unsound practices.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a total of 19,458 companies run by the People's
Liberation Army, the armed police, the police, and legal
departments were shut down, and 6,494 were put in the hands of
local governments, according to Wei.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that despite this success, rampant corruption
has not been effectively curbed and the situation remains severe.
</P>
<P>
To step up the anti-corruption campaign, Wei said that family
members of high ranking officials are restrained to running
businesses or assuming certain positions within the administration
scope of their parents or spouses, and they are forbidden to
receive gifts and money, by taking advantage of the influence of
their parents or spouses.
</P>
<P>
Officials are not allowed to take part in tourist activities
arranged by their subordinates at the expense of public funds, or
use public money for private computers or Internet access.
</P>
<P>
Wei said the Party will make great efforts to investigate
several major cases, especially in the areas of finance, real
estate, land leasing, materials procurement and other significant
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Attention should be paid to smuggling, tax evasion, losses of
state-owned assets, and official malpractice. Unsound practices in
the field of medicine will be especially targeted, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wei urged governments at all levels to adopt a strict fiscal
system that will prevent corruption, and to inform the public
about their administrative activities.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprise should redouble their efforts to improve
their working methods, and their leaders must strictly observe all
relevant regulations. A responsibility system aimed at building
clean government should be consolidated, he added, and stressed
the importance of education in this regard.

HONG KONG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Research Grants
Council (RGC) announced Wednesday that it has renewed its annual
joint research scheme with France, funding a total of 17 new

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said Wednesday it had
agreed to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to
resume the nuclear inspections inside the country.
</P>
<P>
A team from the IAEA will arrive in Iraq next week to
check if the country possesses any nuclear weapons, Nizar Hamdoon,
deputy foreign minister, told foreign media in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The renewed inspections are part of world-wide monitoring of
nuclear facilities by the Vienna-based IAEA and had nothing to do
with the U.N. arms verification program, now suspended, Hamdoon
noted.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad had given a "favorable answer to a request from the IAEA
in the framework of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty," he said.
In 1969, Iraq signed the treaty under which inspections are held as
part of safeguard obligations.
</P>
<P>
"The team sent by the IAEA will have four or five members and
will carry out routine activities in Iraq," he added.
</P>
<P>
IAEA inspections in Iraq have been halted since December 1998,
when Britain and the United States launched airstrikes against
Baghdad for alleged failing to cooperate with U.N. disarmament
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA, which was also involved in the U.N. campaign in Iraq
alongside the UNSCOM special commission on disarmament, declared in
October 1998 that it had found no evidence that Iraq had produced
nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Manila Targets 50 Bln Dollars in Exports by 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Wednesday that it expects the country's exports to reach 50
billion U.S. dollars by the year 2001 as part of its efforts to
widen the access of Philippine products in the foreign market.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said in a report
that the export sector continued to grow fast in 1999, fueled
largely by government efforts to promote Philippine products,
which yielded 3,781 new importers of the country's goods for the
first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The country's merchandise export receipts from January to
November in 1999 increased by 19 percent to 32 billion dollars
from 27 billion dollars a year earlier, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The government serviced and sent to appropriate agencies a
total of 18,909 trade opportunities in 1999 as part of the efforts
to boost the country's dollar-generating sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it assisted 75,562 Philippine exporters and
businesses last year, including those referred to foreign buyers
and businesses.
</P>
<P>
Some 52 Honorary Trade and Investment Representatives covering
31 cities and 20 countries aided the DTI in organizing trade
missions, fairs, seminars to ensure the continuous expansion of
the Philippines' investments and market bases.
</P>

The DTI also enhanced the Philippines' access to foreign
markets by forging and strengthening several trade accords with
the United States, the European Union and Asian countries.

PARIS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The market of satellite launching
is expected to see a net growth this year after suffering from a

executive officer of the Arianespace company, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted Luton as saying that thanks to the
orders from American geostationary satellite operators since last

<HEADLINE> EU Issues Food Policy Paper For European Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
Wednesday published its long-awaited White Paper on Food Safety in
Europe for a wide-ranging debate in the 15-country European Union
(EU).
</P>
<P>
The policy paper mainly focuses on setting up a European Food
Safety Authority. After analyzing the various existing models
elsewhere in the world, the European Commission, EU's executive
body, proposes to base the organization of the future authority
along the lines of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA)
in London instead of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration which
was suggested before.
</P>
<P>
One of the future authority's main tasks would be food risk
analysis, but the Commission wants to put health risk matters to
stay in the hands of independent scientists, and at the same time
keep its own responsibility for taking measures to protect
consumers' health in food scare cases, albeit in close
collaboration with the EU member states and the European
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The policy paper also recommends launching a program for
reviewing and upgrading various pieces of food legislation, with
the hope of making significant progress with the labeling of
products derived from genetically-modified organisms (GMOs).
</P>
<P>
A key chapter in the White Paper is consumer information on
health risks, comprising a comprehensive program on the overall
food chain, including animal feed.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has been hit by a series of health scares
such as "mad cow" disease, dioxins and sewage sludge in animal
feed. Under the agenda in the White Paper, there will be a
consultation period with interested parties until mid-March and a
formal Commission proposal in July.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive will monitor the wide-ranging debate at the EU
level on the final form of the new European food safety to be
assumed by future European Food Authority which is to be
established during the second half of 2001 and start operation in
2002.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Over 400 South Korean civic
groups Wednesday formed an alliance here to reject "disqualified
candidates" who will run in the general elections scheduled on
April 13 this year.
</P>
<P>
The 2,000 General Election Civic Alliance, including the
Citizens' Coalition for Economic Justice, the People's Solidarity
for Participation, the Korean Federation for Environmental
Movement and Green Korea United, vowed to prevent candidates from
running in the elections as they were involved in corruption,
election law violations, military coups, human rights abuse,
insincere parliamentary and regionalist activities.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by an explosion of popular support, the alliance,
which made a criteria against disqualified candidates based on a
survey of 500 voters early this week, said it will also scrutinize
candidates' property, military service and public pledges.
</P>
<P>
It will release a list of disqualified candidates to be named
by competing political parties.
</P>
<P>
Monday, the Citizens Coalition for Economic Justice made public
a list of 164 people who have to be barred from the upcoming
general elections as candidates for the first time in South
Korea's political history.
</P>
<P>

The list has stirred not only controversy about its legality
but also strong reactions from the entire South Korean political
circle. Those lawmakers on the list have already declared it a "
smear campaign."

<HEADLINE> mee011211 hke -- Cyprus Willing to Bring Turkish Cypriots in EU Accession Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides said Tuesday night that the government will possibly
propose to bring the Turkish Cypriots into the European Union (EU)
accession negotiating process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with visiting Greek Foreign
Minister George Papandreou, Kasoulides said the EU has defined that
the Turkish Cypriots can be part of the joint negotiating team of
the Republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus is ready to examine ways for the Turkish Cypriots
to participate in various moves towards the accession and is "ready
to see non-governmental organizations in different procedures."
</P>
<P>
"We will probably be in a position to put forward suggestions
toward this goal," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Turkish Cypriot-controled
north and the Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island after a
abortive pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for the EU membership in 1990 and began
substantive accession negotiations with the EU in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the Turkish Cypriot side had turned down an invitation
by Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides to nominate representative in
the official team negotiating the country's EU accession.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots insist that the Cyprus constitution does
not allow the Republic to join an international organization unless
Greece and Turkey are also members.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash recently said that he
would initial direct dialogues with the EU on the issue of
accession.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt to Create Department of Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is set
to create a Department of Housing, placing all of the existing
government housing agencies and offices under it to enable the
government to effectively cover the backlog of 3.5 million houses.
</P>
<P>
This was announced Wednesday by Presidential Spokesman Jerry
Barican, as he explained that the creation of the new department
would have to pass through legislation before it could be added to
the existing bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
He said in a press release that the decision was reached after
the meeting among members of the Economic Coordinating Council who
recommended to President Joseph Estrada the creation of the
Department of Housing.
</P>
<P>
"That will highlight the commitment of the government to the
housing and urban development and rural development programs,"
Barican said, although he admitted that the plan cannot be
implemented overnight.
</P>
<P>
He said the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council
(HUDCC) will likely be tasked to draft the legislative measure
necessary for the creation of the new department, after which it
shall be submitted to the president for review.
</P>
<P>
If pleased with the draft, President Estrada will approve the
measure and certify it as urgent before submitting it for Congress
for enactment into law, Barican said.
</P>
<P>
The plan was approved after President Estrada issued an
executive order which rationalizes the government's housing sector
by realigning offices under each of the housing agencies.
</P>
<P>
"The president said there is a need to realign the offices to
delineate responsibilities under the following functional
categories: production regulation, financing, marketing and estate
management," Barican said.

Wednesday to end all ongoing skirmishes in Maguindanao province in
the southern Philippines effective 18:00 Wednesday (10:00 GMT),
the Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported.

the local Cotabato-Isulan highway will be pulled out to open the

The governor said both panels also agreed to strengthen the
organizational capabilities of the government-MILF Coordinating
Committees on the Cessation of Hostilities to monitor conflicts
between government troops and MILF guerrillas.

Undersecretary Orlando Soriano and Brigadier General Jose
Torrelavega while the other side was led by MILF political affairs
chief Ghadzali Jaafar, said the PNA.

Maguindanao last Saturday.

<P>
The new site, sponsored by world chocolate giant Mars, will
release the latest information on the connection between chocolate
and health, list the nutritional content of candy bars and other
chocolate confections, and provide the latest research findings on
the sweet.
</P>
<P>
Mars' products such as Dove bars, M&AMP;M's, Snickers and others
have been enthusiastically received by the Chinese, who believe
that a little sugar every day is essential in the daily diet --
but only a little. Statistics show that each Chinese consumes an
average of 16.5 grams of sugar per day, 148 grams less than
Americans and 40 grams less than the world's average.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese's consumption of saccharine is irrationally
high. A recent report says that some 60 percent of sugar content
of food made in China actually comes from saccharine, which is 300
times sweeter than sugar and widely used in drinks and processed
food sold in China.

<HEADLINE> China Sets 5-year Environmental Protection Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China plans to improve its laws
and management over environmental protection and curb the
deterioration of ecological environment during 2001-2005.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the State Environmental Protection Administration
said that China also plans to turn a number of cities into
prosperous and clean areas with sustainable ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
According to a draft plan of China's environmental protection
program for the five-year period, the quality of water in the
country's five major rivers -- the Yangtze, Yellow, Huaihe, Haihe
and Liaohe rivers -- and three polluted lakes of Taihu, Dianchi
and Chaohu, will be greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, the country's emission of sulfur dioxide will be cut
by 10 percent from the level in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The quality of air and water in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin,
Chongqing, and in open coastal cities, cities listed as key
tourist attractions or special economic zones, and provincial
capital cities to the south of the Yangtze River, should be up to
State requirement Level 2 and Level 4, or fairly good quality.
</P>
<P>
During the five years, the country's forest coverage rate will
be increased to 19 percent from the current 14 percent, and trees
will be planted over 12 million ha of land.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to protect the ecological environment in
areas around the sources of China's longest rivers, the Yangtze
and Yellow rivers, which have been suffering from serious water
and soil erosion due to land degradation and deforestation.

<HEADLINE> Pregnant Shopper Gets 4 Fingers Chopped Off: Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outraged by the case, the newspaper published three separate
front-page articles on it, as well as a commentary describing the
act as barbarous and calling for justice, and an interview with
Lin Huisu, chairman of Guangdong Provincial Women's Federation,
who called for tough punishment for the guards.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said customer Lu Shanhui, who was seven months
pregnant, was led into an office for questioning by Aijia
supermarket staff, in Guangdong province, shortly after she bought
her purchases on December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the office, the newspaper said, the staff repeatedly asked
Lu whether she stole anything from the supermarket, and threatened
to beat her after she denied their charges.
</P>
<P>
The paper said she was searched by a shopwoman but nothing was
found except some cash and her identification card.
</P>
<P>
It said Zhang Shuiqiang, head of the supermarket's theft
control department, forced Lu into a room on the fourth floor. Lu
said Zhang left and came back with a kitchen knife and mimicked
cutting off her hand after she insisted that she had not taken
anything.
</P>
<P>
Lu said she struggled, but Zhang, with the help of other four
men, chopped four fingers from her right hand. Zhang then kicked
her and told her to "get lost," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
She retrieved three of her four severed fingers and took a
motorcycle to a local hospital, where doctors operated to reattach
the digits to her right hand.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said it will be a week before they know if the
operation was successful.
</P>
<P>
Lu's unborn child had a rapid heart rate and needed extra
oxygen, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
Local police tried to find Zhang Shuiqiang immediately after
hearing of the case, but he had fled the supermarket and was
reportedly at large.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the incident shocked the Dongguan local
government and police, who have been ordered to find Zhang. The
supermarket was closed by the local government for more than two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Lu's case has infuriated Chinese throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Some other Beijing-based newspapers, including Beijing Youth
Daily, also carried reports of the case.

<HEADLINE> Convicts' Organs for Transplantation Refuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The recent reports in the
South China Morning Post and other media that the hospital
attached to Guangzhou Zhongshan Medical Science University used
organs from convicts' awaiting execution for liver transplants are
pure fabrication, said an official with the university today.
</P>
<P>
He said the university may sue the source of the lie.
</P>
<P>
The official said his university and the hospital have never
bought any organs of convicts awaiting execution, and uses only
livers supplied from volunteer donors.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, only fees for surgery and immunological
rejection are charged to liver transplant patients, in addition to
hospitalization expenses. The media reports of other fees are
totally made up.
</P>
<P>
The official denounced media reports such as those in the Hong
Kong-based English language daily, saying that they violate
ethical standards of journalism and have greatly damaged the
reputation of the university and the hospital. All medical staff
and teaching staff have expressed their indignation over the
matter.
</P>
<P>
He said that the university will continue its work, including
organ transplants, in accordance with the country's laws and
humanitarian principles.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou and James Holger, the resident representative here of
the U.N. Secretary General, said Tuesday night that the
rapprochement between Greece and Turkey will benefit Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting here, both emphasized the significance
of contacts and consultations between the Greek and Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Holger said that the rapprochement between Greece and Turkey
will, sooner or later, "have for the area a spillover effect in
Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated he has found some encouraging signs in the
proximity talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, but he also
admitted ,"it will be a very long process."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens
coup by Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The first round of the U.N.-sponsored proximity talks between
the two communities were held last month in New York in an effort
to pave the way for a final solution to Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou agreed that the Greek-Turkish rapprochement in the
recent months "showed that Greeks and Turks not only can live
together but can have very positive outcomes when they work
together."
</P>
<P>
"This is a very hopeful sign for Cyprus," Papandreou said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is "very important at this time to support
these meetings between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, and
between Greeks and Turks" because it is part of a very important
process which will certainly lead to the solution we need in this
region.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou arrived here Tuesday on a two-day visit. He had been
here in late November before the start of the proximity talks.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Cabinet Approves Media Free Zone Setup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian Cabinet has given
the green light for the establishment of a media free zone in the
kingdom with a projected investment of 400 to 500 million Jordanian
dinars ( some 560 to 700 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy meeting on Tuesday, the cabinet headed by Prime
Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh approved a 20-article draft law on the
construction and operation of the media free zone which is expected
to attract more investments into the cash-strapped kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Text of the draft law was not released to the press, but
Rawabdeh told reporters Tuesday evening that investors will have
absolute freedom of expression under the draft law if they operate
in the zone.
</P>
<P>
The project was aimed at attracting Jordanian, Arab and foreign
investments. Complete freedom will be given to set up radio,
television and cinema production companies in the zone, he added.
</P>
<P>
The draft law will be presented to the parliament for debate and
approval in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
The government has chosen 400 dunums (375,720 square meters) of
land close to the Jordanian Television Cooperation in Southern
Amman for construction of the media free zone, and another 200
dunums (187,860 square meters) of land will be added to the zone if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
Initial estimates showed that at least 400 million dinars (560
million dollars) of investments are needed to set up the media free
zone, which will provide some 10,000 job opportunities to the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in the kingdom remained well above 10
percent in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The first stage of operations will involve granting licenses and
permits to investors who are interested in the zone as well as
setting up the zone's basic infrastructure, Jordanian officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Set up Information Infrastruture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is planning to set up an
organization, called "Turkish National Information Infrastructure
(TUENA)", to deal with the requirements for information in the so-
called new "knowledge century."
</P>
<P>
A study on the project, conducted under the coordination of the
Ministry of Transport, is underway at the Presidential Palace in
Ankara, the Anatolia News Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech at the introductory session Tuesday,
President Suleyman Demirel said the realization of the advent of "
knowledge century" helps Turkey join the ranks of the advanced
world.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member European Union (EU) accepted Turkey as a candidate
member at its Helsinki summit last November, a move Turkey had
wished the EU to take during the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has anticipated to become a full EU member in 2004.
</P>
<P>
In his New Year report "Turkey Toward 2000", Demirel said that "
Turkey will face a bright future and assume a place as one of the
10 major developed countries of the world."
</P>
<P>
"We keep telling our people that this is the century of
knowledge. Inevitably, there are certain requirements of this
century which we have to abide by," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We declare with the TUENA project that our people, from
scientists to farmers in the fields, will make adjustments to
prepare themselves for the time when we can accommodate the
requirements of the century of knowledge," he added.
</P>
<P>
Demirel also highlighted the key role of science and technology
by saying that "Turkey's taking its place in the front rows of
economic development is contingent upon its taking its place in the
front rows of scientific and technological development."
</P>
<P>
"The TUENA project will pave the way for bright days in the next
decade and we should do our utmost to promote this project for our
future," he added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi National Airlines Suffers Loss Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's national airlines,
Biman suffered a loss of 336.9 million taka (about 6.6 million U.S.
dollars) during the 1998-99 fiscal year ending on June 30, 1999,
as per provisional accounting of the year, Minister for Works
Mosharraf Hossain told the parliament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The revenue yield of Biman was not as expected due to steep
competition from other renowned airlines, non-availability of
rebate on fuel lifted from domestic sources, absence of capital
investment and replenishment of 1.6 billion taka (about 31.37
million dollars) from the government for purchase of two aircraft
costing 2.67 billion taka (about 52.35 million dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
Hossain said that to reduce the loss, Biman had already added
one A310-300 and one DC-10 aircraft to its fleet on dry lease for
increasing flights on profitable routes, and an inter-ministerial
meeting had decided to reintroduce rebate on fuel for aircraft
lifting fuel from domestic sources.
</P>
<P>
A total of 486 people, including 59 officers and 427 ordinary
employees, were recruited in the national airlines from June 1,
1996 to January 4, 2000, he added.
</P>
<P>
Biman operates on 25 international destinations in 21 countries
and seven domestic destinations, carrying 367,000 passengers on
domestic routes and 866,600 on international routes in 1998,
according to the airlines' statistics.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Sarawak State Records Lower Trade Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Sarawak, Malaysia's
largest state, chalked up a trade surplus of 9.608 billion ringgit
(about 2.528 billion U.S. dollars) in the first 11 months of 1999,
a 9 percent decline over that in the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Lower trade surplus was due to the relatively stronger growth

exports, according to the Sarawak Statistics Department Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the period under review, Sarawak's total exports
amounted to 20.182 billion ringgit (about 5.311 billion dollars)

dollars),Bernama news agency reported quoting the preliminary
external trade figures released by the department in Kuching, the
state's capital.
</P>
<P>
In exports, liquefied natural gas (LNG) continued to be the top
revenue earner for the resources-rich state with earnings sharing
27 percent of total exports during the January-November 1999
period.
</P>
<P>
Crude petroleum was the second largest revenue earner,
accounting for 18 percent of total exports, plain plywood, the
third biggest export commodity, took a share of 12 percent of
total exports and sawlog, the fourth largest revenue earner,
accounted for 10.7 percent of total exports during the first 11
months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The four major export commodities accounted for more than two-
thirds of total exports.
</P>
<P>
The state's other export items included agricultural products
such as palm oil, pepper (both black and white) and Palm Kernel
oil.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Angolan Refugees in Namibia in Dire Need </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 4,000 Angolan refugees
staying in Namibia without means of subsistence are currently
facing grave humanitarian crisis, an official source said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Due to the lack of food, clothes and medicaments, those
refugees, especially the children, are suffering much from the
malnutrition and various epidemic diseases, said an Angolan
diplomat working on the spot.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Angolan refugees are also facing the threat of
death, since they could be mistaken by the Namibian government
troops as members of the National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a six-year-old child was mistakenly killed at the
break of day by the Namibian frontier defense soldiers when over
40 Angolan refugees from the Calai Region were crossing the
border, who were mistaken by a Namibian farmer as Angola's rebel
UNITA soldiers and invaders into his property.
</P>
<P>
According to the unidentified diplomat, some conditions have
been created in those places with access to resources. But the
refugees are still in dire need for immediate support provided by
the Angolan central government.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Namibian government had permitted the
Armed Forces of Angola to cross the border and enter into the
Namibian territory in their pursuit of the smashed UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan rebel soldiers had been accused by the Namibian
government of disturbing the peace and order in north Namibia,
said the source.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Administrate Community Service of Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The newly introduced Gacaca
(participatory justice) tribunals will demand prisoners, either
accused of genocide or other crimes, serve the community
voluntarily and without pay as punishment, Rwandan Justice
Minister Jean de Dieu Mucyo has said.
</P>
<P>
When Gacaca tribunals begin operating in April this year, "it
is supposed that a person will serve part of his/her punishment in
detention and another part outside serving the community," the
Rwanda News Agency Wednesday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
"A team of experts has been invited from other countries such as
Brazil, Uganda and Zimbabwe where community service has successful
been introduced, to come and advise on how we can adopt the same,"
Mucyo said.
</P>
<P>
However, "this is not provided for by the law," the justice
minister noted Tuesday at a two-day seminar on how community
service of prisoners will be administered.
</P>
<P>
According to Penal Reform International, an organization
assisting on training prison workers and other prison issues in
the country, the introduction of community service of prisoners
will relieve the government of costs incurred in the maintenance
of prisoners.
</P>
<P>
This will also help in integrating the prisoners back in the
society to foster unity and reconciliation," the organization
said.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to find ways of speeding up genocide cases, the
Rwandan government intends to set up a new form community-based
tribunals to try more than 125,000 genocide suspects already
detained in prisons.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Commercial-Scale Plant to Produce Plastics From Corn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A grain company in Nebraska
will be the first U.S. commercial-scale plant to produce
polylactic acid (PLA), a plastic, from corn, the National Corn
Growers Association (NCGA) of the United States reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The plant will turn corn into polymers, small chips or pellets
of plastic-like material that manufacturers will then process into
fabrics for clothing as well as plastic for cups, food containers,
packaging and home and office furnishings such as carpets.
</P>
<P>
Fabrics made from PLA have the feel of silk and the durability
of polyester. Other PLA products may include plastic wrap and
plastic bottles.
</P>
<P>
Culminating research and market development on polylactic acid,
the Cargill Dow plant will open the door to a market that could
eventually consume 500 million bushels (about 12.7 million tons)
of corn per year, the NCGA said.
</P>
<P>
The plant, to be on line by late 2001, will use 40,000 bushels
(about 1,016 tons) of corn per day for an annual use of 14 million
bushels (about 355,600 tons).
</P>
<P>
The PLA application research has been a priority for several
years for corn growers at the state and national levels, according
to the NCGA.
</P>
<P>
The plastics industry is huge, and PLA has great
characteristics for new products.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1994, the NCGA said, its leaders knew PLA was a
great idea: a durable new plastic that is 100 percent
biodegradable and made from a renewable resource, corn.
</P>
<P>
From that year, the national and state corn growers
associations funded research on ways to use PLA while working with
Cargill, urging the grain company to pursue PLA's commercial
development.
</P>
<P>
Corn is the number one field crop in the United States, which
produced 248 million tons in 1998.

PARIS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Bosses of French small trucking
companies have agreed to lift their blockade of border checkpoints
after striking a deal with Minister of Transport Jean-Claude
Gayssot early Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal for the lifting the blockade from tonight," said a

<HEADLINE> UN Agencies Call for Prohibition on Soldiers Under 18 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Five United Nations agencies
have urged at a working group meeting to establish 18 as the
minimum age for both recruitment and participation in armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement made public here Wednesday, the UN bodies
said, "We strongly appeal that 18 years be the minimum age for
voluntary and forced recruitment and for participation in armed
conflict, applicable both to governments and non-state entities
and for both international and internal armed conflicts."
</P>
<P>
The five agencies are the Committee on the Rights of the Child,
the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General
for Children and Armed Conflict, the UN Children's Fund, the UN
High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Working Group on the Draft Optional Protocol to the
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of
Children in Armed Conflict is meeting in Geneva to finalize a
draft text that would raise the minimum age for recruitment and
participation of children in armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Although the Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes
18 as the generally applicable age at which adulthood begins, it
has one explicit exception: the recruitment and participation of
children in armed conflict is permissible as early as age 15.
</P>
<P>
The draft optional protocol is intended to address this
exception.

<HEADLINE> Boxing Promoter: Too Late to Re-arrange Tyson Bout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Boxing promoter Frank Warren
said on Wednesday that it was too late to re-arrange a fight which
is scheduled for January 29 after Britain's Home Office said it
would not allow Mike Tyson to enter this country.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, former heavyweight world champion, could be in an
impossible situation for a fight against British heavyweight
champion Julius Francis because of previous convictions that would
normally bar a foreign citizen from entering Britain,
</P>
<P>
Warren said moving the fight to the U.S. or another venue in
Europe was not an option. "It's too late to arrange, it's two
weeks away," he told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
"We've laid out a lot of money - non-refundable deposits, air
fares and so on - and I'm not accepting it because the way this
has been handled has been very, very bad.
</P>
<P>
"But I do believe that common sense will prevail and this will
be sorted out to everyone's satisfaction."
</P>
<P>
Tyson is due to arrive in London within the next week to begin
training for the fight but the Home Office said on Tuesday that it
was still considering his right to enter Britain.
</P>
<P>
"On the understanding that he will enter in the next couple of
weeks we are considering his right to enter," a Home Office
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The rules state that entry is normally refused, except where
there are strong compassionate reasons, if an offence was
committed which would be punishable in the United Kingdom with
imprisonment of 12 months or more," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office stance was reinforced by Prime Minister Tony
Blair's spokesman who told reporters: "As I understand it, the
room for discretion is very, very limited."
</P>
<P>
Tyson was convicted of rape in the United States in 1992 and
sentenced to six years in jail. He then served another term for an
attack on two middle-aged motorists, from which he was freed only
eight months ago.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Rebounding of Prices by Yearend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China's continuously falling
retail prices might rebound by yearend with the national economy
growing steadily at an annual seven percent this year, a senior
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Mengkui, director of the Development Research Center of
the State Council, expressed his upbeat outlook for the future of
the economy at a national working conference in the capital of
northeast China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
"China's economy is in an upswing out of the current
difficulties," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 saw the fast recovery of China's export, an
overall improvement in performance of state enterprises, a
reducing stockpile of industrial products, and a slowdown of
declining prices which lasted for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
In light of these promising signs, the retail prices, an
important index for the judgement of deflation, will stop dropping
by the end of this year and may pick up afterwards, according to
Wang.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, this year's economic growth will be affected by
such negatives as the small increase in infrastructure investment
at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Wang estimated that China would continue its expanding fiscal
policy in 2001 in spite of these factors.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted pro-active fiscal policies since 1998 through
issuance of extra treasury bonds to increase investment,
attempting to maintain a steady economic growth by stimulating
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Although the proportion of national debt in China's gross
domestic product(GDP) is still smaller than the world's average,
it now accounts for a considerable part of the state budget and
keeps growing at a high speed.
</P>
<P>
The expanding fiscal policy is a short-term approach which will
not last long, said Wang, adding that the development research
center will carry out research into prevention measures that will
ward off potential risks.
</P>
<P>
"Under the current favorable international and domestic
environment, it is doubtless that China will keep its annual
growth rate at seven to eight percent in the next decade," Wang
said.

<HEADLINE> China's Forex Reserves Hit 154.7 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign exchange
reserves hit 154.7 billion U.S. dollars at the end of 1999, an
increase of 9.8 billion U.S. dollars from a year earlier,
according to a report released by the People's Bank of China here
today.
</P>
<P>
The report says that the monetary policies adopted by the
central bank to coordinate the state's macro-economic policies for
expanding domestic demand have achieved notable results in 1999,
with sufficient money supply for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The report cites statistics as saying that by the end of 1999,
the outstanding amount of broad money (M2) increased by 14.7
percent year-on-year to 11.9 trillion yuan, hitting the expected
controlling target.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding amount of narrow money (M1) was over 4.58
trillion yuan, an increase of 17.7 percent, or nearly six
percentage points, from at the end of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also reported a yearly 20.1 percent rise in
the outstanding amount of money in circulation (M0), which stood
at more than 1.34 trillion yuan at the end of 1999, when 225.1
billion yuan of cash was put into circulation.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, the outstanding amount of loans
extended by all financial institutions was more than 9.37 trillion
yuan at the end of last year, up 12.5 percent, or 1.08 trillion
yuan, from a year earlier in terms of comparable terms.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding amount of deposits with the financial
institutions increased 13.7 percent year on year to more than 10.
87 trillion yuan, with a 14.5 percent growth in corporate deposits.
</P>
<P>
Rural and urban residents' deposits showed an increase of 11.6
percent to reach 5.96 trillion yuan at the end of 1999, but the
growth rate was 5.5 percentage points lower than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1999, the exchange rate of the Chinese currency
Renminbi was one U.S. dollar for 8.2793 yuan, compared with 8.2789
yuan at the end of the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Urges Resolution of Finance, Tax Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese Communist
Party official said here today that outstanding problems in the
finance and tax areas should be addressed as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (
CPC) and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee,
said at a seminar high-ranking Party and government officials
which began today at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee
that there are three major problems in the finance and tax sectors.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of fiscal income to gross domestic product and
that of central fiscal income to the overall fiscal income of the
country are still relatively low, said Hu, who is also China's
vice-president.
</P>
<P>
The second problem is the fiscal expenditure is relatively
irrational; the third is that the management of finance and tax
departments is still loose.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who also serves as headmaster of the Party School, told
about 100 ministerial-level officials of provincial governments
and Party committees that those problems have become an obstacle
to the further growth of China's economy and social causes, and
have therefore caught the attention of all of society.
</P>
<P>
He urged leaders of all levels to focus on those problems, and
look for ways to address the problems.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hu asked leading officials at all levels to become
familiar with the general knowledge, policies and regulations of
finance and tax.
</P>
<P>
Xiang Huaicheng, minister of finance, delivered the first
lecture on China's financial reform at the seminar, which is
expected to last a week.

<HEADLINE> mee011204 hke -- Iranian Foreign Minister Not to Visit Egypt Soon, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Despite of the considerable
developments in the Tehran-Cairo ties, Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi has no immediate plan to visit Egypt, Iranian Deputy
Foreign Minister for African-Arab Affairs Mohammad Sadr said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local daily Iran News published on
Wednesday, Sadr denied the press report that Kharrazi would visit
Cairo late this month.
</P>
<P>
He said that outstanding problems remained between the two
countries such as the Camp David Accord signed between Egypt and
Israel and the Khaled Islamboli street in Tehran named after the
assassin of former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Egypt severed their diplomatic relations after the 1979
Islamic revolution as Tehran accused Cairo of signing the Camp
David peace accord with Israel, the first one by an Arab country.
</P>
<P>
With the warm-up of ties in recent years, Egyptian officials
have called on Iran to remove the hurdle for revival of the Cairo-
Tehran ties by changing the name of the Khaled Islamboli street in
Tehran. Islamboli, an Islamic extremist, shot dead Sadat in Cairo
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
In return, some Iranian officials and media urged the Egyptian
side to demolish the tomb of former Iranian shah in Cairo as a
condition for Iran to change the street name.
</P>
<P>
Sadr said that current relations between Iran and Egypt have
undergone considerable improvement and the foreign ministers of the
two countries met on several occasions while bilateral commercial
ties have been established.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have concurred on many sensitive issues concerning
Islam worldwide as in the case of Bosnia, Kosovo and the Turkey-
Syria dispute, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official expressed welcome to the establishment of
the non-governmental Iran-Egypt Friendship Association early this
month and termed it as a step in expanding bilateral contacts and
ties between the Iranian and the Egyptian peoples.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the Iran-Egypt Friendship Association, Sabah
Zanganeh, said that his association would lobby for the resumption
of the ties between Iran and Egypt, though it would not exert
pressure on the Iranian government over the issue.

number of the world's renowned personalities, according to local
newspapers published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Mohammed Al-Saqer has said the conference
will include a packed agenda, touching upon all aspects of Kuwait's
possible future relations with Iraq that invaded it almost ten
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Al-Saqer said that due to "geographic factors in the region and
to the pre-destined fate of the two nations, there should be now or
later a kind of relationship between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
One of the issues that should be discussed at a such a
conference, he said, should be the type of economic and commercial
ties between them, without neglecting the security aspects that
loom on those issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a parliamentary source said the three-day conference
will be divided into six sessions that will cover local, Gulf, Arab
and international dimensions of Iraqi-Kuwaiti relations.
</P>
<P>
The first day sessions will concentrate on a post-Saddam Iraq
and what will Kuwait's position be in a new post-Saddam era whether
economically, politically and at the security level.
</P>
<P>
The second day sessions, in which representatives of the three
main Iraqi opposition groups are expected to participate, will
discuss how Iraqis should view Kuwait, the Kuwaiti source said.
</P>
<P>
The rest sessions will focus on the economic, geographic and
financial aspects of certain areas of Iraq and Kuwait, he added.
</P>
<P>
The idea to organize such a seminar has gained support from
senior government officials. State Minister for Foreign Affairs
Suleiman Majid Al-Shaheen, who had earlier a meeting with the
parliament committee, had commended the panel for such a
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
But Al-Shaheen stressed that the idea of holding such a
conference must serve the benefit of Kuwait and the region.
</P>
<P>
Almost nine years after the end of the 1991 Gulf war that ended
the seven-month Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, relations between the
two Arab neighbor are still icy. Kuwait has ruled out any contact
with Baghdad if Saddam Hussein remains in power.
</P>
<P>
Other key issues including Kuwaiti war prisoners allegedly still
held in Iraq are also blocking a potential rapprochement between
the two rivals.

Wednesday to start a four-day visit aimed at boosting ties between
the countries.
</P>

role as an Arab-Israeli peace facilitator, experts said. Levy will
update King Mohammed VI on the latest development in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>

televisions Tuesday after his returning from the United States,
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak appeared confident over the
future of talks with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
Barak said the talks have reached a vital stage and difficult
decisions will be demanded. He stressed that Israel did not promise
anything to the Syrian side, but will not ignore agreements reached
in the past.
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The fate of Israeli President Ezer Weizman is in the hands of

<HEADLINE> Iran Repeats Readiness to Solve Islands Dispute with UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister
for African-Arab Affairs Mohammad Sadr has reiterated Tehran's
readiness to solve a long-standing dispute with the United Arab
Emirates(UAE) over the three islands in the Persian Gulf, an
Iranian daily reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tehran is ready to talk with the UAE "regarding the current
misunderstanding concerning the 1971 memorandum of understanding
(between Iran and the UAE on the islands)," Sadr said in an
interview with the local daily Iran News.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the islands of Abu Musa, the Greater and Lesser
Tunbs at the mouth of the strategic Hormoz Strait in 1971 after the
British withdrawal from the region.
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and the UAE claim full sovereignty over the islands,
despite of an agreement to co-rule the Abu Musa island, which was
predominantly populated by Arabs.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the UAE called for an international
arbitration, but Iran has insisted on bilateral talks with the UAE
over the sovereignty of the islands.
</P>
<P>
"We do not think that this issue is so important that we will
not be able to solve the problems bilaterally," Sadr said, adding
that with the expansion of bilateral ties, the two countries will
solve their misunderstanding and dispute more easily.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed regret that the UAE has not yet responded to
Iran's call for bilateral talks and said that Tehran would like to
expand its ties with the UAE in the same manner as Iran has done
with other neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the establishment of a tripartite committee by the
Gulf Cooperation Council over the Iran-UAE dispute, he said that "
the committee initially adopted a stand that showed it was not
neutral and insinuated that the Iranian islands belonged to the
UAE, which we do not accept."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Iran welcomes each step that will convince the
UAE to attend negotiations on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Hearing on Case of Deposed Pak PM Halted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A High Court judge in Karachi
Wednesday refused to hear the case of treason and hijacking
against deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif for what he said the
presence of intelligence agents in his courtroom.
</P>
<P>
The judge of the High Court, Justice Shabir Ahmed believed that
fair trial could not be conducted in the presence of intelligence
agents and army personnel in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
A report by News Network International, a private news agency,
said that Ahmed's refusal to hear the Sharif case is a major
setback for the government led by General Pervaiz Musharraf, which
filed the charges against Sharif and other men, including his
brother Shahbaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence agents left the courtroom when the judge took
serious notice of their presence. The judge adjourned the hearing
until January 17 and returned it to the anti-terrorist court.
</P>
<P>
"We were taken by surprise," said Raja Qureshi, prosecutor and
attorney general. "But the judge has exercised his power. He has
the power to assign the case to any other judge. We respect the
law," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Qureshi didn't believe that it was a setback "because
we have a strong case."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former prime minister Sharif has steadfastly
maintained his innocence. He has accused the army of hijacking
democracy and of fabricating the charges to justify the military
coup.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Enrich Senior Civil Servants  With IT Vision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand adopted a new approach
to keep up with the changes of the new millennium, which are
prompted largely by the development of information technology (IT),
by beefing up IT education for senior civil servants in state
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Chadamas Thuvasethana, director of National IT Committee
Secretariat Office, said Wednesday that the cabinet has approved a
Strategy and Operation Plan drafted by the National Electronics
and Computer Technology Center.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, a so-called "vision-creating" project will be
launched to help senior executives in public agencies create
vision on the impact of the information technology and the future
development of their individual departments in the IT-era.
</P>
<P>
Permanent secretaries and director-generals of all departments
in state agencies will have to take a half-day course co-organized
by the Office of Civil Servant Commission and the Ministry of
Science, Technology and Environment, Chadamas told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet assigned all ministries, departments and state
enterprises to undertake the project by inviting speakers to spend
a minimum of three hours on briefing IT knowledge for senior civil
servants at the ministries' regular annual meetings, she said.
</P>
<P>
Each ministry is also asked to organize courses for lower-
ranked executives, Chadamas said.
</P>
<P>
"The plan will enable high-ranking civil servants to have
visions on the IT development in the world and on how IT will
improve government services to the public and the national
development," she said.
</P>
<P>
The new plan is a follow-up of a computer training program
approved by the cabinet in 1995 for civil servants of C-6 level in
order to reduce computer illiteracy in state agencies.

<HEADLINE> Thai Sugarcane Production Not to Drop Much Despite  Low Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's sugarcane production
in the 2000-2001 crop year is not expected to drop sharply from
the current year despite the continued slump in world sugar prices,
the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Output in 2000-2001 is expected to be at 52.56 million tons
compared with 55 million tons in the 1999-2000 crop season.
</P>
<P>
This is because this year's consumption requirement will not
change much from the previous year, the ministry's Center for
Agricultural Information said.
</P>
<P>
However, the plantation areas for sugarcane will be reduced to
5.74 million rai (918,400 hectares) from the current 5.86 million
rai (937,600 hectares), the center said.
</P>
<P>
The price of sugar, now quoted on the New York Exchange at 5.83
U.S. cents a pound (454 grams), is expected to fall to five U.S.
cents by mid-year.
</P>
<P>
The decline is expected to discourage growers further, as their
production costs already exceeded market prices.
</P>
<P>
According to the Agricultural Economic Research Department, the
pre-harvest cane price was 120 baht (3.19 dollars) per ton under
the production cost of 460 baht (12.2 dollars), forcing the
government to seek funds to compensate growers.
</P>
<P>
The government is extending loans of 100 baht (2.65 dollars)
per ton to sugarcane farmers.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that world sugar production would total 134.7
million tons in 1999-2000, while consumption would be only 126.7
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Thailand exported about 3.8 million tons of sugar in the 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Only eight of China's 47 major

<P>
In terms of air quality alone, only Guilin and the
aforementioned eight cities were up to standard.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 6 Rebels, 1 Soldier Killed in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- At least six Muslim rebels, one
soldier have been killed and seven government troopers wounded
since last Saturday as hostilities flared up anew in Maguindanao
province in the southern Philippines, the Philippine government
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between government forces and the separatist Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) broke out in Shariff Aguak and
Datu Piang towns both in the province of Maguindanao last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace said in a statement that the MILF
troops which stormed the municipal hall of Talayan on Monday
vacated the premises Tuesday night after negotiators from the
government and the MILF reached an accord early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Government troops immediately took over the municipal hall
seized for three days by some 100 MILF rebels and are currently
securing the premises for re-occupation by the displaced local
officials, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between the Army and the MILF have displaced more
than 10,600 evacuees from Shariff Aguak and Datu Piang towns in
Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
Government agencies have temporarily housed the evacuees in
various public school buildings, forcing authorities to suspend
classes in these war-torn areas.
</P>
<P>
But despite the development, Secretary Orlando Mercado of the
Department of National Defense said that the government remains
hopeful that the peace efforts with the MILF will continue.
</P>
<P>
He noted that both sides are scheduled to discuss the details
of the formal peace talks on January 17. Part of the agenda, he
said, would be to set up a mechanism to address disagreements.
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping that there would be not only a ceasefire. We
also hope peace talks would produce a mechanism to prevent future
occurrences of this problem," he said.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi Stock Market KSE
index Wednesday crossed the 1,500-point mark amidst buying spree.
</P>
<P>
The KSE-100 Index maintains its strong posture, registering an
increase of 40.78 points to reach 1,540.78 in the morning session
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers expect the market to sustain the positive trend for the
next day or two.
</P>
<P>
The market, which opened Wednesday morning after a break of
five days, maintained high spirit with which it had entered into
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
It thus managed to get out of severe depression due to the
hovering issue between the government and the independent power
producers (IPPs) during the last 30 months.
</P>
<P>
The new target for the index has been set at 1,600 points which,
the dealers expected, will not be difficult to achieve if the
things go on smoothly.

<HEADLINE> Small Business in Australia to Receive GST Voucher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of small
businesses in Australia will begin receiving their 200-Australian
dollar (132 U.S. dollars) vouchers for the goods and services tax
(GST) from Thursday, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The vouchers are meant to offset the cost of the new tax system
but have been denounced by the federal opposition as an insult and
a farce, the AAP said.
</P>
<P>
The cost of new cash registers, computer software and other
changes required for the GST has been put at up to 7,000
Australian dollars (4,620 U.S. dollars) for the average business,
the AAP said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government set aside over 500 million Australian
dollars (330 million U.S. dollars) to help with the transition,
but eventually decided to simply hand out the bulk of the money in
the form of 200-Australian dollar vouchers.
</P>
<P>
Opposition small business spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon said April
1 would have been a more appropriate day to hand out the vouchers.
</P>
<P>
"Receiving a voucher from the government for 200 Australian
dollars toward the purchase of a 5,000-Australian dollar (3,300 U.
S. dollars) cash register will justifiably leave small business
operators unimpressed," Fitzgibbon said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, the government said the criticism is unfair, because
many of the costs of the GST for business can be claimed as tax
deductions, and the voucher is only a small part of the assistance
it is offering.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Warns Unlicensed Food Manufacturers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian authorities
have warned that food manufacturers will meet tough fines and
prison sentences if they still go unlicensed, the Daily Mail
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move was necessitated due to a raise in the number of
companies manufacturing foods without approval of the National
Food Control Commission, registrar of the commission, Fabian
Magoma, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"All those who fail to comply with the food regulations will be
taken to court immediately," said the registrar.
</P>
<P>
Magoma disclosed that more than 60 companies have been found to
be manufacturing food without the licenses, threatening the lives
of people and denying the government revenue.
</P>
<P>
The culprit companies, all based in capital Dar es Salaam,
received an ultimatum on December 24 last year, and they have to
acquire their licenses by January 30.
</P>
<P>
They were urged to deliver to the food control commission
samples of foods they manufacture and labels for analysis as part
of the licensing process.
</P>
<P>
Section seven of the 1978 Food Control of Quality Act 10
stipulates that any person contravening food regulations is liable
for a one-million- Tanzanian shilling (about 1,250 U.S. dollars)
fine or a five-year imprisonment, or both if convicted.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the companies claimed that they have complied
with all the requirements and filled in all the necessary forms
but their registration was delayed by the authorities.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Denies Having Intercepted Ethiopian Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea has denied
Ethiopia's allegation that it intercepted Ethiopian goods at ports
of Massawa and Assab following the outbreak of war between the two
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Walter Information Center, Ethiopian private news agency,
Wednesday quoted Eritrean authorities as saying that goods
intercepted at the ports after Ethio-Eritrean war broke out did
not belong to Ethiopia but to international aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean government has urged the Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) to drop the case filed by Ethiopia
over goods stranded in Eritrean ports.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea's application to the COMESA maintains that Ethiopia's
suit for compensation falls outside the jurisdiction of the
trading group.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia lodged the first formal charge with the COMESA on
September 25, 1999 against Eritrea for illegally detaining its
goods at ports of Assab and Massawa.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia said in its charges that Eritrea had seized
consignments of 139, 500 tons of Ethiopian export and import items
since the countries engaged in the border war in May of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The charges said the seized goods are valued at about 133
million U.S. dollars which is in addition to financial losses and
other expenses incurred by concerned exporting or importing
organizations.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the COMESA had formed a high-level
committee for the verification of the legality of Ethiopia's
appeal and objections raised by Eritrea concerning the matter.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA's court began official functions on September 20,
1999.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A fund to assist member states
of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)
address the effects of a free trade area due by October 31 this
year, a COMESA investment official has said.
</P>
<P>
Director of investment promotion and private sector development
division, Chungu Mwila, said the COMESA would like to generate its
own financial capacity that would assist member countries to set
up sound infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
"The facility called Integration Fund will basically assist
least developed countries in the community to mobilize resources
for development after the implementation of the zero tariff
rates," The Post newspaper Wednesday quoted Mwila as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said once set up, the fund would support the member states'
economies from the expected shortfall in revenue collections after
the implementation of the COMESA free trade area.
</P>
<P>
Mwila said the COMESA discussed issues of trade imbalances that
were raised by some member states and also realized that after the
process of liberalization, revenue from imports had dwindled.
</P>
<P>
He said the integration fund facility was thought to be a
measure that would assist the ailing economies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mwila said preparations for the regional economic conference
that will focus on the trade, to take place in Cairo late next
month, have reached an advanced stage.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA expects over 1,000 participants with sound project
proposals from the region to attend the Cairo conference.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Supports Iraq's Demand for U.N. Sanction  Lifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Wednesday pledged
continuing support for Iraq's efforts to have the 10-year old
United Nations sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
It is vital for both Malaysian and Iraqi permanent
representatives at the U.N. to ensure whatever measures adopted by
U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC),
would reinforce optimism towards the lifting of the sanctions,
Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told reporters
Wednesday after holding talks with his Iraqi counterpart Tariq
Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said UNMOVIC is the new agency charged with
dismantling weapons of mass destruction in Iraq which is "still
apprehensive about accepting the new commission."
</P>
<P>
Tariq explained to Malaysia the effects of the United Nations
sanctions and resolutions against his country, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said he and Tariq also discussed upgrading bilateral
ties, especially economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
He said that for this purpose, the Malaysia-Iraq Joint
Commission would meet in Baghdad this year, but the date, he said,
has not been fixed yet.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq also expressed keenness in direct purchase of more
Malaysian palm oil.
</P>
<P>
Tariq, accompanied by six senior officials, arrived here
Tuesday for a four-day visit at the invitation of Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi, which the Foreign Ministry said earlier in a statement is
aimed at enhancing bilateral ties between Kuala Lumpur and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi deputy prime minister is also scheduled to meet
Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar to exchange views on
bilateral matters and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, a non-permanent member of the U.N. Security Council,
abstained in the vote on the U.N. resolution adopted last December
17 which called for the setting up of a new arms inspection agency
to complete the dismantling of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The rebels of the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) has launched a surprise attack on a
displaced people's camp in western Uganda, causing an unspecified
number of deaths and injuries, a Ugandan newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The surprise attack on the Bundwirume Displaced People's Camp,
four kilometers from the Bundibugyo town on Tuesday morning,
involved some 100 ADF rebels, the Monitor daily said.
</P>
<P>
Ten people were feared killed and nine others seriously injured
when the ADF rebels set ablaze several huts in the camp, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
At least four bodies were removed from the smouldering ashes
although more people could have been burnt beyond recognition, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The injured people were admitted to Bundibugyo hospital.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that the government troops are still
pursuing the fleeing rebels.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Bundibugyo remains precarious and the rebels
reportedly continue to roam the countryside in their hundreds.
</P>
<P>
Although government soldiers were deployed to protect the
villages, they still could not prevent all rebel attacks in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The ADF rebels recently launched a spate of attacks on soft
targets to get food stuffs and recruits.
</P>
<P>
They entered into western Uganda from eastern parts of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo after they were repulsed by
Uganda's government troops there.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Launch Energy Conservation Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Power Development
Board(PDB), the parent organization of the country's power sector,
will launch an Energy Conservation Project by February to save
about 200 megawatt electricity per day in the crisis-ridden
country, The Bangladesh Observer reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The project was aimed at cutting down the increasing expenses
the board has to spend to purchase power from the independent
power producers in the country.
</P>
<P>
PDB Chairman Quamrul Islam Siddiq was quoted as saying that the
project was likely to be launched by next month to ensure power
saving at the consumers end.
</P>
<P>
The project would save at least 40-60 percent of electricity
per valve, he said.
</P>
<P>
A top-level PDB source said the board was going to introduce
the new project to reduce the huge financial loss incurred by PDB
mainly because of monthly payment of power generation by the
independent power producers.
</P>
<P>
Presently there were four independent power producers in the
country, and the board, the sole authority to generate, transmit
and distribute power across the country, was purchasing
electricity from them at a higher rate than its selling rate at
the consumers end, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At the preliminary stage under the project, the board would
release at least 400,000 energy-saving valve, which would save
both the electric bills of the consumers and the PDB.
</P>
<P>
The project was expected to save at least 120 million taka (
about 2.35 million U.S. dollars) a year by introducing new energy-
saving lamps.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project would be launched in the
southern region of the country by February and later extended to
all over the country, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The present production capacity of the PDB is between 2,000 and
2,100 megawatts, whereas the country's total demand is about 2,300
megawatts.

<HEADLINE> Thai Oil Debt Revamp Set to Cut Bad Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A successful debt-
restructuring agreement between Thai Oil Co. Ltd. and its 124
creditors will reduce non-performing loans in the Thai financial
system by 407.7 million U.S. dollars, or around 16 billion baht,
The Nation reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sivaporn Dardarananda, vice chairman of the Corporate Debt
Restructuring Advisory Committee, was quoted as saying the Central
Bankruptcy Court has received the creditors' petition on the oil
company's debt-restructuring plan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The financially ailing oil company owes a total of 2.26
billion dollars to both local and foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
Chulchit Bunyakiat, general manager of Thai Oil, said in a
briefing on the progress of the company's debt-restructuring that
he expects such a plan to be completed as per the court procedure
by late March or early April.
</P>
<P>
The Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT), a major shareholder
of Thai Oil, and its creditors are scheduled to complete all
agreements concerning the debt-restructuring plan before January
26.
</P>
<P>
The court will decide on whether it approves or turns down the
plan on March 20.
</P>
<P>
Thai Oil was saddled with a mountain of bad debts since the
central bank terminated the country's 13-year-old fixed exchange
rate regime on July 2, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The baht devaluation had resulted in a substantial rise in the
company's debts since then.
</P>
<P>
Persistent financial troubles made it difficult for the company
to honor its debt obligations in November 1998. However, the
Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand, one of its major local
creditors, has been successful in bringing all related parties to
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
PTT injected 250 million dollars in fresh capital into the
company, raising its stake to 49.99 percent while other creditors
converted 250 million dollars' debt into equity, raising their
overall stake to 49.99 percent.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Congress Fails to Pass 2000 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The bicameral conference
committee of the Philippine Congress has given up hopes of
ratifying the budget for the year 2000 during this week's special
session called by President Joseph Estrada, the Philippine Star
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the lawmakers will tackle the 651-
billion-peso (16.3 billion U.S. dollars) budget proposed by the
government when they resume regular sessions next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The legislators said newly appointed Finance Secretary Jose
Pardo requested for the postponement to buy time to study the
appropriations bill as well as the projected revenues and
borrowings to support it.
</P>
<P>
John Osmena, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said the
bicameral conference committee cannot do anything until Pardo has
given the panel his estimate on the achievable revenues for this
year.
</P>
<P>
Approval of the proposed 2000 General Appropriations Act was on
top of the agenda of the legislature for its five-day special
session which lasts till Friday.
</P>
<P>
Gilberto Duavit, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee,
said bicameral talks on the budget were deferred without
discussing the ways to fund an additional 30 billion pesos (750
million dollars)in internal revenue allotment (IRA) for local
government units.
</P>
<P>
Duavit said he expects Pardo and Budget Secretary Benjamin
Diokno to submit their own recommendations on the funding sources
for the additional IRA.
</P>
<P>
The request for the 30-billion-peso IRA made by President
Estrada caused the collapse of the bicameral talks on the budget
last December 22, resulting in the legislature's failure to
approve the outlay before the end of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Boosts Trade with Laos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The value of Vietnamese goods
exported to Laos in 1999 reached 175 million U.S. dollars, a 139
percent increase over 1998, according to a report of local
newspaper Vietnam Investment Review.
</P>
<P>
The value of Vietnamese goods exported to Laos in 1998 and 1997
was 73 million dollars and 46 million dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The impressive increase of Vietnam's exports to Laos meant that
Vietnamese exports represented one quarter of Laos' gross import
turnover last year, said an official of Vietnam's Ministry of
Trade (MoT).
</P>
<P>
The MoT official credited the 139 percent leap to a new
bilateral barter trade agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
in 1999, around 85 percent of all Vietnamese goods sent to Laos
were dispatched under barter arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Even though Laos cannot offer hard cash for incoming goods,
they were providing Vietnamese exporters with a market that is
swelling from year to year, according to the MoT official.
</P>
<P>
Major Vietnamese exports to Laos in 1999 were pepper, peanuts,
fruit, arts and handicrafts, garments and footwear.
</P>
<P>
Lao barter payments typically involved Complete Knock Down (CKD)
motorbike kits. 150,000 CKD motorbike kits entered Vietnam from
Laos under barter deals in 1999.
</P>
<P>
A senior Vietnamese trade official said that "we are ambitious
to see Vietnamese goods worth 450 million U.S. dollars sent to
Laos every year".
</P>
<P>
Lao overall export-import turnover reached an average 1 billion
dollars annually in recent year. Goods coming into Laos
represented around 600-700 million dollars of the total.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Sets 42 Bln Dollar Export Goal for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
looking at a bullish exports target of 42 billion U.S. dollars
this year, a substantial increase from the expected 34-billion-
dollar total exports performance last year.
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin said Wednesday that the 42-billion-dollar
export goal for this year was requested by the Philippine Export
Development Plan (PEDP) Management Committee.
</P>
<P>
For the first 11 months last year, the country's export already
hit 32 billion dollars, reflecting the attainment of the
government's low-end of the exports target for the year of 1999.
</P>
<P>
In validating the proposed exports goal, the PEDP management
committee has called for the setting of targets for certain
sectors such as electronics and garments.
</P>
<P>
These two sectors are the country's top dollar earners
accounting for more than half of the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
The PEDP was approved by Philippine President Joseph Estrada in
May last year to serve as blueprint for the country's export
programs and policies.

<HEADLINE> Number of Elderly to Rise in Finland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- With the dramatic rise in the
number of elderly in Finland, this North European country will
experience an accelerated pace in having more elderly than
children in the early part of the 21st century, the Finnish
statistic center predicts.
</P>
<P>
The average Finn's life expectancy at birth will continue to
increase in the next 30 years. By 2009 the number of elderly
Finnish people over 65 will outnumber that of children below 15.
By 2030, with the elderly accounting for 25 percent of the
population, said the center.
</P>
<P>
Such changes are due to the improvement in living standards and
the increase in life expectancy, as well as technological advances
in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.
</P>
<P>
Some Finnish sociologists are concerned that aging will present
a severe challenge to Finland's government, which will have to
provide more resources for resolving the problems arising from
aging.
</P>
<P>
One report prepared by Finland's Ministry of Finance forecasts
that by 2030, public expenditures on the retired elderly will
increase 7 percent and total annuities will account for 18 percent
of the gross national product (GNP) compared to 13 percent at
present.

<HEADLINE> Protein Folding Simulation for Anti-Cancer Drug Design </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 11 (Xinhua) -- An American researcher has
successfully simulated protein structure with the use of
supercomputers, an achievement expected to help design future anti-
cancer drugs, the U.S. National Foundation for Cancer Research (
NFCR) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The discovery gives an answer to the "protein folding problem"
which has eluded scientists for years, said NFCR. It was made by
Dr. Harold A. Scheraga, project director for NFCR and emeritus
professor of chemistry at Cornell University, after 17 years of
research work supported by the foundation.
</P>
<P>
By the use of pure physical methods and supercomputers,
Scheraga demonstrated with remarkable accuracy the ab initio
prediction of protein structure. Together with related
experimental work, NFCR said, the professor is now able to
determine the pathways of oxidative folding for pancreatic
ribonuclease A, a protein whose modification has strong potential
as an anti-cancer agent.
</P>
<P>
Proteins are the basic unit of life, and knowledge of their
structures and functions can help understand better how life works.
Up to now, scientists know that the DNA in a gene is first
transcribed to messenger RNA and then this message is translated
to form amino acid sequences that are the building blocks of
proteins. When the linear amino-acid sequence is formed from RNA,
it folds up in seconds or minutes to form a three-dimension
structure.
</P>
<P>
Much effort in the past 25 years has been expended trying to
know how protein folds up in nature. Its resolution means that
exact drugs can be designed theoretically on a computer without
experiments. In addition, simulating protein folding can allow
scientists to go forward with the modeling of the cell.

<HEADLINE> 15 Battalions of Troops Deployed in Maluku, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Military (TNI)
Commander Admiral Widodo A.S. said the presence of 15 battalions
of troops in the strife-torn Maluku is expected to end communal
clashes and restore law and order in the area.
</P>
<P>
"Their deployment to all parts of the strife-torn provinces of
Maluku and North Maluku is strengthened with military equipment,
including airplanes and warships," Widodo said in Ternate, capital
of North Maluku on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit to the spice island of Ternate, Widodo
met with North Maluku Governor Surasmin as well as local police
and military officers.
</P>
<P>
Of the 15 battalions, four were fielded in various parts of
North Maluku and Central Halmahera Island, 3,600 kilometers
northeast of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"The deployment of massive security personnel, warships and
cargo planes to the two provinces is expected to stop the
bloodshed in a short time," Widodo was quoted by national
newspapers Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He renewed his order for security personnel on duty to be
neutral in the face of the conflicting groups and to strictly
enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
However, North Maluku military chief Lt. Col. Slamet Riyadi
said he needed more reinforcement to prevent the violence from
escalating in the new province.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation in North Maluku remained tense. At least
eight people were killed and dozens of others were injured in
violence in Jailolo subdistrict in Central Halmahera Island on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
A number of handmade bombs in Tobelo and Galela in north
Halmahera Island also exploded on Tuesday but no fatalities were
reported.
</P>
<P>
Maluku and North Maluku provinces have witnessed intermittent
Muslim-Christian violence since January 19 last year, which has
left more than 1,134 dead, over 2,300 injured and 8,500 buildings,
including 122 places of worship, damaged or burned.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at least 800 villagers from Wayula and
Batlale in North Buru subdistrict are missing in forests on Buru
Island near Ambon after escaping an attack from a rival group from
December 22 to 23 last year.
</P>
<P>
"Security officers had searched for them for a week but had
found no trace of them," Maluku Vice Governor Paula Renyaan said.
</P>
<P>
She added that she had asked the army to deploy a helicopter to
find the people.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Signs U.N. Convention on Terrorism Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka was the second
country to sign the United Nations Convention on the Suppression
of the Financing of Terrorism, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
France was the first country to sign the convention at the
United Nations in New York on Monday, followed by Sri Lanka's
Permanent Representative to the U.N. John de Saram who signed the
convention on behalf of the island country, said a ministry
statement.
</P>
<P>
The convention which opened for signature on Monday was adopted
by the U.N. General Assembly on December 9, 1999 and will come
into force 30 days after it has been ratified by 22 signatory
countries.
</P>
<P>
The convention requires state parties to closely monitor,
freeze and prevent access to various funds by groups supporting
terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for the prosecution and extradition of persons
found guilty of involvement in the financial activities of
terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the convention will be of immediate
advantage to Sri Lanka in its fight against the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) which has been fighting for a homeland for
minority Tamils in the north and east of the country since 1983.
</P>
<P>
For Sri Lanka, the funding of LTTE is a matter of vital
importance as it will decide on how long the ethnic civil war will
drag on.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE's complex overseas fund-raising network has enabled it
to survive the government's economic sanctions and successive
military offensives and has been the headache of the government.
</P>
<P>
To promote global cooperation, Sri Lanka hosted the three-day
14th Symposium on International Terrorism last September, focusing
on
financing of international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In addition to France and Sri Lanka, the United States, Britain,
Finland, Malta and the Netherlands also signed the convention on
Monday,the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Dozen Fuel Contamination Cases Reported in Australia in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The fuel contamination crisis
which had grounded thousands of small planes in Australia was not
an isolated incident, an official of Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association (AOPA) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen instances of fuel contamination had occurred
in the past year, AOPA General Manager Mike Hart said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, more than 5,000 small planes were grounded just two
weeks after the discovery of contaminated aviation fuel of the
Mobil oil company force a similar mass grounding on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
AOPA said the fuel problem recurred throughout last year.
</P>
<P>
"There'd be well over a dozen (reports) from various operators
and aircraft owners which would suggest to us that they now
believe, and I think they're probably correct, that this problem
has occurred spasmodically throughout the whole of last year," he
told Radio National.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft operators no longer had the evidence or samples from
problem fuel but the symptoms they described were exactly the same
as those occurring now, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Outlines Plan for Chernobyl Radiation Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine has worked out a five-year
national plan on reducing the impact of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear
disaster, Deputy Emergency Situations Minister Vladimir Kholosha
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The plan, to be implemented from 2001 to 2005, contains
priority measures to protect the health of the affected people,
reinforce the anti-radiation facilities, reduce the radiation in
the affected area, improving the social security there, and
rebuild the local economy.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be funded jointly by the Ukrainian government and
the international community, said the deputy minister.
</P>
<P>
The program, estimated to cost around seven million hryvnia (1.
3 million U.S. dollars) for 2000, replaces a previous five-year
plan which will expire this year. A detailed version of the new
plan is due in July.
</P>
<P>
On April 26, 1986, a reactor explosion at the Chernobyl power
plant sent out waves of radiation that spread over 12 of Ukraine's
26 states, covering an area of 50,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
About 3.2 million Ukrainians, including one million children,
were affected in the worst nuclear disaster in history. So far,
170,000 of them have died of radiation-related illnesses and 70,
000 others have become disabled for life.
</P>
<P>
In November 1996, Ukraine closed one of the two working
reactors at the Chernobyl power plant and in December that year it
declared that the entire Chernobyl station would be closed by 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine recorded a growth of 4.3
percent in its industrial output in 1999, the first positive
industrial growth in ten years, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma attributed the growth to the improving performance of
the manufacturing sector and said his government would try to
maintain the momentum.
</P>
<P>
The machinery building sector grew 10.6 percent in December
1999 compared with the same period last year, which helped the
sector to reduce its decline to a mere 0.8 percent in 1999 from 4.
5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The value of daily necessities grew 7.2 percent and that of non-
food commodities rose 10.2 percent in 1999, according to figures
released earlier by the country's statistics office.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's economy has been in decline since it declared
independence in 1991 when the Soviet Union disintegrated.

<HEADLINE> Privatization in L. America Falls Sharply in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Privatization in Latin America
fell sharply to 12.712 billion U.S. dollars in 1999, representing
a decline of 69 percent compared with 1998 figures, the Santiago
Chamber of Commerce said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The nose-dive was caused mainly by difficult economic and
political situations in the region's main markets, such as Brazil,
Argentina, Venezuela and Colombia, the chamber said.
</P>
<P>
In Brazil, the devaluation of its currency, the real, and the
weakening of the Enrique Cardoso government, put off foreign
investors; while in Argentina recession and elections had
paralyzed privatization since the second trimester, according to
the chamber.
</P>
<P>
In Colombia the recession and complex political panorama
curtailed several projects of major importance, such as the Santa
Fe de Bogota telephone system.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Venezuela, constitutional reforms filled the
country's political agenda.
</P>
<P>
Economic prospects for the year 2000 for nearly all Latin
American countries in the region are positive. It is expected that
the new year will see more privatization, better sales, and a
comeback to previous levels before the crisis, the Chamber said.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech System for Garbage Treatment Now Used in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The wish of residents in the
Chinese capital to live in a clean city is a step closer to coming
true now that researchers have developed a new recycling system to
treat garbage.
</P>
<P>
Created by the Huizhong (Group) Stock Co., Ltd. in Hubei
province, central China, in cooperation with other research
institutions, the equipment is designed to eliminate the enormous
amount of household trash churned out in large cities.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the State-approved garbage treatment system is one
of world's most advanced of the kind.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Huizhong Group said the system recycles the
garbage using high pressure, intense heat and other means so as to
make full use of the waste. Organic and inorganic matter are
separated, made into fine grain, and processed as organic
fertilizer and about 30 other types of building material.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the system should be promoted because it's
cheap, doesn't take up much land, and saves a large amount of
resources.

TIANJIN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The largest port city in north
China used a total of 2.5 billion US dollars of foreign funds in
1999.
</P>

KUNMING, January 12 (Xinhua)-- Three large frescoes dating back
to the Ming Dynasty 1,400 years ago were discovered recently in a
small temple in Jianshui County in Yunnan Province, southwest
China, during a face-lift project.
</P>
<P>
One colored and two black-and-white wall paintings, which had
been covered with a thick layer of ash for more than 600 years,
were carefully removed from the walls by some experts in the local
Zhilin Temple some 500 kilometers south of Kunming, the capital of
Yunnan.

<P>
The now-vivid colored fresco shows a total of 32 figures of
Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy, and the other two carry images of
people and peacocks -- a good luck symbol to ancient Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The black-and-white paintings were unfinished according to some
experts in charge of the excavation project, but no details as to
why they were abandoned midway were provided.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have used advanced techniques to detach the
frescoes from the wall. The paintings have been moved to the

<HEADLINE> China to Further Improve Irrigation Methods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China plans to utilize
irrigation methods to help the nation's sustainable development,
today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shucheng, minister of water resources, said that various
water-saving methods would be implemented throughout China in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
The irrigation plan is one of the three targets which top the
agenda of China's water conservancy project, he added.
</P>
<P>
The central government will continue its efforts to improve
China's existing drought-prevention and flood-control as a basis
for sustainable development of agriculture in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
Droughts and floods have been the primary water-related
calamities plaguing the country's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"Only by strengthening agriculture's capability of withstanding
droughts and floods can China improve the infrastructure and
economic efficiency of farming," Wang was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
By 2030, China will bring 60 million hectares of farmland into
irrigation with more than 70 percent of the land using several
methods of water-efficient irrigation, according to a report
released by the Ministry of Water Resources yesterday.
</P>
<P>
By then, China must yield 640 million kg of grain to feed an
estimated 1.6 billion population by developing high-yielding and
efficient agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental way out for China's water-consuming
agriculture, especially grain-growing, lies in the modernization
of irrigation featuring a variety of water-efficient approaches,"
Wang said.

The forward will not be able to play in any of Chelsea's

But Weah could make his debut in the Premier League in the

<HEADLINE> Doctors say Maradona should Seek Drug Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Doctors treating retired
Argentine soccer captain Diego Maradona proposed on Tuesday that
he seek drug rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Maradona was hospitalized with severe heart problems last week
in Uruguay and was later found to be on drugs.
</P>
<P>
Ramon Leiguarda, director of the heart specialist Fleni Clinic
where Maradona is undergoing treatment for heart-related problems,
said doctors are considering several rehab programs outside
Argentina including those in Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Maradona would better go directly into rehabilitation after his
current treatment in Buenos Aires, Leiguarda said. "He is aware
of the need to seek definitive treatment of his problem," he added.
</P>
<P>
Maradona, 39, was admitted to intensive care in an Uruguayan
hospital last Tuesday with high blood pressure and an irregular
heartbeat. A police investigation was launched a day later, after
his urine samples revealed traces of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
He returned Sunday to Buenos Aires for further treatment of
what doctors described as "a severe heart condition."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Leiguarda reported that Maradona was improving to
be on his feet for the first time since he had been hospitalized.
The doctor expected him to released in the next 48 or 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
One of the star's personal physicians, Carlos Alavrez,
suggested Maradona travel with only members of his immediate
family, should he agree to take a drug rehab program. "This
treatment has to be absolutely serious," he said.
</P>
<P>
Having admitted to the use of cocaine, Maradona was suspended
from the Italian League in 1991 for 15 months following a positive
test for cocaine use. FIFA suspended him in 1994 also for 15
months following a second positive test, for stimulants during the
World Cup finals.

<HEADLINE> NE China Province Preventing More Hail Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Jilin Province, one of China'
s key commodity grain bases, is using scientific means to fight
hail storms which used to bring high losses to local agriculture.
</P>
<P>
 Jilin, located in northeast China, is familiar with natural
disasters. Last year, the province was affected by the El Nino and
La Nina weather phenomena, and hit by snow, rain and low
temperatures in the spring, and strong wind and thunderstorms in
the summer.
</P>
<P>
 During June and August in 1999, potential powerful hailstorms
threatened farmland and crops of the province on three occasions,
brought on by the clash of cold air currents from Russia's Baikal
Lake and warm air currents from southern China.
</P>
<P>
However, due to various precautions measures, the province had
successfully put the natural disaster under control, reducing
losses of the disaster to the minimum.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xuelin, an official in charge of artificial rain and hail
control, told Xinhua recently that in addition to motivating
various meteorological departments to co-operate in monitoring
weather changes, the province set up anti-aircraft and rocket-
launching devices in 12 hail-frequent areas in 1999, a project
which cost 3.81 million yuan (about 459,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Rockets launched into sky helped remove the conditions to form
hailstorms. And on the three occasions, hailstorms were not formed.
</P>
<P>
The devices saved an estimated loss of more than one billion
yuan (about 120 million U.S. dollars) last year, Wang said.

<P>
TIANJIN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural modernization is
most likely to become a reality in Tianjin, a major port city in
north China, by the year 2010, according to a meeting on
agriculture held here recently.
</P>
<P>
Information from the meeting showed that last year's gross
domestic product (GDP) for the rural population of Tianjin hit 12,
300 yuan (about 1,500 US dollars) per person, and the annual

figures stand as the city's best record ever, and rank first in
this category in the country.
</P>
<P>
After hearing from experts who researched the situation, the
city government decided that now is the time to further boost the
city's agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
So far, almost all the counties operating under the city have
made detailed development plans suited to their conditions.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin's modernization drive will focus on using agricultural
technology, updating livestock breeding methods, and improvement
of processed farm products which have higher added value.

since arriving at Old Trafford from Italian club Venezia in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
He played just four games - conceding eleven goals including
five in one match against Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
Palermo-born Taibi has failed to displace Mark Bosnich as
United's first-choice keeper, and has slipped behind Raimond van
der Gouw in the pecking order.
</P>
<P>
Taibi said he would return in the summer to try to become
United's No 1.
</P>
<P>
"I want to play in order then to return to England and reclaim
my place without the problem of being unavailable for the
Champions League," Taibi told Gazzetta Dello Sport.

<HEADLINE> Maric Issues Plea to Leave Newcastle United  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Newcastle United forward Silvio
Maric said he wanted a transfer to Spain or Italy.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian has not appeared for the Magpies in the last seven
matches and has been told by manager Bobby Robson that he can
leave St James' Park.
</P>
<P>
"The past few weeks have been very frustrating for me - I just
want to play. I hope to find a new club as soon as possible,"
said Maric.
</P>
<P>
"If I had a choice I would like a move to Italy or Spain. I
don't think there is a way back at Newcastle - I've spoken to the
manager and he has said if I want to go I can go."
</P>
<P>
Maric joined Newcastle last February for 2.4 million pounds
making a total of 27 appearances for the club.

<P>
CAIRO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Dakar-Cairo Auto rally,
suspended Tuesday after terrorist threats, will restart next
Monday, with Japanese Mitsubishi driver Kenjiro Shinozuka
retaining his six-minute lead.
</P>
<P>
All the teams and equipment will be transported by air from
Niamey to Sabbah and Waw el Kebir airports in Libya from January
12 to 16 and racing will resume Monday, a statement said.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's seventh stage start from the Niger capital of
Niamey had been cancelled following a warning to race organisers
from the French foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
The action was taken after rally organisers the Thierry Sabine
Organisation (TSO) had been informed of the possibility of a
security risk from terrorists as the race passed through Niger.
</P>
<P>
There are some 1,500 people, 150 cars, 127 motorcycles and 64
trucks to fly from Niamey, where the sixth stage ended, to Sebha

<HEADLINE> Tyson May be Barred from Entering Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- American boxer Mike Tyson could
face an entry ban to Britain for a bout next week because of his
criminal record, the Home Office said on Tuesday, according to a
Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
Tyson is due to arrive in London within the next week to begin
training but the Home Office said it was still considering the
issue.
</P>
<P>
"On the understanding that he will enter in the next couple of
weeks we are considering his right to enter," a Home Office
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The rules state that entry is normally refused, save where
there are strong compassionate reasons, if an offence was
committed which would be punishable in the UK with imprisonment of
12 months or more," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office stance was reinforced by Prime Minister Tony
Blair's spokesman who told reporters: "As I understand it, the
room for discretion is very, very limited."
</P>
<P>
Tyson was convicted of rape in the United States in 1992 and
sentenced to six years in jail. He then served another term for
an attack on two middle-aged motorists, from which he was freed
only eight months ago.

LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Scottish soccer league will
expand to 32 clubs next season after Peterhead and Elgin City were
voted into it.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Government Decides to Delay Hanging Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The tripartite summit of Turkish
ruling coalition decided on Wednesday to delay the execution of the
death sentence against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)
leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The ruling partners reached an agreement to hold the file, sent
by the Justice Ministry earlier this month, and to wait for the
ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) on the case.
The process could take some 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the decision was made following tough talks,
indicating the opinion that the execution could lead to an
escalation of separatist terrorism, hurt the process of Turkish
full membership in the European Union and worsen the country's
economy prevailed.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was meant to dissolve a potential government
crisis which Turkey was expected to face.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured by Turkish commandoes last February in Kenya
and condemned to hanging in June by a Turkish court for treason and
separatism.
</P>
<P>
The PKK had been leading a war against government troops for an
independent homeland in southeastern Turkey which claimed some 37,
000 lives. It announced a ceasefire in August, a move interpreted
by the government as an attempt to save Ocalan's life.
</P>
<P>
The European Court has asked Turkey not to carry out the
sentence against Ocalan until it reviews the case. Turkey has not
executed anybody since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Since Turkey is eager to join the EU, it has been urged to
comply the standards of European countries, which have all
abolished the death penalty.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Invited to Multilateral Talks in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat received a Russian-U.S. invitation for
the Palestinians to attend the multilateral Middle East peace talks
in Moscow early February.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was conveyed to Arafat by United States consul in
Jerusalem John Harist and Russian representative to the PNA Alexei
Chesitiakov, according to the official Palestinian news agency
Wafa.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was jointly signed by United States Secretary of
State Madeline Albright and her Russian counterpart Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be attended by Middle East countries under the
auspices of Russia and the United States, the co-sponsors of the
peace process which started at the 1991 Madrid conference in Spain.
</P>
<P>
The participants will discuss issues of common interests
including demilitarization, water resources, refugees and
environment protection.
</P>
<P>
However, Syria and Lebanon, two key players in the Arab-Israeli
conflict, have already refused to attend the Moscow talks, saying
such meetings were meaningless if they have not made peace with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Damascus and Beirut have boycotted multilateral talks on Middle
East peace process from the outset.
</P>
<P>
The first multilateral negotiations were convened in Moscow in
January 1992 within the framework of Madrid conference.
</P>
<P>
But the talks were frozen, together with bilateral negotiations,
in early 1996 as the whole peace process came to a halt following a
series of terrorist attacks in Israel carried out by Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli track of talks resumed after Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak took office last July. And the Syrian-
Israeli talks were revived last December.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Lebanon and Israel have yet to resume.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) announced Wednesday the approval of 206.5
million U.S. dollars in financing to Peru to strengthen an ongoing
government public finance sector reform program designed to obtain
prudence, transparency and accountability of fiscal policy and
improve investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
The IDB said the resources will assist the government in three
areas: tax efficiency, productivity and allocation of public
resources and enhancement of the performance levels of the
deconcentrated public enterprises and agencies.
</P>
<P>
For this the program will provide support for the development
of a managerial culture within the public administration,
introducing modern management systems within the central
government and its decentralized agencies and facilitating their
eventual introduction in local government, the IDB said.
</P>
<P>
The IDB financing consists of a fast-disbursing sector loan of
200 million dollars and a 6.5-million-dollar loan for technical
assistance. Both loans are for a 20-year term, at the variable
annual interest rate, now 6.84 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Spain's Foreign Minister Abel
Matutes discarded Wednesday that his government will present new
allegations for the extraditing of former Chilean military ruler
Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Matutes said that Spain will respect the decision of British
Home Secretary Jack Straw, who refused Pinochet's extradition to
Spain due to health reasons of former Chilean ruler.
</P>
<P>
Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, who had requested Pinochet's
capture and extraditing in order to try him for crimes against
humanity committed in Chile, will present his allegations through
Spain's embassy in London. Garzon gave this Wednesday a 24 hour
space to be informed about the British government's decision of
permitting Pinochet's return to Chile.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was detained October 16, 1998 in London when
recovering from a surgical operation requested by judge Garzon,
who means putting him on trial for torture and the death of
political opponents during the military regime in Chile, from 1973
to 1990.
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary denied Pinochet's extradition to Spain
after medical examinations made last week for the 84-year old
military ruler, who shows health deterioration.

UNITED NATIONS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Spokesman Fred
Eckhard said Wednesday that the United Nations had find it more
difficult than expected to obtain candidates who are willing to be
considered for the chief of the a new arms inspection regime for
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said either the candidates or their governments, in
some cases, are not willing to consider the post as chairman of

Commission (UNMOVIC) for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general still hopes that he can make an
announcement on the UNMOVIC chairman by Friday, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The UNMOVIC was created by a U.N. resolution adopted narrowly
in December 1999. The new arms inspection regime will replace the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. It has been barred
from returning to Iraq after it withdrew from the country in
December 1998 when the United States and Britain launched four-day
military strikes against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Reno Upholds INS Decision to Return Cuban Boy (With More Details) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reno said any challenge to that ruling must come in federal
rather than state court, referring to a ruling by a judge in
Florida that Elian's relatives in Florida have temporary custody
of the boy before a hearing is held before March 6.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the attorneys of the boy's relatives in Florida,
Reno said the state court order has no force or effect on the INS
decision in the case last week to return the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"The question of who may speak for a six-year-old child in
applying for admission or asylum is a matter of federal
immigration law," Reno wrote.
</P>
<P>
The INS ruled last week that the boy who belongs to his father
should be returned to Cuba by January 14. But the boy's relatives
in Florida insisted Elian should remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez ruled Monday a
hearing should be held to decide whether the boy should be
returned to Cuba or not because he will face harm if he returns to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the boy in Florida also seek a political asylum in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
But Reno noted that the INS found no basis for that. "In
particular, the INS found no credible information indicating that
the child could be at risk of torture or persecution if returned
to his father."
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued from the sea on November 25 after his mother
and stepfather died when their boat capsized in an effort to
illegally immigrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to litigate in that forum," Reno said. "This
little boy has been through so much, and it is therefore
imperative that all of us do what we can to resolve his case as
soon as possible," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Reno also defended the ruling of INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner. Meissner was confident that the boy's
father had expressed his true wishes in asking that his son be
returned to him, Reno said.

</P>

trees need to be removed and young trees be replanted in their

struck head-on and then hit from behind. WSOC quoted a group of
local golfers as saying they heard car engines racing, although
none said they witnessed the accident.
</P>
<P>
Phills collided with a car and a minivan headed toward the
arena. His car came to rest in an oncoming lane, and he was killed
instantly.
</P>
<P>
"It looked like his car went across into the left-bound lanes
and swerved," said Charlotte Police spokesman Keith Bridges. "
There were tire impressions that several hundred feet long Mr.
Phills' car. We have not determined anything else at this time
other than it was at a high rate of speed, certainly over the
speed limit."
</P>
<P>
"This is the ultimate tragedy, and our immediate thoughts and
prayers are with his wife, Kendall, children and family," Shinn
said.
</P>
<P>
Phills, a defensive stopper and a team leader, was one of the
Hornets' top reserves. He joined the Hornets in 1997 after six
years with Cleveland. He was in the third year of a seven-year, 33
million dollar contract.
</P>
<P>
He averaged 10.9 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.7 assists a game
for his career at the end of last season. He was fourth on the
team in scoring this season. He was one of four finalists for the
NBA's Sportsmanship Award. He was also a member of the NBA's All-
Defensive Second Team in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time in nine months that tragedy has befallen
a professional athlete in North Carolina. On May 3, Carolina
Hurricanes defenseman Steve Chiasson, 32, was killed in a one-
truck accident.
</P>
<P>
In late October, Hornets forward Derrick Coleman was involved
in a truck accident that has kept teammate Eldridge Recasner out
of the lineup for the entire season.

<HEADLINE> Wreckage of UK Missing Ship Found, Seven Presumed Dead </HEADLINE>

<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Seven fishermen from neighboring
Scottish villages, including two brothers and a cousin, were
presumed drowned Wednesday after their scallop trawler sank off
Britain's west coast overnight.
</P>
<P>
Sea rescue teams using sonar picked up what they believed to be
the wreckage of the 21-meter Solway Harvester on the sea bed some
11 miles southeast of the Isle of Man between Britain and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Coast guards called off a search for survivors, saying no one
would have been able to last long in the Irish sea's icy waters.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair told lawmakers the thoughts
of the entire parliament were with the families: "Our profound
sympathy is with them all."
</P>
<P>
The boat issued a distress signal late Tuesday, but a massive
rescue operation involving aircraft, helicopters and more than 10
ships failed to turn up anything amid rough seas.
</P>
<P>
The crew were all from the southern Scottish villages of Isle
of Whithorn and neighboring Garlieston -- just a few miles apart.

<HEADLINE> Reno Upholds INS Decision to Return Cuban Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reno said any challenge to that ruling must come in federal
rather than state court, referring to a ruling by a judge in
Florida that Elian's relatives in Florida has temporary custody of
the boy before a hearing is held before March 6.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the attorneys of the boy's relatives in Florida,
Reno said the state court order has no force or effect on the INS
decision in the case last week to return the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"The question of who may speak for a six-year-old child in
applying for admission or asylum is a matter of federal
immigration law," Reno wrote.
</P>
<P>
The INS has decided to postpone the deadline for the boy to
return to Cuba in case the boy's relatives will appeal to a
federal court. But Reno did not give a new deadline for the boy to
go or what steps the INS will take next.
</P>
<P>
The INS ruled last week that the boy belongs to his father
should be returned Cuba by January 14. But the boy's relatives in
Florida insisted Elian should remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez ruled on Monday
a hearing should be held to decide whether the boy should be
returned to Cuba or not because he will face harm if he returns to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the boy in Florida also seeks a political asylum
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
But Reno noted that the INS found no basis for that. "In
particular, the INS found no credible information indicating that
the child could be at risk of torture or persecution if returned
to his father."
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued from the sea on November 25 after his mother
and stepfather died when their boat capsized in an effort to
illegally immigrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to litigate in that forum," Reno said. "This
little boy has been through so much, and it is therefore
imperative that all of us do what we can to resolve his case as
soon as possible," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Reno also defended the ruling of INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner. Meissner was confident that the boy's
father had expressed his true wishes in asking that his son be
returned to him, Reno said.

<HEADLINE> Multiple Crash Leaves 40 Dead in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A multiple collision
caused at least 40 killed and an indeterminate number of injured
Wednesday in Brazil's Santa Catarina state, said police.
</P>
<P>
Fog is probably the main cause of the accident, which took
place at dawn, and featured two Argentine buses, a coach from
Brazilian company Reunidas and some cars on road BR-470, according
to this source.
</P>
<P>
An Argentine bus went on fire in the crash, resulting in at
least 40 dead. The only victim identified was the Brazilian bus's
driver Joao Teodoro Campos.
</P>
<P>
Those hurt were moved to hospitals in Vale do Itjal city,
while rescue personnel continue the rescue work.
</P>
<P>
Argentine President Fernando de la Rua expressed Wednesday his
consternation of the tragic road accident which perished at least
37 Argentines. A communique sent by the Argentine government
indicated the president told his collaborators to negotiate the
transfer of victims' relatives and repatriate the dead.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Swiss investigators found two
flight recorders of a Crossair Saab-340 liner near Zurich
Wednesday two days after its crash.
</P>
<P>
The two "black boxes" are expected to shed light on the reason
why the plane went down two minutes after taking off from Zurich '
s Kloten airport on its way to Germany.
</P>
<P>
The plane veered dramatically to the right, instead of banking
to the left as usual after take-off, indicating a possible problem
on board, said Swiss Radio International.
</P>
<P>
Crossair has also announced it has canceled several flights
involving the same type of plane. They are due to have further
checks, a company spokeswoman said. But she gave no details if
problems had arisen.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a memorial service is to be held on
Friday for the victims of the crash, the company said. The service
will be held in the cathedral in the northern Swiss city of Basel,
where the company is based. The victims were four Germans, two
French, a Swiss, a Moldavian, a Slovak and a Spanish national.
</P>
<P>
The crash was Crossair's first involving fatalities in more
than 20 years of operations.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Arrive in Tanzania for Burundi Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela will on Sunday make his first trip to
Tanzania as the newly appointed facilitator for Burundi peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The former president will first meet the facilitation team and
later the leaders of various parties in the talks, said Mandela's
spokesman Brigadier General Hashim Mbita on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 18 parties, including the government of Burundi and two
former presidents Sylvestre Ntibantunganya and Jean Baptiste
Bagaza, will attend the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, the newly named facilitator of the Burundi peace talks
 succeeding the late Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, is also
scheduled to meet with the representatives of donor countries and
special envoys at the talks.
</P>
<P>
The Nobel Peace laureate has asked the donors to continue to
provide financial assistance to enable the 18-month-old
negotiations to be brought to a successful conclusion early this
year.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which started in June 1998, have so far consumed
about eight million U.S. dollars in order to end a six-year civil
war between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi-dominated government.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 people have been killed and hundreds of
thousands of civilians uprooted in the war.
</P>
<P>
According to Mbita, Mandela will later fly to New York to
attend the United Nations Security Council meeting on the
situation in the Great Lakes region to be held next week.
</P>
<P>
Since Mandela was appointed as Burundi peace facilitator at a
Great Lakes summit early last December, he has retained Tanzania's
north town of Arusha as the venue of the talks and kept the entire
team of his former facilitator.

<HEADLINE> (Rpt With Correction) Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Meets Chinese Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- British Deputy Prime Minister
John Prescott Wednesday praised China for the achievements it had
made in recent years and wished the bilateral relationship between
the two countries would develop further.
</P>
<P>
During talks with visiting Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian
Prescott expressed his admiration for the policies China adopted
during the financial crisis in Asia last year.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of the relationship between China and
Britain and wished that the friendly cooperation between the two
nations in all the fields could be promoted to step further.
</P>
<P>
Prescott said he was satisfied with the development of Hong
Kong in the recent two years after it was handed over to China.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also vice-chairman of the Central Military
Commission of China and a state councilor, briefed Prescott on the
situation and development in China.
</P>
<P>
Although China has experienced some difficulties, it is keeping
the trend of a sustained and stable growth in the national economy,
Chi said.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said the year 1999, during which China
celebrated its 50th anniversary, experienced the return of Macao
and successfully launched its first spaceship, is of historical
significance to China.
</P>
<P>
On the bilateral relations, Chi said to maintain and develop a
stable and long-term cooperation between China and Britain is the
common wish of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Such a relationship is benefit to the two peoples and will also
be beneficial to the peace and stability of the world, said Chi.
</P>
<P>
Chi arrived in London Tuesday on an official good-will visit to
Britain at the invitation of British Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon.
</P>
<P>
Britain is the first leg of Chi's four nation visit. He is also
scheduled to visit Russia, the Republic of Korea and Mongolia.

"The arrears in Iraq's contributions to the budgets of many
other international organizations have also mounted, and these
organizations include the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries," Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
Hasan explained in the letter that Iraq had for some years been
seeking exemption from the U.N. Charter provision but certain
states members of the U.N. committee on contributions have opposed
these requests for political reasons, said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
In response to the Iraqi appeal last June, Hasan said, that U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan replied that it was up to the
Security Council to decide whether money could be drawn from the
oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Hasan said that on this basis, his country requested the
Security Council to consider this matter on an urgent basis and to
approve the allocation of 24 million U.S. dollars to pay its
arrears to the United Nations and OPEC.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, Iraq owed the United Nations more than 8.5
million dollars in regular dues, apart from lesser amounts for U.N.
peacekeeping operations. Iraq has lost its vote in the General
Assembly.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Seeking to Expand Sierra Leone Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hedi Annabi, the U.N. assistant secretary-general, told a press
conference here that "the discussions with contributors are still
going on."
</P>
<P>
At present, there are two operations in Sierra Leone, namely
the UNAMSIL and the ECOMOG, he said. "The two operations are
working closely together, with separate tasks and with separate
channels of command."
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG is in charge of the security in Freetown, capital of
Sierra Leone, and the Lungi Peninsula, where the nation's
international airport is located, while the U.N. mission is
guarding the rest part of the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Though with an authorized total of 6,000, the UNAMSIL has only
4,562 peacekeeping troops and 220 military observers on the ground
due to slow deployment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom is circulating a draft resolution among the
15 Security Council members, and some countries need to consult
their capitals before voting, he said.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution will be put to vote "early next month when
all members are ready to vote," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Wednesday met in a closed-door
session to discuss the latest report on Sierra Leone by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who said that "the peace established
in Sierra Leone is still very fragile."
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation Security Council is expected to ponder over Annan
's recommendation to expand the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone in
the wake of the scheduled withdrawal of the Nigerian-led West
African peacekeepers, called the ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Annan wrote to the council president late last year, voicing
his recommendation to expand the UNAMSIL to "close to 10,000
military personnel."
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, issued here
Wednesday, Annan said that "the situation in Sierra Leone has
remained difficult, and progress in the implementation of the Lome
Agreement has been very slow."
</P>
<P>
"However, the tension prevailing in some areas subsided
somewhat following the recent deployment of UNAMSIL to the
countryside," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that, despite the progress made, the peace
established in Sierra Leone is still very fragile," Annan said. "
Tension and mistrust among the parties to the conflict continue,
while the disarmament process has achieved only modest progress."
</P>
<P>
"In addition, unruly members of some armed groups continue to
attack, rob and rape civilians in parts of the country, while
humanitarian workers are denied access to large parts of the
population," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no justification for non-compliance or delays in
the implementation of the Lome Agreement, for the continuing human
rights abuses or for not allowing humanitarian aid to reach those
in need," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I therefore call upon all political parties and their leaders
to urge their followers to act responsibly so that the people of
Sierra Leone can start to live a normal life," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, after more than eight years of brutal conflict,
building trust and confidence will take time and will require a
concerted effort by all parties in Sierra Leone parties as well as
the international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the responsibility for the success of the peace
process ultimately lies with the people and leaders of Sierra
Leone," he said. "It is crucial, therefore, that the Government of
Sierra Leone take the lead in developing a comprehensive plan for
the restructuring of the police and armed forces so that they will
be able to safeguard fully the stability and security of the
country once UNAMSIL begins its withdrawal following the elections
next year."
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led ECOMOG helped end Sierra Leone's civil war and
pave the way for the July 7 cease-fire accord signed by the
government and rebels. But the U.N. force has been slow in
arriving, with only several hundred Kenyan and Indian peacekeepers
in the West African country.

<HEADLINE> Racism Still Problem in U.S. Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The overall economic
situations have improved in U.S. cities, but racism is still a
problem, said a report released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
National League of Cities President Bob Knight, who released
the 16th annual State of America's Cities survey, called for a
sustained effort to "undo racism" in America.
</P>
<P>
Knight said that while the economic picture is good, city
leaders saw the need to help ease racial tensions. Nine-in-10 city
officials said they have an obligation to help fight racism.
</P>
<P>
"As a nation, we have condoned the injustice, tolerated the
suffering and ignored the consequences of racism. We have so much
to learn and unlearn and many wounds to heal," said Knight.
</P>
<P>
Six out of 10 officials said their cities and regions were more
ethnically diverse than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I believe minorities have spoken for many years with absolute
clarity about the lack of inclusion in this society," Knight said.
"Unfortunately we have stuttered in response."
</P>
<P>
Knight called on city leaders to make efforts to increase
dialogue between racial and ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The report, based on a survey conducted in October, was taken
from responses given by 389 city officials about their perceptions
of their communities.

At the close of Wednesday's session, the Dow index rose 40.02
at 11,551.10, cutting its loss of 61.12 points Tuesday.

<P>
Broader stock indicators were lower. The Nasdaq index fell 71.
17 at 3,850.02 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 6.31 at 1,

</P>
<P>
The blue chip stocks rallied as investors put their bets in the
industrial and consumer goods sectors. Stock prices of the
companies such as 3M and Merck rose.
</P>
<P>
Investors sold tech stocks after Yahoo! reported a better-than-
expected profit in the fourth quarter but said its strong revenue
growth is not sustainable. The company earned 19 cents per share
in the final quarter of 1999, better than 15 cents per share in
expectation. The sell-off led the Nasdaq index to a decline.
</P>
<P>
America Online fell and Microsoft also slipped, helping to drag
the Nasdaq lower. Investors shed away America Online's stocks in
fears of its growth potential after the company announced the
acquisition of Time Warner Monday.
</P>
<P>
Investors also sold Microsoft's stocks just before the close of
trading. The company was hit hard by a news report that government
lawyers involved in Microsoft's antitrust case want the software
maker to break itself into three parts to dilute its competitive
advantage.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Government Calls for Use of LPG for Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Belgium's Federal Transport
Minister Isabelle Durant Wednesday announced measures to encourage
the use of LPG, or liquefied petroleum gas, for cars because the
LPG is less polluting than ordinary gas and diesel.
</P>
<P>
Durent said she wants new safety measures for LPG tanks in cars
.She told reporters at a Brussels International Motor Show that
cars which meet the new standards will be taxed less and can be
parked without restrictions.
</P>
<P>
For the moment LPG-fueled cars are banned from underground car
parks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the price of LPG in Belgium will be lowered Thursday
to 14.5 Belgian francs (37 U.S. cents) maximum per liter at the
gas stations. In comparison, a liter of regular gas costs nearly
three times more.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mission Advocates for End to Cuba Blockade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Costello, the delegation that began Monday its
visit, has as its objective the exploration of business
opportunities with Cuba's agriculture as well as trade.
</P>
<P>
As the official said, the United States can export to Cuba rice,
wheat, corn, cereals and fodder for animal feeding, besides
fertilizer, whose prices are lower for the island. At present they
're acquired from other markets.
</P>
<P>
John Block, secretary of agriculture in the Reagan
administration, said that "for professional motives of his own and
of his peers," the 15 members of the mission will ask Congress to
eliminate this policy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
American entrepreneurs, whose visit was approved by the
Treasury Department, have held talks with officials from Cuba's
Agriculture Ministry to explore possibilities in the sector.
</P>
<P>
They will also visit fishing and farming cooperatives,
investigation centers and other installations related with the
sector for exploring farming and feeding projects between both
countries.
</P>
<P>
This is the second U.S. agricultural delegation to visit Cuba
since last October, when a similar mission accompanied the
governor of Illinois state, George Ryan, on his visit.

<HEADLINE> IOC, Sydney Group Members Issue Joint Statement on Anti-Doping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee(IOC) and members of the Sydney Consultative Group on
Anti-Doping have pledged continued cooperation to the creation of
a drug-free playing field for international athletic competition.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement made public today in Lausanne, the IOC and
the Sydney group members of Australia, Canada and the United
States said, "We agreed that the continued cooperation by sports
organizations and governments through WADA is central to creating
a drug-free playing field for international athletic competition."
</P>
<P>
"The IOC, members of the Olympic movement, the athletes,
national governments, and regional governmental organizations all
have roles to play in this effort and WADA is an essential means
for coordinating their roles," they stressed. "It is also
essential to ensure effective worldwide representation of
governments in the WADA process."
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued following a meeting between IOC
President Juan Antonio Samaranch, first Vice President Richard W.
Pound, and Director General Francois Carrard and representatives
of the Sydney group formed at the International Drugs in Sports
Summit in Sydney last November.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions at today's meeting centered around the
inaugural session of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the
issues of government participation in WADA, the outcomes of the
Sydney Summit, as well as how a system for managing drug testing
during the Olympic games should be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
"Pooling the resources and expertise from WADA members is the
next step in the ongoing campaign for eliminating prohibited
substances and practices. This goal will unite us in working to
maintain the integrity of sport and to protect the health of
athletes around the world," they said in the statement.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Tax Plan to Help Working Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced here Wednesday a 21 billion dollar plan to combat
poverty by expanding tax breaks for low-income people.
</P>
<P>
Clinton described the initiative as part of a "new opportunity
agenda" that he will unveil in his January 27 State of the Union
address to Congress.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, in a speech to the Democratic Leadership Council, said
he will seek an expansion of the earned-income tax credit, costing
21 billion dollars over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The measure is expected to help Vice President Al Gore answer
initiatives of former Senator Bill Bradley, his rival for the
Democratic presidential nomination who also proposed expanding the
tax credit for low-wage workers.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's initiative would require approval by Congress, where
Republicans and Democrats are deeply divided over the size and
shape of any tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
The earned-income tax credit was created in 1975 to keep people
working and to offset the payroll taxes they contribute for Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, a Democratic Congress approved the largest increase in
the history of the program.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who vetoed a 792 billion dollar tax package submitted
by the Republican Congress last year, will offer an array of tax
breaks roughly the same size as the 322 billion dollar package
over 10 years that he recommended to Congress last year, White
House officials said.

<HEADLINE> Belgium's Border Control Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The police said no traffic problems were reported at border
posts on Wednesday. The Belgian authorities started border control
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, second day of the three-week regularization
operation,the border checks resulted in long tailbacks and
considerable traffic delays. Hundreds of illegal immigrants turned
out in major cities in Belgium's Flanders region to get
information or apply for the procedure which might give them legal
status. In Brussels, the capital city, the turn-out at local city
halls was less than that on Monday. On the German-Belgian border
some lorries were delayed up to eight hours.
</P>
<P>
Currently, many drivers apparently avoid the border posts on
major highways and motorways. But the police is also carrying out
surprise checks on secondary roads leading into Belgium.
