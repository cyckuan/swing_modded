<HEADLINE> Zaire to Push out Rwandan Refugees Before May 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Zaire said today that it will
push out about one million Rwandan refugees living in the eastern
part of the country before May 1997, when Zaire is to hold
legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted Zairean Prime Minister
Kengo Wa Dondo as saying on Zairean radio and television that his
country "would proceed the systematic closure of refugee camps
before the elections".
</P>
<P>
About 1 million Hutu refugees from Rwanda have been living in
Zaire's provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu since July 1994,
when they fled Rwanda after a genocide against the ethnic Tutsis
took place.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after Zaire has accused Rwanda of sending
armed bands into the eastern plateau region of Zaire to
destabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
Fightings have taken place between Zairean troops and
Banyamurenges, an ethnic Tutsi people who have lived in eastern
Zaire for generations, in South Kivu over the past month.
</P>
<P>
Dondo said that the Rwandan government signed an agreement to
receive the refugees at a meeting held in August in Kigali between
him and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame.
</P>
<P>
"From the moment when Rwanda signed the agreement, it can no
longer go back on its words and we are going to carry out the
agreement for our part," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zaire was the victim of "repeated aggressions from certain
countries, including Rwanda," he added, in reference to the latest
clash between Zairean troops and the Banyamurenges.
</P>
<P>
"We have enough evidence that the Banyamurenges are not alone
and they are helped by the Rwandan army who provide them with
heavy arms," he said.

HARARE, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic
arrived here this morning for a four-day visit to Zimbabwe to boost
economic relations between the two countries.
</P>

closer cooperation between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Zimbabwe and Yugoslavia date back to the
pre-independence era when the European nation assisted southern

<HEADLINE> France Adopts New Law to Fight Racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The French government today
adopted a new law to fight more effectively racism which is fueled
by the far-right National Front (FN) party.
</P>
<P>
The law was prepared by Justice Minister Justice Jacques
Toubon, who said that the new law gives a clearer and stricter
definition of racist remarks and behavior.
</P>
<P>
The law is to tighten the fight against racism which he said
has become "an everyday phenomenon" in France.
</P>
<P>
The decision to draft the new law, which will replace one
adopted by the parliament in 1972, was stimulated by the recent
clash between FN leader Jean-Marie Le Pen and many politicians,
including Prime Minister Alain Juppe, over Le Pen's repeated
declaration that he believes in racial inequality.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the FN announced today that it would extend its
campaign to the "social field" by launching a movement of protest
against unemployment and the Maastricht Treaty of the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
The FN will also launch a movement of the youths next year
which is entitled "Le Pen, I have confidence".
</P>
<P>
The movement is to be advertised with a poster of a pregnant
woman against the background of a wheat field, saying "let the
youths guard in their mind that our country is subjected to a
continuous immigration of people".
</P>
<P>
The new law, which is expected to be approved by parliament
early next year, has also aroused concern from the news media that
the freedom of the press could be jeopardized by the law because
it comes with a stricter control of investigative reports.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Farmers Use More Fertilizer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Fertilizer consumption in
Ethiopia is increasing by 17 percent per year in the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
Fertilizer consumption in the country has gone up from 146,973
tons in 1991 to 245,200 tons in 1995, and it is expected to rise
to more than 250,000 tons this year, the Ethiopian News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Makonnen Manyazewal, Vice-Minister of
Economic Development and Cooperation as saying the government
took early action to formulate a fertilizer policy in November
1993 aimed at satisfying farmers' demand in the supply of
fertilizer, distribution and marketing, pricing and subsidies,
credit, research and extension.
</P>
<P>
He said the government concluded an agreement with the World
Bank to finance the national fertilizer project aimed at setting
up an efficient, competitive fertilizer sector with a view to
increasing food production through promoting increased and
efficient use of fertilizers and taking steps to improve and
maintain soil fertility.
</P>
<P>
The government also established the national fertilizer
industry agency in October 1994, which is an instrument for the
management and development of the fertilizer sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
deepening and wider penetration of the distribution network to
bring fertilizer within easy access to the farmer is another
important step, the vice-minister added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Inflation Rises Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's inflation rose as
expected to over 20 percent last month reflecting the knock-on
effects of recent price increases, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
said today.
</P>
<P>
Inflation, which had fallen to a three-year low of 17.7
percent in August, was under pressure from significant increases
in fuel, energy, medical and transport costs.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the bank, the rise in
inflation to 20.6 percent ''reflected increases in all items as
the economy adjusted to the 1996 wage settlements and the recent
increases in fuel and electricity charges''.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analysts said inflation was expected to increase
again in October to 23 percent and later on fall to about 20
percent by December and 17 percent in June 1997 as predicted by
the central bank. enditem

<HEADLINE> EU to Join GATT Panel Against Japanese Trade Barrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
decided to join a dispute settlement panel proposed by the United
States against Japan's trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
The panel is requested by the U.S. in September to be
established under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) to review U.S. complaints about access barriers to the
Japanese consumer market of photographic film and paper.
</P>
<P>
"This decision is based on EU's direct export interest as well
as a wider interest in the Japanese distribution system," the
E.U. said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Both the U.S. and EU considered that Japan's certain business
practices have restricted competition in international trade by
adversely affecting the distribution channels and limiting the
price competition in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Japan held consultations under GATT in July, but
failed to resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
On September 20, the U.S. announced that it had requested the
World Trade Organization (WTO) to establish a dispute settlement
panel to review U.S. complaints under the GATT regarding Japanese
barriers.
</P>
<P>
"Europe has important export interests in this area," said EU
Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan. "The European market of
photographic film and paper is open to competition. Our industry
would like the same conditions to prevail in other markets as
well."

<HEADLINE> Combined Efforts Needed to Fight Locusts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and Mozambique must
jointly fight the red locusts if it is to be effectively
eradicated, a Zimbabwean entomologist said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe Commercial Farmers Union entomologist Diana Tailor
said, ''unless the situation in Mozambique is under control, we
are not going to eradicate the locusts before the onset of rains.
Even if we eradicate them here, they will still continue coming
from Mozambique.''
</P>
<P>
If the rains come before the locusts are controlled, the
locusts will breed and wipe out all planted crops, Tailor said.
</P>
<P>
The locusts, which have invaded a number of provinces in the
country, have already destroyed crops worth thousands of Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe government has joined hands with farmers in
spraying the locusts.
</P>
<P>
Tailor urged both commercial and communal farmers to alert
authorities once they identified the locusts in their areas.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Speaker Warns of Possible Bloodshed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian Parliament Speaker
Semyon Sharetsky today warned that the situation in the
Belarussian capital of Minsk is likely to explode in the next few
days, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Sharetsky sounded a disturbing note during his meeting with
Leni Fischer, chairman of the Parliamentary Assembly of the
Council of Europe in Minsk, who was here to discuss the
application of Belarus to join the 39-member body.
</P>
<P>
The speaker told Fischer that he was afraid that the volatile
situation in Minsk, rooted in the tension between Belarussian
President Alexander Lukashenko and the parliament, might lead to
violence during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko, who is supposed to be in office from 1994 to 1999,
is seeking to expand his power and to extend his term for another
five years without election by holding a referendum on November 7.
</P>
<P>
However, Lukashenko countered strong opposition from the
parliament, which is against his plan to integrate Belarus with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Sharetsky said the Belarussian parliament was pinning great
hopes for assistance in stabilizing the political situation in the
former Soviet republic on the Council of Europe, Russia and other
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Belarus is "engulfed by political feuds", he said.
</P>
<P>
As tension kept mounting in Minsk, Belarussian President
Lukashenko paid a one-day working visit to Russia today to meet
Russian President Boris Yeltsin at the Barvikha sanatorium outside
Moscow, where the Russian leader is waiting for a heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the two presidents discussed a number of
key problems regarding bilateral integration.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed Lukashenko's plan on the nationwide
referendum while pointing out the necessity to maintain peace and
stability in Belarus "by compromise in line with democratic
principles".

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Up 0.3 Percent in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices in the U.S.
rose by 0.3 percent in September following a 0.1 percent increase
in August, U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was
pushed higher by rising costs for food, clothing and new cars. The
September gain matched the 0.3 percent rise during July.
</P>
<P>
The price acceleration in the U.S. was led by a fourth month of
higher food costs and there were sharp increases of the prices for
meat, poultry, fish and dairy products in last month.
</P>
<P>
Energy prices, which had been falling for three straight
months, showed no change in September.
</P>
<P>
The so-called core rate of inflation, consumer prices excluding
the volatile food and energy sectors, were also up by 0.3 percent
in September.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the increase in the core rate of inflation in the
month was blamed on a sharp turnaround in clothing costs, which
rose by 0.5 percent after having fallen for three straight months.
</P>
<P>
Also adding to price pressures in September was a 2.9 percent
rise in airline fares, the biggest one-month gain since a 5.9
percent jump in February.
</P>
<P>
New car prices were up by 0.6 percent in September, the biggest
rise since a 0.6 percent increase in January 1991.
</P>
<P>
Through the first nine months of the year, consumer prices in
the U.S. have been rising at an annual rate of 3.2 percent,
compared with a 2.5 percent rise in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe that the economy has slowed sharply from
a 4.7 percent annual growth rate in the second quarter and this
slowdown will help to keep inflation from getting out of hand.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve kept the short-term interest rates
stable at its September meeting and its next meeting will be held
on November 13.

<HEADLINE> Two Big US Railroads Strike Biggest Merger Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Conrail Inc., the freight
railroad in the United States that dominates the northeast, and
CSX Corporation, a far larger railroad that blankets the
Southeast, Middle Atlantic and eastern Midwest, reached a merger
agreement on Tuesday, the New York Times Reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 8.4 billion U.S. dollars deal would be the biggest since
the industry was deregulated in the 1980's, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Conrail and CSX have routes extending nearly 30,000 miles, with
about 54,000 miles of tracks, from Boston to New Orleans and from
Chicago to Miami.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came just three months after the Government
approved a merger between the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific
railroads. The two firms expected to seek Government approval of
the merger early next year and to complete it by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
"We are getting America's rail transportation infrastructure
ready for the 21st century," said John W. Snow, chairman, chief
executive and president of CSX.
</P>
<P>
The new company would have more than 50,000 employees and
revenues of 14 billion U.S. dollars, based on 1995's performance,
making it the country's largest in terms of revenue.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Consult with SADC on Its Deal with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa said today
it will not sign a free trade agreement with the European Union
(EU) without consulting its eleven partners in the Southern
African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad
in Windhoek, capital of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that SADC's fears about the possibility of
such an agreement are largely unfounded.
</P>
<P>
He gives assurance South Africa will not take a step that is
detrimental to the rests of the region.
</P>
<P>
Pahad esmphasized the EU's proposal of a free trade agreement
is merely one of several possibilities.
</P>
<P>
He said these aimed at improving economic relations between
South Africa and the EU countries, following South Africa's
exclusion from the Lome Four Convention.
</P>
<P>
The convention gives easy access to products from developing
countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific in the EU
market.
</P>
<P>
SADC member states fear a Eu-S.African free trade accord will
stifle their attempts at economic development.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers and government officials of SADC and EU
ended their two-day joint conference yesterday in Windhoek.

<HEADLINE> Report: One-Fourth of U.S. Children Live in Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Nearly a quarter of the
children in the United States are living in poverty and the
government does not provide enough concern in protecting them from
hunger, the Bread for World Institute said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two percent of the American children under age 18 live
in poverty and more than one in four of those under age 12 are
hungry, the institute said in a report following a survey.
</P>
<P>
The institute's 7th annual report on world hunger being issued
today said that child poverty is greater in the United States than
in other leading industrial countries and the government does less
to protect youngsters from hunger.
</P>
<P>
It said all industrialized countries are scaling back social
programs but "the United States has higher rates of childhood
hunger and has cut back more drastically than any other industrial
nation on programs that help children."
</P>
<P>
The report also listed other industrial countries and the
percentages of child poverty under the age of 18. Following the
U.S. were Canada and Australia, 14 percent; Ireland, 12; Israel,
11; Britain and Italy, 10; Germany and France, 7; Netherlands, 6;
Norway 5; Belgium and Luxembourg, 4; Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden
and Finland, all 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report did not define the poverty level of such industrial
countries as Japan.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Hungary Sign Political Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Hungary signed here
today a political cooperation protocol in a bid to boost
bilateral political cooperation and increase cultural, economic
and trade links between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Kovacs Laszlo, who is
currently on a two-day official visit to Cyprus, said "there is
now more potential for increased cooperation between the two
countries" after the signing of the agreement, which was signed
by Kovacs and his Cypriot counterpart Alecos Michaelides.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian foreign minister also called on the
international community to make "intensive effort" to facilitate
a Cyprus solution.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the solution of the Cyprus question should
ensure the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Cyprus, and should be based on a bizonal federation of the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot communities and secure the rights of the two
communities.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Cyprus' European Union (EU) accession, the
Hungarian minister said "I hope the division and occupation of
Cyprus will certainly not block the way of Cyprus to the EU. It
would not be fair that Cyprus would be punished for something
that was not caused by the Cypriot people."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Cyprus and Hungary will be EU
members by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In response, Cyprus' Foreign Minister Michaelides said Cyprus
and Hungary have a lot in common. He noted that other agreements
on economic, maritime and taxation issues are under consideration
at present.
</P>
<P>
"We aim to further our friendly ties which we would like to
expand," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot minister thanked Kovacs for his country's troop
contribution to the U.N. peace-keeping force and said Hungary
intends to establish its own contingent of around 100 men.
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus and Hungary have embarked on a road for "closer
and concrete cooperation." At the end of October, some 50
Hungarian businessmen will be on the island as part of a large
trade delegation to help boost commercial links, the minister
added.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Settles Kulikov-Lebed Conflict as Lebed Is Gone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
fired his national security chief Alexander Lebed today, ending
the months-long bitter feud between Lebed and Interior Minister
Anatoly Kulikov.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin announced in a nationwide televised address
that he signed a decree to free Lebed "from his post that he is
occupying, including the post of national security chief".
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin heard
reports by both Kulikov and Lebed at a meeting of all "power
ministers". Presidential chief of staff Anatoly Chubais took part
in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the meeting, Chernomyrdin briefed Yeltsin via
telephone on the preliminary outcome of the meeting and promised a
more detailed account later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is currently in the Barvikha sanatorium outside Moscow
preparing for a heart surgery scheduled for the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The two-month-old conflict flared up again after Kulikov made a
sensational statement at a news conference on Wednesday, in which
the interior minister accused Lebed of preparing a military coup
to seize power in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov's revelations came in response to Lebed's report on
Tuesday at a closed-door hearing on Chechnya at the State Duma
(lower house of the Russian parliament), in which Lebed openly
held Kulikov responsible for Russia's military catastrophe in the
Chechen capital of Grozny in August.
</P>
<P>
Lebed said that Kulikov had had all the necessary information
from Russia's secret services to prevent the Chechen rebels'
massive assault on Grozny, which forced Moscow to start peace
talks. Lebed had vowed to take legal actions against Kulikov.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Removes Lebed From National Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today ended once and for all a bitter squabble on his team by
dismissing his security aid Alexander Lebed from the head at the
national security council.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a nationwide televised program, Yeltsin said that he
was compelled to "free General Lebed from the post he occupied in
the security council".
</P>
<P>
The president said that he could no longer bear the situation,
meaning the verbal duel between Lebed and Interior Minister
Anatoly Kulikov over the fall of Chechnya's capital Grozny to
Chechen separatists in August.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, 46, was the driving force behind Yeltsin's presidential
election in June. The ex-army general garnered 14.71 percent of
the votes to rank third behind Yeltsin and Communist party leader
Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
In the runoff elections held in early July, Lebed turned to
support Yeltsin in return for his appointment as the presidential
security chief and head of the national security council.
</P>
<P>
Born into a Cossack family, Lebed began his military career in
1973 and rose swiftly in the ranks. He took Yeltsin's side and
defended the White House in Moscow in 1991.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's parliamentary hearing, Lebed and Kulikov traded
accusations over the fall of Grozny to the hands of Chechen
separatists in August.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov claimed that Lebed entered into "a direct collusion
with (Chechen) separatists" in a bid to gain political mileage for
the next presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
But Lebed named four others besides Kulikov as also responsible
for the fall of Grozny. The officials blamed for the fall
included Doku Zavgayev, head of the Moscow-backed Chechen
government, Konstantin Pulikovsky, acting commander of the Russian
forces in Chechnya, Pavel Golubets, interior ministry coordinator
in Chechnya, and Nikolai Koshan, one of the key members on the
Zavgayev team.
</P>
<P>
The row among senior government officials popped up following
the signing of the Khasavyurt peace agreement on August 31, and
Lebed called for parliamentary hearings early this month in that
Kulikov had categorized Lebed's Khasavyurt peace agreement as
"high treason".
</P>
<P>
The interior minister also accused Lebed of planning "a
creeping coup". He accused Lebed with attempts to create a
special task force, called the Russian Legion, with an aim to
seize power.
</P>
<P>
But Lebed's spokesman Alexander Barkhatov brushed off the
accusation by saying that the security council was working on a
document concerning the establishment of mobile forces based on
the interior ministry and defense ministry.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin was said to have ordered Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin and Kulikov to provide him urgently with
detailed information about the alleged formation of the special
forces.
</P>
<P>
Local observers had expected the Lebed-Kulikov verbal duel to
flare up at Tuesday's parliamentary hearing, but they could be
shocked to see the abrupt ending of the political career of Lebed
who would come of retirement to join the 11-candidate presidential
elections.

<HEADLINE> Black Sea States to Sign Strategic Action Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A Black Sea strategic action
plan is expected to be signed in Turkey's largest city of
Istanbul on October 31 by environment ministers from Turkey,
Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia and Ukraine to save one of the
 world's most polluted seas.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed in a news release faxed to Xinhua today by
the Black Sea Environmental Program (BSEP).
</P>
<P>
The release said, "Over the last 30 years the once thriving
Black Sea ecosystem has virtually collapsed. A massive increase
in the volume of pollutants, most of them carried by rivers
draining out of Central and Eastern Europe, has devastated animal
and plant communities."
</P>
<P>
"The situation has been exacerbated by over fishing and the
accidental introduction of a comb jellyfish which has devoured
huge quantities of fish larvae and plankton and reached a total
biomass of more than 900 million tons, 10 times the total annual
global fish catch," it added.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating situation led to the establishment of the
BSEP in 1993, backed by funding from the Global Environmental
Facility, jointly managed by the U.N. Development Program, the
U.N. Environmental program and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The news release also said, "The Strategic Action Plan is the
product of three years of consultations and research. Although
the surveys conducted and coordinated by the BSEP have confirmed
that the Black Sea environment is severely damaged, they have
also shown that the situation is far from hopeless. the Black Sea
can still be saved."
</P>
<P>
In signing the Strategic Action Plan, the most comprehensive
program ever undertaken, the Black Sea countries are making a
historic commitment to work together for the mutual benefit of
all 160 million people in the region, the news release said.
</P>
<P>
To mark the event, October 31 has been declared as
"International Black Sea Day" and will be celebrated with a
series of public activities in each of the coastal countries,
according to the release.

<HEADLINE> Resigned Nepali Minister Reappointed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Former Nepali finance
minister Ram Sharan Mahat, who resigned from post in July under
pressure from opposition lawmakers, was today reappointed with his
previous portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Mahat took the oath of office as finance minister here today,
the official news agency RSS said.
</P>
<P>
Mahat resigned as finance minister on July 31 after the
revelation in parliament of his personal dollar account in an
American bank.
</P>
<P>
A lawmaker of the opposition revealed in late July to
parliament that Mahat had maintained an account in the worldwide
Consumer Bank of New York even after being appointed a cabinet
member, raising moral and legal questions against him.
</P>
<P>
Under Nepal's foreign exchange law, a Nepali national living in
the country is prohibited from holding a foreign bank account
unless permitted by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Then as demanded by opposition MPs, Mahat resigned but
continued to be charged with the ministry's affairs while the
portfolio of finance minister was held by Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba.
</P>
<P>
According to Mahat, he opened the account in the New York bank
in 1988 when he began to work with the United Nations Development
Program as an economist.
</P>
<P>
Mahat was elected into the lower house of parliament in 1991
after returning from his UN service, representing the Nepali
Congress (NC) Party.
</P>
<P>
He became finance minister in September last year when the
NC-led coalition government under Deuba was formed.

ANKARA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller announced here this afternoon
that the Turkish government has decided to reduce the detention
period for the political crimes.
</P>
<P>
Ciller told reporters at an urgent press conference that the
government is about to complete the work for the shortening of
the detention period for the crimes dealt with by the State
Security Courts.
</P>
<P>
The State Security Courts deal principally with the political
crimes which are described as "terror crimes" by the government.
</P>
<P>
She added that the work for shortening the detention period
would be finalized as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"When we do these things, Europe will not have a base to
isolate Turkey for the situation of its human rights. But if they
insist on that, then they declare themselves as a Christian club
which is very dangerous for the world and regional peace," she
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to the Turkish law, suspects charged with the
terror crimes can be kept in the custody up to 15 days in the
western part of Turkey, but the custody period prolongs to 45
days in the Kurdish dominated southeast of the country under the
state of emergency.

economic life.

<P>
However, he lamented, "we still see some conflicts accompanied
by violence in many countries."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, Indonesia with its free and active foreign policy
will keep on trying to uphold world order, lasting peace and
social justice " he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Rose Modestly in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) --The industrial production in
the U.S. inched up just 0.2 percent in September after rising a
revised 0.4 percent in August, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed report said that the output of durable goods,
items expected to last more than three years, increased only by
0.1 percent last month, comparing with a gain of 0.5 percent in
August. The production of motor vehicles fell back about 2 percent
for a second straight month.
</P>
<P>
Production of non-durable goods such as food and clothing
advanced by 0.5 percent after falling 0.4 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
Output at utilities also slowed to a gain of 0.4 percent from
an increase of 1.7 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
Overall manufacturing production rose by 0.2 percent after
edging up 0.1 percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The report contained no evidence of inflationary pressures. It
said that the U.S. industries were operating at 83.3 percent of
capacity, down from 83.4 percent in both July and August.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that capacity utilization of 85 percent or more
threatens production bottlenecks that could lead to shortages and
higher prices.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect overall economic growth to remain moderate for
the remainder of the year after barrelling ahead at a 4.7 percent
annual rate during the April-June quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the industrial production report showed that the
output in the country was still 3.5 percent higher than a year
ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 17 (Xinhua) -- An unidentified Iraqi official
source said here today that the reported meeting between Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani and an Iraqi envoy in Tehran was
arranged by the Iranian side.
</P>
<P>
A short dispatch filed by the Iraqi News Agency (INA) quoted
the source as saying that the Iraqi envoy was in Tehran before
the latest fightings in the Kurdish area in northern Iraq between
the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) led by Jalal Talabani and
the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) headed by Massoud Barzani.
</P>
<P>
INA said that the source was commenting on a statement by the
Iranian News Agency that President Rafsanjani had received an
Iraqi envoy. However, no further details on the Iraqi envoy's
trip to Tehran were given.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, INA reported that a KDP representative in London
told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) in Dubai, the United Arab
Emirates, that the KDP has rejected Iranian mediation to stop
fighting between the two rival Kurdish factions.
</P>
<P>
The representative emphasized that Iran is not in a situation
that would enable it to mediate in the Iraqi Kurdistan area. He
said that Iran is involved in the inter-Kurdish fighting by
supporting the PUK.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran has denied the charge that it backed the PUK.
</P>
<P>
Fresh fightings between the PUK and the KDP in northern Iraq
renewed Sunday and the PUK has reportedly seized Sulaimaniyah
city from the KDP. Fighting still continues in the area and the
situation there has become precarious.

PARIS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Canadian sprinter Donovan
Bailey's world indoor 50-meter mark was finally ratified Thursday
after eight months by IAAF, world athletics governing body.
</P>
<P>
Bailey, who also won the Olympic gold medals with a world
record time in the 100 meters this summer, ran 5.56 seconds of the

Soon after the race, questions were raised about whether Bailey

Bailey's time topped the previous record of 5.61 seconds set by

American James Sanford.
</P>
<P>
Bailey is still awaiting final IAAF ratification of his world
record of 9.84 seconds in the 100 meters Atlanta.

The IAAF also ratified two other world records: Salah Hissou's
mark of 26:38.08 in the 10,000 meters, set in Brussels on August

<HEADLINE> Sexually Transmitted Disease Control Vital to China's AIDS Prevention: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- China has been warned to be
vigilant about the increasing spread of sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs) before they become a major transmission route of
the HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the ongoing National Conference on HIV/AIDS
Prevention and Control in Beijing say China should take immediate
steps to curb the epidemic of STDs, because their incidence rate
is rising in the country, and sexual contact is now the leading
cause of HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
Currently, most of the HIV infection cases in China are the
result of contaminated syringe needles used for taking drugs and
blood for transfusions. However, STD patients will be the majority
of HIV carriers if the diseases are not controlled effectively,
said Ye Shunzhang, director of the National Center of STDs and
Leprosy Control.
</P>
<P>
China reported more than 1.74 million STD cases from 1977 to
1995. Experts believe that the actual figure of STDs in China has
reached three million.
</P>
<P>
According to the center, the rate of STDs will continue to rise
in China over the next 20 years, due to a large population of
young people, rapid urbanization, changed views on sexual
behaviors, and the increasing migrant population.
</P>
<P>
And in line with the increase of STDs, the occurrence of HIV
infection will be more frequent, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
"We found only one HIV-infected person among STD patients
across the country in 1994, while last year the number climbed to
49," Ye said.
</P>
<P>
The reported cases of HIV in China had reached 4,305 by the end
of August, including 131 AIDS cases. But experts estimate that the
actual number may be between 50,000 to 100,000.
</P>
<P>
Although this rate was considered low compared with some
countries, experts worried that China's 1.2 billion population
will be at risk of an HIV/AIDS epidemic in the future.
</P>
<P>
"We should give first priority to STD control in the battle
against AIDS, because STDs are a springboard for an HIV/AIDS
epidemic," said Chen Minzhang, minister of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
The experts have advised spreading education about the use of
condoms to prevent STDs.
</P>
<P>
A large-scale sex education program targeted at the entire
society should also be launched in order to help people develop
healthy lifestyles, they noted.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The nine-day 1996 Corum Cup

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today removed Alexander Lebed from his post as the chief of the
national security council.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal was announced by Yeltsin via a nationwide
televised program.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he could no longer bear the situation,
meaning the verbal duel between Lebed and Interior Minister
Anatoly Kulikov over the fall of Chechnya's capital Grozny to
Chechen separatists in August.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov had accused Lebed of planning "a creeping coup", the
president press service said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was said to have ordered Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Kulikov to provide him urgently with detailed
information on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told television audience that Lebed was splitting
everyone apart.
</P>
<P>
"I was compelled to free General Lebed from the post he
occupied in the security council," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he accepted Lebed's resignation and signed the
presidential decree to dismiss the ex-general who was the driving
force behind Yeltsin's presidential elections in June.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov also accused Lebed with attempts to create a special
task force, called the Russian Legion, with an aim to seize
power. But Lebed's spokesman Alexander Barkhatov brushed off the
accusations by saying that the security council was working on a
document concerning the establishment of mobile forces based on
the interior ministry and defense ministry.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Lebed and Kulikov traded accusations at a
parliamentary hearing which was held at the requirement of Lebed
who named four others as responsible for the fall of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov claimed that Lebed entered into "a direct collusion
with (Chechen) separatists" in a bid to gain political mileage for
the next presidential elections.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Launch Massive Counter-Offensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
launched a massive counter-offensive against ex-government troops
today and are pushing their front lines to further north of Kabul,
said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
As a major gain, the Taliban recaptured the Bagram military
airbase 50 kilometers north of Kabul from forces led by military
commander of the former government Ahmad Shah Masood.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban now are pushing further into Masood's territory
north of the capital and are within five kilometers of the
provincial capital and strategic town of Charikar, 65 kilometers
north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban launched their attack from a major road junction
captured Wednesday morning from Masood's forces.
</P>
<P>
"Our jets have bombed Charikar three times this morning," a
Taliban was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Taliban jets bombed both Charikar and the front-line military
headquarters of ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani in Jabul
Seraj, 77 kilometers north of Kabul, which is occupied by Masood's
forces.
</P>
<P>
No casualties have been reported so far.
</P>
<P>
Masood was recently joined at Jabul Seraj by forces sent by
northern ethnic Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum.
</P>
<P>
Jabul Seraj and Charikar both fell to the Taliban after the
militia captured Kabul on September 27, but they were taken back
by ex-government forces last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taliban leaders in Kabul said today that they had
managed to reassure Dostum that they would not threaten him
militarily.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's acting Minister for Information and Culture, Amir
Khan Muttaqi, said Dostum had been misled into believing that the
Taliban would launch an attack on his northern territory.
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi said the talks which began Wednesday at Dostum's base
in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif had succeeded in allaying
the fears of the leader who has run northern Afghanistan
autonomously from the Kabul government since 1992.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks were "productive" and prompted Dostum to send
a team of his own to hold talks with the Taliban authorities in
their stronghold in the southwestern Afghan city of Kandahar.

<HEADLINE> China's Electrical Appliance Market Expected to Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The household electrical
appliance market in China is expected to more than overtake that
of North America over the next ten years, a senior executive of a
big-name US company said here today.
</P>
<P>
Driven by the country's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), the
China market is likely to exceed that of North America, Roy Armes,
chairman of Whirlpool Greater China Inc, told a fair for ordering
air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
Chinese consumers buy 20 million household electrical
appliances each year, about 40 percent of Asia's total, according
to Armes.
</P>
<P>
Based on this, Whirlpool is developing the Chinese market as an
important part of its global strategy, the executive said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that Whirlpool has invested 150 million US dollars
since 1994, and set up five joint ventures in China, which
manufacture a series of products ranging from air conditioners and
microwave ovens to washing machines and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
Matthew Sekellick, a company official overseeing business in
China, said he expected Whirlpool's China business to grow by 50
to 70 percent annually in the next five years and become a major
driving force for the company's profit growth.
</P>
<P>
Whirlpool, which reported a sales income of 8.35 billion US
dollars worldwide in 1995, received 90,000 orders for washing
machines in China's largest city of Shanghai a week ago. It will
sponsor fairs for customers to order products in a number of large
cities in China including Chengdu, Beijing and Guangzhou over the
next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
To promote its products to Chinese consumers, Whirlpool will
triple its media and advertising budget and expand its sales
network to 20 cities across the country, Armes said.
</P>
<P>
Sekellick said that the number of air conditioners and washing
machines produced locally by Whirlpool's five joint ventures in
China has reached 70 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Top two seeds Linda Wild and
Yayuk Basuki continued their winning streak to move into the
quarter-finals after easy wins in the women's Nokia Open Thursday.
</P>
<P>
American Wild, world No.32, took a step closer towards her
titlist she won last year as she outplayed quarlifier Yuko Hosoki
of Japan 6-3, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's second seed Basuki, winner of the first Beijing
Nokia Open in 1994, needed only 55 minutes to crash out German
quarlifier Silke Meier 6-2, 6-1, thanked to her powerful serve.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Sandrine Testud of France fought back from one set
down to oust Mi-Ra Jeon of South Korea 2-6, 7-5, 6-3 to advance to
the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shi-ting of Chinese Taipei, fresh from her Wismilak Open
champion last week, disposed of the Chinese best woman player Yi
Jingqian 7-5, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
After nine duce in the third game of the first set, Wang made a
decisive break which helped her to take control of the remianing
play.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Wang had won five times over Yi in the past six
years before Thursday's match.
</P>
<P>
"I made some lapse of my forehand in the match, especially with
those breakpoints," Yi said.
</P>
<P>
However, Seventh seed Nana Miyagi and eighth seed Francesca
Lubiani were stopped at the second round.
</P>
<P>
Lubiani of Italy was eliminated by Chinese Chen Li, ranked
213th in the world, 6-3, 6-3, and Japan's Miyagi, the runner-up of
the last week's Wismilak Open, lost to Tamarine Tanasugarn of
Thailand, 6-1. 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Chen became the second Chinese player entering the
quarter-finals in the history of the Nokia Open after Li Fang in
1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Military chief in the Chechen
separatist leadership, Aslan Maskhadov, has agreed to head the
future coalition government in Chechnya, reports reaching here
said today.
</P>
<P>
"All the (separatist) military commanders of Chechnya, meeting
in Grozny on Wednesday, unanimously offered me to head the
government and I finally agreed," Maskhadov was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Personally confirming this news earlier today, Maskhadov said
that Chechen separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev had offered
this post to him twice, but he had turned down both proposals.
</P>
<P>
However, it is premature to say that this decision is final,
because there is no decree on the appointment of a new prime
minister of the future coalition government in the breakaway
republic, the reports noted.
</P>
<P>
Maskahdov denied rumors that the Chechen separatists were
building a regular army of their own, although he admitted that
they were doing everything "to keep their gunpowder dry".
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chechen separatists are attentively watching
the developments in Moscow, or the dispute between Interior
Minister Anatoly Kulikov and national security chief Alexander
Lebed.
</P>
<P>
"If the party of war prevails in Moscow, we will naturally have
to be ready," Maskahdov said, adding that "if the party of peace
wins, we will be ready to dissolve armed factions."

<HEADLINE>   No Alliance Against Afghan Taliban: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 17 (Xinhua) -- There is no international
alliance against the Afghan Taliban Militia which captured Kabul
on September 27, a Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference this afternoon, the spokesman
said it is all speculation that a group of countries are working
together against the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Some previous reports said the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS), especially those bordering Afghanistan, were worried
about the Taliban's possible penetration into their lands.
</P>
<P>
"The CIS now feels that the Taliban have no extra-territorial
designs," the spokesman noted, adding, "The CIS now desires to
have an understanding between the Taliban and the Afghan Uzbek
Militia led by Rashid Dostum."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, the spokesman said there is no danger to
Pakistan-Iran ties due to the changes in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"There is an understanding between Pakistan and Iran that any
change in Afghanistan will not affect the strategic ties between
the two countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
In reply to another question, the spokesman said Pakistan does
not take sides in an intra-Afghan settlement.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban which occupy two-thirds of Afghan territory can
not be ignored in any package of settlement," he added.

<HEADLINE> China's Capital Passes Rules on Test Animals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The municipal legislature of
the Chinese capital today passed management regulations on the use
of animals for research experiments.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, in eight chapters and 34 clauses, empowered
the municipal science and technology commission to oversee the
work concerning test animals.
</P>
<P>
Any unit involved in the protection, rearing and breeding of
such animals, or in the supply and application of animals for the
production of medicines, or in the scientific experimentation of
animals, must obtain a certificate from the municipal science and
technology commission, the regulations said.
</P>
<P>
People engaged in the animal experimental research must not
mistreat their subjects, the regulations warned, urging
researchers to adopt the best possible study plans and methods or
use substitutes in order to reduce the number of test animals
needed.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has already established a special department for the
management of test animals, according to Zou Zuye, director of the
science and technology commission.
</P>
<P>
However, some problems still exist, Zou said, citing as an
example the lack of an ideal environment and necessary facilities
for the animals.
</P>
<P>
The regulations will become effective on January 1.

<HEADLINE> Founder of Cradle of Managers for Rural Firms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- In the rural area of Fuyang city
in East China's Anhui Province, Fuyang Rural Enterprise School is
known as a cradle of managers for local township- and village-run
companies.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, more than 7,000 rural students have
graduated from the school and are working in local firms. Over 430
directors in 500 major local businesses are graduates of the
school, which currently has in excess of 2,700 students.
</P>
<P>
The private institution does not receive any financial
assistance from the government -- it is solely funded by
farmer-turned-millionaire businessman Zhang Helin.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, 48, is a successful real estate developer, but rather
than indulge in a luxurious lifestyle, he has spent his fortune
on turning local rural residents into entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Zhang first thought of forming such a school in the early 80s,
when he discovered that many local villagers had difficulty
overcoming poverty, mainly because of illiteracy or the lack of
managerial know-how and experience.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he invested his first 160,000 yuan -- his total life
savings at the time -- to open the school's first building. He
appointed himself headmaster, his two brothers as deputy
headmasters, his wife as the school's accountant and his son as
manager of the canteen.

He has relied on his flourishing real estate business to fund
and expand the school, which is currently valued at 100 million
yuan, according to a recent report from local auditing departments.
</P>
<P>
So far, he has invested 58 million yuan in his dream.
</P>
<P>
The school covers 10.4 hectares of land and has a floor space
of over 65,000 square meters. It has modern teaching facilities
and materials, such as a cable television network, and computers
and equipment for conducting physical and chemical experiments.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said he has tried his best to save money to fund the
school. Even when he was seriously ill, he chose not to spend
money for timely treatment, and consequently has chronic back pain.
</P>
<P>
The millionaire leads a simple life. His most expensive item of
clothing is an 80-yuan shirt his wife bought for him early this
year as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
Though his school has developed into a huge compound, his
family lives in a two-room flat. The city government granted Zhang
a villa in appreciation of his contribution to society, but he
later sold the house and invested the money in the school.
</P>
<P>
Zhang has never considered turning the school into a
money-making institution. Between 1985-1988, students received
free schooling. Now, students are charged some fees to ease the
tremendous operation costs.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's deeds have been lauded nationwide. State leaders,
including President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng, have visited
the school.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Commercial Bank Floats FRCD Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 17 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lanka's Commercial Bank has
floated 100 million ruppes (1.75 million US dollars) of Floating
Rate Certificates of Deposits (FRCD) endowed with several new
features for the first time in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The issue, which was floated on Tuesday, has a maturity of four
years and guarantees a minimum interest of 10 percent and a
maximum interest of 17 percent, the Evening newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The FRCDs are in the denominations of 100,000 ruppes (1,754 US
dollars) and 1,000,000 ruppes (17,544 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Among the main features of the scheme are the guarantee of a
minimum interest rate which is higher than the Average Weighted
Fixed Deposit rate of the Central Bank, semi-annual interest
payments and exemptions from withholding tax and stamp duty, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The bank has also secured a commitment from two other financial
institutions for discounting of the FRCDs, thus creating secondary
market opportunities and ensuring liquidity of investment.
</P>
<P>
The Commercial Bank, established in 1969, is one of the
country's most stable private indigenous banks.
</P>
<P>
The bank has a network of 39 branches across the country and
the FRCDs will be issued by all of them.

<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Almost four out of five Chinese
students have expressed concern about Sino-US relationships.
</P>
<P>
Corruption and Taiwan also figured high in their concerns about
present day China.
</P>
<P>
A survey has shown that Chinese college students are becoming
more concerned with important and hot social topics, and are more
confident about China's future.
</P>
<P>
The survey was carried out among 30,000 students from 10
colleges and universities, selected from six provinces and
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that nearly 90 percent of the students quizzed
said that China maintained stability in the past year, and over 70
percent also predicted that China would maintain stability in the
coming three years.
</P>
<P>
Four major issues that college students are concerned about
most are: Lee Teng-hui's visit to the US and Sino-US relations
(89.7 percent), the central government's efforts to crack down on
corruption crime (86.7), China's accession to the World Trade
Organization (85.7 percent) and President Jiang Zemin's
eight-point propositions on developing relations between the two
sides across the Taiwan Straits and peaceful reunification of the
country (81.1 percent).

<HEADLINE> Europe Needs to Redouble Efforts to Combat Poverty: EC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC),
the executive body of the European Union (EU), today called for
redoubled efforts to combat poverty.
</P>
<P>
"There is both an economic and moral argument in doing all we
can to assist the 52 million people who live below the defined
poverty thresholds in the member states," the EU Social Affairs
Commissioner Padraig Flynn said on the occasion of the
U.N. International Day for the Elimination of Poverty.
</P>
<P>
He said that intervention at European level would not solve
poverty in Europe, saying that "the real answer will always lie in
action at national and local level".
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said that EC's past programs involving pilot
projects and the networking of the non-governmental organization's
actions in this field have had a symbolic yet important impact.
</P>
<P>
"The continuation of this useful work would be greatly
facilitated by having a clear legal basis for such actions in the
EU Treaty," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore," he said, "the commission favors the insertion into
the treaty of a proper legal basis with qualified majority voting,
for the adoption of programs and actions which can address the
needs of the poor, the vulnerable and the disadvantaged citizens
of Europe."

<P>
ANKARA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish security police have
seized 42 kilograms of pure heroin and 67.5 kilograms of hashish
in three separate operations against drug trafficking in Turkey,
the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the police stopped a truck on the
Gevas-Van road in Van province of eastern Turkey and confiscated
42 kilograms of heroin in 63 parcels hidden in fuel depot and
other secret places of the vehicle. The heroin was en route from
Iran to Istanbul, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The police detained two suspected drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that according to a tip-off, the security
forces searched Mehmet Tokgoz's house in Darende town of Malatya,
eastern Turkey, and found 52 kilograms of hashish.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish police also seized 15.5 kilograms of hashish which
was hidden at Mustafa Tutar's home in Yahyali town of Kayseri
province, Central Anatolia, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
But Anatolia failed to say when the three operations were
carried out.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Deputy Home Secretary Tom Sackville said in
Istanbul on Tuesday that 80 percent of all the heroin
confiscated by customs officials in the United Kingdom is
shipped via Turkey.

<HEADLINE> New Reason for Preventing Interbreeding Among Species Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have found that
social barriers, like geographic barriers, can also keep different
groups in the same species from interbreeding, according to Nature
magazine published here today.
</P>
<P>
People have always thought that geographic factor is the major
force driving speciation. For instance, a group might become
isolated from the rest of its species when stuck on an island. In
time, this group becomes genetically different from the original
group and the two can no longer interbreed.
</P>
<P>
The scientists studied the fire ant, a vicious creature from
south-east America. Some fire ants live in communities in which
there is one queen - monogyne communities. Others live in
polygyne communities in which there are several queens.
</P>
<P>
The two communities live side by side and are the same species,
but interbreeding appears to be minimal.
</P>
<P>
Professor Kenneth Ross, an entomologist at Rochester
University, New York, has shown that if a monogyne queen presumes
to enter a polygyne nest, she is killed by the males there because
she is too fat and robust.
</P>
<P>
"She is executed by the polygyne workers -- they execute their
own queens if they are too robust or fat as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a polygyne queen will not be accepted by the males
in a monogyne camp.
</P>
<P>
Interbreeding between male polygyne ants and female monogyne
ants is also cut off. This is because the culture in polygyne
communities appears to be to mate in the nest rather than to go
out hunting for a mate, said Ross.
</P>
<P>
He and his co-author Dr. DeWayne Shoemaker have shown that the
DNA flows between the two groups in just one way, from monogyne
males going out and mating with polygyne females. So, while some
interbreeding does occur, there is plenty of reproductive
isolation between the groups.
</P>
<P>
The work may have implications for the evolution of all social
animals, such as wasps, mammals and even humans. It may also help
to explain why there are 25,000 species of ant.

<P>
Addressing a press conference at the Pakistani Foreign Office,

the warring Afghan factions.
</P>
<P>
Babar held talks with the Taliban leadership in Kabul and with
Dostum in Mazar-i-Sharif, Dostum's headquarters in northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that on the directives of the Taliban top
leader Mullah Umer, two Taliban leaders, Mullah Ghaus and

<HEADLINE> Some Flying Dinosaurs May Have Walked Upright: Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Some of the largest flying
dinosaurs might have walked upright, wading through shallow ponds
like flamingos and pecking at shellfish, according to a report in
this week's New Scientist.
</P>
<P>
David Unwin, a British geologist at the University of Bristol,
and Martin Lockley, of the University of Colorado of America, have
jointly developed this new theory after finding footprints of one
species of pterosaurs in Texas.
</P>
<P>
Paleontologists have believed for some time that most
pterosaurs were fish-eaters that lived near the shore.
</P>
<P>
It was thought that they floated on water like seagulls and
fished like modern pelicans, seizing fish just below the surface
as they flew over the water.
</P>
<P>
However, when pterosaur tracks were first discovered inland in
Arizona, United States, in 1957, experts concluded that some of
the winged creatures with long crane-like beaks were like huge
condors that looked for dead dinosaurs to eat.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A seminar on eradicating
poverty in Cambodia was held here today in a bid to look for ways
to eliminate poverty in this country.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh said at the
seminar organized by the Cambodian Planning Ministry and U.N.
Development Program that the theme of the seminar was "truly in
accordance with the wishes and noble task of King Norodom
Sihanouk".
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh said that a stable political and healthy economic
environment could play an important role in eliminating poverty,
and attract more investors to Cambodia, which would result in
creating more jobs for the Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that priorities be given to agriculture, industry
and tourism, and appealed to all ministries to work together to
formulate effective strategies for eradicating poverty in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Planning Minister Chea Chanto said that poverty eradication was
"fundamental to reinforcing peace and achieving a sustainable
human development for Cambodia".
</P>
<P>
He said that Cambodia was still one of the poorest countries in
the world with a per-capita income of 260 U.S. dollars. Recent

<HEADLINE> Holmes To Box Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Larry Holmes said Wednesday
that he will challenge Brian Nielsen of Denmark for the fringe IBO
heavyweight title on January 24 in Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
Holmes, who will be 47 November 3, didn't want to quit because
"It's another title, and it's a chance to help that organization
become legitimate."
</P>
<P>
Holmes helped make the IBF legitimate by accepting that title
after he relinquished the WBC championship in a dispute with that
organization in December 1983.
</P>
<P>
A second reason for fighting again is the money, although
Holmes maintains he's financially secure.
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance for me to feather my nest some more," a report
quoted Holmes as saying..'`We're talking about a little bit more
than a half-million dollars."
</P>
<P>
Nielsen, a 1.87-meter, 117-kilogram boxer who was a super
heavyweight bronze medalist at the 1992 Olympics and who has a
30-0 record, with 18 knockouts.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Dane stopped former WBA champion Tony Tubbs in
the fourth round October 20, 1995, and won the IBO title by
stopping Tony La Rosa in the second round January 12.
</P>
<P>
Holmes has a 65-5 record, with 42 knockouts.

<HEADLINE> Huge Water Project On Yellow River In Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A water control project,
second only to China's Three Gorges Dam Project, is taking shape
on the Yellow River, China's second longest river.
</P>
<P>
A total of 22.8 million cubic meters of earth-stone work, 90
percent of the scheduled, have been done at the Xiaolangdi water
control project.
</P>
<P>
The concrete pouring and dam building of the project have
started, said a project official. Xiaolangdi is the largest water
conservation project along the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is 30 kilometers north of Luoyang in central
China's Henan Province, has the functions of water supply,
irrigation and power generation. After completed, it may be able
to prevent the most serious flooding possible in 1,000 years as
against the current capability to fight the most serious one
possible in 60 years.
</P>
<P>
Construction on the project started in 1994 by 14 companies
from Germany, Italy, France and China, and is expected to take 11
years before it is finally completed.
</P>
<P>
It will cost an investment of 36.47 billion yuan. The World
Bank will provide 1.2 billion US dollars for the project.
</P>
<P>
The river is scheduled to be dammed in October 1997.

providing a record 116.4 billion yuan in loans so far.
</P>
<P>
The bank's agricultural loans during the January-September
period increased by 31.4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Loans to rural enterprises also hit an all-time high of 113.1

ensure supplies to urban areas -- received top priority, and have
had 10 billion and 13.5 billion yuan in loans, respectively, to
date.
</P>
<P>
A streamlined social service system has taken shape in China's
685 grain and cotton production bases, with the bank's help in
expediting grain and cotton production.
</P>
<P>
It also helped ease shortages of non-staple foods, such as
meat, eggs, milk and acquatic products in urban areas, providing

MEXICO CITY, October 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 75 people were
killed and hundreds injured in Guatemala City Wednesday night when
soccer fans tried to squeeze into Mateo Flores Stadium for a World
Cup qualifying match between Guetemala and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 45 minutes before the match, which
drew about 45,000 people, including the presidents of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Fans who were not allowed in tried to enter through a concrete
causeway about 15 meters long and three meters wide into a seating
area, firefighters said.
</P>
<P>
Security forces could not stop them and the crowd surged through
the gate, trampling and suffocating people inside.
</P>
<P>
Bodies of men, women and children were lined up next to the
stadium track. Firefighters and police lowered them from the
grandstands on the stadium's southern side.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu said that "one of the largest
tragedies in our country has happened tonight." He declared the
suspension of the match and three days of national mourning.
</P>
<P>
The stadium, with a capacity of 50,000, filled two hours before
the game was to begin at 8:00 p.m. of local time. Thousands of

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government today
decided to reimpose president's rule in its most populated state
of Uttar Pradesh beyond midnight tonight, the Press Trust of India
said.
</P>
<P>
The decision, made by the cabinet following a meeting here
today, came after none of the three major political forces in the
state can form a government despite of days of hectic bargains
among them.
</P>
<P>
The recent assembly elections in the state, which ended early
this month, resulted in a hung assembly with all three major
political forces falling short of a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
Of the 419 state assembly seats contested, the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) bagged 174, followed by the United Front with 133. The
Congress Party-Bahujan Samaj Party alliance got only 99.
</P>
<P>
Because the state was under president's rule before the
elections, the cabinet decided to reimpose the presidential rule
to put an end to the sustained political stalemate in the state.

<P>
PARIS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The whole public sector of the French economy -- from
railway to school -- will stage a 24-hour strike today at the call
of the trade unions of public employees. Demonstrations will be
held in all major cities of the country. But transportation will
be disrupted only partially, unlike the complete paralysis during
the strike last year.
</P>
<P>
-- Answering an order of strike launched by their trade unions
today, the public employees will keep in their mind the strike of
October 10 last year, which will be the prelude to a movement of
protest against the social austerity plan of Prime Minister Alain
Juppe. The protesters are calling on the government to stop the
falling of consumption power and to cancel a plan to lay off 6,000
public employees next year.
</P>
<P>
Worried about the deteriorating situation of the public
employees, Minister of Civil Service Dominique Perben has agreed
to hold negotiations with public employees on raising salaries
before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Public employees of France today are staging a one-day
strike to defend jobs and demand higher pays. Seven trade unions
of public servants are protesting the reduction of 5,590 jobs
planned in the 1997 budget, as well as the freezing of salary
raises by the government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the public sector of the French economy is also
touched by the strike. Three unions of the National Railway
Company of France have for the first time joined the movement
today.
</P>
<P>
Three unions of doctors have launched a strike to protest the
plan of Prime Minister Alain Juppe to reform the social security
system.

These countries have expressed deep concern over the growing
threats that the illegal use of drugs poses to the health and
integrity of people and the enormous social, economic and
political costs for nations.

<HEADLINE> China Working on Market-based Policy System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- China's current industrial
policy is one of strengthening primary industries, improving
manufacturing, and expanding tertiary industry, according to Chen
Qingtai, vice minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
Chen was addressing a symposium on industrial policy here
today, and explained that China is working on establishing a
market-based system for industrial policy adjusted to its actual
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The country is also improving its foreign trade system,
speeding up development of high-tech industry, and optimizing the
enterprise structure in order to make it more rational, Chen went
on to say. In doing so, he said, China wants to make full use of
the market in resource deployment under the government's
macro-economic control.
</P>
<P>
The current industrial policy, compared with that of the 1980s,
focuses more on areas where market rules cannot work effectively,
such as projects that have a major bearing on the national
economy, or involve a heavy investment risk, or poor returns even
though they benefit the public, as well as those involving
excessive waste of resources, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Priority has also been given to technology research and
development, while reducing government intervention in
construction projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
As market rules come to play a greater role in the national
economy, administrative involvement in China's industrial policy
is expected to account for a smaller proportion, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
More than sixty entrepreneurs and officials from China and
Japan discussed industrial policy, management strategy, industrial
relations, social security, and other topics at today's
symposium.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Verbal Duel Breaks out in Kremlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 17 (Xinhua) -- In a fresh outbreak of bitter
verbal duel in the Kremlin, Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov has
accused national security chief Alexander Lebed of planning a
military coup, as Lebed condemned Kulikov for his poor performance
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a sensational news conference on Wednesday, Kulikov
said: "Lebed has taken a definite decision to take power by force,
without waiting for the presidential elections of 2000."
</P>
<P>
In order to fulfill his task, Lebed is planning to create his
own military force, or Russian Legion, Kulikov said.
</P>
<P>
Lebed's deputy Vladimir Denisov has "sent out instructions to
create a reserve force on the basis of the interior and army
troops", which would be under direct command of Lebed, secretary
of the Russian Security Council, said the interior minister.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov also charged that Chechen separatists had promised
Lebed 1,500 gunmen to help him seize power in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he had asked Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin to submit materials about Lebed's attempts to
President Boris Yeltsin, who is waiting for a heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov's revelations came in response to Lebed's report on
Tuesday at a closed-door hearing on Chechnya at the State Duma
(lower house of Russian parliament), in which Lebed openly accused
Kulikov of Russia's military catastrophe in the Chechen capital of
Grozny in August. Lebed had earlier urged Yeltsin to dismiss
Kulikov.
</P>
<P>
Lebed said that Kulikov had had all the necessary information
from Russia's secret services to prevent the rebels' massive
assault on Grozny, which forced the Kremlin to start peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Denying Kulikov's accusations, Lebed told a news conference
overnight that he will sue Kulikov in court. He stressed that
either he or Kulikov should be sacked. He expressed confidence
that "it is Kulikov who will be dismissed."
</P>
<P>
He said his confidence is based on "the file of documents"
which is now on Yeltsin's desk.
</P>
<P>
He added that Kulikov's news conference was part of a "hidden
power struggle" conducted primarily by the presidential
administration with Anatoly Chubais as its head.
</P>
<P>
Facing the conflict between Lebed and Kulikov, Yeltsin's
spokesman said the president was "extraordinarily upset" and had
demanded a detailed report on the substance of Kulikov's charges
from both the interior minister and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, for his part, called a meeting of the so-called
"power ministers" together with Chubais this morning.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was able to listen to both Kulikov and Lebed at
the meeting, the Kremlin sources said, adding that Lebed was
granted the possibility to express his standpoint toward Kulikov`s
accusations.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting, the prime minister said that he had
ordered "tightening control in every direction related to enhanced
danger", sources close to the government said, adding that "a
considerable part" of what Kulikov said on Wednesday "corresponded
to reality".
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that he does not see any possibility of
mutinies and coups in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said that the situation in the country related to
Kulikov's statements is being analyzed in detail. He said he had
already supplied the necessary information to President Yeltsin
and will deliver a more detailed report to the head of state
immediately after the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Rejects New Israeli Plan on Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
has angrily rejected the new Israeli plan to divide the West Bank
town of Hebron into Arab and Jewish parts.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinian delegation Wednesday night received a
document from Israeli side purporting the division of Hebron into
two cities, according to the English-language newspaper The
Egyptian Gazette today.
</P>
<P>
Arafat described the plan as a tragedy. "This blows up the
agreement," he told reporters at his Cairo home Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Arafat accused the Israeli government of wanting to broaden its
right to chase suspects in Palestinian-controlled areas of Hebron
and to restrict Palestinians from building schools, hospitals and
clubs.
</P>
<P>
Dubbing it "a dangerous operation", Arafat said it shows
Israel's "aggressive intentions in Hebron and complete and
abhorrent racism," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
"What we face now, unfortunately, is a deliberate attempt to
cancel what has been agreed upon," Arafat told reporters after
holding separate talks here with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader has accused Israel of trying to
renegotiating an earlier agreement on its troop withdrawal from
Hebron, the last West Bank town still under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that the Israeli government led by Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu was trying to maintain control of areas in
Hebron which were to be handed over to the Palestinians under the
accord with Israel's previous government.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Israel should have withdrawn its forces
seven months ago from 80 percent of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, however, has insisted that he wants changes in
implementing it to ensure security for the 450 Jewish settlers
who live among Hebron's 120,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said today that Israel's
proposals to introduce changes to the Hebron agreement were
"unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"There is an agreement on Hebron which should be carried out
without effecting any amendments," Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Reviewing Israeli proposals, it is very difficult to imagine
that an agreement would be reached on the redeployment of Israeli
troops in Hebron in the upcoming short period," said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has seen no progress so far in the talks
with the Israelis over the issue of Hebron, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Palestine resumed negotiations in the Egyptian Red
Sea resort of Taba Wednesday amid widespread uncertainty about a
positive outcome.

<HEADLINE> China's Sole Coal-Power Project Nearing Completion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 17 (Xinhua) --A pilot project for China's
energy development strategy of using available coal to generate
electricity, is nearing completion.
</P>
<P>
Yimin Coal-Power Facility, in the Hulun Buir League of north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, is the only such project
with approval from the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The project was listed as one of the country's key projects for
the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
The project started in 1989, and so far four billion yuan
(about 482 million U.S. dollars) has been used for the first-phase
construction, accounting for 85 percent of the total planned
investment in phase one.
</P>
<P>
According to officials at the Yimin Coal and Electricity
Company, the existing open-cast mine, which is now producing 1.7
million tons of coal a year, will be expanded to produce
five million tons a year.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, initial facilities for the installation of the
two 500,000 kw Russian-made generating units have been finished.
</P>
<P>
The first such unit will be installed and put into operation in
the third quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
While building the project, workers have adopted a great number
of energy-efficient designs to reduce production cost and
raising efficiency without damaging the ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
Workers have overcome many difficulties to have installed two
25,000 kw generating units for a reserve power station. Also
finished are a cement factory and the open-cast mine, with an
annual cutting capacity of one million tons of coal.
</P>
<P>
Power produced by the coal-power project will be transmitted
into the Northeast Power Grid.
</P>
<P>
By early next century, Yimin Coal and Electricity Corporation
will have generating units of four million kw. It will have
facilities for producing 20 million tons of coal a year, becoming
an important modern reserve energy base for updating and
development of the old industrial bases in northeast China.

CAIRO, October 17 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
will seek to promote Arab-French ties and boost the French drive
to enhance the peace and stability in the Middle East during his
tour in the region next week, said Egypt's ambassador to France.
</P>
<P>
"It(the tour) comes within the framework of France's interest
in pushing forward the Middle East peace process," ambassador Ali
Maher said in an interview with "Sawt al-Arab" radio today.
</P>
<P>
He said Egyptian-French consultation is the cornerstone of the
French diplomacy mechanism to reactivate Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will visit Syria, Israel, the Palestinian territories
and Jordan before arriving in Egypt in the last leg of his tour
on October 25.
</P>
<P>
His visit comes at a time when the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations have run into serious crisis over disagreement on
implementing the previous agreement on Israeli troops
redeployment from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
While France, together with EU countries, is trying to exert
their influence upon the peace process, the United States and
Israel have tried to marginalize the European role in the peace
overtures.
</P>
<P>
The American side did not invite any European country to the
recent four-way summit in Washington. Israel has also expressed
hope that Washington remains the sole mediator in the Arab-Israeli
negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Delegation Walks Out Of Asian Religion Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AYUTTHAYA, Thailand, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese
delegation today walked out of the fifth Assembly of the Asian
Conference on Religion and Peace (ACRP) in protest against the
creation of a situation of "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan"
by a few leaders of the conference.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read at the meeting here at the week-long
Assembly, Han Wenzao, vice-chairman of the China Committee on
Religion and Peace, said "before and since the convening of this
assembly, certain leaders of the ACRP, on the pretext of making
amendments to the Constitution of the ACRP, have not only treated
Taiwan as a regular member of the ACRP, but also put the
so-called 'national flag' of Taiwan in its journal for
commemorating the 20th anniversary of the ACRP, alongside the
national flag of the People's Republic of China."
</P>
<P>
"Their behaviors have seriously damaged our trust and
heightened our disappointment. This constitutes disloyalty to the
cause of peace in Asia. This not only harms the cause of peace in
Asia, but also violates the patriotic feelings of all Chinese,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said participants from Taiwan are registered as
"delegates" from the "Republic of China" or Taiwan, although they
are not full members of the conference, thus creating a "Two
Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" situation as a fait accompli
within the ACRP.
</P>
<P>
By creating such a situation, these few leaders of the ACRP
"are actually involving themselves deeply in politics and we are
greatly dissatisfied at this," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
It said, "No matter under what pretext they create a 'two
Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan' situation within the ACRP as a
fait accompli, this has objectively reduced the ACRP to a
political tool used by certain quarters for attaining their
political aims."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation had urged the ACRP leadership to stick
to the "one China" policy, and suggested that the Taiwanese
delegation use the name, for instance, "Taiwan, China," or that,
before a solution is reached, participants from Taiwan could stay
as observers.
</P>
<P>
"But this small group of ACRP leaders refused to consider our
advice and view," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"On this ground," the statement said, "the delegation of the
China Committee on Religion and Peace wishes it to be known that
under this circumstance, the delegation is compelled to make the
decision to cease its participation in this assembly and to make
the recommendation that the China Committee of Religion and Peace
cease its participation in all activities of the ACRP until the
ACRP changes its ways as regrads China."
</P>
<P>
About 250 delegates of the ACRP attended the assembly which
began Monday in Ayutthaya, 85 kilometers north of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The ACRP was founded at its first assembly in Singapore in
1976.

<HEADLINE> More Investment Needed for Developing Mekong River Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Mekong River Delta needs more
investment for its development, according to the Vietnam News
Agency report.
</P>
<P>
The Delta, known as "Vietnam's rice basket", is facing the
danger of being left behind by other regions in industry due to
inadequate investment in the sector.
</P>
<P>
This was stressed at a workshop held in Can Tho city on
Tuesday, which was participated by leading officials of all
provinces, the Can Tho university, the Mekong Delta Rice
Institute, the Tra Noc industrial and export-processing zone, the
Song Hau farm and institutions in the delta.
</P>
<P>
Each year, the Mekong River Delta provides more than half of
Vietnam's rice output and between 1.5-2 million tonnes of rice for
export. In addition, the region also provides up to 60 per cent of
Vietnam's export shrimps and a large share of many agricultural
and marine products for export.
</P>
<P>
The Mekong region only has one industrial and export-processing
zone, and one university at present, while its infrastructure
facilities are in poor conditions and are often damaged by
flooding. Airports and sea and river ports are not fully built up.
</P>
<P>
The workshop also focussed on poor investment in heavy
industry, engineering, electronic and petro-chemical industries
and other sectors, including processing industry in the
region.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Future Cooperation Between Cabinet, Parliament in Kuwait (I) (By Liu Guishan) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is deemed to
experience a new period of cooperation between the cabinet and
parliament as both are determined to place the security and
economic issues on top of their priorities in preparing the
country for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The newly sworn-in cabinet, in its first session Wednesday,
declared that it would give top priority to strengthening
national defense and internal security as well as promoting
economic development, which echoed the opinions of most of the
members of the newly elected National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad
Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah told his ministers that "national security
has been and will always be our main duty and a sacred task that
takes priority over any other issue."
</P>
<P>
He said his government will continue building the security,
national defense, national unity and an effective economy. Newly
selected Defense Minister Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem Sabah would
oversee a plan involving 11.7 billion U.S. dollars for the years
from 1992 to 2004 to rebuild the country's military destroyed by
the Iraqi occupation six years ago.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, the prime minister listed "completing
economic reforms, eliminating the state budget deficit and
boosting general administration and services" as key priorities
facing the government.
</P>
<P>
The former parliament passed a budget of 4.21-billion Kuwait
dinars (13.89 billion U.S. dollars) for the 1996-97 fiscal year,
with deficit projected to stand around 1.51 billion dinars (4.98
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has also been compelled to quicken the pace of
economic reform process characterized mainly with privatization
and diversification of revenue sources.
</P>
<P>
On all these issues, the Kuwaiti parliament, which starts its
four-year term Sunday, is seen less confrontational to the
government than the previous opposition-dominated one, although
some politicians say the small but vocal liberal opposition group
and many Islamists could give the government some headaches.
</P>
<P>
During the previous parliamentary term, clashes between the
parliament and the government caused delay of proper tackling of
many important issues.

<P>
Former Oil Minister and elected parliamentary member Abdul
Mohsen Al-Madaj said the newly elected MPs held that "the
main issues are security, restructuring the economy, improving
deteriorating services and the emerging unemployment problem."
</P>
<P>
Jassem Al-Khorafi, perhaps the richest businessman in Kuwait
and former finance minister, who is the only challenger to
former Speaker Ahmed Al-Sadoun for the speakership,
said he would put it on top of the parliamentary agenda to
deal with economic issues and matters concerning the people's
direct interests if he assumes the post.
</P>
<P>
Abbas Al-khudahari, re-elected MP and an independent in the
parliament, said he strongly feels that cooperation would be
facilitated between the legislative and the executive in the
interests of solving these essential and sensitive issues along
with handling regional and security matters.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the fact that most of the
50 newly-elected legislators are pro-government moderates
vis-a-vis the small group of four liberals would contribute to
the optimistic expectations of a highly cooperative future
scenario between the Kuwaiti cabinet and the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Khalid Al-Adwa, a former tribal MP and an Islamist, said after
he was elected to the new parliament, he believed the
"relationship would be cooperative and may even reach good
levels."
</P>
<P>
Another MP, Abdulsalam Al-Osaimi, pointed out that the presence
 of new faces who constitute half of the MPs-elect increases his
optimism that the legislators would make every effort to
cooperate with the government.
</P>
<P>
Still, diplomats here raised doubts over whether the
newly-formed cabinet is permanent or only transitional because
several highly qualified candidates, whom some newly elected MPs
recommend to hold ministerial portfolios, were not selected.
</P>
<P>
They also raised the question of whether the new cabinet would
secure the vote of confidence from the parliament which would
hold its first session on October 20.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti constitution stipulates that in case the parliament
 fails to confer a vote of confidence on the government, either
dissolving the parliament and calling for re-elections or
reconstituting a new government would occur.
</P>
<P>
However, this probably would not come about simply because
both the majority of MPs and the government are looking forward
to a period of cooperation as required by the social realities
in the country.

control in every direction related to enhanced danger," the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in the presence of so-called "power ministers,"
Chernomyrdin said that "a considerable part" in Kulikov's remarks
at a news conference Wednesday "corresponded to reality."
</P>
<P>
Kulikov alleged that Lebed was making preparations for a coup
plot by creating his own Russian Legion, a proposed special
military force.
</P>
<P>
He also charged that the Chechen separatists had promised Lebed
a support from 1,500 gunmen to help fulfil his plot.
</P>
<P>
"Lebed has made a final decision to proceed in the near future
with the use of force, without waiting for the presidential
elections of the year 2000," Kulikov said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Lebed said that he would sue Kulikov in court over
his accusations of planning a military coup.
</P>
<P>
AT the hearings of the State Duma (Lower House of Parliament),
Lebed accused Kulikov of being responsible for the seizure of the
Chechen capital of Grozny by the Chechen separatists in
August. Earlier, Lebed had urged President Boris Yeltsin to sack
Kulikov.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said Thursday that he had already briefed Yeltsin
about the situation and would deliver a more detailed report to
him after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there was enough tension both in society and
in the armed forces and "we shall not allow anyone to speculate on
this."
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the government, Director of the
Presidential Office Anatoly Chubais took part in the cabinet
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Cut Interest Rates by Reducing Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
trying to bring down interest rates by reducing its domestic
borrowing by 30 billion pesos (1.14 billion U.S. dollars) in the
last quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Sources who attended a recent budget coordinating meeting said
here today that the government's move to reduce its domestic debt
would allow the private sector access to funds which the
government would otherwise monopolize.
</P>
<P>
By August this year, the government's domestic debt totaled 788
billion pesos (30 billion dollars), exceeding its borrowing
target.
</P>
<P>
Based on the government's budget, its domestic debt stock for
1996 should not exceed 777.6 billion pesos (29.67 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
For the last quarter of the year, the sources said, the
government would reduce its treasury bill (t-bill) offering and
would not roll over maturing debts of the Bureau of Treasury.
</P>
<P>
The government started last month to lower its regular treasury
bill offering from 6 billion to 5 billion pesos.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in domestic debt would allow the private sector
to enjoy lower interest rates which are usually higher during the
last quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
In the last quarter of 1995, interest rates based on the
benchmark t-bill rates increased by 2.3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Starting next year, the sources said, the government expects
interest rates to decline as the fiscal position of the public
sector improves and inflation slows down.
</P>
<P>
Projections of the Department of Budget and Management show
that interest rates based on the 91-day t-bill would drop to 11
percent in 1997 and further to 10 percent in 1998 from the
projected 12.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The drop in interest rates, however, would depend on the
ability of the government to post a balanced consolidated public
sector financial position.
</P>
<P>
From this year's projected range of 7.5 to 8.5 percent, the
nation's inflation would decline to 8.5 percent in 1997 and
further to 5.5 in 1998, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda Pays Attention to Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has in
recent years paid much attention to population control, in a bid
to raise the quality of life for the majority of people in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's population today stands at 19.8 million as compared
to 16.67 million in 1991, when the country last conducted a head
count. This is a 3.13 million increase at a growth rate of 2.5
percent annually.
</P>
<P>
The number sounds big and worrying for the small and
developing east African country, but the main issue is not the
number but the poor quality of people's life.
</P>
<P>
Children and youths today in Uganda find themselves in an
atmosphere which is plagued by problems of education, disease,
poor nutrition and poverty.
</P>
<P>
For instance, today most schools in the country are crowded
because of the increasing numbers of school age children
without a corresponding increase in the number of schools.
</P>
<P>
Another example is that many children cannot go to school
because their parents do not have enough money school. As a
result, around half of the total adult population in the country
is illiterate.
</P>
<P>
Owing to poor nutrition, poor medical condition, especially
the increasing number of children without a corresponding increase
in number of health facilities and doctors, the under-five mortality
rate was estimated in 1996 to be 20.3 percent of live births,
as against 16.4 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, life expectancy in the country was 43 in 1995,
one of the lowest in the world and is feared to drop to 40 by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
To improve the situation, the government has taken some
measures to control the speedy increase of the population.
</P>
<P>
One of them is to sensitize people and local governments to
population problem in the country. For this, a curriculum project
called "population and family life education" has been
implemented by the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
The project aims at creating among the learners an awareness
and understanding of the population danger such as fertility,
population growth and age structure and their relationship to
the country's resources.
</P>
<P>
The project targets children and youths in primary and
secondary schools with the purpose of assisting the young people
to grow into mature persons who will ensure responsibilities for
their family and society.
</P>
<P>
What's more, since 1987 when the year's July 11 was
promulgated as the first World Population Day, Uganda has held
celebration activities each year to remind local governments to
plan development programs that would reward their citizenship an
acceptable quality of the life they deserve.
</P>
<P>
Another one is that in 1994 the government set up a family
planning agency to formulate and adopt a population policy in a
bid to improve health, nutrition, education and quality of life
of the people.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda Pays Attention to Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The policies adopted by the
agency aimed at reducing pregnancies which are too early, or too
close or too many, and ensuring child survival, enhancing the
status of women and raising the levels of income of individuals
and families.
</P>
<P>
Because of the above measures, people's awarness of the
population issue has been raised and an exiting result comes out.
For instance, condoms sold and used by Uganda's males (about 3.9
million aged between 15-65) have increased from 1.9 million in
1991 to 3.8 million in 1994. Now about 33 million condoms are
imported into Uganda's market per annum.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the average birth rate of Ugandan women has fallen
from 7.3 in 1989 to 6.8 in 1995, while the use of family planning
methods has tripled.
</P>
<P>
It is the first ever evidence of fertility decline in Uganda
because the censuses from 1948 to 1980 always showed an increase
in fertility.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey carried out in the country recently,
most Uganda women stand for birth control: only 23 percent of
married women aged 15 to 49 want another child within two years,
36 percent want to wait more than two years and 31 percent don't
want more children. That means now 67 percent of Ugandan women
are in need of family planning services.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that the percentage of married women
currently using family planning methods went up from five percent
in 1988 to 15 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
As illustrated in the book "Facts on Uganda", the annual
population growth rate in Uganda has declined from a high of 3.8
percent through the 1960s to an average of 2.5 percent in recent
years. Though the fall in the growth rate is partly attributed to
socio-economic decline of the 1970s, the civil strife from 1979
to 1985 and the AIDS epidemic, family planning is surely a very
important factor for the fall.

<HEADLINE> China Opens Market to Overseas Chain Store Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Retailing giants from Japan and
the Netherlands have been chosen as the first partners in pilot
Sino-overseas chain store developments.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the Chinese Central Government has
given the go-ahead to overseas funded retail chain store ventures.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of contracts in Beijing between several large
Chinese and foreign enterprises for the undertakings marks a major
step-forward for China to open its huge retail market," a market
analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that one venture will be funded by the China
National Sugar and Wine Group Corporation, and three Japanese
companies -- Itoyokado Co. Ltd., Itochu Co. Ltd., and Itochu
(China) Holding Co. Ltd. .
</P>
<P>
The other is a cooperation between China National Native
Produce and Animal By-products Imports and Exports Corporation and
SHV Makro N.V. of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"It is noticeable that the two ventures have very powerful
investors behind them," commented the analyst.
</P>
<P>
The two ventures will each build three chain stores in Beijing
in the first stage of the development.
</P>
<P>
Huang Hai, director of the Policy and Legislation Department of
the Ministry of Internal Trade, said in an interview with Xinhua
that the overseas investment will bring China much-needed funds
and advanced sales and management experience to help the fast
growing chain store retail business in China.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, China has so far established over 650 chain
store companies operating a total of over 9,000 stores.
</P>
<P>
"As a newly-emerged business, chain stores are enjoying huge
support from the government," Huang added.
</P>
<P>
Under existing relevant regulations, the Chinese partner of a
joint venture chain store business must hold at least 51 percent
of the equity, and the term of cooperation can not exceed 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Cao Xueming, manager of the Development Department of Itochu's
Beijing Office, called the joint venture a "perfect marriage".
</P>
<P>
He said that one of the Japanese companies is a first-class
retail enterprise of the world with rich experiences in chain
store and convenience shop operations; while another is a major
player in Sino-Japanese trade, and the third is a
solely-Japanese-funded business registered in China.
</P>
<P>
The General Manager of Makro Beijing said that Makro
appreciates highly that its organization has been chosen as a
partner in one of the pilot projects for a joint venture chain
store organization in China.
</P>
<P>
He said that Makro will bring to China the proven successful
system and procedures of a volume driven warehouse-type chain
store.
</P>
<P>
Makro now operates more than 150 stores in 18 countries.

<HEADLINE> Palestine, Israel Resume Talks amid Uncertainty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 16 1(Xinhua) -- The Israelis and Palestinians
resumed talks in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba Wednesday
night amid widespread uncertainty about reaching any agreement
on Israel's long-delayed troop withdrawal from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which resumed after a five-hour delay, began around
11 p.m. (2100 GMT) and were expected to last through the night.
</P>
<P>
Israeli chief negotiator General Dan Shamron said the
negotiations will continue until achieving something on the
outstanding problems, adding that the talks may go on until Friday.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the two sides will work to solve the current
difficulties, namely, the security arrangement in the West Bank
town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Orekat, however, said the
Israeli side should negotiate with a political mandate so as to
reach an agreement. "Otherwise we would be spinning in a vicious
circle," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron is only part of the
24 requirements Israel should fulfill, he said, adding that the
binding agreements are not renegotiable.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accused the Israelis of trying to
renegotiate the agreements signed with the previous Labor
government.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel has refuted the accusation, saying that the
Palestinians are not sincere enough.
</P>
<P>
"If there is willingness on the Palestinian side to reach an
agreement, it is possible, more than possible," said Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, Israel should have completed the troop
redeployment in Hebron, the last West Bank city still under
Israeli occupation, by March 28.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who won elections in May, cited security reasons for
delaying the move, demanding better security arrangements for the
450 Jews who live among 200,000 Palestinians in the city.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian were growing furious time and again with
Netanyahu's tough policies, and riots broke out last week, killing
79 on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Talks resumed last week after Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat met in Washington and promised to strive for a
speedy resolution.
</P>
<P>
The talks in the Israel-Gaza border were adjourned for several
days before moving to Taba.
</P>
<P>
U.S. coordinator Dennis Ross, who has been mediating informally in
the talks, said that change of venue would increase the pace of
negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Russian Security Chief Denies Charge of Coup Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian security chief Alexander
Lebed Wednesday denied the interior minister's charge of plotting
a military coup to seek power while President Boris Yeltsin awaits
heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has asked Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin and the
interior ministry to submit him a detailed report on the charge,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov accused Lebed Wednesday of
attempting to seize power in an "unconstitutional way."
</P>
<P>
He said that Lebed had reached an agreement with the Chechen
rebel government on his plot and he would get support from about
1,500 Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov said that during a recent interview with Western
journalists, Lebed had hinted that the president was no longer
able to run the country and he himself did not have to wait until
2000 to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
He said that at the end of August, Lebed suggested establishing
a special unit, aimed at dealing with terrorists, radical
organizations and other political and military forces which would
threaten the nation's security.
</P>
<P>
He added that Lebed had demanded recently that a temporary
administration be formed by people from the powerful departments
to help solve the Chechen crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov considered Lebed's actions as preparations for a
military coup.
</P>
<P>
He said that his ministry and the Federal Security Bureau have
tightened security across the country to prevent sabotages by
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, who has had long-held differences with Kulikov on the
Chechen issue, denied the charge immediately, reports said.
</P>
<P>
He told the Interfax News Agency that he had not suggested the
formation of a 3,000-3,500 strong armed force but that was
designed to strengthen the power of the nation.
</P>
<P>
While saying that no military coup would ever occur in Russia,
he accused Kulikov of opposing the Yeltsin administration instead
of him.
</P>
<P>
Lebed said that he would appeal to the court against Kulikov.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's Press Secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said that the
president has expressed deep concern over Kulikov's remarks and
has required Chernomyrdin and the interior ministry to provide him
with a detailed report on this issue.

<P>
LANZHOU, October 17 (Xinhua) -- One-fourth of the funds spent
on improving teaching facilities in the Linxia Hui Autonomous
Prefecture in northwest China's Gansu Province have come from
donations from farmers.
</P>
<P>
Over the past nine years, the newly affluent farmers in Linxia,
which is located at the foot of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and
inhabited mainly by the Hui, Dongxiang, Baoan, and Sala ethnic
groups, have donated more than 20 million yuan to education.
</P>
<P>
Since China began its reform policies in the late 1970s, some
have gone into business, even though many were poorly-educated and
didn't even know how to sign a contract.
</P>
<P>
"Illiteracy is like having no eyes, and knowledge is real
wealth," Ma Liang, a member of the Hui Ethnic Group, said. He has
donated 540,000 yuan to education in his hometown of Guanghe.
</P>
<P>
More than a hundred farmers have donated from 10,000 to 300,000
yuan to the schools in Linxia, and Guanghe and Hezheng counties,
which have four individually-sponsored primary schools.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the school donations has become a kind of
vogue, and Guanghe County decided to build another primary school
this April, whereupon local farmers donated 1.06 million yuan the
morning construction started.

Guangzhou, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A female graduate of
Zhengzhou University, who quit her job in a state-run law firm in
Guangzhou after getting some clients and set up a law firm with
her friends, says that she is "not bold enough", and that many
people have their own law firms.
</P>
<P>
After over a decade of reforms and opening up, the woman, Yang
Wenjun, is in fact quite typical of young lawyers in Guangzhou,
capital of south China's Guangdong Province, where lawyers'
business has developed rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou has more than 800 registered lawyers, in 64 law
firms, many of whom have doctor's or master's degrees. Guangzhou's
lawyers have business relations with more than 60 overseas law
firms.
</P>
<P>
They have handled 24,310 criminal cases, represented 50,300
clients in civil cases, and coped with 73,746 other matters since
1981, according to provincial government statistics.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, some 2,900 enterprises, government offices, and other

drafting contracts for over 200 large and medium-sized projects,
including the Daya Bay nuclear power station project, the
Guangzhou expressway project, and the Pearl River power station
project.
</P>
<P>
Law firms are also involved in the re-organization of sharing
holding systems for more than 50 enterprises, such as the

<HEADLINE> Jewish Settlers Plan Street Demonstrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Jewish settlers have
decided to return to the streets next week, this time to protest
the Likud government which they voted for in May elections.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the Council of Jewish Settlers in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip during an emergence meeting
Wednesday night. The aim of the demonstrations is to protest the
government's inaction in resuming activities on expanding Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlers used to hold street demonstrations during the
previous Labor government which imposed a ban on settlement
activities in order to conduct peace talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In the May elections which witnessed Labor's former Prime
Minister Shimon Peres' defeat by Likud's Binyamin Netanyahu with
a razor-thin lead, most settlers voted for Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is not to oust the government of Binyamin Netanyahu,
but to provide the counterpressure which will offset the other
pressure he is getting to continue with the Oslo process and
freeze building on settlements," said Nissim Slomiansky, a
senior council member.
</P>
<P>
"I never thought it would come to this after we worked so
hard to get Netanyahu elected. But I believe we now have no
choice," he added.
</P>
<P>
Slomiansky, who spearheaded right-wing protests against the
Labor government, outlined a "stages plan" for demonstrating
against the Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
Small-scale protests either in front of the Defense Ministry
or the home of Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai are to begin
next week, Slomiansky said. He added that settlers might begin
building new homes without the government's approval.
</P>
<P>
Settlers also planned to return to hilltops in different
locations in the West Bank claimed by them last year.
</P>
<P>
The policy change by the settlers' council came against the
background that Netanyahu would soon redeploy Israeli troops
from the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The settlers also condemned the Likud government for imposing
"the de facto freeze" on building settlements. The government
lifted the freeze in August and has approved plans to build
thousands of houses in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
However, the government slowed down the pace because the
settlement expansion came under increasing international
criticism and was blamed as one major reason for causing the
Palestinian violence late last month.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Jewish settlers in Hebron are setting
up quasi-militias to protect themselves in the event of Israeli
troop redeployment from the town, where 450 Jews live among
120,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the settlers said the armed "civil defense
units" would be the backbone of the community's efforts to
protect itself. He said the settlers decided to take security
into their own hands as the government agreed to redeploy troops
from Hebron.

<HEADLINE> Clinton-Dole Debate Differs Little on U.S.-Japan Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole found that they
have little difference on U.S.-Japan trade relations in their
second and final presidential debate held Wednesday night in San
Diego, California.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that in the last four years of his administration,
the United States has concluded 21 to about 22 trade agreements
with Japan and U.S. export to Japan has gone up 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton said, U.S. trade deficit with Japan has gone
down in the period.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is a bright picture in U.S. export to Japan
as the Japanese economy is coming back from a deep recession and
the Japanese are expected to buy more American products.
</P>
<P>
Clinton further explained his administration's progress in
dealing with Tokyo in their bilateral trade and said, "We are
selling Japan rice from California for the first time."
</P>
<P>
Clinton stressed that his administration was trying to open the
foreign markets that were traditionally more closed and get the
American products into the markets.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Dole criticized the Clinton administration for
letting more manufactured goods get into the American market and
resulting in the loss of American jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, Dole said he supported Clinton's trade policy and
suggested that a U.S. government should be more aggressive in
dealing with foreign economies to get market access.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Dole held their first face-to-face debate on
October 6. Like the first one, tonight's 90-minute debate was
dominated by domestic issues such as tax, welfare, education,
crime, smoking, religion and jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Americans will hold their general elections on November 5.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Students at all Zimbabwe
universities will from next January be required to pay 50 percent
of their fees.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here yesterday by Higher Education Minister
Ignatius Chombo.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would pay the other 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
It costs an average of 17,200 Zimbabwe Dollars (1,720 U.S.
Dollars) per year to educate a student at Zimbabwe's universities
and up to now this is met through government loans and grants.
</P>
<P>
The minister said although the new system would be introduced
in January, it would affect students already at various academic
stages.
</P>
<P>
Over 300,000 Zimbabwe students complete ordinary level education
every year and a large number of them qualify for tertiary education

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A survey conducted by the
Turkish Confederation of Labor Unions (TISK) has revealed that
the Turkish social security system has serious problems, including
a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The TISK said that measures which will give a sound structure
to the social security system be put into effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
The TISK survey pointed out that the financial crisis of
the social security system in Turkey needs an immediate solution,
therefore it urged the government to exert an unswerving effort
in that regard.
</P>
<P>
Besides the government, the labor and employer organization
must exert efforts for improvement of the social security system
as well, the survey added.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, some countries have taken initiatives
in applying more active and less costly social security systems.
</P>
<P>
It says that in those countries, governments are urged not to
intervene in funds allocated to social security systems and
emphasis is put on making an independent and autonomous structure
to the social security systems.

<P>
LHASA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Tibet Autonomous Region
has witnessed rapid economic progress in recent years, thanks to
the selfless help provided by the people from all across China,
particularly from Shanghai Municipality and Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the two regions from east China have over
the past year supported 182 projects in Xigaze Prefecture alone,
involving 85 million yuan of investment, greatly increasing the
economic strength of the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, Shanghai poured 11 million yuan of
funding into the prefecture to establish primaries schools and set
up a scholarship fund for education.
</P>
<P>
Also in the past year officials from Shandong province, who
work in Tibet helping to develop its regional economy, have
collected 250,000 yuan worth of medicines and 300,000 yuan of
medical apparatuses and equipment from Shandong and donated them
to Xigaze's grass-roots hospitals.
</P>
<P>
A total of 127 local Tibetans have arranged to study and work

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Australian Government Beset with Shareholding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government is
under heavy pressure with two of its senior ministers resigned in
share-ownership scandals and three more of its most senior
ministers being attacked by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The three cabinet members under attack are Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister for Trade Tim Fischer, Minister for Finance
John Fahey and Minister for Industry John Moore.
</P>
<P>
Fischer was defended today by Senate leader of his National
Party, Ron Boswell, who told reporters that there was no reason
for him to resign.
</P>
<P>
"As far as Fischer's shareholdings are concerned, he's
completely in the clear," said Boswell.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the latest resignations of Assistant Treasurer
Jim Short and Parliament Secretary Brian Gibson were due to
potential conflicts of interests between their public duties and
private interests.
</P>
<P>
"But that is not the case with Fischer," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said Wednesday that he was selling his share portfolio
to prevent opposition attacks on his integrity, but still faced
questioning on his overseas lobbying for the Broken-Hill
Proprietary company (BHP) while he held stocks in the Australian
giant.
</P>
<P>
Opposition trade spokesman Stephen Smith told Parliament that
BHP shares rose after Fischer announced the retention of the
diesel fuel rebate for miners in August.
</P>
<P>
He said that Fischer had also lobbied on behalf of the BHP in
Venezuela and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Finance Minister Fahey denied any wrongdoing and
blamed his former legal partner for failing to correct official
records listing him as a director and shareholder of the private
firm Tunboa Pty Ltd.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Fahey said he had sold his stake in Tunboa in
August 1986. But New South Wales Parliamentary pecuniary
interests registers showed he continued to declare a 50 percent
stake in Tunboa in annual registrations lodged after 1986.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Industry Moore sought to fight off an opposition
attack on his shareholdings by saying the opposition had "got it
wrong" on the key allegation that a company he was associated with
had benefited from a government decision.
</P>
<P>
As the opposition is pressing hard on the shareholding scandals
and trying to get another senior minister down, Prime Minister
John Howard reportedly "forcibly reminded" the ministers to comply
with the ministerial conduct code.
</P>
<P>
The code prohibits ministers from trading in financial assets
and holding interests in companies involved in areas of ministers'
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
According to local newspaper reports, most of Howard's
ministers have investments in at least one of those firms while
many of their spouses also hold significant financial assets.

<HEADLINE> Iran Asks Iraq to Show Sincerity in Rapprochement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran today asked Iraq to show
sincerity in rapprochement between the two former enemies who
fought an eight-year war from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by the official daily Tehran Times with
strong background of the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The daily also revealed some content of the message by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to his Iranian counterpart Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said that Saddam Hussein in his message called for good
neighborliness and expansion of bilateral ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The message acknowledges that Iran's prominent role in the
region is indisputable," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily Iran News said in an editorial that
regional issues, particularly the explosive northern Iraqi
situation, were the focal points of the message from the Iraqi
president.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Tehran Times said in its editorial that "let us
hope that the Iraqi call for rapprochement with Iran is a sign
of Baghdad's realization of its past errors."
</P>
<P>
However, the daily did no reveal the special envoy the Iraqi
president dispatched to Tehran to convey the message.
</P>
<P>
Charge D'affaires of the Iraqi Embassy Salah Noori Samarmad
also declined to reveal the content of the message and the name
of the special envoy.
</P>
<P>
While receiving the Iraqi envoy Wednesday, Rafsanjani
underlined the need for making efforts to solve the issue of war
prisoners and to completely implement all articles of
U.N. Resolution 598 on the cease-fire between the two warring
parties.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani also underscored the importance of good neighborly
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
As a further response, Tehran Times declared that "we
welcome a rapprochement with Iraq on certain conditions."
</P>
<P>
"In the first place," it said, "Iraq must prove its sincerity
in moving closer to Iran. Thus far the Iraqis have failed to
prove their good will."
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, a gesture of rapprochement with Iran should not be
tactical. Baghdad must prove that its move is strategic, not
tactical," it added.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, it continued, "Iraqi officials must prove that
Washington cannot influence their decisions."
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war from 1980 to 1988. The
decade-old animosity can not be removed from the Tehran-Baghdad
relations overnight.
</P>
<P>
Although the two countries agreed and maintained a ceasefire
since August, 1988, there is no real peace between the two
rivals.
</P>
<P>
The two countries still keep a large number of their armed
forces along the borders.
</P>
<P>
Both sides criticized the other for lack of trust and
sincerity.

<HEADLINE> Rinderpest in Africa Nearly Eliminated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Rinderpest has not been
reported in southern Africa for 50 years but isolated outbreaks
still affect some areas of Africa, the "Daily Nation" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that isolated cases of rinderpest in Kenya
affect only some wild animals and the disease is now restricted
to small pockets in Ethiopia and southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The successful control and eradication of the disease is
attributed to the vaccination campaign initiated in the 1970s all
over the African continent, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
the most devastating disease of rinderpest could be gone once and
for all from Africa by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
First witnessed in the continent in the 1880s, the disease
swept from Somalia to South Africa, leaving four-fifth of
domestic cattle and wild buffalo dead in Africa.
</P>
<P>
FAO has said that rinderpest is at an all time low and could
be eliminated worldwide by the year 2010.

<HEADLINE> Private Economic Setup Helps Employ People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The development of the private
economic sector in China has created new jobs for people laid off
by state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary statistics, about 1.5 million people
who used to work in state and collective enterprises are now
employed by private businesses.
</P>
<P>
The details were disclosed at a meeting held in Shenyang to
discuss developing the private economic sector and helping
laid-off people find jobs.
</P>
<P>
At present, China's state and collective enterprises have 22
million surplus employees.
</P>
<P>
"With the deepening of the reform of state enterprise
managerial system, the number of people being employed by state
economy will reduce, on the whole, in the coming years, and these
people have to find jobs in other economies," an official in
charge of the meeting noted.
</P>
<P>
In cities and provinces which have more old state enterprises,
surplus labor forces are encouraged to work in the private
economic sector.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that more than 800,000 laid-off workers in
Liaoning, a major heavy industrial province in Northeast China,
are working in the private economic sector, and Shanghai has
helped 180,000 people, or one fourth of the total laid off by
state enterprises, to find jobs in private businesses.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Leading Strategic Analyst Warns of Mutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A leading Israeli think
tank expert has dropped a bombshell among the senior political
echelon and top military brass by saying that the army could
attempt a putsch as a result of growing lack of confidence
between Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's government and the
command of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of mistrust now," Ze'ev Maoz, head of
Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, said
in an interview with Israel Radio Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There have been disagreements in the past, but they focused
on important issues. Now the military elite is suspected of
having sold out to the previous government, so its assessments
may be viewed as emerging out of a hidden agenda," he added.
</P>
<P>
Maoz also pointed to a lack of convergence in concepts of the
severity of Israel's international environment. "The political
echelon has been operating under a sense of optimism that the
military elite believes has no foundation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The military has no opportunity to play the political game
to change the situation, therefore the likelihood of a putsch
-- an illegal action -- becomes more and more attractive,"
Maoz warned. "The idea looks unrealistic, but the assassination
of a prime minister also appeared unrealistic until a year
ago."
</P>
<P>
Maoz's arguments touched off mixed reactions Wednesday night.
Chief of the General Staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak dismissed
the idea as laughable. Labor Member of Knesset (MK) Ori Orr,
a former deputy defense minister and a retired general, rejected
the theory outright.
</P>
<P>
MK Rehavam Ze'evi, of far-right Moledet party and also a
former general, agreed with the point of view. "Even if all the
senior commanders were of one mind, the soldiers would not
necessarily follow," he explained.
</P>
<P>
There have been signs indicating growing unease in the
rightwing Likud government. Netanyahu, whose cabinet includes
four former generals, has attempted to scale down the traditional
communication with the IDF top brass, and unlike Yitzhak Rabin,
has kept them from his inner circle.
</P>
<P>
Maoz hinted that Netanyahu's attempt to distance himself from
the army has even caused a rift with Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, a former general quitting the army only a few
months before the elections in May.
</P>
<P>
Following the bloody clashes between Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian demonstrators and police late last month, reports
spread that Shahak had threatened to resign because he lacked
confidence in the new government.
</P>
<P>
The report was categorically denied by the IDF spokesman, but
military sources said later that Shahak was frustrated that army
advice appeared to be falling on deaf ear.
</P>
<P>
In a bizarre incident, according to a report of the
Jerusalem Post today, the army acknowledged Wednesday that
hundreds of soldiers attending a memorial ceremony for the
Armored Corps at Latrun last Thursday were disarmed because
Netanyahu was attending.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Netanyahu's arrival, General Security Service agents
instructed the troops to leave their weapons on the buses.
"(This) was an act showing distrust in the army," Labor MK
Haggai Merom told Israel Radio, after soldiers complained to
him.

the government would also strengthen extension services to
farmers and fishermen to stimulate production.
</P>
<P>
He noted Zanzibar's population is now increasing at a rate of

BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian said today in Beijing that China hopes to enhance its
cooperation with Turkey and its armed forces, to make its
contributions to world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Chi made the statement while meeting Ismail Hakki Karadayi,
chief of the general staff of Turkey's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission,
said that since the two countries established diplomatic relations
25 years ago, Sino-Turkish relations have been well developed.
</P>
<P>
Understanding and friendship has been promoted between the two
peoples, with constant visits by leaders from both sides.
</P>
<P>
According to Chi, with China being the world's largest
developing country, and Turkey being a great Eurasian nation, the
friendly cooperative relation between China and Turkey is not only
conducive to the two countries, but also beneficial to Asia and
the world.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese defence minister said he believes that Karadayi's
current visit to China will push forward friendly cooperative
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chi noted that China adheres to an independent foreign policy
of peace, opposing power politics and hegemonism. The so-called
"China threat" advocated by certain Western countries with
ulterior motives is groundless.
</P>
<P>
China wishes to contribute to the safeguarding of world peace
and stability, he added.
</P>
<P>
Karadayi said, "China is the factor of peace and stability in
Asia, as well as in the world."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese army, well-trained, is the "cornerstone of world
peace", he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Karadayi, Turkey attaches great importance to
developing its friendship with China.
</P>
<P>
The two countries share the same views on many issues and are
both eager to contribute to world peace and tranquility. He said
he hopes exchanges between the two countries will be expanded to
various areas.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish army head arrived in China on October 15 for a
week-long official visit as guest of Fu Quanyou, chief of the
General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
(PLA).

<HEADLINE> Investors From ROK Eye Lianyungang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIANYUNGANG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Lianyungang, a port city in
east China's Jiangsu Province, has given the go-ahead to 14
projects this year, with investment from the Republic of Korea
(ROK), in its economic and technological development zone.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that the newly-approved ROK-funded
enterprises involve a combined investment of 100 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The city has already approved the establishment of ten other
ROK-funded enterprises. So far ROK-funded enterprises in the
city make up one third of the city's total number of
foreign-funded businesses.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attribute the increased ROK investment in the
development zone to increasingly frequent trade activities
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the increased trade between China and ROK,
Lianyungang held a series of investment promotion events to
attract more investors from ROK, and the events have produced
positive results.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city has also worked hard to improve its
work efficiency and basic facilities for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Lianyungang, situated in the middle of the Chinese coast, and
at the eastern end of the Eurasia Continental Bridge, is only 514
nautical miles away from Pushan City in the ROK.
</P>
<P>
From January to September this year a regular container marine
route from Lianyungang to Pushan transported 4,888 standard
containers from ROK, accounting for 90 percent of the total number
of containers shipped to China from ROK.
</P>
<P>
Lianyungang City has established friendly ties with Mokpo, a
port city in ROK. A marine route linking Lianyungang to Mokpo will
be opened next year.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to geographical advantages, Lianyungang City is
linked to 150 countries and regions by marine routes and the
Eurasia Continental Bridge.
</P>
<P>
In its "Outline of the Ninth Five-Year-Plan (1996-2000) for
National Economic and Social Development and Long-Term Goals for
the Year of 2000", the Chinese Government wants to see a plan
calling for the establishment of an economic belt along the new
Eurasia Continental Bridge, and lists Lianyungang in a priority
plan for sustainable development, which will greatly promote the
development of Lianyungang City as a whole, said the
officials.

<HEADLINE> Regional Ministerial Mission to Burundi Cancelled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A regional ministerial
mission to Buruni was yesterday cancelled in the wake of reports
that the military junta in the troubled central African country
had vowed not to enter into peace talks with Hutu rebels while
sanctions were still in place.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperaton said, "it has been found necessary to
suspend the delegation to Bujumbura for now in order to allow
time for consultations pending clarification."
</P>
<P>
The delegation comprising the foreign ministers of Tanzania,
Kenya, Uganda, Zaire and Cameroun was picked at the Great Lakes
region leaders summit in Arusha last Saturday and assigned to
travel to the troubled country to assess the situation on ground.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said in a communique issued at the end of the
summit that they were satisfied with implementation of the
sanctions imposed on Burundi since July 31.
</P>
<P>
They picked a ministerial team to go to Bujumbura to check the
commitment of the military junta for unconditional peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Burundi strongman, Major Pierre Buyoya, reportedly sent a
letter to the leaders in which he said that he was ready for
peace talks with the National Council for Defence and Democracy
(CNDD) and other groups fighting his Tutsi-dominated army.
</P>
<P>
However, the military rulers in Burundi on Mondy, reportedly
announced that they would refuse to negotiate with Hutu rebels
until crippling economic sanctions were lifted.
</P>
<P>
The regional summit asked the Burundi military ruler Major Buyoya
to open unconditional peace talks with the warring parties within a
month or face further sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The leaders resolved to maintain the sanctions, saying that
their main objective was to serve as an effective means of
securing a negotiated settlement between all parties to the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Accordding to reports, ethnic war between Burundi's
Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu rebels is killing up to 1,000
people monthly and regional leaders fear that the country could
go down the same path as Rwanda where up to a million people were
killed in the genocide in 1994.

ZHENGZHOU, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Two techniques developed by
the Henan Provincial Environmental Protection Science Research
Institute have saved a number of paper mills and leather
enterprises from being shut down.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the central China province has strived
to spread practical technology for the treatment of pollution. A
dozen optimum techniques designated by the central government have

<P>
The two techniques developed by the research institute have
basically solved the problem of polluted waste water produced by
paper mills and leather enterprises with an annual output of
10,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The pollution in Henan is serious. The Huaihe and Haihe rivers,
two major rivers flowing through the province, are earmarked by
the nation as areas needing top-degree treatment.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Accelerates Fishery Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- China is striving to develop
its fishery industry to help feed its growing population.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural officials hold that harvesting both the land and
the shallow coastline seas will relieve the great pressure on
sustained grain supplies.
</P>
<P>
Even the country's paddy fields will play their part - by
becoming part-time 'lakes' for commercial aquatic farming, with
fish growing alongside newly planted rice.
</P>
<P>
The country is to vigorously develop fisheries, while boosting
grain production to provide enough food for its huge population,
an agricultural official said today.
</P>
<P>
The country has 2.6 million hectares of shallow sea area
suitable for aquatic production, with only a quarter utilized so
far.
</P>
<P>
In addition, over 6.7 million ha of rice fields can be used for
raising fish. And there is a great potential for developing
deep-sea fishing in the three million square kilometers of sea
area.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of aquatic production in China registered an
annual increase of 11.6 percent in the past two decades, with the
output climbing to 25.17 million tons last year, accounting for a
quarter of the world total.
</P>
<P>
Its output is expected to surpass 32 million tons by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
However, the per capita consumption of aquatic product in China
averages 20 kg a year, only one fourth of that in Japan, the
world's heaviest consumer.
</P>
<P>
Zhuo Youzhan, director of the Fishery Bureau under the Ministry
of Agriculture, said that rational development of fishery
resources, which does not infringe on land for grain production
and animal husbandry, is a measure of strategic importance in
opening up a new source for agricultural development, and will
help to reduce the direct consumption of grain.
</P>
<P>
Aquatic product is considered a food which contains
much protein and low fat, and can invigorate the function of the
human brain.
</P>
<P>
Many coastal cities and provinces have pledged to build "farms
on the sea".
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Province, in northeast China, will invest 15 billion
yuan in developing fisheries in the northern part of Yellow Sea and
Liaodong Gulf in the next five years. The province plans to raise
its annual aquatic output to three million tons by the year 2000
and to five million tons by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the practice of raising fish in paddy rice fields
will spread in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze
River, the Yellow River and shallow sea area in south China.
</P>
<P>
Fishing areas experimenting modern breeding techniques will soon
be set up in Bohai Bay, Laizhou Gulf, the mouth of Yangtze
River, development zones in southeast Fujian and Pearl River.
</P>
<P>
A number of coastal cities have given energetic support to the
cultivation of valuable species, such as grouper and abalone.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Downplays Tariff Cuts on Information Tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The proposal for zero tariff on
information technology within the framework of the World Trade
Organization by 2000 would bring minimal benefits to Thailand,
according to the Thai Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Business Economics Department under the ministry said its
recent study shows the liberalization of the sector will not give
Thailand better access to products in other markets.
</P>
<P>
Some officials from the department said Thai information
technology companies usually operate according to policies of
their parent companies in developed countries which normally
impose low tariffs on such products.
</P>
<P>
So, the reduction of tariff has little impact on the product
marketing of Thai companies, they added.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the department said the United States would push
members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to
endorse the proposal at the APEC ministerial meeting in November.
But developing members of the group might seek more time to study
details of the timeframe and the coverage of products.
</P>
<P>
Thailand opposes the inclusion of consumer electronic products
such as telephone sets in the tariff cut scheme, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The proposal which is being pushed by the United States
reportedly will cover products such as computer hardware and
software, semi-conductors, integrated circuits and
telecommunications equipment.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province has set up an office to manage foreign-funded projects,
in an effort to help enliven its local economy by opening more
to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan has introduced approximately five billion US dollars of
overseas funds, setting up more than 5,000 enterprises. The
province has one of the most brisk economies in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Shortage of high-quality projects and intergrated management
has led to only a few successful foreign-funded enterprises in the
province, affecting its use of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The office will carry out work to make it easier for projects
to take shape -- from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
And the office will help list projects that the province needs,
to help the area attract more overseas funds. It will also improve
the efficiency of application processing by foreign investments in
the province.

<HEADLINE> Half Nepalese Feel Poverty on Rise: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 17 (Xinhua) -- More than half of Nepalese
people believed their living standards have worsened during the
last decade, according to a recent opinion poll conducted here.
</P>
<P>
Despite the government's claims of considerable economic
growth, more people in Nepal felt that poverty has been increasing
rather than decreasing over the last 10 years, local newspapers
today quoted a report based on the poll as saying.
</P>
<P>
The independent poll, sponsored by the local poverty
alleviation group Action Aid Nepal, was conducted early this month
with the aim of soliciting views of the general public and opinion
leaders regarding  poverty alleviating efforts in the country.
</P>
<P>
It involved 282 street corner inquiries to pedestrians and 77
interviews with opinion leaders including lawmakers, senior
government officials and development experts.
</P>
<P>
While 44 percent of the general public thought that poverty has
increased in the country, over half (52 percent) of the opinion
leaders agreed with that, the poll showed.
</P>
<P>
It also found that more male (50 percent) and literate (49
percent) respondents felt poverty has gone up over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
On the causes behind the worsening poverty, common people
pointed to unemployment and inflation while opinion leaders cited
unemployment and corruption.
</P>
<P>
Some respondents also cited less income, political instability,
lack of industries, decreased agricultural output and lack of
working zeal as reasons for the poverty aggravation.
</P>
<P>
An interesting finding of the poll is that most general public
respondents (61 percent) confessed that they personally had made
no contribution to the country's poverty alleviating efforts.
</P>
<P>
Nepal, with its per-capita gross domestic product being less
that 200 U.S. dollars, is considered by the United Nations as one
of the poorest countries in the world.

<HEADLINE> Republicans, Democrats Raise Big Campaign Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Democratic Party
has collected 46.5 million U.S. dollars for the presidential
campaign over the past three months.
</P>
<P>
But the Republican National Committee reported even larger
receipts -- about 63 million dollars -- for July and August alone.
</P>
<P>
Those figures include loans and transfers from other
committees, as well as fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic National Committee's quarterly spending report,
covering July through September, was made public by the Federal
Election Commission today. The Republicans, who file monthly, will
report their September fund-raising next week.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats raised 23.9 million dollars in so-called "soft
money," donations from corporations, unions and wealthy
individuals that come through a loophole in federal election law.
</P>
<P>
The party received another 22.4 million dollars in
contributions from individuals or political action committees
(PACs), which raise money from corporate employees and members of
unions or other groups with common interests. PACs have a 15,000
dollar ceiling on what they can contribute to a party organization.
</P>
<P>
The biggest "soft money" donation came from labor -- 400,000
dollars from the Communications Workers of America.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Oil Industry Gets Price Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) should seriously consider the current
spiraling world oil price which has exceeded the organization's
reference figure of 21 U.S. dollars per barrel, a prominent
Indonesian economist said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Soebroto, a former mines and energy minister and OPEC
secretary general, said at the fifth Asia Pacific mining
conference and exhibition that the price spiral would only spark
fear and complaints from those suffering the consequences of the
upward price movement.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the conference today quoted Soebroto as saying the
current rise in oil prices has resulted from at least two factors
-- the supply-demand stability on the world market and speculation
that Iraqi oil will not enter the market.
</P>
<P>
Global oil supply, he said, currently stands at 60 million
barrels per day (bpd), of which about 25 million bpd are supplied
by the OPEC and the remainder by non-OPEC countries.
</P>
<P>
The supply can be fully absorbed by the world market,
particularly because Europe and North America are approaching
winter, he said.
</P>
<P>
There is no fear of the world market being oversupplied, he
said, because Iraq is unlikely to export its oil this year or in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, Soebroto said, OPEC, at its next meeting in
November, should maintain its current production quota of 24.52
million bpd, so that the group's members can benefit from the rise
in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference and exhibition opened Wednesday was
attended by delegations from Southeast Asian nations, Canada,
South Africa, Poland, the United States, India, China, Japan, New
Zealand and Australia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori will make his first official tour of Thailand on November
17, Peruvian diplomats said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori's visit to Thailand is part of his three-nation tour
of Southeast Asia which will also take him to the Philippines and
Malaysia, Peruvian Ambassador to Thailand Oscar Maurtua de Romano
said.
</P>
<P>
President Fujimori's trip is to take place at a time when
bilateral trade between Peru and Thailand has grown significantly
over the past years, the ambassador was quoted as saying by local
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries reached 44.4 million U.S.
dollars in the first half of this year, more than the 38.8 million
dollars for the whole 1995, Maurtua said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the total trade value between the two countries
rose from 15.6 million dollars in 1993 to 30.7 million dollars in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Fishmeal is the single largest Peruvian export to Thailand,
valued at 14.6 million dollars in the first half of this year, an
increase of 247.8 percent over the whole 1995 in value, the
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Peru also produces large quantities of cotton, which could be
used by the Thai textile industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's largest export to Peru was rice in the first half of
the year, worth 18.6 million dollars, Maurtua said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Dole Spar in Final Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- United States Republican
presidential candidate Robert Dole turned out to be aggressive as
expected in the second and final debate with President Bill
Clinton Wednesday night, in San Diego, California.
</P>
<P>
Dole, trailing behind Clinton by double digits in most national
polls, went on the offensive tonight, claiming that public trust
in the presidency had been "violated."
</P>
<P>
With only 20 days left for him to try to turn around the polls,
Dole launched attacks on Clinton frequently during the 90-minute
face-off.
</P>
<P>
"You're the president of the United States. You have a public
trust and you have to keep that public trust as George Washington
and Abraham Lincoln did," Dole said. "And I think that trust has
been violated, and it seems to me, we ought to face up to it."
</P>
<P>
While answering questions from the audience at the "town hall"
style debate, Dole referred to issues such as the Whitewater real
estate deal, and the White House officials' collecting FBI
background files of former administration officials.
</P>
<P>
"Many American people have lost their faith in
government... They see ethical problems in the White House," Dole
said, while claiming that he was a man of his word.
</P>
<P>
Rather than responding to the Dole attacks, Clinton expounded
his ideas for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to respond in kind to all these things," Clinton
said. "I hope we can talk about...the future.
</P>
<P>
"I will do my best to make this a discussion of ideas...not
insults," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Questions were raised about budget, tax, smoking and drug
abuse, Medicare and Medicaid, welfare reform and affirmative
action programs, and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Both candidates walked out from behind their lecterns to
respond before nearly 120 selected and undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
The debate broadcast live on major networks was considered
Dole's last chance before a national audience to gain ground in
the polls.
</P>
<P>
Members of the audience were selected from the San Diego area
by the Gallup Organization.
</P>
<P>
The debate was hosted by PBS newscaster Jim Lehrer, who also
moderated the first debate in Connecticut on October 6, and the
only vice presidential debate between Vice President Al gore and
Republican vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp, last week in
Florida. Lehrer randomly selected the questioners.
</P>
<P>
Tonight's event took place in Shiley Theater, on the campus of the
University of San Diego.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Importers Threaten to Boycott Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Importers
Association has threatened to boycott Japanese goods if Japan
retaliates against Indonesia's controversial national car policy,
the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the association Amirudin Saud Wednesday expressed
indignation over Japan's move of taking Indonesia's national car
policy to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"If the consequence of Japan's complaint to the WTO brings any
economic sanction toward Indonesia, the association will retaliate
by boycotting Japanese products, including automotive products,"
the reports quoted Amirudin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Japan is currently Indonesia's largest trading partner and
largest source of foreign direct investment and foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's exports to Japan increased to 12.59 billion US
dollars last year from 10.92 billion US dollars in 1994, while its
imports from Japan went up to 9.2 billion dollars from 7.73
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Japan remained the largest investing country in Indonesia with
cumulative investment commitments of 5.16 billion US dollars from
January to July.
</P>
<P>
Amirudin said the association's declaration was not influenced
by the government or any other party, but a genuine act to defend
the nation's interests.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the European Union (EU) and the United States have
formally requested consultations with Indonesia, under the
auspices of the WTO, over the latter's national car policy.
Consultation is the preliminary step in the WTO dispute settlement
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's national car policy, announced in February, grants
tariff and luxury tax exemptions for three years to Pt. Timor
Putra National to help it develop a national car.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the EU and the US, which hold more than 95 percent of
the Indonesian auto market, filed their complaints recently to
WTO, claiming that the Indonesian auto program violates
international trade rules.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Blocks EU Bid for Arbitration Over Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
succeeded in blocking a request by the European Union for a World
Trade Organization (WTO) panel to review the U.S. Helms-Burton law.
</P>
<P>
The EU claimed the law, which threatens trade sanctions against
foreign companies investing in Cuba, was unacceptable because it
was designed to force other countries to follow U.S. foreign
policy objectives.
</P>
<P>
The EU signalled its intention to press ahead with its demand
at the next meeting of the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) on
November 20, after the U.S. presidential election in November.
</P>
<P>
But Booth Gardner, the U.S. permanent representative to the
WTO, said, "We don't think that the WTO is the appropriate
forum. This is a political issue and not an economic one."
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton law, named after its congressional sponsors
Jesse Helms and Dan Burton, allows individuals to launch actions
in U.S. courts against any company anywhere which, in doing
business in Cuba, benefits indirectly from assets expropriated by
the Cuban government after the revolution in 1959.
</P>
<P>
The law has been condemned around the world and the EU's
request for arbitration at the world trade body has won support
from Australia, Cuba, Canada, Mexico and other Latin American
countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU's request for arbitration, which came after two rounds
of consultation with the WTO failed to resolve the issue, will be
re-submitted on November 20 and will, under the WTO procedures,
automatically trigger the setting up of an arbitration panel, an
EU spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The panel, consisting of three neutral experts, will have six
months to report its findings.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: True Threat Comes From Those Trumpeting "China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan has gradually broken the restrictions put on it after
World War Two. The restrictions were aimed at ensuring it
followed a road of peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Though the Japanese Constitution prevents Japan from having its
own armed forces, Japan has built up a truly modern military
strength through the so-called "Self-Defense Force," which
possesses one of the most advanced conventional arsenals in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The Air Self-Defense Force of Japan (ASDF) has 185 U.S. F-15
fighters and is planning to increase the number to 223. The Ground
Self-Defense Force (GSDF) possesses sophisticated U.S. Patriot
missiles. The 24 squadrons of the six air defense units of the
ASDF have been equipped with 120 Patriot missile launchers. The
domestically manufactured weapons of the GSDF have also reached
world level.
</P>
<P>
The Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) boasts many new-type
combat vessels equipped with sophisticated weapons. Japanese
submarines are high-performance vessels with oceangoing combat
capabilities. In 1988, the MSDF began to build a new generation
of destroyers equipped with Aegis technology, which can match the
most advanced warships of the United States. Some in the Japanese
military have even gone so far as advocating that Japan should own
an aircraft carrier.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that Japan is building up its military power
steadily while claiming verbally that it has no desire to become a
military powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
Japan's military expenditure amounted to 50.2 billion
U.S. dollars in 1995, the third largest in the world, according to
a report issued by the London International Institute for
Strategic Studies on October 9 this year. This is three times
more than the combined military expenditure of the seven members
of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and two
would-be members.
</P>
<P>
Japan has spared no cost in importing the most sophisticated
weapons in the world, making it one of the world's main arms
buyers.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, Japan has also broken the post-war
restrictions on its defense spending, exceeding the limit of one
percent of its annual gross national product (GNP), and sent its
troops overseas.
</P>
<P>
This year Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a Joint Declaration on
Security, expanding the scope of cooperation defined in the 1951
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty from "safeguarding the security of
Japan" to safeguarding the rest of the entire Asian-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
To meet this expanding goal, Japan is attempting to break the
provisions set out in the Japanese Constitution that Japan shall
not exercise the "right of collective self-defense."
</P>
<P>
Japan's actions have created instability in Asia. People all
over the world, especially in Asias, are deeply concerned about
the road Japan, with its record of aggression, will embark upon in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Compared with Japan, China's expenditure on national defense is
much lower. But Japan, parroting the United States, is spreading
demagogic allegations that China's defense spending is increasing
at an alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
the Chinese people, who had suffered aggression, oppression and
plundering by imperialist powers for more than a century, have
carefully treasured their hard-earned peace.
</P>
<P>
China has firmly stood for respecting the sovereignty of all
countries and defending the interests of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Today China's economy has achieved some progress compared with
the past, but per capita national income is still very low
considering its huge population of 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
Eliminating poverty and improving the standard of living of its
people remains one of China's most arduous tasks.
</P>
<P>
China needs a lasting peaceful international environment if it
is to reach the level of an intermediate developed country through
the efforts of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Facts have shown that China is an important force in advocating
and safeguarding peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at
large. It is not China but Japan which walks in the shadow of the
United States, that seeks hegemony and the status of a "super
power."
</P>
<P>
It is clear that the real threat comes from Japan and the
United States, which have been spreading the allegations of the
so-called "China threat."
</P>
<P>
Japan's aim in disseminating the "China threat" is to divert
the attention of the international community and lull the world
into letting down its guard so as to quietly achieve its
long-coveted goal of becoming a major political and military
power.

COLOMBO, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Sea erosion damaged 100 meters
of Sri Lanka's main southern rail track on Wednesday, disrupting
train services on the line and leaving thousands of commuters
stranded, according to railway sources today.

With about 75 train services affected Wednesday, the Railway
Department is planning shuttle services today for commuters.

<HEADLINE> Germany Writes Off Debt Owed by Bolivia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Germany has decided to write off
234 million mark (163 million U.S. dollars) debt owed it by
Bolivia and to continue to help the South American country fight
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The German government made the promise when German President
Roman Herzog and Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl met Bolivian
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada who began a four-day visit to
Germany today.
</P>
<P>
Federal government spokesman, Peter Haussman, said both German
leaders praised Bolivia's efforts in environment protection and in
anti-drug campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Kohl said Germany would continue to support Bolivia's reforms
and supply it with economic aid. The Bolivian president said his
country would try to become more self-sufficient in order to rely
less heavily on foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia, a landlocked country with a population of about seven
million people, is one of the poorest countries in the continent.
Its gross national product in 1994 was 5.6 billion dollars and its
external debt was 4.2 billion dollars by the end of 1993.
</P>
<P>
As a major benefactor to Bolivia, Germany has provided 1.45
billion marks (960 million dollars) in aid.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: True Threat Comes From Those Trumpeting "China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- This year, Japan has trumpeted
more flagrantly than ever the so-called "China threat," and
claimed for the first time that "attention must be paid to trends
in the Chinese military."
</P>
<P>
Its 1996 Defense White Paper said China has been "modernizing
its nuclear strike capability as well as its naval and air forces,
expanding activities at sea, and conducted military exercises in
the Taiwan Straits which has heightened tensions there."
</P>
<P>
A report submitted recently by the Japanese International
Relations Forum to Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, said
"various signs show that China is seeking hegemony and the
status of a super power, which is very dangerous."
</P>
<P>
It was Japan that made the loudest noises over the limited
number of nuclear tests China conducted in the past. This was in
sharp contrast to its attitude toward the nuclear tests conducted
by the United States and other countries.
</P>
<P>
People will never forget that it is Japan that has been the
biggest threat to Asian countries in modern history. Japan started
and participated in 14 aggressive wars, including 10 against
China, in the 70 odd years after the Meiji Restoration in the
late 19th century, which marked the end of feudalism in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japanese troops trampled on the territories of China and other
Asian countries. Japanese aggressors stopped at nothing -
burning, killing, looting and raping wherever they went. Their
heinous crimes are too numerous to mention.
</P>
<P>
It's out of ulterior motives that Japan is now calling China, a
country once subjected to its bullying and humiliation, a threat.
</P>
<P>
After World War Two, and unlike Germany, Japan has only
grudgingly and under pressure acknowledged its history of
aggression. It has never made any serious attempt to realistically
examine its role and its actions.
</P>
<P>
For half a century, certain elements in Japan have been
stubbornly unwilling to face up to the history of Japanese
aggression. They've done the very opposite. They have never missed
an opportunity to reverse the verdict against war criminals and
their crimes of aggression.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Japan should have used the 50th anniversary of the
end of World War Two, as an opportunity to come to terms with its
incorrect historical views and make a clean break with its past
stubborn attitude. However, Japan's reply was disappointing.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, Japanese Prime Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto,
following in the footsteps of former Prime Minister Nakasone
Yasuhiro, paid homage to the Yasukuni Shrine which houses the
memorial tablets of 14 class-A war criminals.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Japanese government connived with a group of
right wingers who landed on the Diaoyu Islands and its surrounding
islets in the East China Sea, which are an intrinsic part of
China's territory.
</P>
<P>
These acts showed that militarism is raising its ugly head
again in Japan, and that an economically stronger Japan is
repeating its pre-war mistakes and ignoring other countries'
sovereignty and the feelings of their people.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Concerned Over Russian Duma's Draft Over Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian foreign ministry
voiced concern today over a draft adopted earlier by Russia's
State Duma to halt the division of the disputed Black Sea fleet.
</P>
<P>
Russia's territorial claims against Ukraine and its intention
to change the process of dividing the Black Sea fleet between the
two countries as demonstrated in the draft are disturbing, Vice
Foreign Minister Konstantin Grishchenko told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
His ministry has instructed the Ukrainian ambassador to Russia
to make presentations to the Russian foreign ministry and will
also seek explanations from the Russian ambassador to Ukraine, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that a constructive settlement of the
disputes existing in bilateral relations is in the interests of
both countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the Supreme Soviet (parliament) of Ukraine will
certainly respond to the Duma's move, and Ukraine will also seek
international support on this issue, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, the Ukrainian foreign ministry criticized the
remarks made by Russian Security Council Secretary Alexander Lebed
on Sevastopol, the headquarters of the fleet shared by Russia and
Ukraine after the former Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Lebed claimed in an open letter to the Russian public that the
port city "has never been ceded to Ukraine and has never lost its
legal status of being Russian."
</P>
<P>
He said that as both Russia and Ukraine had territorial claims
on the city, the negotiations to divide the fleet should be
stopped.

<HEADLINE> Scientists to Combat Superstitious beliefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Association of
Science and Technology (CAST), a non-governmental organization of
well-known scientific workers, will do more to combat
pseudoscience and superstitious activities in some regions in
China.
</P>
<P>
To fulfill the task, CAST has set up a working committee to
safeguard and spread scientific knowledge, and to mobilize forces
of all circles to eliminate pseudoscience and superstitious
activities, said Gong Yuzhi, a leading CAST official, at a seminar
which opened Wednesday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
CAST and its regional associations will also publish reports to
publicize cases involving pseudoscience and superstitions, "China
Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Gong said that CAST will hold regular seminars, once every two
or three months, to enhance public awareness of the importance of
learning scientific knowledge instead of believing in astrology,
fortune-telling and other superstitious practices.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, such superstitious activities as
witch-craft, enshrinement of gods, geomancy and fortune-telling,
which preach supernatural power, have occurred in some regions,
especially rural areas, due to local governments' ignorance of
scientific knowledge, said Guo Zhengyi, a CAST researcher.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign superstitious practices like astrology and
fortune-telling using cards have also brought to China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, from late 1988 to early 1989, hundreds of
Chinese and foreign fortune-telling books were published and
millions of copies were sold in the country.
</P>
<P>
Many of these books were destroyed in the nationwide
anti-pornography campaign in 1990. Yet there were put on sale
again over the past two years.

<HEADLINE> FAO Urges Restoring Agriculture to Priority Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Jacques Diouf, Director-General of
the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), urged
policy-makers of all countries in the world to restore agriculture
to its rightful priority status.
</P>
<P>
Diouf spoke at a ceremony marking the annual World Food Day
today at FAO's Rome headquarters, where heads of state and
government will meet between November 13-17 for a historic World
Food Summit.
</P>
<P>
He said that "their first task is to create a social, economic
and policy framework that will boost food production and encourage
sustainable farming practices."
</P>
<P>
He called it a "logic-defying paradox" that while the world
produces enough food for everyone, "more than 800 million people
have no guarantee of an adequate diet."
</P>
<P>
"We have a dual challenge ahead," Diouf said, "that of
producing enough food and that of ensuring that each individual
has access to this food."
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the ceremony, Cote D'Ivoire President Henri
Konan Bedie appealed for funds for water management in Africa to
achieve food security.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Candidate: NATO Expansion Should not Affect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The issue of NATO expansion
should not become a factor affecting Bulgaria's domestic policy, a
presidential candidate said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Marazov, who is also Bulgaria's cultural minister, was
delivering a speech on his foreign policy. He said that when NATO
(the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) took in new members, it
should take the conditions of the individual country as the basis
for membership.
</P>
<P>
Whether a nation joined NATO should be decided by NATO and the
relevant nation itself, he said. The issue, on safeguarding the
security and interests of the nation, should be solved on the
basis of national consensus.
</P>
<P>
After Bulgaria becomes an associate of the European Union, it
would safeguard its political and economic interests, and
interests in environment protection and security, by the most
appropriate means, said Marazov.
</P>
<P>
The recovery, growth and development of the regional economy
were of vital importance to ensure lasting peace and stability, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's general election will be held on October 27, and 13
candidates will compete for the presidency and vice-presidency.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved a second annual loan of 24 million
dollars for Chad under the enhanced structural adjustment facility
(ESAF).
</P>
<P>
The loan is provided in support of the Chadian government's
1996-1997 macroeconomic and structural adjustment program. The
first ESAF credit worth some 71 million dollars was approved in
September last year.
</P>
<P>
Chad's medium-term macroeconomic objectives for 1996-99 include
realizing an average 5.5 percent annual growth of the gross
domestic product (GDP), lowering the inflation rate from 10
percent projected for 1996 to less than 3.5 percent in 1999, and
reducing the external current account deficit from the 17 percent
of GDP this year to less than 13 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The country's program aims at reaching an economic growth of six
percent in 1996 and five percent in 1997 while inflation will decline
from 10 percent this year to four percent in 1997. The external
current account deficit is expected to narrow to 15.7 percent of
GDP in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chad joined the IMF in July 1963, with a quota of about 59
million dollars. The IMF credit currently available for that
country stands at about 56 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Argentine government
has decided to deregulate its foreign trade to improve the

Under the government decision, Argentine companies may import
and export without having to go through the red tape of a customs
agent, said Carlos Silvani, an official in charge of the customs'
tax division.
</P>
<P>
The deregulation of customs would mean lower costs for
companies and would improve the competitiveness of Argentine
products in international trade, Silvani said.

By simplifying customs procedures, the Argentine government
also seeks to reform a government body involved in cases of
corruption which have been under investigation recently.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Guangdong's 100 Billion US Dollar Investment Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A decade-long plan to attract
100 billion US dollars in overseas investment has been launched by
south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong wants to encourage more overseas companies to invest
money in comprehensive agricultural development projects and
export-oriented agricultural projects in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
The province will also work harder to attract more overseas
investors, and increase overseas investment in basic facilities,
basic industries, capital- and technology-intensive projects, as
well as in hi-tech projects.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, in the coming 10 years, the
province plans to make a use of 10 billion US dollars of overseas
capital each year.
</P>
<P>
Tang Bingquan, deputy governor of the province, said that the
province will strengthen its macro guidance and management over
the use of overseas funds, while trying hard to create a sound
investment environment to attract more trans-national companies,
consortiums and major trading firms, to start businesses in
Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, up to June this year, the province had
made an actual use of 59.1 billion US dollars of overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
The province has established economic cooperation ties with
industrial and commercial communities and financial organizations
in more than 70 countries and regions.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The opening ceremony of
the First Brazil National Games for Indigenous People was held
here on Wednesday when some 400 Indians athletes marched into the
stadium in traditional dresses and facepainting.
</P>
<P>
The athletes come from 34 of the some 200 different tribes
living in Brazil and they will compete in some Olympic events as
soccer, track and field, volleyball and swimming as well as such
traditional Indian events as ritual fighting, archery and canoeing
in the three-day event.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to demonstrate that Indians are also athletes. This is
a very important day, which makes me very happy and gives me a
great deal of satisfaction," said Brazil's Extraordinary Sports
Minister Edson Arantes do Nascimento, better known as Pele, who
helped organize the games.
</P>
<P>
Regional indigenous games had been held in previous years, but
this is the first time the games tap on tribes from across the
country. Some 40 women will also compete in the games for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
"The women will only compete in soccer, track and field,
volleyball and swimming. In archery and wrestling only men will
participate because they dominate the art of war in indigenous
cultures," said Carlos Terena, the Indian coordinator for the
games.

<HEADLINE> Study: 90 Percent US Public School Teachers White </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Almost every nine out of 10
American teachers are white and they are paid more than their
monority colleagues, a private education research group reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of white teachers averages 73 even in urban
schools, many of which have a high proportion of minority
students, the National Center for Education Information said in a
report profiling public school teachers.
</P>
<P>
The report, which surveyed 1,018 public school teachers around
the country, said the overall percentage of white teachers has not
changed much in the past 10 years, hovering around 90 percent
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based center also found that white teachers are
paid about 36,900 U.S. dollars a year averagely, 10,900 dollars
more than nonwhite teachers.
</P>
<P>
But white teachers have more experience, about 17 years,
compared to about 12 years for nonwhite teachers, who have an
average of 12 years of experience.
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 percent nonwhite teachers, 7 percent are black, 2
percent Hispanic, 1 percent American Indian or Alaskan, and 1
percent Asian.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that there is still a gap in salary
between men and women, with men paid 38,400 dollars a year, while
women make 34,600 dollars.

<P>
NEW YORK, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds and thousands of
American black people gathered today at the U.N. Dag Hammarskjold
Plaza, observing the first anniversary of the Million Man March in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
In a nearly three-hour speech to the gathering of around 35,000
black people, Nation of Islam leader Lousi Farrakhan attributed
particularly a 7 percent national drop in crime to last year's
rally.
</P>
<P>
"I know Clinton wants to take credit for it," he said. "I know
the police want to take credit for it. The real truth is that the
spirit of the Million Man March should take credit for it."
</P>
<P>
At last year's march, Farrakhan led black people in a pledge to
"never raise my hand with a knife or a gun to beat or cut or shoot
any member of my family or any human being."
</P>
<P>
The main them of this year's gathering is "World Day of
Atonement." Organizers said the rally would issue a worldwide
appeal against exploitation and violence, and call upon nations to
repent and atone for injustice.
</P>
<P>
Winnie Mandela, the ex-wife of South African President Nelson
Mandela, also attended the rally.

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's newly-elected
presidency, stuck in quarrels between its Serb and Muslim members,
will hold its second session next week in Sarajevo, it was
announced today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Bosnian Foreign Minister Jadranko
Prljic, who however did not specify the date and venue of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The members of the new presidency, who are Alija Izetbegovic,
who is Muslim, Kresimir Zubak from the Croat side and Momcilo
Krajisnik from the Serb side, met for the first time on September
30 in a motel on the brink of Sarajevo city.
</P>
<P>
But Krajisnik and Serb members of the new parliament boycotted
the inaugural ceremony on October 5 for what they called "security
concerns."
</P>
<P>
The issue of venue has since been one of the major obstacles to
future meetings between the Muslim and Serb sides, with the former
insisting on stately buildings and the latter opting for less
symbolic places.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim side also demanded that the Serb officials sign an
oath of loyalty to the Bosnian constitution, while the Serb side
required an agreement to ensure its influence on Bosnian
activities abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to Prljic, next week's meeting was agreed on by
Izetbegovic and Krajisnik during their telephone talk earlier in
the day.

<HEADLINE> 1.3 Billion People in Poverty, 1.2 Billion in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Globally 1.3 billion people, or
almost one in four, are currently living in poverty, with 1.2
billion of them in developing countries, according to the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) today.
</P>
<P>
In addition, every year about 25 million more people are
joining the poor, i.e., having an annual income of less than 370
U.S. dollars, it said in a press release issued to mark the
International Day for the Eradication of Poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNDP, jobless people form the bulk of the
world's absolute poor. It said that around the world, more than
120 million people are unemployed, 85 million of them in the
developing world, and about 700 million others are under-employed.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the extreme rich and poor has widened globally.
The average income of the richest 20 percent of the world's people
is now 61 times that of the poorest 20 percent, compared to 30
times 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 30 years, developing countries have made
remarkable progress economically and socially, including raising
the real per capita income by an average 3.5 percent a year, life
span by 17 years, as well as net enrollment at primary level from
48 percent to 77 percent.
</P>
<P>
Still, about 17 million people in developing countries are
dying each year from curable infectious and parasitic diseases
such as diarrhoea, malaria and tuberculosis. Around 130 million
children are out of primary school and 275 million out of
secondary school.
</P>
<P>
Despite an increase of 20 percent in food production per head
in the past decade, nearly 800 million people in these countries
do not get enough food, more than a third of children are
malnourished.
</P>
<P>
The maternal mortality, at 384 per 100,000 live births, is
nearly 12 times as high as in industrial countries, while the
death rate of children under the age of five, at 97 per thousand
live births, is almost six times that in industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
South Asia is the home for more than 560 million poor people.
About 850 million people there lack access to basic sanitation,
250 million to safe drinking water. Some 600 million people suffer
from chronic malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
In Sub-Saharan Africa, about 170 million, or a third of the
region's population do not get enough to eat. There is only one
doctor for every 18,000 people, compared to 6,000 in the
developing world as a whole and 390 in developed countries. More
than 10 million people are infected with HIV, accounting for two
thirds of the global total.
</P>
<P>
In Latin America and the Caribbean region, about 110 million
people were below the poverty line in 1990. A total of 6 million
children are malnourished. In some metropolises, more than 100,000
children live on the streets. In rural areas, 44 percent of the
people lack access to safe water.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP said that with the only exception of East Asia, the
number of poor people has been rising since the 1980s in all
developing regions. It called for global efforts to diminish
poverty, which it said is a multi-dimensional problem resulting
from deeply imbedded structural imbalances.
</P>
<P>
People in poverty not only lack income to cover subsistence
needs; they also suffer from marginalization and social exclusion
as well as lack of political clout, said the UNDP.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali issued a statement today, calling on the
international community to fight against hunger.
</P>
<P>
In a message marking the World Food Day, he said that in a
world of plenty, no one should have to face the evil of famine and
starvation.
</P>
<P>
"Today, almost 800 million people are chronically
undernourished. This is simply unacceptable," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the World Food Summit in Rome next month will
provide an opportunity for decision makers to reinvigorate and
refocus their efforts to end the global scourge of hunger. The
summit gives the world community a platform for adopting new
policies and pledging new resources, which are both urgently
needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is now 22 years since the World Food Conference established
the goal of "eradicating hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition
within a decade." Without new initiatives and a redoubling of
efforts, the global fight against hunger and malnutrition will
never be won, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"World Food Day gives the world community the chance to
rededicate itself to the fight against the global scourge of
hunger and malnutrition," he said.

The EU said in a statement that it deplored this latest tragic
death, as it did all the violent deaths which had occurred
recently in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
It declared that the EU fully endorsed the principle stated by
the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus that deadly force must not
be used by either side against persons who cross the respective
cease-fire lines, or enter the U.N. buffer zone.
</P>

It called on both sides to look urgently at measures aimed at
removing live ammunition from front line posts and increasing the
area of demanning as called for in U.N. Security Council
resolutions.

"These events only underline the need to redouble efforts to
seek progress on dialogue between both communities," the statement
said.

<P>
The EU also stated that it would encourage and promote efforts
aimed at an early resumption of dialogue between both communities,
with the objective of achieving a comprehensive political
settlement to the Cyprus question, under the aegis of the United
Nations.

<HEADLINE> Feuding Kurds Agree to Negotiate, US Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The two warring Kurdish
factions in northern Iraq have assured the United States of their
willingness to begin peace negotiations after U.S. mediation, U.S.
officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement of holding talks between the Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) was reached
after U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau held
telephone conversations today with KDP leader Massoud Barzani and
PUK leader Jalal Talabani, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Pelletreau will also meet with Barzani's representatives in
Washington Thursday and then travel to the Middle East over the
weekend to consult with Barzani and Talabani.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of those phone calls the meetings between State
Department diplomats and KDP representatives will go forward,"
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said. "Following that,
over the weekend and into next week, Assistant Secretary
Pelletreau will travel to the Middle East and he will have
separate meetings with Mr. Talabani and Mr. Barzani."
</P>
<P>
"We are urging the KDP and PUK to begin an immediate cease-fire
followed by political discussions," Burns added.
</P>
<P>
Bloody fightings broke out in August between the two Kurdish
factions over the control of authority in northern Iraq, which is
Kurds' enclave designated by the United States and its allies
after the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The fightings led to the Iraqi troops' involvement in Kurdish
affairs under the invitation of the PUK for help and the U.S.
retaliation against Iraq with missile attacks on the air defense
installments in southern Iraq.

<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Leading European stock markets'
recent strong surge all ran out of steam today, with London, Paris
and Frankfurt all ending down sharply on U.S. economic data and
Wall Street's turning lower.
</P>
<P>
The London market closed 26.4 points down at 4,024.4 on the
FTSE 100 index as profit-taking on Wall Street and a big fall in
the UK jobless total conspired to weigh on British share prices.
</P>
<P>
The market was depressed by today's unemployment figures,
together with a rise in average earnings and worse-than-expected
government borrowing figures which sparked fears of inflationary
pressures and destroyed hopes for more interest rate cuts, dealer
said.
</P>
<P>
German share in Frankfurt drifted backwards as investors took
profits following Tuesday's record closing and the DAX-30 index
shed 13.55 points to close at 2,714.90.
</P>
<P>
Market players said that investors were also cautious ahead of
German M3 money supply data.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse also ended in negative territory today, with
the CAC-40 index down 9.76 points or 0.45 percent at 2,158.52,
undermined by weakness in the European bond market and
profit-taking on Wall Street.

London's FTSE 100 index closed 26.4 points lower at 4,024.4.
The Frankfurt DAX-30 share index ended down 13.55 at 2,714.90. The

ATHENS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos left for Sarajevo today, starting a tour of capitals in
former Yugoslavia, which will also take him to Belgrade and
Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
In Sarajevo, Pangalos is expected to discuss the development of
bilateral relations between Greece and Bosnia-Herzegovina and the
Greek participation in the reconstruction of Bosnia. Athens had
announced the opening of its embassy in Sarajevo in January.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos will then head for Belgrade to meet with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, his counterpart Milan Milutinovic
and Federal Prime Minister Radoje Kodic.
</P>
<P>
In Belgrade, Pangalos will discuss Greece's economic interest
in Yugoslavia and the development of bilateral relations. It was
reported that economic relations between the two countries have
been burdened recently by Greece's refusal to issue Schengen-type
visas to Yugoslavs since October 1.
</P>
<P>
The Greek and Yugoslav foreign ministers are expected to sign a
cooperation treaty between their respective ministries.
</P>
<P>
In Zagreb, Pangalos will meet with his croatian counterpart

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Criticizes Israeli Proposals on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said here today that Israel's proposals to introduce
changes to an agreement on the redeployment of its troops in the
West Bank town of Hebron were unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
"There is an agreement on Hebron which should be carried out
without effecting any amendments," Moussa told reporters
following a meeting between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"Reviewing Israeli proposals, it is very difficult to imagine
that an agreement would be reached on the redeployment of Israeli
troops in Hebron in the upcoming short period," said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Under an earlier agreement between the previous Israeli
government and Palestine, Israel should have withdrawn its forces
seven months ago from 80 percent of Hebron, the last West Bank
town still under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The new Israeli government led by Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu, who was elected late this May, has been seeking
amendments to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accused Israel of trying to renegotiate
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, however, has insisted that he is not trying to
alter the accord but wants changes in implementing it to ensure
security for the 450 Jewish settlers who live among 120,000
Palestinians in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and the Israelis have focused on the issue of
Hebron in their negotiations which had been held in the Erez
checkpoint between the Gaza Strip and Israel since October 6 and
resumed in Egypt's resort town of Taba today.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side holds that no progress has been made in
the talks, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
But the Egyptian foreign minister added that the Palestinians
would continue the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps some sort of progress would be realized," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who also met with visiting Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul Karim Kabariti today, did not speak to reporters
afterwards. But Moussa said that Egypt and Jordan are moving
together to support the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"The Jordanian position is the same as the Egyptian one ...
Coordination will continue on all levels and our united position
is that we do not accept any change in the Hebron agreement and
we ask that it be carried out honestly," Moussa said.

<HEADLINE> EC Adopts Three Documents on EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC)
today adopted three documents, which are linked to the third stage
of the Economic and Monetary Union(EMU), in an effort to further
boost the preparatory work of the introduction of the single
currency.
</P>
<P>
The adopted documents to the European Council concern economic
convergence between European Union(EU) members, the legal status
of the EURO -- EU's future single currency --, and a stability
pact for EU members which will have joined the EMU.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference shared with EU Finance
Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy, EC President Jacques Santer
expressed his confidence that "a substantial number of Member
States will be part of the EMU right from the beginning".
</P>
<P>
"The EURO will be a fact," he said, "and we are moving to the
final straight of the technical preparation, and that too will be
completed on time."
</P>
<P>
Mr de Silguy said that once these three documents were adopted
by the Council, the framework for the introduction of the EURO
would be finally clarified "so that the transition could be
carried out in the best possible way".
</P>
<P>
The main points of the legal framework for the use of the EURO
include confirmation of the name of EURO and that it will be
divided into 100 cents, continuity of contracts, 1 to 1
equivalence between the EURO and the basket ECU from 1 January
1999, legal tender issues and rounding rules for conversion
between national currencies and the EURO.
</P>
<P>
During a transitional period(1 January 1999 to 31 December 2001
at the latest) national currencies will remain in circulation, and
will have equivalent legal status to the EURO.
</P>
<P>
Euro denominated bank notes and coins will be introduced from 1
January 2002 at the latest and will circulate in parallel with
national notes and coins for up to six months, after which time
only EURO notes and coins will be legal tender.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the stability pact is preventive to ensure that
countries participating in monetary union avoid excessive public
deficits.
</P>
<P>
A maximum fine, which is 0.5 percent of gross domestic product,
could be imposed by the EC on EMU members with excessive budget
deficits. If the country was able to correct the situation within
two years, the "deposit" would be returned.
</P>
<P>
The idea of the new style convergence program is on the one
hand to help the pre-in countries to strengthen their convergence,
and on the other hand to protect the whole EU from possible
monetary crisis with the intervention by the European Central
Bank.
</P>
<P>
These three documents will be discussed by European Finance
Ministers in the coming weeks with a final agreement expected by
the time of the summit of EU leaders in Dublin in December.

<HEADLINE> EU Makes Efforts to Fight Misuse of Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- European Union(EU)
governments, industry groups and parents should unite to fight
child pornography and other illegal or harmful content on the
Internet, the European Commission(EC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
With the adoption of two reports, the Commission is trying to
find ways to protect children and to prevent criminals from
misusing the global computer network.
</P>
<P>
Instead of proposing strict legislation, the EC offered
solutions such as industry codes of conduct, cooperation between
the 15 EU governments to enforce existing laws and software that
can screen out unwanted material.
</P>
<P>
The EC said that industry codes of conduct should guarantee
that all material on the Internet is traceable and that it would
encourage the use of filtering software and the introduction of
one or more European rating systems.
</P>
<P>
The EC also proposed a working meeting organized by the
G/7-countries to examine the feasibility of immediate measures
using existing legal framework and to discuss the possibility of
an international convention on harmful and illegal content.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls for Extension of Unmanning Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Peace-Keeping Force
in Cyprus (UNFICYP) has called for the extension of the 1989
unmanning agreement by the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides in the
wake of the killing of an unarmed Greek Cypriot by Turkish
soldiers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here today, the UNFICYP noted that
"five deaths in as many months in the U.N. buffer zone or
adjacent to the cease-fire lines sadly underscores the urgent
need for arrangements which ensure that such tragic incidents do
not recur."
</P>
<P>
Describing the 1989 unmanning agreement reached by the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot sides as "successful," the press release said
that the UNFICYP has been "pursuing with the military authorities
on both sides an extension of the unmanning agreement to all
areas along the buffer zone." The UNFICYP has also "called on
both sides to prohibit loaded weapons along their respective
cease-fire lines."
</P>
<P>
The UNFICYP "firmly believes that the prompt implementation of
measures, such as the prevention of use of lethal force, except
in clear situations of self-defense, will help to reduce tension
and will contribute to a climate conducive to a peaceful
settlement of the Cyprus problem," the U.N. body stressed in the
release.
</P>
<P>
"To this end, (the) UNFICYP is redoubling its efforts and is
looking forward to the close cooperation of both sides to reach
an early agreement," it added.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, 58-year-old Greek Cypriot Petros Kakoullis was
shot dead when he strayed a few meters into the
Turkish-controlled northern areas while collecting snails with
his son-in-law near the British base area of Dhekelia.
</P>
<P>
A 180-kilometer-long buffer zone across Cyprus separates the
island into two parts. A 1,200-strong U.N. peace-keeping force is
patrolling along the buffer zone set up in 1974 when Turkey sent
troops to take control of 37 percent of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
Kakoullis is the fourth Greek Cypriot killed by Turkish troops
in the last four months.

<HEADLINE> Russian Interior Minister Accuses Lebed of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Interior Minister Anatoly
Kulikov today accused national security chief Alexander Lebed of
attempts to create a special task force for organizing a creeping
state coup.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a sensational news conference, Kulikov charged
Lebed with attempts to create a special task force, called the
Russian Legion, "modeled on the French foreign legion" that would
act in circumvention of law.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Lebed was trying to organize "a creeping
coup" in the country in order to seize power.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his ministry has information indicating that
Chechen separatists are willing to help Lebed with his plans and
that the Security Council secretary has also gathered the support
of criminal groups.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov cited some of the provisions of a document marked "for
internal use only" that Lebed has given to one of his deputies. In
it, Lebed insisted on establishing a new structure, some sort of a
parallel General Staff, that would include secret service agents
and specialists from information and analytical departments of the
Interior Ministry, the Federal Security Service and the Military
Intelligence Service.
</P>
<P>
He believes that Lebed wanted to set up such an organization in
order to localize and neutralize political and military conflicts
in Russia, find, indoctrinate and liquidate political and military
inspirers of "civil riots" and the leaders of terrorist and other
lawbreaking organizations.
</P>
<P>
Such an organization would also find and detain individuals
committing terrorist acts in Russia and "deliver preventive strikes
on the bases of organized crime", Kulikov said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that some time ago Lebed asked him to exterminate
bandits without trial and investigation and to provide him with
the lists of such people.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that this is also evidence of Lebed's
plans to stage "a creeping coup."
</P>
<P>
Kulikov also accused Lebed of entering into "a direct collusion
with (Chechen) separatists" in a bid to gain political mileage for
the next presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The minister told reporters that he had asked Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin to give all the materials concerning this
matter to Preident Boris Yeltsin. Asked whether he may meet the
president, he said a meeting may take place within the next five
or six days.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the State Duma (lower house of parliament) hearings
on Wednesday, Lebed singled out a number of military and political
figures who he said were responsible for the seizure of Chechen
capital of Grozny in August. Kulikov was the key person among
them. Earlier in August, Lebed also urged Yeltsin to sack Kulikov
from his post.
</P>
<P>
Brushing off Kulikov's accusations, Lebed's spokesman Alexander
Barkhatov said that the Security Council was working on a document
concerning the establishment of mobile forces based on the
Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The document is a response to the current problems facing the
Interior Ministry and Kulikov's numerous complaints that he and
his ministry cannot cope with some of these problems, the
spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the work on the document was conducted with
the consent of the interior and defense ministries and took into
account their views.
</P>
<P>
Barkhatov said Lebed had asked the president to give him a
two-week vacation starting next week. "Lebed deserves a short
break because the last months of his work were marked by intensive
work," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to a source in the Russian government, Chernomyrdin
plans to summon the so-called "power ministers" on Thursday partly
to discuss the bitter dispute between Lebed and the "power
ministers."

MOSCOW, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
is worried by the information that Interior Minister Anatoly
Kulikov has accused national security chief Alexander Lebed of
planning "a creeping coup," the presidential press service said
tonight.
</P>
<P>
It said that Yeltsin had ordered Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Kulikov to provide him urgently with detailed
information on this issue.
</P>
<P>
It was reported here that Chernomyrdin plans to summon the
so-called "power ministers" on Thursday to discuss the bitter
dispute between Lebed and the "power ministers." Presidential chief
of staff Anatoly Chubais will reportedly participate.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a sensational news conference earlier today,
Kulikov charged Lebed with attempts to create a special task

He also accused Lebed of entering into "a direct collusion with

However, Lebed's spokesman Alexander Barkhatov brushed off
Kulikov's accusations, noting that the Security Council was working
on a document concerning the establishment of mobile forces based
on the Interior Ministry and Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian
parliament on Wednesday, Lebed once again accused Kulikov and
other high-ranking officials of being responsible for the seizure
of Chechen capital of Grozny by Chechen separatists in August.

way to restore Angola's war-ravaged economy.
</P>
<P>
In order to re-finance IMF's Structural Adjustment Program
(SAP) in Angola, another IMF experts delegation would be arriving
in Luanda on a fact-finding mission, according to the IMF boss.
</P>
<P>
"I have held meetings with the government and the economic
team aimed at seeing how to establish the best possible program
to spare the Angolan people additional suffering," he told the
press conference.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the implementation of the SAP means the year 1997
budget to be worked out by the Angolan government must meet the
IMF standard.
</P>
<P>
The IMF leader also urged the Angolan government and the rebel
UNITA movement to achieve national reconciliation at an early
date to restore international confidence in its economy, adding
that peace and stability are essential for economic development.
</P>
<P>
IMF officials said Camdessus' visit came after the IMF
withdrew its representative from Luanda last year after the
Angolan government failed to implement economic reforms for the
fourth time since 1987.

<HEADLINE> Two Thirds of French People Support Thursday's Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-four percent of French
people support the one-day strike to be launched Thursday by
employees of public sector around the country, said a poll by the
CSA Aujourd'hui/Le Parisien published today.
</P>
<P>
A big demonstration by public employees from around the country
will be held in Paris Thursday to protest the 1997 austerity
budget law presented to the parliament by Prime Minister Alain
Juppe.
</P>
<P>
The law includes plans to lay off tens of thousands of public
employees in a few years to save money and cut public deficit to
meet the criteria of the Maastricht Treaty for joining the
European Monetary Union (EMU) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The budget law is expected to be adopted by the parliament,
which is dominated by the rightwing majority of Rassemblement pour
la Republique (RPR) of which Juppe is the president, and the Union
pour la Democratie Francaise (UDF).
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted on 1,000 people above 18 on October 11-12,
showed that 39 percent of the people polled think the present
difficulties in the French economy are caused by the criteria set
by the Maastricht Treaty for entering the EMU.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 21 percent of the people polled expressed their
hostility towards the strike, while 12 percent said they were
indifferent and 3 percent failed to answer.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Juppe, however,
have vowed to carry through the austerity policy, despite a 12.6
percent unemployment rate at home, the increasing social pressures
on the government, and widening differences within the ruling
majority.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Jacques Barrot said
today that he "understands that a certain number of fears and
requests will be expressed" on Thursday by the protesters, but
warned them against "blocking the country beyond that day."
</P>
<P>
"If there is one day for marking the punch, OK. But later on,
one should sit by the table," said Barrot on television, adding
that "it is not strike but talks which can solve the problem."

<HEADLINE> Sanctions on Burundi To Be Maintained Until </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- African countries will keep on
sanctions on Burundi until the central African country makes
further clarification, the Kenyan Minister for Foreign Affairs
and International Co-operation, Kalonzo Musyoka, said here today.
</P>
<P>
The minister told a press conference at the Kanyatta
International Airport that the military regime in Burundi had
changed their mind when they refused talks with Nyangoma's Forces
for the Defense of Democracy.
</P>
<P>
At the regional summit held last Saturday in the Tanzanian
city of Arusha, the mediator of the Burundian peace talks and
former Tanzanian president,Julius Nyerere, informed the summit
that he had received a letter from Major Pierre Buyoya,
confirming the latter's readiness to enter talks with other
factional leaders in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The summit decided to send a ministerial delegation to Burundi
in order to assess the Buyoya's commitment to peace talks and
take appropriate action if needed.
</P>
<P>
However, BurundiAN Prime Minister Pascal Firmin Ndimira told
diplomats on Monday, "The blockade is an obstacle and the
government cannot dialogue until it is lifted'.
</P>
<P>
the ministerial delegation, of which the Kenyan minsiter is a
member, is scheduled to leave Dar es Salaam for the Burundian
capital of Bujumbura today, but had to suspend the trip due to
the Burundian regime's defiant response and no guarantee of the
delegation members' security.
</P>
<P>
The delegation comprises foreign ministers from Kenya, Uganda,
Zaire, Cameroun and Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Halting Drilling in Caspian Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian oil authorities today
denied the suspension of oil drilling operation in the Caspian
Sea.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that everything
about Iran's first oil well is going ahead normally in the
Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Mehdi Husseini, director of the National Iranian Oil Company
(NIOC), rejected the rumors by Azerbaijan that Iran had stopped
drilling in the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
However, an official in the Azerbaijan's National Oil Company
said Tuesday that Iranians had stopped drilling its first oil
well at a depth of 5,767 meters.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official said that in view of the fact that
everything in the sea is unknown and unexpected problems
particularly in relation to controlling water pressure may arise,
a temporary halt of operation is quite natural.
</P>
<P>
Husseini further said that drilling operation for the well is
to continue as deep as 6,000 meters and even deeper if
technically possible.
</P>
<P>
He said the presence of water below the Caspian Sea bed was
the main reason for the temporary halt to drilling operation.

<HEADLINE> Israel Reports Slow Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli economy is growing
at a far lower pace in recent years, reported Israel Radio
tonight.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimate of Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics
(CBS) showed today that the Israeli economy this year would grow
by 4 percent at most, which is far lower than the 6-7 percent
growth rate in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The year 1995 saw a 7.1 percent increase, the best performance
in recent years, the radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The CBS preliminary estimate was based on the first 9 months
of this year. The 4 percent is still high by western
standards. But the Israeli economy has witnessed a far more rapid
growth for the past 6 years, primarily due to the large waves of
immigrants from the former Soviet Union and the peace process in
the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
According to the initial Finance Ministry's estimate, the 1996
growth rate would be at over 5 percent. But it has turned out to
be a bit too optimistic. Most of this year's growth is coming
from the increase of public and private consumption.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the growth of exports has been behind
that of imports. In 1996, export of goods and services is
expected to rise only by 4 percent, compared to an average
increase of 11-15 percent in each of the past four years.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, import of goods is expected to show a 7-8
percent rise this year. The balance of payments deficit is
predicted to reach a record high of 11.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said he was
very concerned about the economic slowdown. He told the Likud
Knesset (parliament) faction that there is a trend of serious
recession of the economy, which, in his view, began before the
elections in May.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that if the government does not act quickly to
get the economy back on track, it would take three years to get
out of the current situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he has exerted pressure on the Bank of Israel
Governor Yacov Frenkel to lower the interest rate so as to help
prevent the economy from a further downturn.

<HEADLINE> 96' British International Motor Show Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The 1996 British
International Motor Show opens here today to the public, which
coincides with the centenary of the British motor manufacturing
industry.
</P>
<P>
This year's show is claimed a comprehensive model collection of
all the best cars in the world from the family compact car to the
grandness luxury saloons.
</P>
<P>
The event - the largest exhibition of any kind staged in
Britain - is also more dynamic than ever. Among the 800 cars on
display, 35 are on show in Britain for the first time, with prices
ranging from a few thousand pounds to 500,000 pounds (750,000 U.S
dollars) of Mclaren Fl.
</P>
<P>
An organizer of the show said "the show opens its doors to the
public today with more than 150 million pounds (225 million U.S
dollars) worth of cars and motoring paraphernalia on display."
</P>
<P>
One of the stars of the show today is Ford's new Ka. It's style
is so revolutionary, when alongside most other saloons, it makes
them look old fashioned. However, It's price is unexpectedly low,
at about 7500 pounds (11250 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Motor industry experts believe that the show is bound to give
a boost to Britian's motor industry in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, more than 800,000 people are employed in
manufacturing and distributing motor vehicles. Although the
workforce has become leaner over the years, it has become more
productive.
</P>
<P>
Car production has been steadily rising from 1,237 million in
1991 to l,575 million this year. With exports up from 605,000 to
an estimated 810,000 units.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican PM Talks With Visiting IMF President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi today talked with visiting Managing Director of
the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, on the
IMF-sponsored Structural Adjustment Program (SAP).
</P>
<P>
Camdessus, who arrived here today from Angola on his two-day
fact-finding mission, encouraged the Mozambican government to
continue its implementation of the SAP which started in the
southern African country since 1987, calling Mozambique "a model
in the implementation of the SAP."
</P>
<P>
"We have seen encouraging results," he was quoted by Arlindo
Lopes, spokesman of the prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister answered that the Mozambican
people have not yet benefited from the program, despite its
"positive results".
</P>
<P>
According to the IMF estimate, Mozambique achieved seven
percent economic growth rate in 1995, but the foreign debt
soured.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi also talked with Camdessus on the issue of foreign
debt of the country which has reached 5.5 billion U.S. Dollars,
according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said if the Mozambican government continued to stick
to its way of economic restructure, the people would surely be
"better off".
</P>
<P>
The IMF is expected to complete his visit on Thursday.

urgent formation of a machinery to monitor the borders and all
sorts of support to the rebels on either side of the borders in
implementation of the agreement.

He reaffirmed Sudan's conviction on the prospects of bypassing

<HEADLINE> Lack of Funds Prevents Building of African Rail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

LAGOS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The construction of a railway network
linking African countries will start as soon as funds for the project
are available, the president of the Union of African Railways (UAR)
said today.
</P>
<P>
So far, according to UAR President Hansen Isidowe, it has not been
possible to raise funds for the project because the union depends
solely on its members for funding.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 24th general assembly of the union in Abuja,
capital of Nigeria, Isidowe, who was once Director-General of the
Zambian railways, said that if the Organization of African Unity
could extend the kind of financial support it gave to its specialized
agencies to the UAR, the chances of the project coming on stream would
be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
The president did not mention how much the project would cost or the
time frame, but said that the UAR needs to explore additional methods
of funding in order to raise the required capital for the proposed
railway linkage program.

<HEADLINE> WTO Sets Up Panels to Decide Photo Film, Hormone Meat Rows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Dispute Settlement Body
(DSB) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) decided today to set
up two independent panels to investigate the photo film dispute
between the United States and Japan, and the hormone meat row
between Canada and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The photo film panel will look into a U.S. complaint which
basically says that Japanese government regulations close the
country's film distribution system to foreign manufacturers in
violation of Japan's obligations under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. asked for a WTO panel on this matter at the previous
DSB meeting on October 3. Japan blocked the request, saying that
it still saw hope of resolving the dispute through bilateral
consultations.
</P>
<P>
However, under WTO rules, the panel is established
automatically on a second request, which was the case today.
</P>
<P>
The second panel on a Canada complaint against the EU's ban on
hormone-treated meat imports was also set up on a second request
by Canada.
</P>
<P>
The EU has since the late 1980s banned import of meat from
livestock treated with certain growth-enhancing hormones. Canada
says that the EU ban lacks scientific support and adversely
affects the importation of foreign meat.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has already challenged the EU ban earlier at the WTO
and has the case been investigated by a WTO panel established in
May.
</P>
<P>
Another highly-charged row was also brought to the DSB meeting
today when the EU requested for a panel to rule on the U.S.
Helms-Burton law that penalizes foreign companies doing business
with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The EU said it objected to the U.S. trying to force other
countries to follow their own foreign policy objectives through
the threat and actual imposition of trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., as formerly expected, refused the request but must
agree when the request is made for a second time on the next DSB
meeting scheduled for November 20.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Asks Government to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
asked today the government of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, which
has resigned to make way for a new cabinet following the recent
parliamentary election, to carry on official function.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential decree published in the news bulletin of
the state-run Lebanese National News Agency tonight, the
president "asked the government to continue disposing the work
until the formation of a new government."
</P>
<P>
"The president thanks the prime minister and the ministers
for their cooperation and the work they have done for the
national reconstruction," the decree added.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's government resigned Tuesday in compliance with the
constitution since the four-year mandate of the current
parliament expired on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Consultations to choose a new prime minister will begin after
the next parliament elects a new speaker on October 22. According
to Lebanon's constitution, the prime minister will be named by
the president and must win a confidence in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Reliable official sources said that Hrawi will hear the views
of each of the 128 members of the parliament and will name the
majority choice to head the new government.
</P>
<P>
In the Beirut Presidential Palace Tuesday, Hrawi presided over
the last regular session of the Council of Ministers, the second
cabinet led by the billionaire prime minister since he took
office in October 1992.
</P>
<P>
After the session, the president hosted a special ceremony
for saying good-bye in honor of the cabinet members, in which
Hrawi decorated House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister
Hariri with the Order of Merit, the medals of the highest
degree.
</P>
<P>
Hariri and Berri scored victories in the Lebanese general
elections in last August and September and became heads of the
two biggest parliamentary blocs.
</P>
<P>
The victories have made them the most favored candidates
respectively for the next premier and house speaker.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's constitution, the house speaker
should be a Moslem Shiite, the prime minister a Moslem Sunni,
while the president a Maronite Catholic.

<HEADLINE> WWF Calls for Actions Against Climate Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTREAL, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature
(WWF) today called for stronger actions to combat the threat of
climate change to wildlife and natural ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
"Climate change as a result of global warming represents a
serious threat to the survival of biodiversity and the protection,
management and rehabilitation of protected areas," the WWF
reaffirmed.
</P>
<P>
Governments and international organizations "have to stop
hitting the snooze button on the alarm bell for action that global
warming represents," said Adam Markham, director of the WWF's
Global Climate Change Campaign.
</P>
<P>
"How many ecosystems must be threatened before we listen to
this wake-up call?" he asked at a news briefing at the ongoing
World Conservation Congress in Montreal, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Climate changes affecting the planet are caused mainly by the
burning of coal, oil and gas. Huge quantities of pollutants like
carbon dioxide trap more and more heat in the atmosphere,
ultimately disrupting the global temperature balance.
</P>
<P>
At the speed the climate is now changing, scientists predict
the world will soon be warmer than at any time in the last 10,000
years.
</P>
<P>
According to a study by some 2,500 scientists of the world,
atmospheric concentrations of Co2 are now 30 percent above the
pre-industrial level and a warming trend in global mean
temperature can be detected since 1860.
</P>
<P>
"Significant loss of species must be considered as one of the
most important impacts of climate change," the study said.
</P>
<P>
Climate change is "getting worse," and it has already produced
"severe" impacts on ecosystems, habitats, species, Markham noted.
</P>
<P>
In this fight against global warming, Markham emphasized that
the industrialized countries should take on more responsibilities
and keep their promises of Co2 emission reductions.
</P>
<P>
He singled out the United States, the world's biggest producer
of green house gas emission, and Canada, the No. 1 country in per
capita gas emission. The two countries produce more than 20
percent of all gas emission worldwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
If the present level of ecosystem is to be maintained, at least
20 percent of Co2 emission will have to be reduced worldwide,
Markham added.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- China today again called
on all parties involved in the conflict in Afghanistan to work
together for achieving a genuine national reconciliation and
stability.
</P>
<P>
China is concerned about the latest changes and developments in
the Afghan situation, said Qin Huasun, China's permanent
representative to the U.N., while speaking today at the U.N.
Security Council on the question of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting in Afghanistan caused widespread concern
from the world community, the neighboring countries in particular,
according to the Security Council meeting, during which
representatives from 27 countries voiced their hope for a peaceful
settlement of the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
As a friendly neighbor of Afghanistan, China is also concerned
about changes and developments in the Afghan situation, said Qin.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the parties will cast away their political,
religious and racial differences, immediately stop armed conflicts
in the general interest of the country and nation, and establish,
through peaceful negotiations, a broadly-based and stable
government acceptable to all parties at an early date," said the
Chinese ambassador.

<HEADLINE> Iran Expresses Regret at Remarks by Turkish FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Foreign Ministry
said today it regrets over Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu
Ciller's statement about Iran's backing of a Kurdish faction in
Iraq, according to a report by the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
The ministry noted that Ciller made the statement based on
what it called false and baseless information.
</P>
<P>
Tansu Ciller Tuesday accused Iran of supporting Iraq's
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), a rival group of the
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), said IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Both the PUK and KDP have been vying for domination of a large
part of a region in northern Iraq since 1992 after the end of the
Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Ministry claimed that Iran has always been in
the belief that backing any group in northern Iraq would only
heighten tension there and that regional countries by realizing
their responsibilities should help ease tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati Tuesday evening
categorically denied reports on Iran's involvement in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Velayati also invited leaders and representatives of both
warring Kurdish factions in northern Iraq to settle their
disputes at the negotiating table, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the invitation for talks being extended by
Tehran is the sign of Iran's humanitarian and principled policy
to end the fratricide in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister said that Tehran was ready to mediate as
it had done in the past between the two Kurdish factions to end
their armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Commenting further on the latest developments in northern
Iraq, he added that neither of the warring factions would be able
to remove the other rival group through the use of force.
</P>
<P>
"We call upon Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP), and Jalal Talabani, leader of the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) to stop fighting. We welcome
talks between the leaders or the representatives of the two
factions," he stated.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the fighting between the two Iraqi Kurdish
factions was useless and there was no solution to the crisis in
northern Iraq except resumption of talks.

<HEADLINE> UK Unemployment Falls to 7.4 Percent in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of people out of work
and claiming benefit in Britain fell to 2.073 million in
September, the lowest level for five-and-a-half years, according
to figures released today by the Office for National Statistics
(ONS).
</P>
<P>
The unemployment total fell by 35,600 last month, the largest
monthly fall since December 1994, taking the total number of
people leaving the jobless queues over the past year to 190,900.
</P>
<P>
This compares with an August downturn of 17,300 and takes the
overall jobless rate down to 7.4 percent, its lowest level since
February 1991.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the stock of unfilled vacancies at job centers rose
by 16,600 to 253,600 last month, the ONS said.
</P>
<P>
Employment Secretary Eric Forth welcomed the fall in
unemployment as a vindication of the government's economic
policies, saying that "unemployment is not just falling, but
falling faster."
</P>
<P>
However, Labor spokesman Stephen Byers said the figures
included only those out of work and claiming benefit and were
therefore misleading.
</P>
<P>
He added that 95 percent of new jobs were part-time and the
number of full-time employees fell by 47,000 over the summer.
</P>
<P>
City economists agreed that the figures dented hopes of
early cuts in tax and interest rates and reduced the Chancellor's
room for maneuver in the pre-election period.

<HEADLINE> African Women's Conference To be Held in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A four-day African
women's conference will be open here on October 25 to discuss
means and ways to raise capacities of the women policy makers and
strengthen unity among the African women leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian Daily News quoted sources close to the
conference organisers as saying that the conference, which will
be attended by more than 100 African women ministers and
parliamentarians, will focus its discussions on promoting
solidarity among women leaders through proposed regional or
national networks and ways to promote resources mobilization by
training African women policy makers.
</P>
<P>
The conference, to be organised into several training
workshops, is aimed at enhancing the capacity of African women
policy makers in moulding and utilizing public opinion in favour
of issues affecting women, adolescents and children, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
African women policy makers bear a heavy responsibility for
setting the pace at the policy formulation level in vital areas
like population, sustainable development, women's empowerment,
gender equity and reproductive health, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
The first African women's confernce was held in Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso, in July last year.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Accuses Israel of Trying to Cancel Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
today accused Israel of trying to cancel an earlier agreement on
its troop withdrawal from Hebron, the last West Bank town still
under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
"What we face now, unfortunately, is a deliberate attempt to
cancel what has been agreed upon," Arafat said to reporters after
holding separate talks here with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak today also met with Kabariti, who left here following
his brief visit, which lasted only several hours.
</P>
<P>
The visits by Arafat and Kabariti to Egypt coincided with the
scheduled resumption of Palestinian-Israeli talks on the issue of
Hebron at the Egyptian resort town of Taba.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators from both sides and U.S. Middle East peace
coordinator Dennis Ross have been in Taba for the talks due to
resume this evening.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that the Israeli government led by Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu was trying to maintain control of areas in
Hebron which were to be handed over to the Palestinians under the
accord with Israel's previous government.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Israel should have withdrawn its forces
seven months ago from 80 percent of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, however, has insisted that he wants changes in
implementing it to ensure security for the 450 Jewish settlers
who live among Hebron's 120,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat accused the Israeli government of wanting to broaden
its right to chase suspects in Palestinian-controlled areas of
Hebron and to restrict Palestinians from building schools,
hospitals and clubs.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said following the
meetings here today that Israel's proposals to introduce changes
to the Hebron agreement were "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"There is an agreement on Hebron which should be carried out
without effecting any amendments," Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Reviewing Israeli proposals, it is very difficult to imagine
that an agreement would be reached on the redeployment of Israeli
troops in Hebron in the upcoming short period," said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has seen no progress so far in the talks
with the Israelis over the issue of Hebron, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat and the Egyptian foreign minister said that the
Palestinians would continue the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said that he still thought there was a chance for
agreement through the efforts of Ross, but also feared a new
breakdown in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Without redeployment in Hebron, I think we will be having a
crisis in hand," he told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Police Kill 4 Suspected Moslem Militants in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Police today killed four
suspected Moslem militants in clashes in Deir Mawas, Minya
province, some 220 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
A policeman was also killed in the clashes, Egypt's news
agency MENA reported.
</P>
<P>
Among the four militants, two had been involved in a terrorist
attack on Greek tourists outside the Europa Hotel in Cairo last
April, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The attack left 18 Greeks dead and injured 16 others and an
Egyptian parking attendant.
</P>
<P>
The Moslem militants have waged a violent campaign against the
government since 1992 in an attempt to install strict Islamic
rule in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The militants have often targeted Christians, policemen and
foreign tourists in their attacks.
</P>
<P>
Today's clashes came just two days after suspected militants
killed a policeman and a 10-year-old bystander Monday night in
Malawi, some 260 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The police forces have cracked down on Moslem militants, but
recently there have been terrorist operations by suspected
militants almost on a daily basis in southern Egypt.

JOHANNESBURG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's military
veterans today appealed to President Nelson Mandela to ban the
production, stockpiling, sale and use of anti-personnel mines in
the country.

The veterans also called on the South African National Defense
Force to send experts to Angola and Mozambique to help locate
mines undetected.

<HEADLINE> Kabariti: Jordan's Stance Identical to Egypt, PA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti said today that Jordan and Egypt share identical
political views and always seek to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's stance, which is the same as the Palestinian and the
Egyptian positions, is clear as announced by King Hussein during
the Washington summit, Kabariti said during a meeting with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
"We can never be in a camp that wishes to impede the peace
march or to freeze it," said the Jordanian premier.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti conveyed a message from King Hussein of Jordan to
Mubarak regarding the recent developments on the Arab arena and
the Palestinian-Israeli peace track.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the difficulties in the current negotiations
would be eliminated through American mediation, while stressing
that the peace accords signed with the previous Israeli
government are sacred and should not be tempered with.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said King Hussein has got reassurance from Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to commit to and abide by the
Oslo agreement during their contact Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, both Mubarak and King Hussein have become
increasingly critical of Israel's failure to implement the
accords signed with Palestine and to move forward the talks on a
final peace between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa held a tete-a-tete
meeting with Kabariti later on the sidelines of talks between
Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who later also met
Kabariti.
</P>
<P>
The meetings came a day after Jordan's King Hussein became the
first Arab leader to visit the Palestinian self-rule area, the
West Bank, saying that he wanted to work with Arafat to rescue
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti and Arafat's visits here coincided with the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the long-delayed redeployment
of Israeli troops in the West Bank town of Hebron, which will
reportedly resume at Egypt's resort town of Taba later today.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Representative on Actions for Social Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- China today called for
concrete actions in implementing the tasks set at the World Summit
for Social Development held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xuexian, deputy permanent representative of China to the
United Nations, made the call today at the 51st Session of the
U.N. General Assembly, which was focused on the implementation of
the outcome of the world summit.
</P>
<P>
Top priority should be given to the eradication of poverty,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"The international community, the United Nations, the
multilateral financial institutions need to positively contribute
their own share of efforts and resources," according to the
declaration of the summit.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese ambassador said, there is, at the
international level, very little substantive international
cooperation. "This trend must be reversed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mobilizing resources is a core issue in the follow-up to the
summit, Wang said. The international community is waiting to see
whether developed countries are ready to carry out their
commitments, that is, to fulfill the target of putting aside 0.7
percent of the gross national product (GNP) for overall official
development assistance, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador urged the United Nations to more
actively coordinate the efforts in mobilizing financial resources.
</P>
<P>
Wang also introduced China's progress in implementation of the
goals of the summit. For the five years leading to 2000, China is
determined to basically solve the problem of food and clothing for
65 million people who now remain in a state of poverty, he said,
adding that it also plans to add 40 million more non-farming jobs.
</P>
<P>
He said the country will also strive to eliminate illiteracy
among young and middle-aged people by the year 2000, while
actively improving people's material and cultural life.
