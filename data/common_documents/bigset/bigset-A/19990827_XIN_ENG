<HEADLINE> Botswana to Hold Election on October 16 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Botswana will hold general
elections on October 16 this year, the office of President Festus
Mogae announced in Gaborone Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The decision was made late (Thursday)," Agence France Presse
(AFP) quoted presidential spokesman Andrew Sesinyi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The seven political parties contesting the election will have
to submit their nominations for president by September 18, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Nominations for the 44 contested parliamentary seats have to be
made by September 24.
</P>
<P>
The newly-elected president will appoint another four people to
 parliament after the vote.
</P>
<P>
Only 51 percent of some 900,000 eligible voters in the southern
African country have registered to vote in the general elections,
which are held every five years.
</P>
<P>
This is the lowest registration since Botswana, home to about
1.5 million people, attained independence from Britain in 1966.
</P>
<P>
Political apathy has largely been attributed to internal rifts
within opposition parties and widespread unemployment and poverty.
</P>
<P>
festus Mogae of the ruling Botswana Democratic Party took over
as head of state from former president Ketumile Masire who retired
in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent president's party is expected to win the
elections easily, as it did in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Danish Economy to Slow to 1.3 Percent in 1999, IMF Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate of the Danish
economy is projected to drop to 1.3 percent in 1999 from 2.7
percent last year as a result of new measures designed to dampen
consumer spending and housing demand, the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In its annual review of the Danish economy, the imf said the
country's economy performed well in 1997-98, but cautioned that
capacity constraints became more evident as real gross domestic
product (GDP) growth of about 3 percent remained above potential.
</P>
<P>
As unemployment fell to 6 percent, less than half its level
only five years earlier, the country's wage inflation has
increased to 4.25 percent which is higher than that in the main
trading partner countries, the IMF said. For the whole year of
1999, the consumer price is forecast to edge up to 2.5 percent
from 1.7 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Starting in mid-1998, the Danish government has carried out
economic policies aimed at slowing growth in domestic demand,
while sustaining a rapid pace in implementing structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
"Executive directors commended the authorities for their
sustained implementation of a strategy of fiscal discipline and
structural reform, which had contributed to a prolonged economic
expansion," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF projected real GDP will increase by 1.5 percent in 2000
while the inflation rate keep unchanged at 2.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Albanians Continue to Block Russian Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Kosovo Albanians Thursday
continued to maintain a blockade around the town of Rahovec in
southwestern Kosovo to prevent Russian peacekeepers' entry.
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth straight day of blockade as talks to end the
confrontation failed.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovars had a sentiment against Russians peacekeepers and
they would not sign any deal with the Kosovo peacekeeping
authorities on ending the blockade, according to the Albanian
Telegraphic Agency (ATA).
</P>
<P>
The blockade is being transformed into a general protest of
more than 40,000 people of Rahovec, and the majority of
participants in the blockade spent the nights on the roads, ATA
said.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo Albanians Monday began to use hundreds of trucks,
tractors and cars to jam the roads leading to Rahovec, apparently
in a bid to block Russian troops' deployment in the town.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry Tuesday issued a bulletin to
condemn this behavior, indicating it violated the related
resolution of the United Nations on Kosovo.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators agreed
Wednesday night on a timetable over implementing the Wye agreement
that would require Israel to complete two further sets of West
Bank withdrawals by January 20.
</P>

Under the Wye agreement signed by Israel and the Palestinian

percent of the West Bank, in exchange for tougher measures against
terrorism by the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> European Central Bank Keeps Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- With the U.S. Federal Reserve
(Fed) raising its interest rates a day before, the European
Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday said it would keep the leading
rates at current level. The decision was made at its first council
meeting in Frankfurt after the summer recess.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released after the meeting, the ECB said its key
lending rate, which had not changed since April, would remain 2.5
per cent.
</P>
<P>
The decision was far from a surprise to the financial market.
Since the economic situation in Europe is basically different to
that in U.S, experts said the ECB would make no major interest
rates change until year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Analysts of Germany's Commerzbank were cited by the Deutsche
Presse Agentur (DPA) as projecting the ECB to raise the key
lending rate to 2.75 percent in the next February. It is necessary
in the U.S. to raise the interest rates amid the tendency of
inflation, but in the Eurolands there is no such danger with the
current low growth rate, they said.
</P>
<P>
Leading indexes in European stock markets dropped slightly
following the statement of ECB, with the DAX down 34.12 points in
Thursday mid-afternoon against the day before, and the M-DAX index
down 8.91 points. Analysts attributed it to a "cooling-down" of
the investors over the U.S. Fed's decision.

"It is very important to create a platform that will enable as
many countries as possible to discuss in-depth vital questions
relating to bio- safety," said Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
"The potential benefits as well as risks of modern

directly from previous technological revolutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer said that people have to make wise and informed
decisions on how to use them.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP hosted a meeting in Nairobi on August 23 to 24 of
African Ministerial Conference on the Environment with focus on
genetically- modified products as a move to push for a protocol on
bio-safety.
</P>
<P>
The regional conference aimed at examining the current
situation of living modified organisms in Africa and possible
stands to take on the issue. Twenty countries participated in the
meeting.

Informal consultations, which intend to revive the stalled
negotiations on trade in genetically-modified food, are due to be

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Gets Arms Deal at Reduced Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- South African Defense
Minister Patrick Lekota has confirmed that the government has
managed to shave off six billion rand (about one billion U.S.
dollars) from a planned 30-billion- rand arms procurement package.
</P>
<P>
The reduction was after the prices were successfully
renegotiated with foreign suppliers, the state television SABC
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"At this stage, we're confident that following those further
negotiations, we will be able to cater for the need of the defense
force at an amount significantly reduced from 30 billion, by
approximately five to six billion rand," Lekota was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The South African cabinet last November announced the preferred
 suppliers of jet fighters, submarines, corvettes, utility
helicopters from Sweden, Britain, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
The package included counter-trade measures, or industrial
participation, by the tendering countries, which is expected to
bring about up to 100,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Lekota said the counter-trade programs would not be
significantly affected by the price cut.
</P>
<P>
"The package has been negotiated in such a way that it should
support the delivery programs on job creation, the strengthening
of the economy and so on," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling African National Congress Thursday denied news
reports that there was dissent among its ranks over the massive
arms deal.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa Draws Lessons from Asia in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Organized by the United Nations
Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), a delegation comprising participants
from Zambia, Swaziland and some other African countries has
visited Thailand recently in a bid to draw lessons from the Asian
state in fighting against HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS said that nearly 10,000 men in sub-Saharan Africa are
becoming infected with the AIDS virus every day and lamented that
while they may work productively for a decade or more, most of
them will die before reaching retirement age.
</P>
<P>
The southern part of the African continent holds the majority
of the world's hard-hit countries. In Botswana, Namibia,
Swaziland, Zimbabwe and Zambia, current estimates show that
between 20-26 percent of people aged 15- 49 are living with HIV
and AIDS. South Africa, which trailed behind some of its neighbors
in HIV infection levels at the start of the 1990s, is
unfortunately catching up fast. In Zambia, the estimated adult
prevalence was about 20 percent in 1997. It means that one out of
five people in this country is HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, AIDS was responsible for an estimated two million
African deaths, 5,500 funerals per day.
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS says that for too long it has been assumed that "dealing
with AIDS in the working place is not good for workers." But
experience has now shown that both the management and workers have
a stake in the fight against AIDS and that all sectors need to be
engaged right at the outset.
</P>
<P>
Officially launched in 1993, Thailand Business Coalition on
AIDS (TBCA) has been mobilizing resources (money and skills) from
the private sector for HIV/AIDS prevention, for adoption of
clear, non discriminatory workplace policies and for
implementation of workplace education programs.

In carrying out its objectives, TBCA is serving as a forum to
foster, guide and support efforts among businesses with the
government and non- governmental organizations. It works with
business leaders to help create a framework for business community
to effectively plan and implement HIV/AIDS activities in
workplaces; it provides a forum and facilitates networking for
training managers to share ideas on how best they can manage
HIV/AIDS within their organizations.
</P>
<P>
TBCA has been embraced by the business community because they
are concerned with loss of experienced personnel who may represent
special skills, years of training and institutional memory. They
are also concerned with fear of increased costs of hiring,
training and screening new employees when skilled employees die.
They have realized that it is cheaper to prevent HIV infections
than to treat infected employees.
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS representative Bernadette Freers told Xinhua Thursday
that African countries would greatly benefit from such
experiences.
</P>
<P>
She said it is equally important, however, to remember that 80
percent of the adult population in Zambia remains uninfected and
all the women and men in this age group can actively take measures
to protect themselves and help stop the spread of the virus.
</P>
<P>
That's why a strong response to the epidemic from all sectors
of the Zambian society is so important, she added.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the Zambia National AIDS Control Program
carried out this year an extensive consultation with a wide range
of stake-holders, including the business sector represented by the
Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Zambia
Federation of Employers and the Zambia Congress of Trade Union
from which emerged the process of developing the national Strategy
Plan for 1999-2001.
</P>
<P>
She said all participants welcomed the establishment of the
business coalition on HIV/AIDS in Zambia with a secretariat which
will support and facilitate activities on regular basis and called
on all Zambia's businesses to support the idea.
</P>
<P>
Freers described the positive response by the business sector
to form a coalition to fight the pandemic as the only and last
solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
She said the workplace is an appropriate and important setting
for AIDS programs because workers spend a significant part of time
working there.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the National AIDS Control Program also held
workshops with the business sector to explore and discuss the role
of the latter in HIV/ AIDS prevention, but "most of the workplace
only distribute condoms and carry out peer education among the
junior officers without any support by management. The peer
educators themselves do not possess adequate training and are
therefore not confident," she said.
</P>
<P>
She hailed Barclays Bank and Nakambala Sugar Estate for having
 developed and implemented successful HIV/AIDS prevention and
awareness programs.
</P>
<P>
"However, there are very few examples of organizations with
high level commitment in Zambia," Freers complained.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the African delegation explored the practical
 strategies developed by TBCA in facilitating the business
community of Thailand to implement HIV/AIDS activities.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that some twinning arrangements might be
established between Thailand, Zambia and Swaziland. Thailand
representatives may well be invited to the forthcoming 11th
International Conference on AIDS and STDs (sexually transmitted
diseases) in Africa scheduled for September 12- 16 in Zambian
capital Lusaka.

<HEADLINE> Barak Refuses to Intervene in Controversial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Despite the pressure from the
religious parties in his coalition government, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak Thursday said that he would not intervene in
moving a giant turbine on Shabbat.
</P>
<P>
Barak, currently vacationing in northern Israel, said that
transportation of the turbine is a commercial issue and he does
not intend to intervene.
</P>
<P>
Barak's associates also accused some members of the religious
parties of turning the turbine affair into an issue concerning
the survival of the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Shabbat, which means rest in Hebrew, starts in sunset on Friday
and ends in sunset on Saturday. According to strict Judaism rules,
the Jews are forbidden to do things such as work, cooking or
driving on Shabbat.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli company is scheduled to move a giant turbine over
the next four Saturdays to a power plant from the central area of
the country to the southern city of Ashkelon.
</P>
<P>
The religious parties in Barak's coalition government have
asked the government to prevent the movement.
</P>
<P>
Members of the powerful Shas party, which holds 17 seats in the
120-member Knesset (parliament), pointed out that Barak could
easily prevent the transportation of loads on the Sabbath in his
capacity.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of Shas party are also holding meetings to discuss
the matter.
</P>
<P>
National Religious Party, which takes 5 seats in the Knesset,
also warned that the government should not allow the turbine to be
moved on the Jewish holy days.
</P>
<P>
The current coalition government led by Barak has 75 seats in
the Knesset, with the religious parties accounting for 22.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Staffers to Visit Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of U.S.
Congressional aides will pay a five-day visit starting Friday to
Iraq to investigate the effect of U.N. sanctions there, a member
of the group said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The aid of the trip was to "examine the effect of economic
sanctions in Iraq on the civilian population, governmental policy
and U.S. economic and strategic interests," the group said in a
request sent to National Security Adviser Sandy Berger on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has blamed the sanctions for the death of hundreds of
thousands of Iraqis through malnutrition and the collapse of
medical services.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey issued by the U.N. Children's Fund found that
child mortality rates have more than doubled in south and central
Iraq since the sanctions began in 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The State Department opposing the visit forced the group to
cancel the trip last week, but in later discussion the State
Department conceded they could make the visit legal if they did
not enter Iraq on U.S. passports.
</P>
<P>
A fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies however said the
State Department "didn't have a legal basis to prohibit
representatives from the Congress from conducting an
investigation."

<HEADLINE> Russia Condemns Arrest of General in Vienna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia Thursday condemned the
arrest in Vienna of a Bosnian Serb general as "unprecedented" and
harmful for the peace process in the Balkan.
</P>
<P>
"What happened in Vienna, which has long been believed to be a
capital of multilateral diplomacy, can be described only as
unprecedented," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement
in response to Wednesday's arrest of the head of the general staff
of the Serb Republic of Bosnia army, General Momir Talic, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Talic was arrested by Austrian police for being on the
so-called closed list of the international tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He arrived in Vienna to take part in a seminar sponsored by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe at the
invitation of the Austrian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Russia "has always called for just punishment to be meted out
to those guilty of war crimes in Bosnia, but all problems related
to this are to be solved only through the Bosnian parties' direct
cooperation with the tribunal," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Each time a decision is taken to arrest a person accused of
military crimes, even if it is sanctioned by the tribunal's chief
prosecutor, we must, first of all, assess its influence on the
situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the implementation of the
peace treaty," the Russian ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"The common task of all participants of the Bosnian settlement
is to take serious steps and prevent measures which can trigger
tension or affect the progress of the peaceful settlement" in the
country, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Reiterates Call for Summit to Close Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian presidential adviser
on Thursday reiterated call for a pan-Arab summit, the country's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing 3,000 students at Cairo University's Beni Suef
Branch in southern Egypt, Presidential Political Adviser Osama
el-Baz underlined that the proposed summit will help close Arab
ranks and form a united Arab stance on regional issues.
</P>
<P>
After the election of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in May,
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak proposed in June that an Arab
summit be convened to forge a united position on the expected
Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said on Wednesday that Arab states were discussing the
holding of the summit. Contacts "began in August and will continue
through September to prepare an agenda for the summit," he said in
a speech to students at Alexandria University.
</P>
<P>
The president said he has long pushed for the summit to be held
on an annual basis to provide an opportunity to settle conflicts.
</P>
<P>
But reports said that differences among Arab countries have
obstructed the proposal. Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on
Thursday confirmed the reports, warning against any attempt to
stall the holding of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that some parties were seeking to delay,
though not hamstring, the convocation of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The idea to convene a pan-Arab summit has run into opposition
from Syria, which has yet to resume negotiations with Israel for
the return of the Golan Heights captured by the Jewish state in
the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Further, the proposed summit could bring together Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein and the leaders of Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia, who have not forgotten Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait
and its bombardment of Saudi cities during the subsequent Gulf War
in 1991.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official on Botswana's Social, Human </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Botswana has not been able
to adequately meet the major challenges of poverty, unemployment
and HIV/AIDS, United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
representative Macharia Kamau said in Botswanan capital Gaborone
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Policies and programs designed to respond to poverty and
unemployment continue not to bear the fruit that we and the
government would wish for," Kamau was quoted by South African
Press Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The government and the people of Botswana continue to face
considerable difficulties in the execution of social and human
development programs," he added.
</P>
<P>
He was introducing a review of the UNDP's 35-million-U.S.
dollar program of collaboration with Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Rafeeuddin Ahmed, U.N. Undersecretary-General and a special
advisor to the UNDP, said the continuing problems stemmed from the
non-implementation of projects.
</P>
<P>
"There is a most urgent need to deal with the rising effect of
HIV/AIDS, yet there appears to be a lack of political will," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Recommendations to address poverty are not translated into
coherent and integrated action plans."
</P>
<P>
Criticism did not come only from the world body. Presenting a
review of Botswana's National Development Plan 8 (NDP8), acting
director of macro- economic development, Wilfred Mandlebe, said
there was a serious need to re- prioritize the plan.
</P>
<P>
"The theme of NDP8 is to promote sustainable economic
diversification from the diamond industry, create jobs and
alleviate poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Little progress has been achieved. Whilst the targeted
average growth rate of 5.2 percent per annum over the five years
of the plan is likely, most of the impetus continues to come from
the mining sector."
</P>
<P>
Mandlebe said the review of NDP8 had identified AIDS as a
number one priority.
</P>
<P>
"It poses serious consequences for the economy," he said. "It
will drastically reduce skilled human resources with serious
implications on productivity."
</P>
<P>
Despite continued public education programs which had so far
cost 43.5 million pula (9.8 million U.S. dollars), prevalence
rates remained high, rated at 17 percent of the adult population.

<HEADLINE> Half of COMESA Population Live in Poverty: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- About 50 percent of the 380
million people in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) are living in abject poverty with little access to
employment and other income generating ventures.
</P>
<P>
African program director Andrew Mullei of the regional body
revealed this at a three-day brainstorming workshop on the COMESA
Vision and Strategy in Zambian capital Lusaka Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mullei said that the member states could not afford to ignore
the challenges that constitute internal indebtedness, noting that
there is need for member states to understand the importance of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
It was disclosed that only seven countries out of the 21 COMESA
member states are less indebted while the rest live in abject
poverty.
</P>
<P>
COMESA Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha said that COMESA had
the potential strength to confront the future challenges so as to
exploit the emerging opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He that the workshop was a process initiated by the member
states themselves to restructure and re-position the organization
so that it could compete favorably on the world market and in turn
try to reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
"The workshop we believe can contribute significantly toward
making COMESA one of the leading and dynamic regional integration
grouping in the world and our dream lies partly in our capacity to
identify opportunities," he said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the process and time-table for completing the
development of the COMESA Vision and Strategy into the 21st
century, he said, the secretariat will put together a second draft
based on the outcome of this brainstorming exercise.
</P>
<P>
The draft will be submitted to the Council of Ministers Meeting
later this year for their consideration.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that the process will culminate in submitting a
final draft to the Assembly of Heads of State and Government in
May 2000," he said.

GAZA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat Thursday briefed a U.S. congressmen
delegation on the developments in the implementation of the Wye
Accord.
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting in Ramallah as important and positive,
PNA Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil
Shaath said Arafat reviewed the economic difficulties faced by his
people due to the Israeli intransigent measures.
</P>
<P>
Arafat complained the stalled peace process has affected
investment and trade in the Palestinian territories, Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel are negotiating the full
implementation of the Wye Accord, which was suspended in early
December last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye Accord signed last October, Israel should
withdraw troops from another 13 percent of the West Bank, release
750 Palestinian political prisoners and open safe passage between
Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Congress delegation spoke highly of Arafat and the
Palestinians in their adherence to the accords signed with Israel,
Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
They also showed concern over the issues raised by Arafat,
particularly those relating to the troops withdrawal, the release
of Palestinian prisoners and the economic difficulties, Shaath
added.

ANKARA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is ready
to provide Turkey with more support to help it recover swiftly
from last week's devastating earthquake, high-ranking EU officials
said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hans van den Broek, the vice-president of the outgoing EU
Commssion, said "there is an absolute consensus between the
member states that a special effort has to be made to help Turkey
in these very difficult circumstances."
</P>
<P>
Broek and Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen of Finland, the EU
term president, visited the quake-stricken districts of Istanbul,
the largest city of Turkey, on Thursday morning and arrived in
Ankara later for talks with Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
and Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.
</P>
<P>
The EU has already released EURO 2 million for Turkey, while
the 15 member countries have provided a total assistance of more

Speaking at a press conference before leaving Ankara, Broek
and Halonen said that the issue of more substantial assistance
for Turkey will be on the agenda of the EU foreign ministerial
meeting in Finland on September 4 and 5.
</P>
<P>
They declined to give an exact number of the assistance,
but Broek said that the EU Commission is pondering over the
release of an initial sum of some EURO 25-30 million.

CAIRO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian security forces on
Thursday arrested 13 members of the country's largest Islamic
fundamentalist group, the Muslim Brotherhood, police officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were detained in their homes in Giza, the suburb
of Cairo, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
They were arrested on charges of trying to recruit new members
to the banned group, setting up camps for new members and training
them in martial arts, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
In the suspects' homes, the security forces found numerous
books and pamphlets, they said.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the suspects were ordered to be detained for 15 days
for questioning, and five others were released, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1928, the Muslim Brotherhood was banned in 1954, but
the government of President Hosni Mubarak had tolerated it until
1995. Since then, the government has cracked down on the
Brotherhood, accusing its members of supporting the Islamic
insurgency that broke out in 1992. Hundreds of Brotherhood members
have been tried and scores imprisoned.

<HEADLINE> 300 Angolans Flee From Captivity of UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 300 fatigued rural
residents successfully fled from a forest area where they had been
living under captivity of the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), local press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Among the 300 persons who arrived Wednesday in Caalaa, a
fortress controlled by the government troops in the war-torn
Huambo Province, are children, women, and old people.
</P>
<P>
Determined to move out of the Epuacha Village, which is
controlled by UNITA militants, they had walked on foot about 21
kilometers for their destination.
</P>
<P>
"We had a savage life for more than nine months," the fugitives
said, adding that they had to tolerate bad treatments of the UNITA
rebels and face the grave situation of food supply.
</P>
<P>
Under the "captivity" of the rebels, a fugitive said,
"agricultural development was not permitted and other means of
subsistence could not be realized."
</P>
<P>
Massive runaways took place a lot of times since August 13, as
the social-economic situation deteriorated in the areas controlled
by UNITA, said Antonio Patricio, an official of the Ministry of
the Assistance and Social Reintegration.
</P>
<P>
During the past two weeks, the number of the fugitives from
those villages reached 2,410, Patricio said.
</P>
<P>
Since the turn of the year, when the Angolan civil war broke
out again, the government troops and the UNITA rebels have been
fighting fiercely in the central part of the country which has
suffered more than 20 years of war.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) have controlled main
cities and fortresses, driving the UNITA militants back to the
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
But the rebel scattered into small groups, trying to flee from
heavy strikes by the government troops, and moved into the
country's central rural area where they had their headquarters and
logistic bases.
</P>
<P>
Due to the international sanctions imposed by the Security
Council of the United Nations in 1993 against the diamond trade
with UNITA, the rebels were hindered from developing, and
meanwhile, the social-economic situation deteriorated in the rural
area.
</P>
<P>
One-third of Angola's total population, or three million, live
in Luanda, capital of the southern African country, while the
population density in rural areas is quite small.

NAIROBI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda has been angered by false
reports alleging that Ugandans living in the capital Kigali are
being harassed after the battle between Rwandan and Ugandan troops
in the Congolese city of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, Seth Kamanzi, Secretary
General of the Internal Ministry, refuted the allegations
published by the Ugandan independent daily, The Monitor, on August

</P>
<P>
The Ugandan Embassy in Kigali also rejected the allegations and
affirmed that no single Ugandan has appeared at the Embassy
complaining of harassment.
</P>
<P>
"Ugandans in all sectors of Kigali are happily going on with
their day to day work in harmony with their Rwandan neighbors," an
official from the Ugandan Embassy in Kigali underlined.
</P>
<P>
The Monitor paper had reported that Ugandans in Rwanda are
living in fear following clashes between the two troops in the

</P>
<P>
Commission spokesman Thierry Daman said Thursday that Belgium
was bound to inform the European Union and relevant EU member
states of any food safety problems.
</P>
<P>
"If there are results of tests concerning non-Belgian products,
then we want to know about them," said the spokesman at the daily
EU briefing.
</P>
<P>
Belgium is now required by EU law to test its own meat products
for high levels of PCB, the chemicals which indicate the presence
of cancer-causing dioxins in the wake of the dioxin-in-food crisis
that rocked the country.
</P>
<P>
The EU has started legal action against Belgium for failing to
notify the commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union, and EU member states soon enough of the initial
dioxin contamination earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The EU standing veterinary committee decided Wednesday to
maintain the requirement for Belgium to test its meat of poultry,
pork and beef for PCB levels.
</P>
<P>
The committee agreed to review the controls in end-September.
</P>
<P>
A PCB ceiling of 200 nanograms per gram of animal fat has been
set for Belgium and has yet to be adopted as an EU-wide threshold
for announcing dioxin contamination.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Urges Non-Violence in East Timor Ballot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Thursday urged all parties in East Timor to stop
the violence for the peaceful and secure ballot next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Strongly condemning the acts of violence in Dili, the capital,
Wednesday, the council called on the Indonesian government to
cooperate with the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET)
to ensure the secure and free movement of its staff.
</P>
<P>
The council made the statement to the press by its president,
Namibia's Martin Andjaba, after hearing a briefing on the matter
from U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Kieran
Prendergast.
</P>
<P>
East Timor's 450,000 registered voters will cast their ballot
to determine whether they want a wide-range autonomy within
Indonesia or independence.
</P>
<P>
Pro-integration and pro-independence clashes Thursday, the
second last day of campaigning for the ballot, reportedly left at
least three dead.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council called on the local authorities for
concrete steps to prevent further violence, to investigate the
events of violence and to bring those responsible to justice.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan made a similar
statement through his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general is appalled by the widespread violence in
Dili today, including the loss of lives," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"He demands that the Indonesian authorities take immediate
steps to restore and maintain law and order," it added.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials said that despite violence, the poll will go
ahead as scheduled.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Sentences 8 Genocide Suspects to Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 26 (Xinhua) - Rwandan regional court on
Wednesday sentenced eight persons to life imprisonment for
involvement in the 1994 genocide, state-run radio Rwanda reported
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The eight suspects were part of 22 alleged criminals who had
been tried by the Gikongoro court, 100 km southwest of the
capital, for about two months.
</P>
<P>
Twelve others were condemned to a 10-year jail sentence for
they pleaded guilty to charges of genocide they were accused of.
These include a 15- year old suspect. Two others were acquitted
and immediately released.
</P>
<P>
The group of 22 were involved in hunting down and massacring
Tutsis in Kibaga sector, in Musange commune.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the prosecution had requested death
penalty for the two suspects who were acquitted by the court.
</P>
<P>
Two people were not prosecuted because they died in detention,
the radio said. The culprits have been requested to pay
compensation to the victims amounting to about 475,000 U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The April - July 1994 genocide claimed the lives of about half
million people, mostly ethnic Tutsis and opposition Hutus.
</P>
<P>
Up to 124,000 genocide suspects are detained in Rwandan
prisons, and most them are awaiting trial.

<HEADLINE> World Community Urged to Help Release Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The African-Asian People's
Solidarity Organization (AAPSO) on Thursday called on the world
community to help have the Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails
released.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in the day, the Cairo-based organization
urged world countries and concerned parties including world human
rights organizations "to stand firmly in favor of the release of
the Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails."
</P>
<P>
AAPSO accused Israel of attempting to influence the Palestinian
decision in the ongoing peace talks between the two sides by
delaying the release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Israel is detaining thousands of Palestinians for their
struggle against the Israeli occupation. The Palestinians and
Israel are negotiating the release of 650 Palestinian prisoners
under the Wye peace accord signed last October. The two sides are
disputing about the criteria for the release of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian prisoners are subject to psychological and
physical tortures, AAPSO said, adding that they are deprived of
the simplest human rights.
</P>
<P>
The organization accused the Jewish state of flagrantly
violating the human rights and poisoning, on purpose, the climate
of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
It will hold a meeting on August 29-30 to discuss the issue of
Palestinian prisoners and pay tribute to the heroes who are giving
the best examples of steadfastness, according to the statement.

<HEADLINE> British Scientists to Test GM Vaccine on Humans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- British scientists at a germ
warfare research center are about to begin testing a
genetically-modified vaccine for bubonic plague on humans,
according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine has been developed in response to fears that
British forces could be attacked by foreign countries, which are
thought to have built up stockpiles of biological weapons, a BBC
report said.
</P>
<P>
The research program is being carried out on behalf of the
Defense Evaluation and Research Agency, the body which runs the
government's top-secret Porton Down chemical and biological
warfare center in Wiltshire.
</P>
<P>
Porton Down's technical director, Dr Rick Hall, told BBC
Thursday, "We have a new vaccine against plague that is at a
particularly advanced stage of development, that is produced by
genetic engineering."
</P>
<P>
"And of course once it is licensed, through exactly the same
process as any other medicine, it will not only provide increased
protection for the UK and its armed forces, but it will also be
available to help protect civilians in parts of the world where
plague occurs naturally," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tests of the GM vaccine for the plague involving human
volunteers are to start imminently and the vaccine could have
civilian as well as military benefits, BBC said, noting that
research into genetically-modified bacteria, including the bubonic
plague, is one of Britain's closest-guarded military secrets.
</P>
<P>
The organisms are modified to make them less dangerous and
provide protection to those involved in the experiments, according
to BBC.
</P>
<P>
Bubonic plague is as an acute infectious fever characterized by
chills, prostration, delirium and swollen glands in the armpit or
groin. Since the end of World War I, 20,000 people have taken part
in experiments at Porton Down, BBC said.

hke -- Marion Jones' Quits Athletics Worlds
</P>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- American star runner Marion Jones has
decided to pull out of the World Athletics Championships after she
sustained back injury on Wednesday, her manager Charlie Wells said
today.
</P>
<P>
"She's out of the championships," said Wells.
</P>
<P>
Jones, who won the women's 100m on Sunday, pulled up in agony in the
middle of the 200m semi-final Wednesday night and collapsed on the
track before being rushed off to the medical centre for treatment on a
tretcher.
</P>
<P>
Doctors worked over Jones at the stadium for about 2 and a half
hours, before she walked out slowly under own power without speaking to
the media. Plans to take her to a hospital were scrapped and she
returned to her hotel room, asking not to be disturbed.
</P>
<P>
The USA Track and Field issued an official statement Wednesday
night, saying that she had spasms and cramping in her lower back.
</P>
<P>
But there is no offcial word today on her injury. However, her coach
Trever Graham hinted that there might be no serious problem.
</P>
<P>
"She looks good walking," Graham said. "There's little pain and
soreness."
</P>
<P>
Jones had come to Seville with a target of a record breaking four
gold medals, but it was shattered when she could only manage a bronze
in the long jump on Monday.

<HEADLINE> France Never Weary of Being Advocate of Africa: Chirac </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- France is never weary of being the
advocate of Africa and is optimistic about the future of the
continent, said French President Jacques Chirac Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an annual speech made at the Elysee presidential palace to
the French diplomatic envoys posted around the world, Chirac, who
has made several visits to Africa, criticized "the scepticism
tainted with indifference" about the declaration of African
leaders at the Algiers Summit last month.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that at the summit, African leaders decided to
accept the principle of democracy and human rights as the rule of
good government.
</P>
<P>
"I tell you this, despite the disappointing setbacks, Africa
goes forward. This is not the time to discourage her," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also called on the United Nations to send a peacekeeping
force to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where a truce has been
signed lately after a one-year war which brought in several
African states.
</P>
<P>
"It would be shocking that the United Nations hesitates to send
an international force to the Democratic Republic of Congo to
accompany there a solution of peace, while the Security Council
did not hesitate to engage massively in Kosovo," he said.

<HEADLINE> UK Workers Most Overworked in Europe: Union Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Union leaders in Britain are
urging the government to rethink planned changes to working hours
regulations, as a recent report showed UK employees are the most
overworked in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Trades Union Congress (TUC) is asking the government to
call talks between employers and unions to reach agreement on
difficulties which have emerged in the Working Time Directive
which came into force last year.
</P>
<P>
The government has announced that it intends to change the
directive to cut red-tape, allowing more opt-outs for workers and
employers. It said the changes will make the directive more
workable, without watering down protection.
</P>
<P>
But the TUC is warning that many white-collar workers will be
left without protection, even though they work some of the longest
hours, according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
"Too many workplaces are gripped by a long-hours culture," TUC
General Secretary John Monks said. "Nothing is ever said, but the
pressure of work, office culture and job insecurity makes clear
that employees have little choice but to put in extra work."
</P>
<P>
A report published by the TUC Thursday showed Britons worked
the longest hours in Europe. UK workers average 44 hours a week,
the report said, compared to 39 in Holland, Belgium and Denmark,
and 40 in France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The TUC said Citizens Advice Bureaux across the UK has been
inundated with inquiries from workers pressured into working
longer hours.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Confederation of British Industry said the
changes to the directive were necessary and "the directive is a
real headache for firms, costing time and money."

<HEADLINE> UK Nuclear Watchdog Attacks Government's Waste Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The UK government's nuclear waste
advisers said it has done nothing to develop policy on disposing
of the wastes for over two years.
</P>
<P>
The scathing accusation came in the annual report of the
Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee (RWMAC), composed
of independent experts, according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
"RWMAC believes that government policy on the long-term
management of radioactive waste has effectively been in limbo
since 17 March 1997," the report said.
</P>
<P>
That was the date when the British government told Nirex, the
company charged with finding a suitable waste disposal site, to
stop work at Sellafield, in northwest England. The abandonment of
work at Sellafield, beneath British Nuclear Fuels' plant,
effectively stopped Nirex's search for a site.
</P>
<P>
The report not only indicts government, but is a catalogue of
criticisms of other parts of the nuclear industry, according to a
BBC analysis.
</P>
<P>
"It speaks of the committee's belief that, `all too often, the
basis for current policies is insufficiently clear, and there is a
lack of explanatory material available' to ordinary people," BBC
said.
</P>
<P>
The report acknowledged that the RWMAC is waging what it calls
an "ongoing campaign" for better and clearer explanation of how
nuclear waste management is regulated. It said it is important,
both for open government and to win public acceptance of policies,
to have a document which would explain the principles underlying
waste regulation.
</P>
<P>
The RWMAC also wants "openness, transparency and a clearer
statement of practice" on how radiation doses are assessed,
according to BBC.
</P>
<P>
The report expressed concern that "little progress has been
made in developing sufficient low-level waste disposal capacity,"
and urged faster progress on other clean-up facilities.
</P>
<P>
The committee believes there is probably more than one source
of the radioactive metallic particles which have been found on and
around the Dounreay site over the last 20 years, the report said.

PARIS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
proposed Thursday that the European Union (EU) create a political
committee of security to increase the autonomy of European defense
within NATO.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that the war in Kosovo proves that Europe must have
its own defense to cope with future crises.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the priorities of France when it takes over the
EU presidency in 2000," he said at a conference of ambassadors
held at the Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
He said that the relationship between such a committee and the
EU is like that between the Atlantic Council and NATO.
</P>
<P>
Such a security committee should be accompanied by a military
committee and a chief of staff of European troops to assume the
functions of supervision, analysis and planning, he added.
</P>
<P>
France has been campaigning for years with its EU partners for
an autonomous defense force in Europe which can operate outside
NATO.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Wins Support for World Gold Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has won
support for its proposal to establish a coordinated mechanism to
regulate large-scale gold sales, a top official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
All European central banks and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) have been successfully persuaded that such a mechanism
should be established for minimizing the negative effects of gold
sales, Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka
told reporters in Cape town.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister was quoted by South African Press
Association as saying that Britain is not open to changing its
plans to sell half of its gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
"I can't say we have won our argument with the British," she
said, despite that the British had said if a coordinated approach
to selling off gold was agreed to, they would abide by it.
</P>
<P>
Since Britain announced plans to auction off half its gold
reserves, six South African mines have made plans to retrench over
11,000 mine workers.
</P>
<P>
Mlambo-Ngcuka said she did not believe the current slump in the
gold price justified the large-scale retrenchment of miners, as
many mines still had scope to become more efficient.
</P>
<P>
The recent collapse of East Rand Proprietary Mines was the
result of long-standing internal problems and not solely
attributable to the poor gold price, she said.

JOHANNESBURG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) Thursday denied media reports that
there was dissent within its ranks over a 29-billion-rand
(five-billion-dollar) arms purchase plan.
</P>
<P>
The purchase was still set to go ahead, South African Press
Association quoted ANC Caucus Chairman Thabang Makwetla as saying.
</P>
<P>
The media reports -- quoting a document claimed to be a
research paper from the parliament's portfolio and joint standing
committees on defense -- claimed ANC parliament members were
divided over the massive expenditure on arms, with some believing
it would be possible to change the procurement plan and save the
country in excess of 6 billion rands (one billion dollars) .
</P>
<P>
Makwetla Thursday dismissed the reports as "misleading", saying
that "It is in fact an insult to the work of all people involved
in debates on the procurement package for the defense equipment."
</P>
<P>
The caucus had called for an investigation by the ANC
secretary-general' s office to check members' possible involvement
in the distribution of the document.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Accused for Violating Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Allied Forces in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) said on Thursday rebels
continue to violate the Lusaka Cease-fire Accord despite accepting
to sign the agreement, according to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the allied forces, supporting Congolese
President Laurent Kabila and headquartered in Kinshasa, said the
rebels had not stopped training and recruiting more fighters.
</P>
<P>
"The public pronouncement and pledges to abide by the accord
are not corroborated by a troops stand-still. The Allied Forces
from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) reserve the
right to clear and protect the main supply route," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The two rebel factions of the Congolese Rally for Democracy
agreed to sign the cease-fire accord this week to end the one
year-old war in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The government of DRC President Laurent Kabila came under siege
from rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda last year and had to be
propped up by armies from Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola.
</P>
<P>
The three countries together with Rwanda and Uganda signed the
peace accord last month in Lusaka to end the hostilities in the
Central African country.
</P>
<P>
The rebels did not sign the accord because of personality
clashes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Allied Forces said cases of abduction and
torture of civilians by the rebels had been reported in several
places.
</P>
<P>
"At Munenge, Rwandese soldiers forced civilians to crack open
an unexploded bomb causing it to explode killing six civilians,"
the statement said.

<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Despite a recent murder and
charges of weapons smuggling against the Irish Republican Army
(IRA), Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam Thursday
ruled the IRA's ceasefire had not been violated, thus keeping
alive hopes of reviving the stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam announced in the Northern Ireland capital of Belfast
that although there was evidence that the IRA guerrillas were
involved in the murder of a taxi driver last month, there was not
sufficient basis to say overall that the two-year-old ceasefire
had broken down.
</P>
<P>
After talks with senior security advisers in Belfast and
members of the Irish government, Mowlam also stressed that the
early release of republican prisoners would continue.
</P>
<P>
Under the historical Good Friday accord signed last April, some
270 IRA prisoners have been released and the remaining 200 are to
be set free by next May if the ceasefire holds.
</P>
<P>
However, Mowlam's decision, which would provide chances for the
IRA's political wing Sinn Fein to participate in a review of the
peace process next month, drew mixed reactions from the political
parties and the Irish government.
</P>
<P>
Pro-British unionists poured scorn on Mowlam's statement,
saying it was deeply flawed, and some even called for her
resignation.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble, who is also
Northern Ireland's first minister, described her statement as
"deeply disappointing, deeply flawed," and thought she was
accepting the IRA's ceasefire definition.
</P>
<P>
Michael Ancram, chairman of Britain's opposition Conservatives,
called Mowlam's statement "incredible" and said it undermined
confidence in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein Chairman Mitchel McLaughlin welcomed Mowlam's
statement, saying it was the only decision available and would
protect the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government said it fully shared Mowlam's assessment
that "in terms of an overall judgement, the IRA ceasefire has not
broken down."
</P>
<P>
The pro-British unionists had wanted Mowlam to say the IRA had
breached its truce and that the early release of IRA prisoners
should be halted.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein, defending the IRA ceasefire was intact, warned
before Mowlam's statement that it would not take part in next
month's review of the peace process if she stopped prisoner
releases.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam later said she came "very close to judging that the IRA
ceasefire is no longer for real." It had been a difficult decision
for her to make, she added.
</P>
<P>
"The peace we now have is imperfect but better than none," she
said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Northern Ireland's police chief, Ronnie Flanagan,
blamed the IRA for the murder of the Belfast taxi driver Charles
Bennett, an alleged police informer.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said she accepted Flanagan's assessment but added she
was called on to make an overall decision about the IRA ceasefire
and whether there had been a decision by the organization to break
it.
</P>
<P>
"There is no example of organized violence," she said.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam stressed that her decision was based on security advice
and not politics.
</P>
<P>
Talks on implementing a Northern Irish peace deal signed in
April last year will be frozen until September as Protestant
politicians refuse to share power with Catholic republicans in the
Sinn Fein party until its guerrilla ally, the IRA, disarms.

<HEADLINE> Greece Reaffirms Position on EU Aid to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Greece stressed Thursday that its
stance towards the veto of European Union (EU) aid to Turkey under
a financial protocol had not changed despite a catastrophic
earthquake which has claimed thousands of lives in the neighboring
country.
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming Greece's such position, government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that Greece would help to ensure that the EU
supports Turkey economically after last week's devastating
earthquake in northwestern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Greece would contribute in this way in the same spirit that it
immediately sent tons of humanitarian aid as well as medical and
rescue teams to the earthquake-ravaged areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
For years, Greece and Turkey have been at odds over their
disputes in the territorial waters, air space limits and the
delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greece has insisted that it will not lift its veto on the EU's
1-billion U.S. dollar financial aid to Turkey unless the latter
improves its human rights record and relations with Greece.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, speculation in the local press that Greece
might lift its standing veto over an EU financial protocol for
Turkey has been fueled, partly by the speed and extent of Greek
humanitarian aid to Turkey.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for Better Urban Governance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Klaus Toepfer, acting Executive
Director of United Nations Center for Human Settlements (Habitat),
has called for better urban governance to minimize the
devastation caused by natural disasters like the recent
earthquake in Turkey, according to a news release issued
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Admitting immediate humanitarian needs as the most important
for Turkey, Toepfer also noted that what has happened in the
urban areas of the country is an epitome of how damage caused by
natural disasters is compounded by the unchecked process of
urbanization.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to minimize the destruction caused by natural
disasters is to ensure that local authorities are trained and
equipped to enforce appropriate construction laws," he said in
the news release.
</P>
<P>
The Habitat holds that the population explosion in cities of
many countries has led to low-quality housing and infrastructure,
which is vulnerable to natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
"In a rapidly urbanizing world, the international community has
to make a global effort to ensure that our cities are better
governed," Toepfer urged.
</P>
<P>
The average population of the world's 100 largest cities is
currently over 5 million inhabitants as compared to 2.1 million
in 1950 and less than 200,000 in 1800, according to U.N.
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The Habitat, sometimes known as a U.N. city agency, is
headquartered in Kenya's capital Nairobi.

<HEADLINE> French President Proposes Summit of Mediterranean Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
proposed Thursday that all countries bordering the Mediterranean
hold a summit meeting next year to seek peace and development in
the often tumultuous region.
</P>
<P>
"I attach a great importance to this project which will give a
push to the building, on both sides of the common sea, and for the
first time since the Roman Empire, a single space of peace,
cooperation and development," Chirac told a meeting of French
ambassadors posted around the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that France would like to propose such a summit within
one year and during its rotating EU presidency in the second half
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chirac expressed his satisfaction over relations with the
northern African states of Tunisia and Morocco, and expressed
optimism about an improvement of relations with Algeria after
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika came to power in April.
</P>
<P>
"The moment has come to change the course of things between
Algeria and France," he said.
</P>
<P>
The French president also said that France is ready to turn "a
dark page" in its relations with Libya.
</P>
<P>
Relations between France and Libya were cut after the 1988
bombing attack upon a French passenger plane in Africa, in which
Libya was suspected of involvement.
</P>
<P>
Libya has recently paid compensations to the families of the
victims of the attack.

<HEADLINE> 12 Units of Daewoo Group Put Under Workout Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Financial
Supervisory Commission (FSC) decided Thursday to put 12 units of
the ailing Daewoo Group under a debt workout program in an attempt
to help resume their normal operations.
</P>
<P>
Pledging not to produce impact on the market, the creditor
financial group would freeze the debts and debentures of the 12
reconstructed enterprises, and take over managerial control of the
companies for new capital inflow and relevant revival policy. If
necessary, the creditors have the right to conduct debt-equity
swaps.
</P>
<P>
Under the accomplished "bank management," Daewoo Group, the
country's second largest conglomerate with a total of 25
subsidiaries, is now "not able to steer its own fate," press
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Among the 12 subsidiaries to undergo financial rehabilitation
are Daewoo Corp., Daewoo Motor Co., Daewoo Telecom Co., Daewoo
Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. and Daewoo Electronics Co., while the
other 13 units were urged by the government to carry out self-
rescue.
</P>
<P>
The creditor financial group, made up of 13 creditor banks of
Daewoo, declared on August 16 restructuring plans to reduce the 25
subsidiaries of the conglomerate to only six by mid-January next
year.

<HEADLINE> Sun Hung Kai &AMP; Co. Limited to Launch Online Broking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Sun Hung Kai &AMP; Co. Limited ("
Sun Hung Kai" or "the Group") has a clear policy to develop the "
online" or electronic broking capacity to complement the current
electronic delivery of its research and financial information
services.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the Group's online broking, to be operated on the
Stock Exchange's future AMS/3 which allows Straight Through
Processing (STP) providing Terminal and Open Gateway approaches,
will be announced later this year.
</P>
<P>
With the Gateway approach, Sun Hung Kai will be able to
directly connect with the Stock Exchange using an Open Gateway
device and the Group is expecting benefits from this initiative.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from our enhancement of broking services for clients,
Sun Hung Kai is proceeding with the marketing and business
development activities announced at our annual general meeting in
June," said Sun Hung Kai's executive chairman, Arthur George Dew.
</P>
<P>
Sun Hung Kai Thursday announced its interim results for the six
months period ending June 30, 1999. The Group recorded an
operating profit of 28.8 million HK dollars (3.68 million U.S.
dollars) and a profit from ordinary activities of 57.2 million HK
dollars (7.33 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Steel Imports Increase in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign steel shipments into
the United States increased in July for the third time in five
months, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In preliminary figures, the department said imports totaled 2.9
million metric tons in July. That compares to final figures of 2.8
million tons in June. The 6 percent one-month increase follows a 9
percent decrease in June.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration and the U.S. steel industry have
been closely monitoring the monthly figures for signs of an end to
a crisis from low-priced imports, which the industry blames for
thousands of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Since November, when the Commerce Department first threatened
punitive tariffs on shipments of the industry's core product,
foreign shipments had decreased by one-fifth.
</P>
<P>
For the first seven months of 1999, imports totaled 18.2
million metric tons. That is a 5 percent increase from the 17.2
million metric tons in the same period of 1997, before the Asian
economic crisis reduced demand for steel abroad and forced foreign
companies to sell their surplus in the healthy U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 level was 10 percent below the 20.2 million metric
tons during the first seven months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Despite periodic monthly spikes, the Clinton administration has
continued to stick by its policy of relying primarily on imposing
tariffs at the industry's request and resisting stronger sanctions
that administration officials fear could prompt a trade war.
</P>
<P>
The steel industry already won tariffs on hot-rolled sheets
from Japan, a primary foreign source for that product before the
trade complaint was filed.

NEW DELHI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The total installed capacity

the year 2020, Indian scientists said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In his lecture on "Nuclear Science and Technology -- Vision
2020" at the Bangalore University, Atomic Energy Commission
Chairman Dr. R. Chidambaram said that the present nuclear energy
production is 1,840 mw in the country's 10 nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
He said nuclear energy is an "inevitable option" to meet the
future energy needs and the country is supposed to reduce the
capital cost and ensure shortest construction period of seven to
five and half years for nuclear power plants.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Estrada Seeks to Push Ahead Charter Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has made his three-day trip to the southern Philippine
island of Mindanao, which ended Wednesday, a fresh move to defend
his controversial plan to amend the nation's constitution.
</P>
<P>
In his speech delivered in Mindanao, Estrada spared no effort
to call for support to the planed charter change which, he said,
is dominated by economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"To speed up Mindanao's development, we need economic reforms,"
Estrada said at the inauguration of a fishery project.
</P>
<P>
"We need enough funds to bankroll our spending for our economic
needs. But we don't have adequate capital and funds to respond to
these requirements," he further noted.
</P>
<P>
Estrada held that the charter change is the right way out,
saying the desired amendment will open the nation to foreign
capital, which he said is in urgent need to eradicate poverty in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
However, his initiative has met strong domestic opposition,
which was highlighted by last Friday's mass protest rally in
Manila led by former president Corazon Aquino and Manila
Archbishop Jaime Sin.
</P>
<P>
Under the present Philippine constitution, foreign investors
can not own land in the Philippines and their ownership share in
Philippine industry can not exceed 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Estrada believes that the "out-of-date" provisions are a
barrier to his administration's anti-poverty drive and vowed to
lift the provisions through charter amendment.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said here that it is significant for the
president to make a trip to Mindanao just on the first working day
after the August 20 protest rally.
</P>
<P>
During his trip in Mindanao, Estrada reportedly inaugurated
several billion pesos worth of projects for agricultural
infrastructure. But what the president can hand over is no more
than 329 million pesos (8.2 million U.S. dollars) at the spot.
</P>
<P>
Citing the Davao Integrated Development Project as an example,
analysts said it needs 4.6 billion pesos (1.15 billion dollars) a
year for five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's concern over the economic reforms weighs even more
heavily as he believes that the prevailing poverty in Mindanao
itself can deal a counter blow to the critics of his charter
amendment plan.
</P>
<P>
While Mindanao accounts for 40 percent of the country's food
requirements, the region has 50 percent of the nation's poor,
Agriculture Secretary Edgardo Angara said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada told residents in Mindanao that he hoped the
inauguration of major agriculture projects "will be the beginning
of your rise from poverty."
</P>
<P>
However, an estimated 24 million Filipinos are living in
poverty nationwide, accounting for 32 percent of the total
population of 74 million.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the trip, Estrada expressed his satisfaction with
the support from the residents in Mindanao. But, in the wake of
more protests that are said to follow in September, only time can
tell whether the charter change plan can live up to the ongoing
challenges.

<HEADLINE> Government, Church Relations "Excellent": Angolan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luanda, August 26 (xinhua) -- Angolan Foreign Minister said the
 relations between the Angolan government and the country's
Catholic Church are "excellent", local news agency Angop reported
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Joao Bernardo de Miranda made the statement in a bid to
dissipate the speculation of "the deterioration of relations"
between the government and the Catholic Church, in consequence of
the notifications of three journalists of the ecclesiastical radio
issued by the National Direction of Criminal Investigation (DNIC).
</P>
<P>
"The occurrence with the journalists of the Catholic radio was
an ordinary incident," said the minister, adding that "this
situation should not frighten anybody."
</P>
<P>
Radio Catolico, run by the Catholic Church, transmitted in
middle August a program of the British Broadcast Company (BBC)
about an interview with Jonas Savimbi, head of the rebellious
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Three journalists of the Catholic radio were then summoned by
DNIC and warned not to transmit words of a war criminal. But the
U.S. ambassador in Angola Joseph Sullivan issued a statement
supporting the Catholic radio and accusing the government of
hindering the freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
"The authorities have the competence to correct what is bad,"
defended Miranda.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also ensured that the government has never
 considered the incident as "an attitude of the Catholic Church."
He exhorted Angolan and foreign journalists to report the facts in
Angola with ponderation and transmit the reality of the
occurrences.

tribute to the prisoners who fought for "liberty, unity and
justice".
</P>
<P>
Symbolically, August 26 is Namibia's National Heroes Day.
</P>
<P>
Zuma, who spent 10 years on Robben Island as a political
prisoner, said he could think of no better place to remember the
joint struggle for freedom waged in South Africa and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
"Robben Island is also no better place to begin a new fight
against poverty and to unite people in the struggle for a better
life," he said.
</P>
<P>
Witbooi said he came "within an inch" of being sent to Robben
Island himself.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian deputy prime minister said he and three other
former Swapo members were sentenced to imprisonment on the island
but he managed to "talk himself out of it" during the trial.
</P>
<P>
His three co-accused were also present at the unveiling.
</P>
<P>
Witbooi said the commemoration of those who had been kept in
prison on Robben Island was a triumph of the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
The plaque is to be mounted in the D-block of the prison where
Swapo (now Namibian ruling party) prisoners were kept in isolation
from African National Congress (now South African ruling party)
supporters.

</P>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Cathy Freeman of Australia retained
the women's 400m gold medal at the World Athletics Championships here
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The pre-race favourite, runnning in lane five, set the fastest pace
in the race, surging ahead after the final bend and establishing her
winning status at the home straight.
</P>
<P>
Freeman, 26, was clocked 49.67 seconds for the title. Anja Rucker
of Germany was second at 49.74 and Lorraine Graham of Jamaica
overpassed the 99 world leader Falilat Ogunkoya of Nigeria in the last
metres to take the bronze at 49.92.
</P>
<P>
History repeated itself again in the race. The three medalists are
the only athletes to mark below 50 seconds as what happened in Athens
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I was just so pleased and relieved to cross that finishing line,"
said Freeman. "I was aware that someone was coming close to me on my
right but I didn't know who."
</P>
<P>
"I was really focussed out there tonight, but basically I was just
very tired from the semifinal," added the Australian.
</P>
<P>
Current world indoor champion and twice European champion Grit
Breuer of Germany made a disappointing race and finished seventh with
50.67.

</P>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Olympic and world champion Michael Johnson br
oke
the men's 400 meters world record with 43.18 seconds and won the gold medal at t
he 7th
World Athletics Championships here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The previous record was set by his fellow American Butch Reynoldson in Zuric
h on
August 17, 1988.
</P>
<P>
Sanderlei Claro of Brazil finished second in 44.29 and Aleiandro Cardenas of
 Mexico
third in 44.31.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who also holds the 200m world record, is now tied with Carl Lewis
for the
most career gold medals at the World Championships with eight apiece.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long time in coming," Johnson said. " This was the perfect sett
ing. I wanted
the medal but I also wondered how many more times I would have to lower the worl
d
record."
</P>
<P>
"I want to take advantage of this opportunity," the jubilant Johnson said.
 "I knew I'm in
great shape. I now can go to the Sydney Olympic Games as a world record holder i
n both
events. "
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who was the first man in history to win a gold 200- and 400 meters
double at
both the 1995 World Championships and 1996 Olympic Games, said he's confident of

breaking the world record again.
</P>
<P>
"I know I can run faster, " he said. "I know I can run 42 second flat. "
</P>
<P>
The American, who dominated the two events for about one decade, has been pl
agued
with injuries since last year.
</P>
<P>
He had to pull out of the 200 meters in the U.S. championships, which double
d as
qualifier for the championships, and entered the 400 meters with a wild card a
the
defending champion.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pround of myself to be able to come back from injuries," he said.
 "My coach
and I said early this year on what to do this season. I said I want to break the
 world
record."
</P>
<P>
Parrela and Cardenas were both satisfied with their second and third finishi
ng
performance.
</P>
<P>
"It was a fast race," Parrela said. "I couldn't help looking at Johnson as w
e run because
we knew what he was going to do tonight. I thought that if I just can keep close
 to him. I
would do well."
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas said that the bronze medal was the compensation for so many times
that his
friends and family wanted him to be with them but he himself kept telling them
he had to
train.
</P>
<P>
"It's a great success for Mexico and all America to take this medal in the f
astest 400
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who set the world record in the 200m of 19.32 seconds at the 1996
Olympics,served notice of this evening's landmark event with an astonishing perf
ormance in
the semifinal on Tuesday night. Coming off the turn with a huge lead, he jogged
</P>
<P>
He arrived here with bests this season of 20.07 in the 200m and 43.92 in the
 400m.
</P>
<P>
Along with his four world titles in the 400 meters, Johnson has also won wor
ld crowns in
the 200m in 1991 and 1995. His other world 400m titles were in 1993, 1995 and 19
97.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Pull Permanent Troops Out Of Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration said
on Thursday that it will withdraw its permanent troops from Haiti
and replace them with rotating units made up largely of
reservists.
</P>
<P>
"We will in the future move from a permanent force that's there
under this configuration and replace it with rotational assistance
teams," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing in Edgartown, Mass., where
President Bill Clinton is vacationing, Lockhart said details and
matters of timing remained to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
The 450 full-time U.S. force is all that remains of the U.S.
contingent of 20,000 sent to Haiti in 1994 to help restore the
elected government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
Reports say that the force would stay until fall when the
elections were held and would likely be withdrawn early next year.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart made it clear that the U.S. will continue to deploy
troops in Haiti. "The U.S. military is not withdrawing from
Haiti," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton is committed "to reducing and eventually
withdrawing the permanent force or the force that's there under
the current configuration," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House voted earlier this summer to order U.S. troops
home from Haiti at the end of the year. The Senate has yet to vote
on the legislation.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of some members
of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) met in
Togo's capital Lome Thursday to discuss the insurgent fighting
between Liberian government and its rebels.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministers from Nigeria, Ghana, Liberia, Guinea, Sierra
Leone, and Togo, as well as the representatives from Cote d'Ivoire
and Burkina Faso attended the meeting, which was aimed to prevent
the conflict from destabilizing the sub-region, according to
information reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The insurgency, started early this month in Liberia's
northwestern Lofa County bordering Guinea, has displaced tens of
thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
The fighting also strained relations between Liberia and its
neighbor Guinea, as Liberia repeatedly accused Guinea of
supporting the rebels, whose base is believed to be in the Guinean
side of the two countries' border. Guinea had vehemently denied
the charges.
</P>
<P>
Liberian troops are reportedly making significant gains in
recent days in combating the rebels, believed to be loyalists of
Liberian President Charles Taylor's rival warlords during the
country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
But fierce fighting is still going on, according to latest
reports from the ECOWAS.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Speedy Approval of "Oil For Food" Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- China on Thursday urged
certain members of the U.N. Security Council to speed up the
approval of contracts in Iraq's "oil for food" program to
alleviate the humanitarian situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question from Xinhua, Ambassador Shen Guofang
said council members should not politicize the program since they
have all agreed to it, despite different views on the Iraq issue.
</P>
<P>
Shen, Deputy Chinese Permanent Representative to the United
Nations, made the remarks after the council's closed-door
consultations on the implementation of the humanitarian program in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The "oil for food" program is based on the increase of Iraqi
oil exports capacity, said Shen, asking: "how can Iraq's oil
production not be affected when there are holds of contracts of
oil industry equipment?"
</P>
<P>
The latest U.N. report shows that a total of 484 Iraqi
applications remain on hold with a value of some 500 million U.S.
dollars. The situation remains serious with contracts to buy
communications, utility, water supply and disinfection items.
</P>
<P>
China fully supports U.N. Secretary-General's call for
accelerating the resolution of the issue by the U.N. sanctions
committee, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The "oil for food" program began on December 10, 1996 to ensure
substantial deliveries of food and health supplies to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Because of contracts holds, low oil prices and inadequate oil
producing capacity, the program has run into difficulties.

<P>
NAIROBI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) led by Ahmed Ouyahia, special envoy of
current OAU Chairman and Algerian President Abdulaziz Bouteflika,
arrived in Eritrea to inform the Eritrean government on the
clarifications that the OAU delivered to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean Foreign Ministry said in a news release Thursday
that the delegation met with Eritrean President Issaias Afewerki
and Ouyahia briefed him on his meeting with the Ethiopian
officials on August 23 and 24.
</P>
<P>
The delegation noted that the parties have accepted that "any
interpretation of the OAU Framework Agreement and the Modalities
is the sole responsibility of the OAU and its current chairman,"
said the release available here.
</P>
<P>
To end the bloody border war between Eritrea and Ethiopia, OAU
has forwarded three documents, namely, the Framework Agreement,
the Modalities and the Technical Arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Eritrea accepted the Technical Arrangements
worked out by experts from the OAU, the United Nations, Algeria
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Technical Arrangements provide a detailed implementation
plan of the peace package on the basis of the Framework Agreement
and the Modalities, the release added.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Ethiopian authorities have not accepted the
Technical Arrangements, the Eritrean Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The war between the two countries broke out on May 6, 1998 over
a disputed stretch of their border area.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebel Factions Committed to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Rival factions of the rebel
Congolese Rally for Democracy (CRD) have said once again they will
sign the cease- fire agreement, which have already been signed by
all the six countries and another rebel group involved in the
year-long war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Emile Ilunga, leader of one faction backed by Rwanda, told
Zambian Minister of State House Eric Silwamba that he fully
endorsed the proposal made by the Southern African Development
Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The SADC proposed that all founding members of the CRD be
allowed to sign the cease-fire agreement, which were signed in
Lusaka on July 10 by DRC and its supporters -- Zimbabwe, Namibia,
Angola as well as rebels' supporters -- Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) television
Thursday quoted Ilunga as saying that the SADC initiative has not
only broken the impasse over who will sign the agreement but also
indicated that Africa wants the two rival factions to bury their
internal differences and work for peace.
</P>
<P>
Ilunga praised Zambian President Frederick Chiluba for his
tireless efforts for the peace in vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba, leader of another CRD faction backed by
Uganda, also said Congolese people are tired of war.
</P>
<P>
Silwamba said that Chiluba will soon announce a date when all
the founding members of the CRD will append their signature to the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
On July 10, CRD and the Movement for the Liberation for Congo
(MLC) did not sign the agreement because of the disagreement
within the CRD over who would sign it on behalf the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
MLC signed the agreement on August 1.
</P>
<P>
To break the deadlock, the SADC proposed last week that all the
founding members be allowed to sign the Lusaka agreement.
</P>
<P>
In May Ilunga ousted Wamba and was named by his supporters as
new leader of the CRD.
</P>
<P>
After the wrangle broke out, Wamba moved from eastern DRC town
of Goma to northern town of Kisangani and has been insisting that
he is still the leader of the rebel movement.

military present in Haiti next year," Foley told reporters.

<P>
The United States will move the focus of assistance to outlying
regions of Haiti, where assistance is now needed most and ensure
the Military Assistance Teams are more mobile, more responsive,
Foley added.

stabilize itself politically, economically -- and that we remain
present in Haiti and committed to the policy," the spokesman said.

WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) announced Thursday that its executive board had
completed the second review under the Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility for Uganda and approved the disbursements of
22.78 million U.S. dollars in credit to the African country.
</P>
<P>
"Directors welcomed the authorities' commitment to the
continued implementation of prudent macroeconomic policies, strong
structural adjustment reforms, public service rationalization,
improvement of social services, and a robust poverty reduction
program," IMF Deputy Managing Director Shigemitsu Sugisaki said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
"These policies had sustained Uganda's track record of rapid
economic growth and moderate inflation, and had contributed to a
notable drop in the incidence of poverty in Uganda," he added.
</P>
<P>
The IMF urged the authorities to further boost revenue
performance through actions to improve tax enforcement and
compliance and steps to broaden and deepen the tax base.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also praised the government for its having given
increased priority to poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
"They (directors) supported the authorities' intention to
increase public outlays on poverty and social areas within the
context of disciplined expenditure management," Sugisaki said.

<HEADLINE> A Man Suicides in Vatican's Basilica of St. Peter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A man from the Italy's south city
of Bari committed suicide in Vatican's famous basilica of St.
Peter in Rome Thursday, shooting himself in the head while being
filmed by an Australian tourist.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, the act may have
desecrated the most important Catholic church in the world,
rendering a consecration ceremony necessary before any form of
service can be celebrated.
</P>
<P>
The man, Benedetto Minnini, aged between 60 and 65, shot
himself Thursday afternoon by putting a pistol into his mouth and
pulling the trigger.
</P>
<P>
An Australian tourist inadvertently filmed the incident as she
was intent on capturing the inside of the basilica on her video
camera. She alerted police but the man died immediately.
</P>
<P>
Minnini's body was taken to the a Catholic hospital on the
outskirts of Rome, but reason of suicide is not yet known.
</P>
<P>
Under Catholic Church legislation, a violent act committed
inside a consecrated place of worship automatically annuls the
consecration.
</P>
<P>
Because it is forbidden to celebrate mass or any of the
Church's sacraments in an unconsecrated church, the cardinal in
charge of Basilica of St. Peter, Virgilio Noe', will have to
reconsecrate the basilica. It is believed that the ceremony could
take place Thursday night.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Attorney General Vows To Probe Waco Truth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno pledged Thursday to investigate the truth of Waco incident in
which over 80 members of the Branch Davidian cult were killed as
their compound in Waco, Texas, was set on fire on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Reno's pledge came after the Federal Bureau of Investigations
(FBI) admitted that its agents may have fired potentially
flammable tear gas canisters on the final day of their standoff
with the the cult six years after the incident.
</P>
<P>
The FBI denied categorically that flammable devices were used
in their standoff with the Branch Davidian cult led by David
Koresh.
</P>
<P>
"I have no reason at this point to believe the FBI is
responsible for the deaths of those people," Reno told her weekly
news conference at the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
She said she was "very, very frustrated" that six years after
categorical denials by the FBI there were news reports about the
possible use of flammable devices.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely critical that we do everything humanly
possible to learn all the facts as accurately as possible and make
them available to the Congress and public," said Reno.
</P>
<P>
"I will continue to pursue this matter to get to the truth,"
she said. "I intend the results of the review to be made public
and I will not stop until I get to the bottom of this."
</P>
<P>
Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh have ordered a fresh
investigation of what transpired on April 19, 1993, at the Branch
Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Reno and Freeh ordered 40 FBI agents to re-interview
everyone who was at the Waco scene on that day.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Mining Company Pulls out of Zambia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian Finance Ministry said
here Thursday that a Chilean mining company has pulled out of the
privatization of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM).
</P>
<P>
Preconditions ZCCM set for the Chilean company to proceed with
the deal include the ability to secure 200 million U.S. dollars
and find an emerging partner.
</P>
<P>
After carrying out technical, financial and business analysis,
the Chilean company said that the preconditions have not met its
investment criterion.
</P>
<P>
However, the Zambian government said that it remains committed
to the privatization of the country's mining industry and will
take measures to ensure that the privatization process be
completed as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has been trying to privatize its copper mining industry
to revive the ailing industry but up to now the big mines have not
been sold partly because of disagreement over the prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) - Europe's main stock markets ended
mixed Thursday as a sluggish opening on Wall Street provided
little impetus to traders.
</P>
<P>
London's blue chip FTSE 100 closed up 0.23 percent at 6383.9,
off its session highs, as slumping oil stocks tempered the upside
from rising bank and telecom shares.
</P>
<P>
Oil price concerns weighed on BP Amoco and Shell, while Wall
Street's weakness kept UK shares flat in the session.
</P>
<P>
But the lower fuel costs proved a big bonus for British
Airways. Shares in the UK airline soared 22.25p, or 5.6 percent,
at 418p, in a move attributed to crude oil futures trading below
the key 20 US dollars per barrel mark.
</P>
<P>
Paris shares listed on the CAC 40 finished flat at 4629.37 as
the market settled into a consolidating mode after four days of
successive gains.
</P>
<P>
It was reported the market was little changed for much of the
session as investors took stock of this week's events and
consolidated gains.
</P>
<P>
The electronic Xetra Dax in Frankfurt closed down 0.2 percent,
or 10.98 points, at 5389.34, capping four straight session of
gains as the chemical sector came under selling pressure.

UNITED NATIONS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.
Secretary-General's Special Envoy for the Balkans, Carl Bildt, is
here at the U.N. headquarters Thursday to meet with U.N. Deputy
Secretary-General Louise Frechette, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman did not say what they will discuss during
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, the first
group of 200 recruits for the province's multi-ethnic police
force will start their training on Monday, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Their course will run through October. A second group of
recruits will begin training on September 15. So far, some 19,500
people have been applied to join the new force.
</P>
<P>
The training is under the responsibility of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation (OSCE), which is responsible for one
of the four main pillars of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led peacekeepers failed to keep law and order after
its deployment in Kosovo under a Security Council resolution,
adopted on June 10. Non-Albanians are being persecuted in Kosovo
after the return of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which seized
power in some Kosovo areas after the withdrawal of Yugoslav
forces.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Reminds of "Humanitarian Deficit" in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Despite a brighter
outlook for Iraq oil exports in the current "oil for food" phase,
there should not be any complacency over the humanitarian
situation in Iraq, a senior U.N. official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Benon Sevan, Executive Director of the Iraq Program said his
judgement was based on the "lamentable state" of Iraq's oil
industry and the volatile oil market.
</P>
<P>
Besides, there was a "humanitarian deficit" estimated at 3.1
billion U.S. dollars for the two previous 180-day phases, he said,
referring to the gap between real export revenue and the U.N.
authorized ceiling of 5.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sevan, who briefed the Security Council on the implementation
of the humanitarian program in Iraq, said the estimated value of
approved oil export contracts may reach 6.5 billion dollars for
the period from May 25 to November 21, based on the current level
of 18 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
After deductions for the purchase of oil spare parts and
equipment and pipeline fees, the funds available for the
implementation of the humanitarian program are expected to be 3.86
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the authorized revenue target of the current
phase may be reached some time around the middle of October.
</P>
<P>
He said since the "oil for food" program began in 1996, there
had been a total of 484 holds on Iraq's export applications, with
a value of close to 500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The "excessive number of holds" on applications have "serious
implications for the implementation of the humanitarian program",
he added.
</P>
<P>
The "oil for food" program aims at ensuring substantial
deliveries of food and health supplies to Iraq. During the first 3
phases the Security Council set a ceiling of 2 billion dollars on
oil exports in each phase.
</P>
<P>
For the two phases prior to May 25 this year, the ceiling was
lifted to 5.2 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
ended a closed-door session on Thursday afternoon at which the
latest situation in Burund was discussed.
</P>
<P>
There is no open announcement of the outcome of the meeting,
which lasted some one and half hours.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is briefed by the U.N. Secretariat, came
after ethnic Hutu rebels have killed more than 30 civilians in
attacks over the past week in southern Burundi and around the
capital Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
Col Gabriel Gunungu, the governor of the southern province of
Makamba on the Tanzanian border, told reporters on Tuesday that at
least 30 civilians were killed in three separate attacks in recent
days.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan had strongly condemned last
week the recent killing of civilians in Burundi by rebels and
government troops and called for an end to the attacks.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people have been killed in Burundi's civil
war, which started in October 1993. Human rights groups accuse
both rebels from the ethnic Hutu majority and the army of
massacres of civilians.

<HEADLINE> Police Fail to Attract Ethnic Recruits in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The number of ethnic minority
police officers in England and Wales has risen by only 37 in the
past year -- fewer than one person for every force, showed Home
Office figures released Friday.
</P>
<P>
A Home Office report on the current breakdown of police service
personnel disclosed that the total number of ethnic minority
police officers has increased from 2,483 to 2,520 in the past 12
months across all 43 police forces in England and Wales.
</P>
<P>
Only 2 percent of the total officers in the 43 forces were from
ethnic minorities, with 87 percent of them holding the lowest rank
of constable.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw told chief constables in April that
they should recruit 8,000 officers from ethnic minorities within
10 years.
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Police needed to find another 5,662 officers
from ethnic minorities even though the force was going through a
recruitment crisis, partly blamed on the high cost of living in
the capital.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office figures, which charted recruitment changes
between April 1998 and March 1999, showed a cut in total strength
of 718 officers to 126,096 across the 43 forces.

<HEADLINE> Probe Begins into Italian Soccer Player's Confession on Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The confession came in a letter published in Italy's Catholic
weekly Famiglia Cristiana, which said it had verified the truth of
the claims but would not reveal the identity of the player.
</P>
<P>
Coming on the eve of the new league season, the player's claims
of widespread corruption and their legal consequences threaten the
sport.
</P>
<P>
Last year, AS Roma club's coach Zdenek Zeman sparked a similar
controversy, saying that many Italian players were guilty of
doping.
</P>
<P>
The Rome investigation is based on a 1989 law under which fraud
in sport is punishable with up to two years in prison and a fine
of as much as 50 million lire.
</P>
<P>
The player wrote that he had been lured into corruption with
the promise of a first-rate contract, a trick which he said he was
not alone in falling victim to.
</P>
<P>
"People do this and other things," he said. "The amount of
money involved in the game now has killed everything and I too am
a victim."
</P>
<P>
He went on to speak of his terrible remorse over what he had
done.
</P>
<P>
Famiglia Cristiana's response was that while his clear
repentance would win him God's forgiveness, he should still
confess to judicial authorities.
</P>
<P>
The vagueness of the player's claim to have "altered the course
" of the championship meant that it was impossible to say whether
he referred to last year's, or whether he meant that the eventual
champions were not rightfully such.
</P>
<P>
But his reference to large sums of money and his having "
falsified the championship" led many observers to conclude that he
was a first division player, possibly in a top team vying for the
title.
</P>
<P>
His claims of corruption in soccer drew expressions of outrage
and disbelief among soccer players and club officials.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Court Issues Subpoenas to NATO Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Justice Ministry
on Friday issued subpoenas to a total of 14 leaders of NATO and
its major member countries, including U.S. President Bill Clinton,
ordering them to appear in court on war crimes charges.
</P>
<P>
A justice ministry statement, released by the official Tanjug
news agency, charges the leaders with committing war crimes
against civilians during the 78-day U.S.-led NATO airstrikes
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The justice ministry said it was issuing subpoenas to the
leaders in accordance with international regulations and the
Yugoslav criminal law.
</P>
<P>
Several such trials have been announced by different Yugoslav
courts.

<HEADLINE> Somalia Hit By Kenyan Border Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The humanitarian situation in
Somalia is further deteriorating as Kenya's recent closure of its
border with the war-torn country, which has tightened its
isolation from the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The situation is at its worst since the downfall of the late
regime in 1991, Some 30 percent of the children under five and 20
percent of pregnant women have died in the effected regions,
Mogadishu's Joint Health Authority (JHA) said in a statement
published here.
</P>
<P>
The organization characterized Kenya's decision to close down
its borders with Somalia as a horrific decision undermining the
already limited humanitarian assistance to the Somalis from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The worst affected regions are Gedo, Bay, Bakol, Middle
Shabelle, Galgudud and Mudug where starvation caused by droughts
and diseases are taking their tolls every day. Some 8 to 12
people die every day in Dhubo town of Gedo region.
</P>
<P>
In Bur Dhubo town, the situation is even worsened by conflicts
between opposing Somalis and Ethiopians and drought in the past
two seasons. What's more, refugees from the Ethiopia occupied Bulo
Hawo, Dolow and Luq flowed into the area and drained out the
already limited resources.
</P>
<P>
In Middle Shabelle region, more than 15,000 families are now at
risk of dying for shortage of food, medicine and blankets.

<HEADLINE> China's Textile Industry Reforms Getting Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China's textile industry has
made some progress in cutting losses and reducing the number of
spindles and employees, a breakthrough for state-owned enterprise
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry reforms were in the forefront of state-
owned enterprise reforms and reducing the number of outmoded
spindles was seen as a major step in changing the structure of the
industry, so 6.92 million spindles were destroyed in an 18-month
period.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the spindle reduction work is expected to be
completed by the end of this year, and the industry has found jobs
for nearly 880,000 laid-off workers with government help since
last year.
</P>
<P>
China's textile industry has contributed a great deal to the
nation's economy but state-owned textile factories had lost 8.3
billion yuan (about one billion U.S. dollars) by the end of 1996.
The industry cut 2.6 billion yuan in losses by the end of 1998,
and by June of this year it had started making profits of 390
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Losses were cut by 219 million yuan in the first half of this
year, compared with the same period of last year.

SNOW DRAGON SHIP, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The team on the Chinese
North Pole expedition ship had an unexpected visitor -- a homing
pigeon.
</P>
<P>
 The pigeon was found on the board of the ship Snow Dragon by
a sailor who was scrubbing the deck. It staggered out of a corner
of the deck, tired and hungry, so the sailor picked it up and ran
to the kitchen to get some mung beans and water which it disposed
of in a minute.
</P>
<P>
 To his surprise, both of its wings had Chinese characters on
them and it seemed so strange to see up there near the Arctic
Circle.
</P>
<P>
 The pigeon's appearance on the ship seemed a miracle, no
matter where it came from, the sailor says, wishing the bird a
safe journey home.

<HEADLINE> East Timor's Autonomy Ballot Campaign Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- East Timor's autonomy ballot
campaign ended Friday in a quiet atmosphere following Thursday's
massive clashes between pro-independence and pro-integration
factions.
</P>
<P>
At least four people were shot dead and a dozen others wounded
in sporadic clashes in East Timor that tarnished the autonomy
ballot campaign Thursday, according to reports from Dili, capital
of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Violence flared up between pro-independence and pro-integration
supporters around the Kuluhun area, east of Dili Thursday. Two
supporters of the pro-integration group and two from the
pro-independence group were shot dead in the violence.
</P>
<P>
Despite the violence, head of the U.N. Mission in East Timor
(UNAMET) Ian Martin Friday reiterated that the autonomy ballot to
determine the future of East Timor will go ahead as scheduled on
August 30.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read out by Martin in Dili, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan called on Indonesian security
authorities to arrest those responsible for carrying out the acts
of violence and lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
Martin said the UNAMET can not confirm that police officials
were behind the shooting in a clash on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Asked about efforts to secure the ballot, Martin said the
police have done their job well and they have been cooperating
with the U.N. civil police.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie decided at a
cabinet meeting on political and security affairs Thursday to
grant amnesty to jailed East Timor anti-integration leader Xanana
Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision, State Secretary/Justice Minister
Muladi said based on the presidential decision, Xanana would be
released by September 15. The president had decided to grant
amnesty to Xanana for his contribution in the search for a
comprehensive solution to the problems in East Timor, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Xanana, leader of the pro-independence National Council for
East Timor Resistance, was captured and jailed in 1992 for leading
armed guerrilla rebellions against Indonesian rule in the former
Portuguese colony. He was put under house arrest in February this
year under a special dispensation to allow him to assist moves to
resolve East Timor's future.
</P>
<P>
Muladi also said that the government had prepared a contingency
plan for the result of the August 30 ballot, which will allow the
East Timorese to choose whether their homeland should become an
autonomous region within Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
He said if the East Timorese accepted the autonomy option, the
Indonesian government would prepare to transfer the power to the
government of the special autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if they choose the second option, Jakarta
would set up four teams for dealing with security and order,
saving the country's assets, moving out about 230,000 pro-autonomy
people from East Timor to various parts of Indonesia and
transferring power.
</P>
<P>
Responding to concerns over possible violence following the
ballot, East Timor Military District Commander Col. Noer Muis said
they have prepared two strategic scenarios to cope with the worst.
</P>
<P>
"The post-ballot period will be a very critical stage since
neither of the two conflicting factions seems able to accept the
possibility of defeat. And this has been reflected by the numerous
clashes among their supporters during the campaigning," The
Jakarta Post quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the autonomy ballot will take place as
scheduled on August 30 in every polling station from 06:30 local
time (2230 GMT on August 29) to 17:00 local time.
</P>
<P>
A total of 451,796 East Timorese -- 438,517 in East Timor and
13,279 outside the territory, including those overseas -- have
registered for the ballot.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations will announce simultaneously the voting
result in New York and Dili about one week after the ballot.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia early this year announced it would grant East Timor
independence if the people in the territory reject the offer of a
wide-ranging autonomy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Income, Spending Up in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Americans' personal income
continued to increase in July but their spending climbed much
faster, leaving the nation's savings rate near a record low, the
Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Personal income, which includes wages, interest and government
benefits, rose a slower-than-expected 0.2 percent last month, the
smallest this year, following a strong 0.7 percent increase in
June. Wages rose a solid 0.7 percent in July, compared to a 0.5
percent gain in June.
</P>
<P>
Spending, however, went up 0.4 percent in July, slightly less
than many analysts had expected. In June, spending rose 0.3
percent. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the
country's total economic activity.
</P>
<P>
Because consumer spending has repeatedly outpaced incomes, the
nation's savings rate, savings as a percentage of after-tax
income, has set a string of record lows this year.
</P>
<P>
But in July, the savings rate was minus 1.4 percent, better
than the record low of negative 1.5 percent in May. Previously, a
record low of negative 1.2 percent was set in April.
</P>
<P>
A major reason for the negative savings rate, economists say,
is that the strong stock market is boosting Americans' net worth
and making them more comfortable about dipping into savings to pay
for their spending sprees.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Tuesday raised interest rates for the
second time this summer by a quarter of a percentage point, making
borrowing more expensive. The Fed did this to slow the economy and
keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
In June, a big increase in federal disaster relief subsidy
payments to farmers caused farm proprietors' income to surge,
boosting overall personal income. Last month, those payments
decreased, causing their income to fall sharply and slow overall
income growth.
</P>
<P>
Spending on durable goods, big-ticket manufactured items
expected to last at least three years such as washing machines and
cars, rose 0.2 percent in July, compared to a 0.1 percent gain in
June.
</P>
<P>
Spending on nondurable products, such as food and fuel, went up
0.1 percent, slightly less than the 0.2 percent increase the month
before.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending in the second quarter rose at an annual rate
of 4.6 percent. That was brisker than estimated a month ago, but
slower than the torrid 6.7 percent pace of spending in the first
quarter.

<HEADLINE> Germany, U.S. Make Little Progress on Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The three-day talks between the
German and U.S. governments over the compensation for ex-slave
workers in the Nazi era halted Friday in Bonn without a
breakthrough after both sides found they could not agree on the
accurate sum.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference following their meeting, the German
delegate Graf Lambsdorff and his U.S. counterpart Stuart Eizenstat
stressed that the two countries must seek a settlement "as quickly
as possible" for the interests of those victims of Nazi
dictatorship. But they failed to predict when such settlement
would come on the table.
</P>
<P>
Both of them criticized German business' reluctance to pay for
the projected compensatory fund. Lambsdorff called on German
business to "take more moral responsibility" and avoid "greater
image-loss."
</P>
<P>
"Every year 10 percent of the survivors die.... Their average
age is over 70," said Eizenstat, referring to the urgency of a
quick settlement for those still living. He stressed, "We cannot
allow any biological solution."
</P>
<P>
About 400 German enterprises had deployed slave workers to earn
a huge sum of profits in the Nazi regime. Some of them, such as
the Volkswagen, have become world-leading concerns during the
post-war era.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen large German companies have by now agreed to envisage a
fund of 1.7 billion U.S. dollars for 600,000 people. But the U.S.
believed 20 to 30 billion dollars for more than 2 million people
should be more reasonable.
</P>
<P>
Lambsdorff argued the compensatory fund should be affordable,
and rejected the demand of 20 billion dollars as "absolutely
unrealistic."
</P>
<P>
"The compensation should be payable for German enterprises," he
said, adding that too much demand would make them "think twice,
whether or not to take part in the fund."
</P>
<P>
Hoping to reach a compromise, Eizenstat promised the U.S.
government would protect German companies at court if the
survivors forged more demands after the compensatory package.
</P>
<P>
But, if the deal fails with all these guarantees, the

<HEADLINE> Fed Must Pay More Attention to Stock Market, Greenspan Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States' monetary
policymakers must pay closer attention than ever before to what
happens on the stock market because more Americans are investing in
stocks, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"As the value of assets and liabilities have risen relative to
income, we have been confronted with the potential for our
economies to exhibit larger and perhaps more abrupt responses to
changes in factors affecting the balance sheets of households and
businesses," Greenspan said in a speech at the Fed's annual
retreat, in Wyoming's Grand Tetons.
</P>
<P>
There has been a debate in economic circles over whether
financial markets should be taken into consideration when the Fed
sets interest rate policy. Since the central bank's primary
response is to keep inflation in check, some argue, it needs to
focus on price changes in the real economy, looking at such things
as whether commodity prices or wages are rising too quickly.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, however, said that given the larger percentage of
household wealth that is now accounted for by investments, the
central bank needs to watch more closely what happens on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
"Central bankers, in particular, are going to have to be able
to ascertain how changes in the balance sheets of economic actors
influence real economic activity and, hence, affect appropriate
economic policies," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan has expressed concern about the high-flying stock
market before. In December 1996 he caused a sharp, brief selloff
in markets around the world by wondering aloud whether investors
were in the grip of "irrational exuberance."
</P>
<P>
At the time of that speech, the Dow Jones industrial average
was hovering around 6,500. On Thursday, the index ended 127.59
points lower at 11,198.45 after Wednesday's record close of
11,326.04.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Group Calls For Expediting Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's National Alliance
for Peace (NAP) Friday called upon the government to expedite the
peace process by presenting the constitutional amendment on
devolution proposals to parliament.
</P>
<P>
"All parties and politicians in the democratic stream must do
everything in their power to facilitate this process and put the
national interest before that of their party," said the NAP in its
resolution.
</P>
<P>
NAP's spokesman Witharana said the government should present
the constitutional amendment to parliament before the government's
budget in November.
</P>
<P>
The NAP, formed last November to pressure political parties to
cooperate in solving the long running ethnic conflict, comprises
religious leaders, professionals and their organizations,
academics and those in the cultural sector, trade unions, women
and youth organizations.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year-old war between the
Sinhalese majority-controlled government and Tamil minority rebels
of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who demand a
separate homeland in the country's north and east.
</P>
<P>
The ruling People's Alliance government has proposed the
constitutional amendment which includes devolution proposals to
give more powers to regional councils in a bid to end the ethnic
strife.
</P>
<P>
However, the amendment requires a two-third majority for
passage in parliament which can be obtained only with the support
of the main opposition United National Party (UNP).
</P>
<P>
"While the opposition must act constructively and responsibly,
the government should be flexible enough to accommodate all
workable amendments and be responsive," said the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Local business leaders have urged the government and the UNP to
reach a consensus on a political solution by September 30. Then
they can take the consensus to the LTTE leaders in October to
persuade the rebels back to the negotiating table.

NEW DELHI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- India Friday handed over eight
Pakistani prisoners of war (POWs) to the International Committee
of Red Cross and they will be repatriated to Pakistan, an external
affairs ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
India offered to release the eight Pakistani soldiers who were
taken prisoners of war on August 13 in the recent Kashmir
conflict.
</P>
<P>
India said the offer, announced on the eve of Pakistan's
Independence Day, is a "goodwill gesture" on the Indian part.
</P>
<P>
However, the release had been delayed as the two countries were
engaged in a war of words, with India accusing Pakistan of
creating "complications" over the soldiers' repatriation by
refusing to confirm their identities.

WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Scientists say that a 15 million-year-old skeleton unearthed
in Kenya belongs to a previously unknown animal type that may be a
sort of great-uncle of our oldest direct relative.
</P>
<P>
-- New revelations about Russian money laundering through a
major U.S. bank have presented Vice President Al Gore with a
potentially difficult campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>

from joining the earthquake relief effort, fearing that they might
win public confidence and thereby converts to the cause of
political Islam, which the government views as a threat to the
secular order.
</P>
<P>
-- Britain sought to prevent the collapse of peace efforts in
Northern Ireland by ruling that recent charges of murder and
gunrunning against the IRA did not constitute a violation of its
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- the U.S. economy grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the
second quarter, down from an original estimate of 2.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> More World Records Tumble at Pan Pacs Swimming Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heyns set her seventh record in six weeks, slicing 0.78 seconds
off her own mark in the women's 200 meters breaststroke. World
champion Kristy Kowal trailed dehind her by almost two seconds.
</P>
<P>
Ukrain-born Krayzelburg splashed home first in the 100m
breaststroke, clocking one minute 55.87 seconds to break the eight-
year-old world mark of 1:56.57, set by Spain's Martin Lopez-Zubero
in November 1991.
</P>
<P>
It was also the 10th world record set in the championships,
which finish on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Krayzelburg broke the 100m backstroke world record on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Heyns, who admitted her training had been helped by the food
supplement creatine, hoped to set another personal best on
Saturday, after receiving permission from swimming body FINA to
have a crack at her own 50m breaststroke record in a specially
arranged time trial.
</P>
<P>
The United States picked up the other two golds on offer on
Friday, bringing their championships tally to nine compared with
Australia's 11.
</P>
<P>
Jenny Thompson won the women's 100m freestyle. It was her 22nd
Pan Pacific gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Tom Wilkens of the United states claimed the 200m individual
medley title.
</P>
<P>
Heyns completed an Olympic breaststroke golden double at the
Atlanta Games but almost quit the sport a year ago, after failing
to take even a single gold at the world championships. She said
her concentration was affected in the 200m breaststroke because
her swimsuit was wedged between her buttocks. But she was on
record pace throughout the race and clocked 2:23.64 to win, which
was her seventh record in the past 10 races including heats and
semi-finals.

<HEADLINE> HK's Exports Continue to Improve in First Half 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's exports continued
to improve in overall terms in the second quarter of 1999,
according to a government report on the economic situation in the
first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter of 1999, total exports of goods fell by
about 2 percent in real terms over a year earlier, smaller than
the 5 percent decrease in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
For the first half of 1999 as a whole, total exports of goods
fell by about 3 percent in real terms over a year earlier. On a
seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, total exports of
goods rose by about 1 percent in real terms in the second quarter
of 1999, having recorded virtually zero growth in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Imports of goods fell further, by about 8 percent in real terms
in the second quarter of 1999 over a year earlier, following a 10
percent decline in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
For the first half of 1999 as a whole, imports of goods were
down by about 9 percent in real terms over a year earlier. On a
seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, imports of goods
revived to a growth of about 1 percent in real terms in the second
quarter of 1999, from a 2 percent decrease in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
With imports falling much faster than exports on a year-on-year
comparison, the visible trade deficit narrowed further to 4
percent of the value of imports of goods in the first half of 1999.
This was much smaller than the corresponding figure of 9.3 percent
in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
On invisible trade, exports of services should have risen
further in the second quarter of 1999 over a year earlier, mainly
upon a sustained revival in inbound tourism. Imports of services
should have held broadly stable. As a result, the invisible trade
surplus had probably expanded further.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with the reduced visible trade deficit, this led to a
greater surplus in the combined visible and invisible trade
account in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Unified Marine Environmental Protection Team Needed: Lawmakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Top Chinese legislators today
said that there needs to be a unified national marine-law
enforcement team to stop the deterioration of the marine
environment and to find ways to use marine resources better.
</P>
<P>
At the 11th session of the 9th National People's Congress
Standing Committee, lawmakers examined the draft amendments of the
Marine Environment Protection Law and discussed establishing a
unified marine-law enforcement team among other issues.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Shusheng, a committee member, said that China's current
marine administration offices overlap in their work and lack
cooperation, leading to a lack of efficiency and waste of human
and material resources.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers suggested that China model itself on other
countries and establish a unified marine-law enforcement team. Du
Bilan proposed that China first have unified law-enforcement
activities and then establish a unified team.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers agreed that China desperately needs to revise its
existing Marine Environment Protection Law, which as passed in
1983, to deal with the deteriorating marine environment.
</P>
<P>
China has 18,000 km of coastline, with approximately three
million sq km of sea areas under its jurisdiction. Serious
pollution in recent years has led to many problems to the marine
environment. There were some 193 instances of red tides in China's
coastal areas in the 1990-1998 period, causing hundreds of
millions of yuan in economic losses annually.

<HEADLINE> Aircraft Wreckage to Be Cut Up Before Removal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The wreckage of the China
Airlines MD-11 that crashed at Hong Kong International Airport on
Sunday will be cut up and removed in three pieces, the Airport
Authority (AA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
AA Acting Airport Management Director Howard Eng said that it
had been hoped that the fuselage could be recovered in one piece.
However, the extent of the internal damage to the aircraft had
prevented this.
</P>
<P>
Late last night, the fuselage was lifted by three cranes from
the crash site and recovery trailers were put in position to
remove the wreckage, Eng said. However as the aircraft fuselage
was lowered onto the trailers, it became evident that the impact
of the crash had caused serious internal structural damage to the
aircraft, he added.
</P>
<P>
An assessment was made with the technical experts on site,
including the Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company (HAECO), the
crane operators and representatives of the aircraft manufacturer.
It was agreed that the wreckage, particularly the nose section,
was in an unstable condition, and it was possible it would break
up if an attempt was made to remove it from the site and transport
it three kilometers to HAECO.
</P>
<P>
Eng said that repairs to the runway surface, which was damaged
by burning fuel, were completed by 09:00 hours Friday. In addition,
the 43 damaged runway lights have now been replaced.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that it was still too early to say when the south
runway would return to operations. However, the airport was
operating normally with the use of the north runway.

<HEADLINE> CIS Defense Chiefs Discuss Air Operation System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Defense ministers from countries
of the Commonwealth of Independent States met Friday in Astrakhan,
southern Russia, to discuss ways to improve the operation of the
joint air defense system.
</P>
<P>
Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, chief of the international
military cooperation department at the Russian Defense Ministry,
said the CIS countries have been increasing personnel and
materials involved in the joint system.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will discuss the system's funding, the Interfax
news agency quoted Ivashov as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The principle remains the same -- Russia covers 50 percent of
the spending and other members pick up the rest," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Officially, the joint air defense system includes 10 CIS
countries: Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
In practice, however, only six are involved: Armenia, Belarus,
Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Russia and Tajikistan, Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov said the ministers also planned to discuss a new
candidate for the post of chief of staff for coordinating CIS
defense cooperation, who will be approved at the next CIS summit.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, chaired by Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev,
is being attended by delegations from Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus,
Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Sensex Records New High in Bombay Stock Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The sensitive index (Sensex)
rose 24.30 points Friday on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) on
sustained speculative buying coupled with fresh purchases from
foreign institutional investors and local financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-30 share sensitive index opened remarkably up at
4,875.28 and moved in a range of 4,896.09 and 4,851.60 before
closing at a new record high at 4,870.66 as against Thursday's
close of 4,846.36, netting a rise of 24.30 points.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-100 index improved further by 11.38 points to 2,183.88
from the previous close of 2,172.50.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-200 index and the Dollex were quoted moderately up at
501.34 and 191.88 compared with their previous close of 499.29 and
191.01 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-500 index rose by 3.90 to 1,482.60 from Thursday's
close of 1,478.70.
</P>
<P>
Market sources said there was a strong optimism that the Sensex
would hit the magic 5,000-mark by next Wednesday as the bull run
was likely to be powered on the back of foreign institutional
investors' net purchase position for the current week.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Settlers Call for Boycott of Burger King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Jewish settlers called for a
worldwide boycott of the international fast-food chain Burger
King Friday after it decided to close a restaurant in a Jewish
settlement in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"We are calling on Jewish organizations and our friends, Jews
and Christians, to boycott Burger King," Israel Radio quoted Benny
Kashriel, mayor of the largest West Bank settlement Maale Adumin,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
His call came after Burger King announced Thursday that it
would cancel immediately the right of its Israeli franchise-holder
Rikamor Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Arab and Muslim groups have threatened a worldwide boycott of
the American company after it opened a chain restaurant in Maale
Adumin three months ago, saying this move was tantamount to a
recognition of Israel's control over the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the West Bank from Arab control in the 1967
Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued from its headquarters in Miami, Burger
King accused Rikamor of breach of its franchise contract and
misrepresentation.
</P>
<P>
"Specifically, Rikamor falsely informed Burger King that the
food counter would be located in Israel," the statement said. "It
had been clearly understood between the two companies that Burger
King would not approve Rikamor opening restaurants in the West
Bank at this sensitive time in the peace process," it added.
</P>
<P>
But Rikamor chairman Meshulam Riklis staunchly denied the
charge, saying his company had received all the approvals
required by Burger King's world standards.
</P>
<P>
Both Riklis and Kashriel, who is also chairman of a council
representing Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza, vowed to
take "all legal means" to fight the closure decision of Burger
King, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Burger King has more than 10,000 restaurants worldwide,
including 46 in Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Forum for Unity, Democracy,
and Justice (FPDK), one of the pro-autonomy forces in East Timor,
Friday condemned the "brutal attack" by anti-autonomy radicals
that claimed five lives during the final round of the pro-autonomy
campaign Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, FPDK chief Domingos Policarpo expressed
his regret over the "irresponsible and inhumane" act by the
anti-autonomy radicals, saying the action had totally violated all
agreements in the code of conduct of the campaign and had openly
provoked the pro-autonomy group and jeopardizes the popular
consultation that will be held next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Reports said five people were killed and dozens of others were
injured in a physical clash between the conflicting factions in
the East Timor capital of Dili on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place when the East Timorese were conducting
their campaign for the August 30 direct autonomy ballot.
</P>
<P>
However, the United Nations Mission in East Timor said Friday
that the ballot will go ahead as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is organizing the ballot in the territory to
enable the East Timorese to accept or reject a wide-ranging
autonomy offered by the Indonesian government early this year.
</P>
<P>
A rejection of the autonomy proposal will mean independence for
the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was integrated into Indonesia in 1976 in a move
never recognized by the United Nations.

BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's financial street is
taking shape after several years of construction, with more than
200 banks and companies flooding in.
</P>
<P>
Now the headquarters of 12 key financial organizations,
including People's Bank of China, the Bank of China, Industrial
and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China,
Construction Bank of China, and People's Insurance Company of
China, have settled down in the street.
</P>
<P>
Work on the 1,700-meter street started in August 1994. Two
million square meters of the 88-hectare area will be used for
buildings and some skyscrapers have been completed.
</P>
<P>
The street will be a state-level financial administrative
center mostly for the headquarters of state-level banks and
financial organizations, according to Wang Gongwei, who is in
charge of construction and development.
</P>
<P>
Some seven billion yuan (840 million U.S. dollars) has been
spent on the street, half of that from overseas investors, and it
has attracted more than 200 enterprises, and some well-known
overseas companies like Malaysia's Hong Leong Group have shown
interest in the area.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the street will be built into a three
million square meters modern financial center in ten years.

NEW DELHI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Most safety systems in India's
nuclear power plants are compliant in solving the year 2000 (Y2K)
problem and the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) will achieve
full Y2K compliance by the end of October this year, an official
report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report on the DAE's Y2K readiness presented
here to the National Y2K Action Force, 29 of the 33 safety-related
systems in the nuclear power plants in the country are Y2K
compliant and further verification is under way. The status of the
rest four is unclear.
</P>
<P>
Safety analysis of each plant has been considered by the
Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd. in Mumbai, which runs the
power plants, and contingency plans have been drawn up
accordingly, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Though the DAE would be ready by the end of September,
certification and external audits would take a month, officials

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Ministry of
Manpower Friday confirmed that Compaq Singapore, a multi-national
company of computer manufacturing, will lay off 1,600 workers in
the city state in the fourth quarter of this year as part of its
world-wide corporate restructuring exercise.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a press release that it has been informed
by the company of its retrenchment plan which will be carried out
in phases beginning in the fourth quarter of this year with the
completion scheduled for the first quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The ministry and the Economic Development Board have been
working closely with Compaq to facilitate the re-deployment and
re-training of the affected workers and to offer employment
assistance to the would-be retrenchments, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The confirmation of the company's decision came two weeks after
Western Digital, also a multi-national company, had embarked on
retrenchment of 2,500 workers in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,700 workers were retrenched in Singapore in the
first half of this year, slightly less than half of the 14,600
workers laid off in the second half of 1998. However, layoff in
large numbers by multi-national companies in Singapore will offset
the labor market improvement.

distinct rebound in the second quarter of 1999, according to the
government's Half-yearly Economic Report 1999 published here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
An initial assessment suggests that gross domestic product (GDP)
should have returned to a small positive growth of around 0.5
percent in real terms in the second quarter over a year earlier,
reversing the declining trend since the first quarter of 1998
leading to a 3.4 percent decrease in the first quarter of 1999,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, GDP should
have also rebounded distinctly, to an increase of around 3.0
percent in real terms in the second quarter, after a 0.3 percent
decrease in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, investment demand remained sluggish, affected by a
still uncertain business outlook, continued credit restraint and
high real interest cost, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Yet consumer spending improved noticeably, it added.
</P>
<P>
Exports continued to pick up, driven in particular by stronger
demand in the East Asian economies, and also by the sustained
economic growth and import absorption in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Export of services should have risen further, along with the
revival in inbound tourism.
</P>
<P>
As the labor market tended to stabilize, both the seasonally
adjusted unemployment rate and the underemployment rate edged 6.2
percent and 3.0 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The trend of improvement in the economy can be expected to
continue into the second half of 1999, the report said.
</P>
<P>
While investment spending in machinery and equipment by the
private sector could still be slack, investment spending by the
public sector, especially those on the priority railway projects
and on public housing, should continue to gather momentum to
provide a degree of offset, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending should likewise revive further, against a
more positive economic environment and outlook.
</P>
<P>
Externally, exports of both goods and services are likely to
pick up further, as recovery in the East Asian economies takes
hold and as the exchange value of the U.S. dollar softened most
recently.
</P>
<P>
For 1999 as a whole, the forecast GDP growth rate in real terms
is kept unchanged in the present update, at 0.5 percent, said the
report.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Says Lee Teng-hui Betrays Nation's Interests (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, China's leading
newspaper, in an article on Saturday criticizes Lee Teng-hui for
betraying the interests of the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Lee's "two states" remark caused an international uproar, but
he said recently that the more confusion, the better. This
crankiness shows his determination to divide the country and be an
enemy of the Chinese people, it says.
</P>
<P>
Lee was encouraged by foreigners who supported his remark
publicly and staged an anti-China farce. But any interference in
Chinese affairs are doomed to fail, it says.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan, and more than 100 other countries
were shocked by Lee's remark and reaffirmed the one-China position,
proving that Lee can not change the international community's
pursuit of the one-China principle.
</P>
<P>
More and more countries have come to understand the Chinese
people's determination to safeguard national sovereignty and they
are more alert after seeing through Lee's wild ambition to split
China and have set the scales of international relations right,
the article says.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's leading anti-Israeli
guerrilla group Hezbollah Friday announced that one of its
fighters was killed in south Lebanon last week.
</P>
<P>
Abbas Rihan, 24, was killed in fighting with Israeli troops in
south Lebanon last week, the group said in a statement which gave
no details.
</P>
<P>
The fresh fatality raised to 20 the number of Lebanese
guerrillas, most from Hezbollah, killed in south Lebanon since
the start of this year while 13 Israelis were also killed.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli troops out of the country.

BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of the General
Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), in a meeting
here today with Ulukalala-Lavaka-Ata, minister of foreign affairs

On bilateral army relations, Fu said that China welcomes the
increase of contacts between both army leaders. The PLA hopes to
work together with Tonga's armed forces to promote military
relations within the general framework of bilateral relations.

<P>
Ulukalala reiterated that Tonga will unswervingly stick to the
"one China" policy. "Tonga holds a positive view towards further

<HEADLINE> Tourism Brings Wealth to China's Zhangjiajie (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The number of poor people in
Zhangjiajie City in central China's Hunan Province has fallen by a
staggering 85 percent in the last decade as a result of rapid
economic development boosted by tourism.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 500,000 agricultural workers
have now cast off poverty, with the annual per capita income
rising by 1,135 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Located in the mountainous region west of Hunan, Zhangjiajie
has been an extremely impoverished area for a long time due to a
shortage of arable land and poor communications infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
When the city was established in 1988, over 600,000 of its 1.3
million population lived below the poverty line, with ethnic
minorities accounting for more than 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Then the city government mapped out a strategy focusing on
tourism to develop the economy and encourage a better standing of
living, especially as the area is endowed with unique and well-
preserved natural resources.
</P>
<P>
After painstaking efforts, they attracted near some nine
billion yuan of investment from home and abroad, which has helped
build up an efficient communications network, including railways,
highways and air routes.
</P>
<P>
This network now links the remote city with all China's major
cities nationwide, and the air routes to Hong Kong and Macao which
opened earlier this year also facilitate the growing numbers of
overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zhangjiajie has stepped up the construction of
tourist facilities in its key scenic spots, including cable cars
and special walkways while sparing no effort to protect the
natural environment.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 the city's major scenic spot of Wulingyuan was
inscribed on the World Heritage list by UNESCO.

<P>
The rise of Zhangjiajie's reputation as a tourist attraction
has boosted its visitor figures by 18.3 percent on an annual basis
with revenue increasing by 42.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, the city has received more than 15 million tourists
and earned over two billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it has also given priority to developing tourism by-
products such as handicrafts. The tapestries made by Tujia ethnic
girls sell well across the country and throughout southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that more than 300 tourism related food and
handicraft enterprises in the city had a combined financial
turnover nearing one billion yuan last year, accounting for one-
third of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has also boosted the development of agriculture,
featured by the 6,000 ha of quality tea, 20,000 ha of fruits and
more than 50,000 ha of medicinal herbs growing in the area which
sell widely to visitors.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year tourism continued to grow in
Zhangjiajie with more than 900,000 visitors flocking in from all
over China and worldwide. This resulted in revenues of over 300
million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Blast Kills 2 Taliban Governors: Afghan Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Two Taliban governors of
northern Afghan provinces traveling in a same vehicle were killed
in a mysterious blast, an opposition commander said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle carrying Balkh governor Mullah Akhtare Qandahari,
Kunduz governor Arif Khan and Kunduz police chief Mirzah Nasseri
blew off mysteriously in the northern town of Baghlan, said
General Hussain Anwari, commander of the opposition group
Harrakat-e-Islami.
</P>
<P>
But he did not give the time of the accident.
</P>
<P>
Immediate confirmation from the Taliban or independent sources
is not available.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Anwari said the two Taliban governors were
reportedly killed in the accident while Mirza Nasseri was believed
to be in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban officials were in Baghlan to inspect the front
lines, he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwari also claimed that the opposition forces made many gains
in battle fields across Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
After two days of intense fighting in the eastern provinces of
Nangarhar, Laghman and Kunar, the towns of Norgol, Nerang,
Baharabad and Chondichinar were captured by the opposition troops,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In a counter offensive launched in Samangan province in
northern Afghanistan, the opposition troops also managed to
capture the districts of Zarre, Hamrakh and Sayad, according to
Anwari.

The Jing people also have vigorously developed their cross-
border trade with Vietnam. Last year, the Jing's average annual
income reached over 4,800 yuan, becoming the highest among all
Chinese nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Yet, owing to historic and natural factors, the overall
development of China's ethnic regions still lags behind that of
the coastal areas. In some remote areas, people still do not have
adequate food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
However, China has made concrete efforts to narrow the gap
between ethnic regions and developed coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, China invested a total of 336.3
billion yuan in fixed assets in ethnic regions. Last year alone,
this investment reached 260 billion yuan, accounting for about 10
percent of all domestic investment.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin has said that judging from the
past several thousand years, new China's policy about the ethnic
groups has been the best and the most successful in the world.
</P>
<P>
With China's gradual shift of emphasis to developing the
western regions, the increased development of the rich natural
resources in ethnic regions, the deepening of reforms and opening-
up, and the correct execution of the nationality policy, it is no
longer a dream for the ethnic groups to take off, according to
many ethnic affairs experts.

<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Fifty years ago, Tie Richang's
father was a lowly serf of the Yi ethnic group, ploughing all day
long in the valleys of southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Now, Tie now is a security official at the satellite launching
center in Xichang of Sichuan, issuing orders via his cellular
phone every day to the sentries around the center.
</P>
<P>
"Can you image that our family came into modern society from
slave society in such a short period of time?" asked Tie, who
turned 50 earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Tie is just one of the 110 million ethnic minority people in
China, yet his family's experiences over the past 50 years reflect
the sea changes witnessed by the nation's ethnic groups over the
past half century.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Ethnic Affairs Commission show that
the population of China's ethnic groups has risen to nearly 110
million from 35 million in 1953, and their average life expectancy
has doubled to over 60.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the gross domestic product (GDP) of China's five
autonomous regions and the three provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and
Qinghai reached 757 billion yuan (about 91.2 billion U.S. dollars)
from 5.6 billion yuan in 1952, with an average annual growth of 10.
5 percent, above that of the national average.
</P>

executive vice-minister of the commission, recalling the 50 years

"The good relations between our various nationalities and their
mutual growth have set an good example for other countries in
properly dealing with nationality issues," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that it is the policies of the Party and government
that have ensured long-standing social stability and fast
development for the ethnic groups in politics, economy, culture,
and other areas.
</P>
<P>
As early as May 1, 1947, China established its first ethnic
autonomous region under the leadership of the Communist Party of
China. This ushered in the great experiment of autonomy for the
country's regions inhabited.
</P>
<P>
New China kept in mind the failures of the past and in other
countries, and has greatly emphasized the establishment and
maintenance of nationality-to-nationality relations of "equality,
unity, and mutual help."
</P>
<P>
Currently, China has five provincial-level autonomous regions,
30 autonomous prefectures, and 120 autonomous counties (banners).
All of the top leaders in these regions, prefectures, and counties
are members of the ethnic nationalities they represent.
</P>
<P>
The autonomy of ethnic regions is one of China's three main
political systems, and has become the basic national policy,
willingly upheld safeguarded by nearly every Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"While ethnic policies and the autonomy system have enabled the
country's ethnic groups to embark on the road to equality and
unity, the reform and opening-up have given full play to their
potential capabilities," the official noted.
</P>
<P>
Take the example of the Jing ethnic group. They live on three
small peninsulas in south China near the Beibu Gulf, with a
population of under 18,000. Over the past 20 years, they have
intensified their engagement in sea fishing, planting, and
processing.

<HEADLINE> Russian Premier Vows to Destroy Gangs of Islamic Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin said Friday that his country will use everything in its
arsenal against criminal gangs.
</P>
<P>
"The gangsters must know that we will use whatever is
necessary to fight them," Putin told federal soldiers in Botlikh
district of Daghestan, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He awarded medals to servicemen and Daghestani volunteers who
had fought against the Islamic militants that infiltrated
Daghestan from the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Putin praised the forces for their success in driving out the
rebels ahead of the deadline he set.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 federal troops were killed in the two-week operation.
</P>
<P>
"Russia will never forget what you did today. Russia will
always help you, militarily and economically," Putin told Botlikh
district residents as he presented medals to the fighters of a
Daghestani self-defense unit.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had appropriated 300 million rubles (12.
12 million U.S. dollars) for current spending and 100 million
rubles (4.04 million dollars) for rebuilding work in Daghestan.
</P>
<P>
Putin called on Botlikh residents to show hospitality to
refugees fleeing the villages once occupied by the Islamic
militants. He urged the refugees not to hurry to return to their
villages because rebels had laid mines everywhere.
</P>
<P>
The mines must be cleared first, he said. "We have brought a
planeload of tents, blankets and other necessary things," Putin
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief of the General Staff Anatoly Kvashnin warned
that the fight against the rebels was far from over.
</P>
<P>
The recent fighting in Daghestan was just the first stage of
fighting the rebels, he said, "We know fully well that the bandits
have plans to tear Daghestan away from Russia and expect them to
change tactics in order to achieve their goals."

BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Air pollution in China,
especially in large and medium-sized cities, is now unbearable,
according to Chinese lawmakers, who met here today to discuss
draft amendments to the Law on the Prevention and Control of Air
Pollution.
</P>
<P>
They almost unanimously support the overhaul of the 1987 law
which was revised only three years ago and proposed replacing the
country's energy consumption pattern dominated by coal burning
with clean resources, such as electricity and gas.
</P>
<P>
However, there were still many attending the ongoing
legislative session, who worry whether the huge investment scheme
needed to implement the changes as required by the draft
amendments is feasible or affordable.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments under review by the National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee add 22 articles to the existing
50-article law and only 23 of the existing articles are left
unaltered.
</P>
<P>
According to a source with the NPC, the draft amendments were
not originally planned for discussion in this session's agenda
because of the changes made in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"But due to the accelerated deterioration of air quality in
recent years, the NPC Standing Committee leadership attaches great
importance to the issue and decided to move these new amendments
forward in the legislation procedure," the source said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Chunyun, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee said
that they (the amendments) are urgently needed for the protection
of people's health and are closely linked to the sustainable
development of the national economy.

<HEADLINE> "Air Pollution in China Unbearable": Lawmakers (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang and three other committee members, Chang Shana, Li Meng
and Zhu Yuli, said the draft still does not fully address the real
cause of air pollution in China, i.e. coal burning. If coal is
still burned at today's rate, no improvement will occur, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, legislator Liu Hongyuan was concerned that the
proposed investment in air pollution control for targeted cities
is as high as 350 billion yuan (42.3 billion U.S. dollars) for the
next 10 years, taking up nearly five percent of the local revenue
in related areas.
</P>
<P>
"The NPC should also adopt a resolution to make the investment
compulsory and forcible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another member Du Yijin said that the State Council should
conduct research in advance on how much control is needed and how
much will be affordable.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers Zhu Yuli, Tong Fu and many others suggested that the
government should levy fines heavy enough to make it financially
unfeasible for polluters to continue fouling the air.
</P>
<P>
But Pu Chaozhu and Yu Xinglong argued that many state-owned or
collectively-owned enterprises are already in financial
difficulties and short of funds to tackle pollution control,
saying that if fines are too heavy, there would be even grimmer
situation for them.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration said that 70
percent of China's key cities including Beijing, Shanghai,
Chongqing, provincial capitals and coastal or tourist cities
failed to meet national air pollution control standards in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization reported that of the 10 most
contaminated cities of the world in terms of air quality last year,
seven were in China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets With Former German Chancellor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in a
meeting with former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl here Friday
afternoon, said that Sino-German relations will have stable growth
in the next century with a joint effort.
</P>
<P>
Jiang described Kohl as an "old friend of China" and said that
China and Germany are both important countries and that expanded
mutually beneficial cooperation is in the long-term interest of
the people of both countries. Their economies complement each
other, he said, and there are bright prospects for cooperation and
that relations will have long-term stable development.
</P>
<P>
Kohl said that relations between the two can become even better
and that he is fully confident of that and promised to continue
efforts to develop friendly relations even if he is no longer
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the world is heading toward multi-polarization
in an unalterable historic trend but the Kosovo crisis shows a
dangerous tendency which deserves the attention of people all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has always held that the world will not be
safe unless the five principles of peaceful coexistence among
nations are upheld and unless different countries respect each
other, treat each other as equals, increase cooperation, and seek
a common ground while preserving differences.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes the next century will be one of peace and
development and that the Chinese Government and people are ready
to contribute to world peace and the common development of mankind,
with other governments and people.
</P>
<P>
Kohl arrived here Tuesday and has met with Li Peng, the
chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, and with Premier Zhu Rongji on separate occasions.

<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
met here with a group of young Taiwan scientists at the Great Hall
of the People on Thursday who are here to attend a symposium
promoting cross-Straits academic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, expressed
his welcome to the Taiwan scientists.
</P>
<P>
He said many scientists in the past made their major
discoveries in their youth, and the future is often created by the
wisdom of young people.
</P>
<P>
He added that people across the Taiwan Straits are all sons and
daughters of the Chinese nation, and the Chinese people are hard
working and intelligent people who are sure to make more
contributions to mankind by absorbing advanced scientific
discoveries from other countries.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier emphasized that China is working toward the
peaceful reunification of the motherland, and that the cross-
Straits exchanges and cooperation in science and technology should
not be affected in any cases.
</P>
<P>
He said there are many favorable conditions for cross-Straits
scientific and technological cooperation, and scientists from both
sides of the Straits can complement each other in mutual
encouragement toward the scientific advancement of the Chinese
nation.
</P>
<P>
Li also told the Taiwan scientists of China's strategy for
rejuvenating the nation by promoting science and education, and
restructuring and reforming scientific research institutions.

<HEADLINE> Manufacturing Output Jumps in July in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing
output increased by 17.4 percent year-on-year in July 1999 and
registered an accumulative 18-percent growth on a three-month
moving average basis, latest data released by the Economic
Development Board (EDB) show.
</P>
<P>
The growth was contributed mainly by the strong demand for
electronics and chemical products. Cumulative output increased by
11.5 percent in the first seven months of 1999 compared with the
same period in 1998, according to the EDB data issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Due to higher demand from the United States, output in the
electronics cluster ran up a robust 34.0 percent year-on-year in
July. Output increased substantially for telecommunication
equipment, sustained by strong demand from the region. The output
of semiconductors was also higher, boosted by orders from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
In addition, unit shipment of low-cost disk drives to the
United States increased. However, there was severe price erosion
in many electronic products. For the first seven months of 1999,
cumulative output of the electronics cluster grew by 20.7 percent
over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals cluster grew by 20.8 percent compared with July
1998 and this brought the cumulative growth for the first seven
months to 17.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
As the output of petrochemicals in July decreased by 28.1
percent year-on-year, the output of the pharmaceuticals industry
jumped by 104.6 percent and the petroleum industry declined by
22.2 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
The output of the engineering cluster in July declined
marginally by 3.8 percent year-on-year, attributed mainly to the
slowdown in the transport and process engineering sub-cluster.
</P>
<P>
However, the precision engineering segment increased by 2.5
percent driven by higher demand for metal and plastic components
for the electronics cluster.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Senate Find Fault with Ambassadors List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The senators deliberated on the nomination Thursday after the
Senator Chuba Okadigbo-led Foreign Affairs Committee submitted its
interim report, which suggested the list should give an equal
chance to every state, and the nominees per state could be drawn
from either the career or political categories.
</P>
<P>
By implication, there will be 109 nominees in all, rather than
103 currently listed - with three from each of the 36 states and
one from the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Senators were
elected on the same allotment pattern, reported the Guardian, a
leading Nigerian newspaper Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the executive arm of government remains at variance with
the legislature on this matter. Presidential Liaison Officer
Alhaji Ibrahim- Imam, said in Abuja that legislators do not have
constitutional powers to recommend what number to pick from each
state.
</P>
<P>
"The President will however look into genuine cases. But they
don't have the constitutional powers to dictate to the President.
And to the best of my knowledge, the President accommodated their
views. We however hope to work in harmony with them," he said.
</P>
<P>
But According to Okadigbo, the committee's concern was with
complaints of negation of the federal character and the need for
balancing in the presidential list. He added that senators are
constitutionally empowered to approve or disapprove names of
envoys, but in the case of advisers, it is the number.
</P>
<P>
He further suggested that the envoys-designated should meet
senators from their respective states for preliminary screening in
cases where primary screening by police, State Security Service
and others would have been certified alright; and the president to
ensure every state has three nominees and the three could be drawn
from either the career or political categories, or mixed.
</P>
<P>
In states where there is just one nominee each for now,
Okadigbo said the committee's thinking is: "The president will be
advised on the need for balance. On our recommendations, he will
give us fresh names."

</P>
<P>
AsianMedic led the gainers of the day surging up 90 cents to

<HEADLINE> An Honorable Night-soil Collector And His Family (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's note: This year is the 50th birthday of the People's
Republic of China (PRC). Xinhua News Agency is releasing a series
of stories about 50 Chinese men and women, young and old, to
present a picture of the changes that have taken place in China
over the past half century. These people will describe their own
experiences and how they fit into the changes in the motherland.
This is the sixth article.
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Shi Chuanxiang, a night-soil
collector, never dreamed that his handshake with a former Chinese
president 40 years ago would link the fortune of his family with
that of China's.
</P>
<P>
Shi died in 1975. However, his wife and children are well-
acquainted with both the misfortune and glory the family went
through over the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
Cui Xiuting, 76, Shi's wife, still clearly recalls the
excitement her husband felt on October 26, 1959, when he told her
how the then Chinese President Liu Shaoqi received him at the
Great Hall of the People to honor him for his social contribution
to the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Liu told Shi, "For the work you do as a night-soil collector
you are a true servant of the people. And as the state president,
I'm also a servant of the people." Shi never forgot those words or
the thrill of shaking hands with a state leader, according to Cui.
</P>
<P>
"It was a great honor for my family," his wife said. "In the
old days, even ordinary people, to say nothing of dignitaries,
turned up their noses at such workers."
</P>
<P>
Shi became an instant celebrity. In 1959 he was elected a
member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body to the
government, and in 1964 he became a deputy to the Third National
People's Congress, the legislature.
</P>
<P>
But changes on the political scene dealt Shi a fatal blow.
During the chaotic "Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976), Liu Shaoqi
was accused of being a "renegade and scab," was ousted and
persecuted to the point of death. Shi was believed to be a
follower of Liu, and in 1971 was forced to give up his job in
Beijing and return to his hometown in Qihe County, Shandong
Province in east China.
</P>
<P>
Although Shi had no chance to see his name cleared and to
experience the prosperity brought on by the reform and opening up
policies of the late 1970s, he was relieved to learn that his
younger son, Shi Chunli, would take his place as a night-soil
collector. The elder Shi died at the end of the "Cultural
Revolution".

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Backs Set-up of Int'l Criminal Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- As a country still
developing its human rights legislation, South Africa supported
the establishment of an International Criminal Court (ICC), Deputy
Justice Minister Cheryl Gillwald said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference on a United Nations' plan to set up
the ICC, Gillwald said: "This is an evolutionary step for the
international community but specifically for South Africa."
</P>
<P>
She told legal representatives and academics as well as
representatives from human rights organizations that South Africa
was one of the first countries to sign the ICC statute in Rome
last year and it was reviewing its legislation in accordance with
the statute.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 other nations are signatories.

<P>
Later his two daughters and eldest son were also employed by
the sanitation sector.
</P>
<P>
Shi Chunli started out as a garbage collector, then became a
loader and a driver, and was named a model worker in Beijing for
his outstanding achievements. He is now secretary of the Communist
Party Committee for Discipline Inspection of the Beijing
Sanitation Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"What my son has done is the same as his father," said his
mother proudly.
</P>
<P>
But there are differences in the job itself. "After 50 years of
development, great changes have taken place in China and in the
sanitation industry," said Shi Chunli, explaining that these days
trucks are used to carry excrement and urine rather than buckets.
</P>
<P>
Shi Yuhua, the youngest daughter of Shi Chuanxiang, said that
the development of a market economy has transformed people's way
of thinking about sanitation workers. During the 1980s, sanitation
workers were still looked down upon by some citizens, especially
by young people who thought that work in a foreign-funded company
was the best job to be had. The sanitation sector had to advertise
to find workers.
</P>
<P>
Now more people, even graduate university students, are willing
to be employed as sanitation workers, she noted.
</P>
<P>
But she can't forget those hard times in 1984 when her family
had to scrimp and save to buy a refrigerator. These days, a color
TV, a washing machine and an air-conditioner have replaced the
family's old traditional furniture.
</P>
<P>
Shi Xinmei, a granddaughter of Shi Chuanxiang, said that the
monumental change her family experienced is a reflection of what
has happened throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
She has worked in hotels, overseas-funded enterprises and
private businesses since graduating from middle school. "No matter
what I've done, it was all based on my own abilities," said Shi
Xinmei.
</P>
<P>
Shi Chuanxiang has been dead for decades, but his children and
grandchildren still cherish his work ethic. So does the nation.
</P>
<P>
Now, more than 10 Chinese provinces and autonomous regions and
over 30 cities have designated October 26 as "Environmental
Sanitation Day."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Stocks Fall 1.66 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks fell
dramatically Friday, ahead of the release of GDP figures and an
expected interest rate rise.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng index slumped 225.25 points, or 1.66 percent, to
close at 13,383.13 Friday.
</P>
<P>
The market turnover was 5.369 billion HK dollars (688 million U.
S. dollars), down by 1.656 billion HK dollars (212 million U.S.
dollars) from the 7.025 billion HK dollars (900 million U.S.
dollars) of the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government was to release the second quarter GDP
figures shortly after the market close.
</P>
<P>
The market was also hit by the expected decision of the Hong
Kong Association of Banks to raise deposit rates by 25 basis
points to match the U.S. interest rates rise Tuesday, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Counter, Utilities, Properties and Commerce and
Industry all suffered losses of 1.62 percent, 1.50 percent, 1.71
percent and 1.85 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
China-related shares ended lower with the Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index down 1.54 percent and the Hang Seng China-
Affiliated Corporations Index down 0.55 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index opened higher at 13,707.59 points Monday
afternoon, as the stock market was closed in the morning due to
the onslaught of a rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
Hit by the U.S. Federal Reserves decision to raise key interest
rates by 25 basis points, the Hong Kong stock sank 154.74 points
or 1.13 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A new Wall Street record and hopes of strong interim results of
two local blue-chips Cheung Kong (Holding) Ltd. and Hutchison
Whampoa helped boost the market to surge 129.25 points to reach 13,
608.38 Thursday.

</P>
<P>
She set four world records in two days at the Janet Evans
Invitational meeting in California last month, breaking both the
100m and 200m breaststroke records twice each and she went even
faster in both events in the Sydney championships.
</P>
<P>
She lowered her 100m standard in Monday's heats then broke the
200m in the semi-finals and again in the final.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Water and Sanitation Highest Priority in Quake-Stricken Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The most pressing health priority
in Turkey is the re-establishment of proper water and sanitation
services 10 days after a devastating earthquake struck the country,
the World Health Organization (WHO) said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The primary disease threats are waterborne diseases because of
unsafe water and acute respiratory infections due to over-crowding,
WHO warned.
</P>
<P>
The catastrophic earthquake killed over 12,000 people, left an
estimated 200,000 homeless and destroyed infrastructure in a 5,000
square-kilometer wide area, according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, "We need to ensure that, until water and sewage
infrastructure can be rebuilt, enough safe water is provided to
people in the region or, failing that, people know that they need
to boil or chlorinate all water first," said Lindsay Martinex,
Director of WHO's Department of Communicable Disease Surveillance
and Response.
</P>
<P>
WHO said that other priorities include the establishment of
infectious disease surveillance systems, the re-establishment of
basic health care services and the provision of mental health
services.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, WHO pointed out that the risk of infectious
disease epidemics is very limited. "In over 20 years of tracking
natural disasters, WHO has not found one instance of a disease
epidemic occurring in the aftermath of an event," Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, WHO said, diseases such as cholera are very unlikely
to appear in the region simply because the pathogen Vibrio
cholerae is not present in the environment and has not been found
in Turkey for almost 30 years.

<HEADLINE> China's Real Estate Index Continues to Slide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Real Estate Index, an
indicator of the industry's health, dropped 0.56 points from June
to July, to 101.65 points, which was 2.01 points lower than the
same month last year.
</P>
<P>
A report issued jointly by the National Bureau of Statistics
and the China Business Climate Monitoring Center said that in July,
the sub-index of real estate development space dipped 5.49 points
from June to 115.4 points, contributing most to the decline of the
Real Estate Index.
</P>
<P>
From January to July, China developed 25.8 million square
meters of land, up 40.4 percent over the same period last year,
but the growth rate dropped 17.8 percentage points from that for
the first six months this year.
</P>
<P>
Of the eight sub-indexes which comprise the Real Estate Index,
three were up and five down, and the vacant housing space sub-
index has continued to fall since May, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urges APEC to Reach Consensus on Trade Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand urged APEC members to
reach a consensus on a broad-based trade liberalization rather
than voluntary sectoral liberalization at the summit next month in
Auckland, Thailand News Agency (TNA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi was quoted by
TNA as saying that he hopes the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) members will unanimously support the calls of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) to agree on a broad-based liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, also director-general-elect of the WTO, said the
comments of APEC are very important in the world since its trade
value accounts for over 50 percent of world trade value.
</P>
<P>
The situation has changed in the past five years, so APEC
should review its free trade agenda, Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
The APEC meeting this year comes a month before a WTO meeting
which aims to launch a new "millennium round" of global free trade
talks. Three critical areas -- investment, tariffs and services --
will be the focal point of the discussions.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Release All Thai Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- All Thai prisoners held in
Myanmar will be released, following a request by Thai Foreign
Minister Surin Pitsuwan, to mark Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej's
72nd birthday this year, the official Thai News Agency (TNA)
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thai Ambassador to Rangoon Pensak Chalarak had been informed by
Myanmar's Political Department of the unconditional release of all
53 Thais detained in Myanmar, TNA said.
</P>
<P>
TNA said Surin welcomed the move as a positive gesture of
"growth and new direction" in inter-ASEAN (the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) relations.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's agreement on the release of all Thai prisoners,
mostly held on charges of illegal entry and fishing, followed an
announcement by the Thai government that it would release
prisoners from ASEAN member countries to mark the auspicious
occasion of the king's sixth cycle birthday on December 5.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN prisoners to be released by the Thai government will be
those serving their terms on non-criminal charges, including
illegal entry, overstaying and counterfeiting official documents.
</P>
<P>
Surin has approached all ASEAN members for granting an amnesty
to Thai inmates held in their countries.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Foreign Ministry is also pushing for an agreement with
other ASEAN members on prisoner transfer to allow ASEAN inmates to
serve their remaining terms in their home countries, and it is
planning to later negotiate a similar agreement with non-ASEAN
countries, including Western ones.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> EU Offers Aid to Kosovo Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission -- the
executive body of the 15-nation European Union -- said on Friday
that it had decided on a grant of 1 million euros (1.05 million U.
S. dollars) for the urgent rehabilitation of a Kosovo hospital.
</P>
<P>
The grant will pay for the repairs to the hospital building,
electricity generating and heating equipment, as well as salaries
for both the ethnic Albanian and ethnic Serb staff of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The hospital is located in Mitrovica, northwest of Pristina,
capital of the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
The aid project, according to commission officials, is aimed to
demonstrate the European Union's determination to support public
institutions where Kosovars from different ethnic backgrounds can
work together to provide services for all the people in the
province.
</P>
<P>
The Mitrovica hospital now faces problems such as neglect and
lack of investment, badly degraded buildings and facilities, non-
payment of ethnic Albanian staff and lack of administration.
</P>
<P>
Patients have died on the operating table because of power cuts
while the lack of water has caused deteriorating hygienic
standards in the hospital, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
"The EU can only support Kosovar institutions which are at the
service of all Kosovars," said Marc Franco, chief of the European
Commission's Task Force in the Yugoslav province. "This hospital
must be a place of healing -- both physical and spiritual-- for
all who need it, irrespective of their ethnic group."

<HEADLINE> Tiny Wish of A Chinese Drug Squad Officer (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua)-- Holding tightly to her father's
thigh, the five-year-old girl moaned, "Daddy, please don't leave
me."
</P>
<P>
With tears in his eyes, Shi Fengmin, a stoutly-built drug squad
officer from southwest China's Yunnan Province, could say nothing
but hold his beloved daughter in his arms.
</P>
<P>
He must rush to his outpost -- a truck station in the tropical
forest that separates China and Burma, which is both his office
and dormitory shared with seven other colleagues.
</P>
<P>
"We usually work 18 hours a day, but can only enjoy sunlight
between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. as the trees in the tropical forests
are often dozens of meters high, and block out the light," he said.
</P>
<P>
"When the sunlight becomes dimmer, we inspect the passing
vehicles with electric torches."
</P>
<P>
Shi is one of China's tens of thousands of drug squad officers.
They are equipped with a handgun or semi-automatic gun because
they have to deal with the ruthless and well-armed drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
One day in November of 1996, Shi was in real danger when a drug
smuggler threw a grenade at him after being stopped for routine
inspection.
</P>
<P>
Shi and his colleagues fell to the ground immediately and
narrowly escaped death. After a fierce exchange of fire, one of
the smugglers was wounded and finally caught.
</P>
<P>
Dong Shen, a senior anti-drug officer in Yunnan which borders
the notorious "Golden Triangle", said that during the 1992-1998
period, China's anti-drug forces cracked nearly 47,000 drug-
smuggling cases and confiscated 37,000 kg drugs of all sorts.
</P>
<P>
"Police in Yunnan confiscated more than 80 percent of the
heroin seized in China and some 70 percent of the opium caught in
the country," Dong said. "It's a great contribution to both China
and the world as a whole."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of June this year, the
registered drug addicts of Yunnan have dropped to some 45,000, a
sharp decline from 57,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
However, the success has come at a price. Over the past 10
years, in Yunnan alone 28 officers were killed on duty while
another some 200 officers suffered severe injuries.

<P>
"I can't relax for one minute," Shi said, "because if one
smuggler slips away under my nose, that means hundreds or even
thousands of happy families might be completely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I am attaching too much importance to my work," Shi
began laughing at himself, "because I never know which particular
family I'm protecting. It might be a Chinese family, a Japanese
family or even a British family, who knows?"
</P>
<P>
While most of the world's population stay at home and enjoy
their families, Shi and his seven colleagues have to sleep and
work in a ten square meter packing box in the station for six
months each year.
</P>
<P>
They have no electricity, no amusements, no family letters, and
usually wash their faces once a week as the nearest river is six
miles away.
</P>
<P>
"But on festivals or our birthdays, we do buy fresh vegetables
from a tiny village, about 30 miles from the outpost, and
everybody will enjoy a happy meal." Shi added.
</P>
<P>
"No matter how many hardships I have to sustain in the forests,
I am still a lucky man. I have a wife and a daughter at home, and
that means I have hope."
</P>
<P>
Of his seven colleagues, four have lost their wives because
they were not able to shoulder their responsibilities as husbands
and fathers.
</P>
<P>
"In order to trace a drug dealer at large, one of my colleagues
once sold the only hen of the family to cover traveling expenses,"
Shi said.
</P>
<P>
"The wife begged her husband not to sell the hen as their son
had to pay tuition fees. When she failed to persuaded him, she
left him permanently," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that among Yunnan's 40 million population, some
3.55 million still live below the State-set poverty line of 500
yuan (about 60 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
As a result, the living and working conditions of the province'
s drug squad officers are not expected to be improved considerably
within a foreseeable future, a provincial anti-drug officer said.
</P>
<P>
"I am not able to show enough affection to my daughter and
sometimes she does not even get a phone call from me for months,"
said Shi, his eyes brimming with tears.
</P>
<P>
"But I do have a tiny wish that one day while I am still alive,
I could win an anti-drug medal so that my daughter can be proud of
her father."

<P>
PARIS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said on Thursday that
France will have by 2000 a law on internet as the second great
step for his program to let France enter the information society,
which is marked by making legislation about the ``new public space
'' instead of merely encouraging people to connect to the network.
</P>
<P>
-- In East Timor, three days away from a referendum on
independence, the local population is living in terror. The
militiamen opposed to independence began on Thursday a
demonstration of force in Dili, the capital of East Timor, to
scare the local people with the threat of a new civil war.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac said on Thursday that France
will never accept that a regional organization build itself into a
``holy alliance'' and take actions everywhere. He was referring to
a all powerful NATO while drawing a lesson from the crisis of
Kosovo.He predicted that France will remain a ``strong, happy and
influential'' country.
</P>
<P>
-- Russia and China have agreed to cooperate in fighting ``
international terrorism, separatism and religious extremism''
during the summit meeting between President Boris Yeltsin and
President Jiang Zemin in Bishket this week. Russia is scared by
the threat from Islamists on its southern wing, including Caucasus
and Central Asia.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti POWs Issue to Top Agenda of AL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The issue of the Kuwaiti
prisoners of war (POWs) held in Iraq will top the agenda of the
Arab League (AL) meeting due in Cairo next month, a Kuwaiti
official told a local newspaper published Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The POWs issue will be the main clause of the report by AL
Secretary General Dr. Esmat Abdul Meguid," said Abdul A'L
Al-Qinai, Kuwait's permanent representative to the Cairo-based
AL, in a telephone interview with the Arabic daily Al-Rai
Al-A'am.
</P>
<P>
Qinai said that there has been "constant coordination between
the Kuwaiti permanent representation and other delegations at the
alliance who support this cause."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insists that Iraq is still holding over 600 Kuwaitis and
third country nationals in captivity, an allegation denied by
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has sought various levels to press for the release of
those detainees, who Kuwait said were snatched by Iraqi troops
during Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait in 1990-1991.
</P>
<P>
As the AL foreign ministers' meeting, which is scheduled on
September 12-13, will be chaired by Iraq, the league's rotating
chairman, political observers here are not expecting a result
satisfactory to all concerned parties around such thorny issue
as the POWs problem.

<HEADLINE> Russia Mir Space Station Set to Go Unmanned Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia will effectively stop the
operations of its Mir space station on Friday as the last crew
depart the station which has been in orbit for 13 and a half years.
</P>
<P>
Russian cosmonauts Viktor Afanasyev and Sergei Avdeyev, and
Jean-Pierre Heignere of France will close the docking hatches
connecting Mir with the Soyuz-TM spacecraft at 22:17 Moscow time (
18:17 GMT) and detach from the station at 01:14 Saturday (21:14
GMT Friday), the Interfax news agency reported, quoting Mission
Control near Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The three astronauts are scheduled to land near Arkalyk in
Kazakhstan at 04:30 Moscow time (00:30 GMT) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Six to eight days after that, Mission Control will issue the
final commands to shut off the main computer on Mir and the
gyrodines maintaining the station's pitch and attitude will then
stop turning. The 120-ton station will begin to drift, performing
no practical functions.
</P>
<P>
Only its temperature systems, power, solar panel orientation
and telemetry equipment will continue to operate. The cosmonauts
have deactivated all other service systems.
</P>
<P>
However, these systems can be reactivated by commands from
Mission Control if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that Mir can continue to function for
several more years, but the government has stopped funding the
program due to financial pinch.
</P>
<P>
If no financing for Mir's further operation is found, a final
crew will visit the station and prepare it to fall back to Earth
over a safe area of the Pacific Ocean in February 2000, Interfax
said.
</P>
<P>
Mir was lifted into space on February 20, 1986. Twenty-four
international scientific programs and 17,000 scientific and
technological experiments have been conducted aboard the station.
</P>
<P>
It provided researchers from 15 countries a unique chance to
study space and conduct experiments in zero gravity. The station
carries 11.5 tons of scientific equipment from 27 countries.
</P>
<P>
Mir has also hosted 102 astronauts from other countries,
including the U.S., France, Germany, Austria, Japan, Britain,
Bulgaria, Syria and Afghanistan.

NANNING, August 27 (Xinhua) --Xu Bingsong, former vice chairman
of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regional Government,
was sentenced to life imprisonment today by the Intermediate
People's Court of Nanning City, the regional capital, for the
crime of taking bribes.
</P>

<P>
The 56-year-old Xu, a native of Taishan City, south China's

bribes on May 22, 1998, and was arrested on June 3.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges U.N. to Prevent U.S.-British </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has demanded that the
U.N. Security Council live up to its responsibilities and adopt
necessary measures to prevent the U.S. and British bombardment of
Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In two letters addressed to the U.N. secretary-general and the
president of the Security Council, Iraq's Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said that the U.S. and British warplanes
attacked Iraqi civil targets and service facilities.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf said that the U.S. and British warplanes launched on
August 17 airstrikes against residential areas in northern and
southern Iraq, killing 19 civilians and injuring 11 others, most
of them women and children.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister once again stressed Iraq's firm right to
claim compensation for the damage it has sustained due to the
aggressive acts.
</P>
<P>
The letters said that the U.S. and British warplanes taking
off from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Turkey carried out 11,623
sorties over Iraqi airspace since December 17, 1998 till August
22, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, U.S. and
British warplanes have been regularly attacking Iraqi civilian
facilities and military sites in the no-fly zones, causing severe
civilian casualties and property damage.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from attacks by Iraqi government troops.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Keep Exchange Controls: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said here Friday Malaysia's exchange controls
will stay as the international financial system has yet to be
reformed.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement at a meeting on the Malaysian economy
attended by some 120 top ranking public and private sector
officials including foreign participants here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that in a scenario where the financial system was
still fraught with dangers since unscrupulous currency speculators
have yet to be controlled, he strongly believed that "the bombs
are still falling."
</P>
<P>
"Even if the bombs are not falling, the planes are still
hovering above us. We still have to be very careful," he said.
</P>
<P>
Currency trading is 20 times bigger than world trade in goods
and services, he said, adding "Hedging simply increases the cost
of business, but worst of all currency trading has destroyed whole
economies of nations and regions, destablized them politically and
have caused untold misery for hundreds of millions."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia imposed exchange controls in early September last year
and pegged its ringgit to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 3.80.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Concerned Over Afghan Destruction of Agriculture System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Friday
expressed concern over the alleged systematic destruction of
agriculture infrastructure by Taliban forces in Afghanistan's
Shomali plains.
</P>
<P>
The people displaced during the recent fighting in Shomali
region north of Kabul have reported that the agriculture
infrastructure there "is being systematically destroyed", said
Stephanie Bunker, spokesman for the U.N. Coordinator for
Afghanistan, at a press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
She said the boundary walls around the fields were reportedly
being demolished and irrigation system destroyed.
</P>
<P>
"We are worried about the long-term consequences of this
action," she added.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. official said she was not aware of the extent
of damage being done.
</P>
<P>
Bunker said the claims of the Afghan opposition that some
250,000 people have been displaced from the Shomali plains during
the recent fighting are "exaggerated".
</P>
<P>
She said a five-member U.N. assessment team is currently
visiting northern Afghanistan to evaluate the scale of the
displacement.
</P>
<P>
Afghan Taliban have asked the United Nations not to believe
some reports against the militia and to evaluate the situation in
accordance with the realities.
</P>
<P>
According to international non-governmental organizations in
Afghanistan, the number of displaced people ranges from 60,000 to
75,000.

JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli army is drawing up plans to increase
dramatically the number of women it calls up for reserve duty. The

duty from 24 to 38 and to do away with the exemption that women
receive upon marriage.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel recently prevented a Palestinian attempt to get a
foreign vessel to visit Gaza, as the Palestinians intended to
create a fait accompli emphasizing Gaza's status as an
international harbor. Meanwhile, construction on a new Gaza port
is scheduled to start in October, as part of the implementation of
the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- According to a public opinion poll published by Yediot
Aharonot, acting Likud Party chairman Ariel Sharon would win
the elections for the party's leadership, if the elections were
held today. The poll shows that 50 percent of the Likud members
would vote for Sharon, while other candidates could not get more
than 30 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite the threats from the religious party in his
coalition government, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said
Thursday that he had no intention to intervene in the affair over
moving a giant turbine on this Shabbat. The United Torah Judaism
Party has threatened that it would leave the coalition government
if the transportation went ahead on Friday night.

<HEADLINE> 621 Rescued in Ruins after Earthquake in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A total of 621 people have been
rescued since the killer earthquake occurred in western Turkey on
August 17, the Prime Ministry Crisis Administration Center
announced Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The center said that the death toll of the massive quake, with
a magnitude of 7.4, has risen to 13,040 and 26,630 others were
injured.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that tens of thousands of people are missing or
believed to be still buried under the rubble.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local Daily News reported Friday that both
construction and legal experts warned that the authorities who
have ordered the removal of quake-demolished buildings are
committing a crime by destroying evidence against crooked
contractors and builders.
</P>
<P>
They said that if the debris are removed, all evidence of
malpractice by contractors will be lost, and no one will be able
to claim compensation or press charges against the builders.
</P>
<P>
Many Turks claim that the high death toll is in part due to
shoddy construction by contractors who paid off officials to
ignore building codes.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit has said that
40,000-50,000 prefabricated homes would be needed in the next
couple of months and that building permanent replacements would
probably take a year to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Turkish government and private companies have launched a
campaign to call for donations for the quake survivors and to
rebuild the areas.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Threatens to Cut Aid to Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch government has
threatened to stop financial aid to Uganda if the latter's
government does not cut its defense expenditure.
</P>
<P>
This warning was issued by Dutch Minister of Development and
Cooperation Evelin Herfkens here Thursday, according to the New
Vision paper Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who finished her short visit to Uganda Thursday,
told reporters that the Dutch government has signed an agreement
with Uganda to provide aid on condition that the latter's military
expenditure is slashed.
</P>
<P>
If the Ugandan government fails to meet its obligations as said
in the agreement, the Dutch government would definitely stop its
planned aid to this east African country, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said her government would lobby the European Union to stop
military aid to developing countries to bring peace in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch government has approved 38 million U.S. dollars in
aid for Uganda, the minister disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's defense expenditure hiked dramatically due to its
military involvement in the armed conflict in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, the biggest stumbling block for it to get
fund from donors.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Egyptian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Egyptian newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt denied Thursday it was launching a mediation bid to
resume talks on the Syrian-Israeli track, which were stalled in
1996.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt does not arrange meetings between the two parties. We
clearly back Syria's stand seeking a just and comprehensive peace
through the Madrid peace conference items of reference and the
land-for-peace formula," said Osama el-Baz, President Hosni
Mubarak's political advisor.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Thursday a
pan-Arab summit was possible despite some countries' attempts to
put it off. "I can not say there is obstruction (of the summit)
but there are some attempts to delay it," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders met last time in 1996 in Cairo to reaffirm
commitment to peace as a strategic option. Any future summit is
also expected to address developments of the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- An Egyptian diplomat did not rule out a tripartite summit
meeting between Mubarak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Bassyouni, Egypt's ambassador to Israel, told the
Middle East News Agency Thursday that such a summit was possible
after the Palestinians and the Israelis sign a memorandum of
understanding over the long-overdue implementation of the Wye
accord.
</P>
<P>
"Such a summit can not take place before the two parties end
their talks and iron out their outstanding differences over the
implementation of the accord," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Representatives of the Sudanese government and an opposition
alliance will meet in Cairo on September 13 to prepare peace talks
in Sudan, a Libyan diplomat has said.
</P>
<P>
"The upcoming preparatory delegation meeting in Cairo ... will
lay the basis for the national dialog conference," said Suleiman
al-Shahoumi, a leader of the Libyan part in an Egyptian-Libyan
team trying to end Sudan's 16-year-old civil war.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Shareholding Companies Exceed 230,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China's shareholding companies
maintained an upbeat development momentum in the first half this
year, with their number climbing to more than 230,000.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce show that from January to June, the number of
shareholding corporations increased by some 20,000, or 9.2 percent,
from the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
By June, the registered capital of Chinese shareholding
enterprises had exceeded 137 billion yuan (16.5 billion US dollars)
, up nearly 20 percent over the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
An official with the administration attributed the increased
number to the government's preferential policies and the
successful restructuring of many state-owned and collectively
owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The increase in numbers and capital reveal that through the
reform of state-owned enterprises, the enterprises' capital was
reorganized and more rationally utilized, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Posts Higher Industry Production Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Value of production and net sales
for total manufacturing of the Philippines increased by 2.3
percent and 2.0 percent respectively in June 1999 compared with a
year ago, the National Statistics Office said Friday in a report.
</P>
<P>

report.
</P>
<P>
Year-on-year increases of production value were observed in 8

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Peso Faces Depreciation Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The depreciation trend of the
Philippine peso starting early July became more apparent this week
with the local currency dipping nearly to the psychological level
of 40-pesos-to-one-U.S.-dollar.
</P>
<P>
Analysts blamed both internal and external factors to the
recent depreciation of the country's currency, which has recovered
from last year's unprecedented low level of 45 pesos against the
greenback to 37-39 pesos level since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Local traders said the most important internal factor for the
peso's depreciation is the country's low interest policy, which
increases liquidity of the local currency while decreasing its
value against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the year, the Central Bank of the
Philippines has cut the country's overnight rates as much as 20
times in a bid to bring down the cost of bank lending and boost
credit demand of corporations.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's overall 437.5 basis points' cut brought the
overnight borrowing rate from 13.375 percent to 9 percent while
bringing the overnight lending rate to 11 percent from 15.375
percent.
</P>
<P>
By increasing liquidity in the country's monetary system, the
rate-cut move contributed much to the depreciation of the
Philippine peso.
</P>
<P>
To increase the liquidity of the local currency, the central
bank also trimmed down the commercial banks' mandatory reserve
requirement on deposits from 15 percent to 12 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that one percentage point reduction of the
reserve requirement will release as much as 10 billion pesos (250
million U.S. dollars) to the local financial system.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the central bank implemented another scheme to lower
the actual overnight lending interest rate: It pays 9 percent for
the first half of banks' overnight placements, and 8 percent for
the second half.
</P>
<P>
Traders said this scheme, designed to discourage banks to
deposit their money in the central bank's vaults and push them to
lend more to corporations, increased further the liquidity of the
local currency.
</P>
<P>
Another major internal factor attributable to the depreciation
of the peso is the recent unstable political situation in the
country which worried local and foreign traders.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the re-emergence of cronyism, sour relationship
between the government and the press, talks of the Charter change
and friction between different economic authorities are making
investors jittery.
</P>
<P>
Among the political factors, the most important one is the
so-called Charter-change issue.
</P>
<P>
On August 20, protesters rallied nationwide to oppose attempts
by Philippine President Joseph Estrada to amend the country's
12-year-old Constitution.
</P>
<P>
While stressing that the Charter changes would merely remove
restriction on foreign investment and denying charges he might use
them to extend his term in office, Estrada maintained that no
protests would stop his plans.
</P>
<P>
The Charter-change dispute scared foreign investors who are
preparing to wrap-up their dollars and leave the country in case
of political disorder.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the external factors that attributed to the
depreciation of the Philippine peso include the regional situation
and the interests hike in the United States.
</P>
<P>
As one treasurer of the local market said, fears of a Chinese
yuan devaluation and problems in India and Pakistan are making
Asian markets not a very good place to invest in the near term.
</P>
<P>
On August 24, the U.S. Federal Reserve lifted the federal funds
rate for overnight loans between banks to 5.25 percent from 5
percent and moved the discount rate up to 4.75 percent from 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The rates hike of the U.S. together with the low interest rates
policy of the Philippines prompted "asset shifting," as fund
managers converted their holding into dollars which carried more
attractive yields.
</P>
<P>
However, Rafael Buenaventura, governor of the central bank,
said the value of the peso would not breach the
40-pesos-to-one-dollar psychological level even as the local
currency continued to depreciate these days.
</P>
<P>
He said the decline of the peso was a "temporary aberration"
because the country's economy is "on track", adding that the
balance of payments (BOP) and the current account (CA) were in
surplus and would support a stable peso.
</P>
<P>
Based on recently released figures, the BOP and the CA
surpluses of the country are 3.2 billion dollars and 1.7 billion
dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, corporate demand for dollars would still be
lacking in the near future because manufacturers are still bent on
using all up their inventories for production.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Buenaventura said, the central bank has many kinds
of measures to protect the local currency.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the central bank can raise bank reserve
requirements from the present 12-percent mark to burn speculators
if the Financial Department refused to raise the treasury bill
rates.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Airways Attains Y2K Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Airways and its cargo
handling subsidiary, Kenya Air-flight Handling Limited, will be
fully Y2K compliant by the end of August, according to airline
officials.
</P>
<P>
"The scope of compliance include system and equipment at the
airline's head office and all the out stations within the Kenya
Airways global network," Koome Mwambia, the carrier's public
relations manager, said in the capital Nairobi Thursday.
</P>
<P>
All the information technology systems and software for
reservation, departure control, flight operations, and revenue
and financial accounting will be ready by August 31, said Paul
Muinde, head of information technology at the airline's head
office.
</P>
<P>
The potential Year 2000 (Y2K) computer glitch is a software
problem caused by coding shortcuts in older programs which may
lead them to confuse January 1 of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Airways spent 60 million shillings (some one million U.S.
dollars) on new information technology equipment and software
replacement during the April 1998 - March 1999 period, the Daily
Nation newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mwambia said that the airline's two aircraft suppliers, Airbus
 Industries and the Boeing Co. had already issued their Y2K status
reports and confirmed the entire Kenya Airways fleet was
Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Airways now operates a fleet of four Airbus A310-300,
four Boeing 737-300 and two Boeing 737-200 aircraft.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- India's external debt
increased to 98.23 billion U.S. dollars at the end of March 1999
from 94.32 billion U.S. dollars in the same period last year,
according to the Reserve Bank of India.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the major source of increase in external debt
during the 1998-1999 fiscal year was under commercial borrowing,
particularly on account of Resurgent India Bonds.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of concessional debt to total debt continued its
declining trend, falling from 39.2 percent at the end of March
1998 to 37.9 percent at the end of March 1999. Short-term debt
declined to 4.33 billion U.S. dollars at the end of March 1999
from 5.05 billion U.S. dollars at the end of March 1998 or to 4.4
percent of total external debt from 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the year, the overall balance of payments recorded a
surplus of 4.22 billion U.S. dollars (1 percent of Gross Domestic
Product) for the third year in succession as against 4.51 billion
U.S. dollars during 1997-98.

<HEADLINE> Another 29 Pro-Israeli Militiamen Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Military Tribunal
Thursday night gave 29 former pro-Israeli militiamen prison terms
ranging from six months to two years for collaboration with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The sentences raised to 92 the number of former South Lebanon
Army (SLA) members who have stood trial since the militia withdrew
from the Jezzine area in June.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong SLA, which was established in 1985, is
trained and armed by Israel to help patrol its occupied border
zone.
</P>
<P>
Jezzine, just north of the border zone, has been policed by the
SLA since the security zone was established.
</P>
<P>
The convicts are among the 220 militiamen who voluntarily
surrendered to the authorities after the SLA withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Of the 92 militiamen put on trial, 83 have received jail terms
of three months to two years.
</P>
<P>
Another nine have been acquitted or had their cases dropped
because they were elderly.
</P>
<P>
But, relatives of the militiamen complained that the sentences
are too harsh although they have been considered by the
authorities more lenient than the seven-year sentences proposed by
the indictments.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawers have argued that the defendants were victims of
circumstances, not traitors, who joined the militia under duress
or financial straits.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Economy Posts 2.9 Pct Growth in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines posted a 2.4
percent growth in gross domestic product (GDP) and 2.9 percent
growth in gross national product (GNP) respectively in the first
semester of 1999, the Philippine government said Friday in a
report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report released by the National Statistical
Cooperation Board, the GNP and GDP grew by 3.8 percent and 3.6
percent respectively in the second quarter, "twice stronger than
the first quarter's 2 percent and 1.2 percent."
</P>
<P>
GNP is the value of goods and services produced by the economy,
including income from abroad, while GDP is GNP minus overseas
income.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the good performance of the economy
mainly to the 6.6 percent growth rate of the combined agriculture,
fishery and forestry sector as a result of the predominantly rainy
weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
The services sector continued its positive run, although at a
slightly slower pace compared with last year, with a 3.5 percent
growth for this semester, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The industry sector, on the other hand, contracted even further
relative to the same period of last year with a negative growth
rate of 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the expenditure side, only personal consumption expenditure
and government consumption expenditure registered positive growth.
</P>
<P>
Exports of goods and services in real peso prices posted growth
during the second quarter but was not enough to buffer its decline
during the first quarter, as it shrank by 5.4 percent for the
whole semester, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Imports of goods and services in real peso prices also grew by
0.4 percent during the second quarter but was not adequate to
offset its reduction during the first quarter. Hence it declined
by 11.2 percent in the first semester of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Felipe Medalla, secretary of the Social Economic Planning
Department, said that based on these figures, he is confident that
the country could post the whole year growth targets of 3.0-3.7
percent in GNP and 2.6-3.2 percent in GDP.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda allegedly Plans Fresh Attack on Kisangani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- More Rwandan troops are being
flown to Kisangani in eastern part of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo to prepare for fresh attacks on the third largest city
of the country.
</P>
<P>
A contingent of more than 3,000 Rwandan soldiers will be added
to its force based in the city, the New Vision daily reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan troops want to attack Ugandan armed forces there
and control the whole city of Kisangani, rebel leader Wamba dia
Wamba was quoted as claiming here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan and Ugandan troops, together with factions of the rebel
RCD group they respectively support, clashed in the city for four
days last week. The fighting came to a halt after leaders of the
two countries met and agreed to stop it.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, both factions of the split rebel group the
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) agreed to jointly sign the
Lusaka ceasefire agreement to put to an end to the year-old armed
conflict in the Congo.
</P>
<P>
They failed to endorse it in Zambia on July 10 due to internal
wrangles over the leadership issue.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister NKosazana Zuma, who shuttled
between Kigali and Kampala last weekend, recently said that the
peace process in the Congo can still be long even after all the
rebel groups in the Congo sign the peace pact.

<HEADLINE> Wool Production in New Zealand Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Wool production in New
Zealand has declined sharply in the current season following
droughts of the past two summers and the continuing decline in
sheep numbers, the New Zealand Wool Group said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Production for the season is expected to be close to the
original forecast of 188,300 tons, a decline of four percent from
the previous season, it said in a media release.
</P>
<P>
Initial estimates are for a slight recovery in the next season
to about 190,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Adjusted for inflation and exchange rates, New Zealand's wool
prices are falling at a rate of three percent a year.
</P>
<P>
"This reflects the productivity gain in the synthetic fiber
industry" in the world, it said. The Group also predicted wool
prices in world markets are not expected to improve significantly
in the short-term.
</P>
<P>
China remains New Zealand's largest single market for raw wool.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Wine Exports Keep Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's wine exports in
past 12 months are estimated to be worth 120 million NZ dollars
(62.4 million U.S. dollars), the Wellington-based newspaper
Dominion reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This growth should continue with exports estimated to be worth
275 million NZ dollars (143 million U.S. dollars) by the year
2003," N.Z. Wine Institute chief executive Philip Gregan was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 40 new wineries have set up in the past year, bringing
the number in New Zealand up to more than 320, he said.
</P>
<P>
The average return from wine exports is around 7.5 NZ dollars
(3.9 U.S. dollars) a liter which is up about one NZ dollar (0.52
U.S. dollars) on last year.
</P>
<P>
Some of this profit increase reflects the lower New Zealand
dollar, but it also reflects the increasing exports of higher
value product, Gregan said.
</P>
<P>
"The trend of increasing value has been clear for the past
decade, and we expect it to continue," he added.
</P>
<P>
The three key markets for New Zealand's wine are Britain, the
United States and Australia, he said.

<P>
WELLINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley issued a statement here Friday, describing Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's state visit to her country from September
13 to 16 as a "milestone" for New Zealand, as "it is the
first-ever visit by a People's Republic of China's Head of state
to New Zealand."
</P>
<P>
"China is an increasingly important influence in our region.
New Zealand links with China are growing and the president's visit
symbolizes the beginning of a new period of development in the
relationship," she said.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said trade between China and New Zealand has grown
rapidly in recent years with annual two-way merchandise trade now
reaching 1,828 million NZ dollars (about 1,000 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
"This makes China our sixth largest export market and fifth
largest trading partner, exports and imports combined," she said.
</P>
<P>
While New Zealand's exports to China have traditionally been
dominated by wool, its recent trade performance has seen a
widening range of products exported, Shipley said.
</P>
<P>
She added that in the next few years, services exports are also
likely to expand rapidly, specialist in the fields of consultancy,
aviation services, tourism and education.
</P>
<P>
She disclosed that during his stay in the country, President
Jiang will meet with New Zealand business leaders, have official
talks with the New Zealand Government, meet Chinese migrants and
visit a farm and a secondary school.
</P>
<P>
"Recent visits to the People's Republic of China by me and my
colleagues have shown us that New Zealand must grasp the
opportunities which this visit presents," Shipley said.

</P>
<P>
Akhtaruzzaman Chowdhury Babu, who was also the industry and
commerce secretary of the BAL and one of the accused in a murder
case, occupied the head office of the United Commercial Bank
Limited after ousting members of the board of directors at gun
point, directors and senior officials of the bank were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the directors were forced to tender their resignation
at gun point. Zafar Ahmed Chowdhury, chairman of the bank, said he
was asked at gun point to put his signature on the paper which
both Akhtaruzzamn Chowdhury and his men termed as "resignation
letter."
</P>
<P>
The bank has 79 branches throughout the country with a deposit
of 11 billion taka (about 220 million U.S. dollars) and more than
2,500 employees and officials, according to Zafar Ahmed Chowdhury.
</P>
<P>
The eight directors were discussing matters of the bank at a
meeting which was also attended by two government representatives
and Akhtaruzzaman Chowdhury Babu when about 50 policemen and 50
armed supporters broke into the board room and forced the
directors to resign, the directors said.
</P>
<P>
"I am the chairman and I will preside over the meeting,"
Akhtaruzzaman Chowdhury Babu was reported as saying. He lost his
position as the bank chairman five years ago on charge of
irregularities at the directive of the Bangladesh Bank, the
country's central bank, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> hke082717-Jiang Zemin's Upcoming NZ Trip Described as "Milestone" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley issued a statement here Friday, describing Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's state visit to her country from September
13 to 16 as a "milestone" for New Zealand, as "it is the
first-ever visit by a People's Republic of China's Head of state
to New Zealand."
</P>
<P>
"China is an increasingly important influence in our region.
New Zealand links with China are growing and the president's visit
symbolizes the beginning of a new period of development in the
relationship," she said.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said trade between China and New Zealand has grown
rapidly in recent years with annual two-way merchandise trade now
reaching 1,828 million NZ dollars (about 1,000 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
"This makes China our sixth largest export market and fifth
largest trading partner, exports and imports combined," she said.
</P>
<P>
While New Zealand's exports to China have traditionally been
dominated by wool, its recent trade performance has seen a
widening range of products exported, Shipley said.
</P>
<P>
She added that in the next few years, services exports are also
likely to expand rapidly, especially in the fields of consultancy,
aviation services, tourism and education.
</P>
<P>
She disclosed that during his stay in the country, President
Jiang will meet with New Zealand business leaders, have official
talks with the New Zealand Government, meet Chinese migrants and
visit a farm and a secondary school.
</P>
<P>
"Recent visits to the People's Republic of China by me and my
colleagues have shown us that New Zealand must grasp the
opportunities which this visit presents," Shipley said.

million dollars up to June 1998, sources were quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Industrial Growth Rate Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's industrial growth rate
slowed down to 10.3 percent in the first eight months of this
year, down 1.7 percent from the same period last year, Vietnam's
English daily Vietnam News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's industrial growth rate in August represents a fall of
0.4 percent from July, according to Vietnam's General Department
of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-invested enterprises, which account for about 35
percent of the total industrial output, are expected to grow 19.9
percent in August, down 1.2 percent from the growth rate recorded
in the first seven months this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the State-owned sector's industrial output increased
by only 4.5 percent, a drop of 0.1 percent from the growth rate
recorded in the first seven months this year, reflecting poor
management, outdated production methods and overemployment that
plague Vietnam's state companies.
</P>
<P>
The figures for state-owned enterprises, which account for 43
percent of Vietnam's industrial value, gave fresh evidence that
the industry of the country is losing steam.
</P>
<P>
The non-state sector's industrial output grew 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one out of 33 industrial products posted increases in
the first eight months this year.
</P>
<P>
They include crude oil, 22.5 percent; processed marine produce,
14.2 percent; sugar, 28.5 percent; knitted products, 2.5 percent;
garments, 13 percent; paper, 9 percent; fertilizers, 13 percent;
automobiles, 16.3 percent; and bicycles, 23.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Products that fell include coal, down 22.3 percent; laminated
steel, 7.4 percent; machine tools, 17.7 percent; silk, 1.9
percent; detergent, 16.6 percent; medicines, 3 percent; and
pesticide, 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output accounts for 32 percent of Vietnam's gross
domestic product and agriculture 27 percent, with the rest made up
by the service sector.

JAKARTA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Swimming
Association (PRSI) plans to hold a centralized training camp in
January at Bali Cliff Resort in Bali as part of its preparation
for the Olympics Games in Sydney next year.
</P>
<P>
PRSI chairman Rahardi Ramelan said that he would invite an

PRSI was satisfied with the results of its five-week stint in
Australia before competing in the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Recruit Best Athletes For SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) has set the 2000 National Games (PON) as the arena
to recruit athletes for centralized training in its strategy to
regain the overall medal titles at the 2001 Southeast Asian (SEA)
Games.
</P>
<P>
The council's chief of athletes development Mochammad Hindarto
said that it was following its example in 1997, when sports
organizations recruited PON winners for the Games.
</P>
<P>
"After PON, sports organizations can recruit 200 athletes to be
prepared for the SEA Games. With nearly 18 months to prepare the
athletes, I believe we can groom them maximally in order heal our
wounds from only finishing third in the 1999 Games," he was quoted
by The Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's unexpectedly poor showing was its worst since first
competing in the SEA Games 22 years ago. It won only 44 golds,
compared to the 65 golds of Thailand and 57 of Malaysia,
previously the perennial third-place finisher.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia bagged 147 golds and Thailand took 77 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"After the 1996 PON, sports organizations and KONI recruited
the athletes to be groomed for the 1997 Games for about nine
months. The results were really satisfactory," said Hindarto, the
chef de mission in the 1999 Games.
</P>
<P>
"This year we only had three months to prepare the athletes for
the Games," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto said funding constraints remained the major obstacle
to organizing long-term training for the country's athletes.
</P>
<P>
"It's really a disparity for us compared to Malaysia, which is
spending nearly 28.2 million U.S. dollars to support the Malaysia
Gemilang (Malaysia Shines) project to win the 2001 Games title
before its own public. The Malaysian government has even prepared
the budget to support the Malaysia Boleh (Malaysia Can) project to
fulfill its ambition to host the 2006 Asian Games and improve its
ranking in the quadrennial event," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto said the council's funds of 5.5 billion rupiah (723,
700 U.S. dollars) from the National Development and Planning Board
and another 4.5 billion rupiah from the Gelora Senayan Management
Board was only sufficient to pay to send the contingent to the SEA
Games in Brunei Darussalam two weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Still Lags Behind in Y2K Preparations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Most computer systems in the
Indonesian government agencies and enterprises were yet to be

National Institute of Administration (LAN) said.
</P>
<P>
The research institute said that 72 percent of computer systems
in different state institutions remained unprepared for the
expected changes, commonly known as Y2K.
</P>
<P>
But head of LAN's Y2K team Jafar Basri said that major agencies
like national air carrier Garuda Indonesia, state-owned
electricity company PT PLN, state oil and gas company Pertamina,
Bank Indonesia, state-owned telecommunications company PT Telkom
and airport management firm PT Angkasa Pura were expected to be
fully prepared in September.
</P>
<P>
According to The Jakarta Post Friday, the World Bank-funded
survey covered 90 percent of all organization units in central and
provincial administrations. It found that 72 percent of 352
critical systems were not Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
The survey painted a dimmer picture for health services, public
administration and some transportation sectors.
</P>
<P>
In the health sector, most computer systems would fail if they
continued in their present state. The situation could lead to
hospital machinery becoming inoperable and garbled date on the
condition of patients.
</P>
<P>
In public services, a breakdown in the system would cause
inefficiency with work being switched to manual operations.
</P>
<P>
Y2K refers to problems computerized systems will face at the
turn of the century, when their two-digit-year counters fail to
distinguish between 1900 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
The glitch may cause computers to shut down or fail to function
properly. Then, power supplies may drop, telephones and
transportation systems may stop operation and automated banking
transactions may fail.

founding of New China in 1949, has grown into a leading industry
accounting for over six percent of the country's GDP, ranking
fourth after industry, agriculture and commerce.
</P>
<P>
In 1949 the construction sector created only 1.1 percent of
China's total national income. Through 50 years of growth, the
sector has recorded an annual output value totaling 1.006 trillion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Construction projects were impressive and wide-ranging during
the country's first Five-Year Plan period (1953-1957) period,
during which a total of 595 large and medium-sized projects were
launched in this time, including the building or rebuilding of
approximately 10,000 kilometers of railways and 250,000 km of
highways. The capital's ten major construction projects were
completed in just ten months, with an overall floor space totaling
673,000 sq m. This marked an auspicious beginning in China's
history of construction.
</P>
<P>
But the burgeoning sector suffered serious setbacks during the
three-year Great Leap Forward, which began in 1958, and also in
the decade of turmoil during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to
1976.
</P>
<P>
In 1978 construction resumed its momentum when China adopted
the reform and opening-up policy. In 1983 the country introduced
the concept of competition into the industry by initiating the
bidding system, thus marking a transfer from the planned economy
to the market economy. The sector reported a total output value of
105.3 billion yuan the same year, or 1.4 times that of 1976.
</P>
<P>
In the 20 years since the introduction of reform and opening-up
policies, China has completed numerous key projects, including the
Daya Bay and Qinshan nuclear power plants, Beijing-Kowloon Railway
and the conservancy project on the Huaihe River, the Yangtze
Petrochemical Project, the Second-Phase Project of Baoshan Steel
Complex in Shanghai, the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan Expressway, the
great Nanpu and Yangpu suspension bridges in Shanghai, and the
expansion project of Beijing Capital Airport.

<P>
In addition, notable undertakings such as the Three Gorges
Project and the Beijing-Shenzhen Expressway are underway.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 China adopted its first Construction Law, which has
further increased control and supervision of the nation's
construction markets.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 China completed housing with a total 657 million sq m
in floor space and paid to the state coffers 30.19 billion yuan in
taxes.
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of reform and opening-up, the nation
also has actively explored the overseas construction markets. In
1979 it signed contracts and agreements with more than 100
countries and regions, with contract volumes topping 51.17 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
China signed 8,442 building contracts and agreements with 181
countries and regions in 1997, amounting to more than 11.3 billion
US dollars, or some 60 times the figure for 1980.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country's overseas construction operations have
greatly sharpened its competitive edge in the world construction
markets, and have extended from real estate to metallurgy, ports,
power plants, petrochemical projects, machinery manufacturing and
water conservancy.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Condemns International Tribunal's Kidnapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia said Thursday it was
angry with the Austrian police over the kidnapping of Momir Talic,
Chief of the General Staff of the Bosnian Serb Army.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Foreign Ministry demanded Talic's immediate release,
who is now being held by the International Criminal Tribunal for
Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague, Holland.
</P>
<P>
Talic was arrested in Vienna Wednesday when he was attending a
military conference on the Bosnia issue presided over by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). He was
not aware that he had been secretly indicted for war crimes
against humanity by the ICTY.
</P>
<P>
"This unprecedented trick, reminiscent of the dark era of the
inquisition of the Middle Ages and not of a Europe on the
threshold of the third millennium, was carried out with the
assistance of Austria," a ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry said that as host of an international conference,
the Austrian government should have guaranteed the safety of every
person in attendance and turned down the arrest plan, which has
caused an irretrievable political loss to the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapping of Talic is wrong in regard to the European
security and cooperation or international relations and law, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade also said that the ICTY had been an accomplice in the
anti-Serb policy of the United States and other Western countries.
The ICTY took action in a systematic and planned way to damage the
interests of the Serbian people in Bosnia and Croatia, while
turning a deaf ear to anti-Serb crimes in Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
The ICTY's "criminal behavior violates the basis of the Dayton
peace process and stifles the reawakening of trust between
entities in Bosnia-Herzegovina," the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Fire Emergency Declared in 4 Californian Counties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 26 (Xinhua) -- California Governor Gray
Davis on Thursday declared fire emergencies in four counties and
ordered the national guard to help firefighters contain wildfires.
</P>
<P>
"All state firefighting resources have been deployed to combat
27 major blazes" that have consumed 121,000 acres of grass, brush
and timber across the West, Davis said, declaring emergencies in
Tehama, Butte, Tuolumne and Shasta counties, all in northern
California.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports from the fire-fighting areas say that about 11,
000 firefighters using at least 750 fire engines are battling
blazes in California, Nevada, Oregon, Montana, Washington and
Idaho. They were supported by at least 104 helicopters and more
than 20 air tankers.
</P>
<P>
Federal firefighters have requested help from as far away as
North Dakota and Tennessee, according to Katy Coulter, U.S. Forest
Service spokeswoman.

"The situation is escalating and it's getting to the point
where we are concerned about being able to respond to all the
fires adequately," said Janelle Smith of the National Interagency
Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cow Festival Being Observed in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The traditional Gaijatra (Cow
Festival) is being observed in the Kathmandu Valley and some other
places in the country amidst fun, gaiety, humor, satire and
entertainment, the official RSS news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The festival beginning on the first day of the waning moon of
Bhadra (April of Nepal year) will last for a week.
</P>
<P>
During this time, people of all ages in the guise of cows and
lunatics will go round the city wearing odd costumes to
commemorate those who died in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Family members of those who died during the past year offer
fruits, bread, beaten rice, curd and money to those participating
in the procession including the cows.
</P>
<P>
The festival is believed to have started during the reign of
King Pratap Malla (in the 16th century) who, in a bid to appease
his queen much grieved at the death of her son in smallpox
epidemic, ordered his people to organize humor and satire programs
in various comic postures.
</P>
<P>
This tradition has been given continuity in the form of the
Gaijatra festival during which people also give vent to pent-up
feeling towards social and political anomalies, human follies and
other contemporary affairs through comic skits, cartoons and the
like.

CARACAS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Oil ministers from Venezuela,

<HEADLINE> Ecuador to Defer Interest Payment of Brady Bonus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadorian government
announced Thursday that it will defer payment for 30 days on 96
million U.S. dollars in "Brady bonus" interest in an attempt to
restructure the country's foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadorian President Jamil Mahuad said in a televised address
Thursday that the government is deferring the interest payment on
Brandy bonds which is due August 28. He noted that the country's
economic situation has worsened amid a financial crisis, effects
of the "El Nino" weather phenomenon and low oil prices at the
start of the year.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and foreign banks have
expressed support for Ecuador's plan to restructure its 5.9
billion dollars in Brady debts, the president said.
</P>
<P>
During the 30 days in which the payment of interest is deferred,
Ecuador will also seek a restructuring of its exterior debt of 16
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The value of Ecuador's Brady bonuses registered a fall of 24
percent in the United States' stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's discount and par Brady, totaling 3.1 billion dollars,
are backed by U.S. Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
The Brady plan, named after former U.S. Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, was introduced in the 1980s to swap billions of
dollars in defaulted Latin American bank debt with bonds that were
partially backed by U.S. zero coupon bonds.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- When Hadxa, a Kazak woman in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, left the
nomadic life 10 years ago and turned to business, something her
ethnic group had despised for generations, none of her relatives
understood her.
</P>
<P>
A decade later, however, Hadxa has two shops and two trucks and
has turned out to be one of the richest Kazaks.
</P>
<P>
Kazaks used to be proud of the fact that there were no Kazaks
involved in business, she says, but things have completely changed
and business people are about as common as herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
The Kazak are one of China's 56 ethnic groups, with a
population of about 1.11 million, the majority of them in Xinjiang.
They have their own language with a script based on Arabic. They
used to call themselves "people who live on horseback" and engaged
in animal husbandry and mostly led a nomadic life. Many of their
proverbs and sayings were sprinkled with expressions like "Kazaks
raise sheep, not sell them", showing how they stuck to their
traditional way of life.

national conference on technological development here on Thursday,
said there need to be more concrete ways to implement the country'
s strategy of revitalization through science and education.
</P>
<P>
Zhu asked Party and government departments and scientists to
work with a sense of urgency and greet the new century with new
developments because increasing and industrializing technological
developments has a direct bearing on China's status and

<P>
The reform and opening up policies in China over the past two
decades changed all that. Official statistics show more than 60
percent of them have ended their nomadic life and settled down and
increasing numbers are involved in business, tourism, transport,
and various industries.
</P>
<P>
Kazaks have joined other local people in some 1,000 farm
produce markets that sell as many as a million sheep every year
and a large number of settlements have schools, hospitals, and
public utilities in pastoral areas, replacing herdsmen's tents.
</P>
<P>
Those who still live on animal husbandry now raise sheep and
cattle in pens provided with electricity and water supplies. One
of them, Kamabay, even built a house for his cattle because
temperatures can drop as low as 52 degrees below zero centigrade
in winter in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
He also has a fodder grinder, a hay cutter, and tractor and,
thanks to all these, his cattle seldom die of hunger, disease, or
the cold and he plans to turn his ranch into one of the largest in
the country.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Xinjiang animal husbandry department says
that by the year 2000, some 80 percent of the Kazaks will have
come down off their horses and the nomadic life of years gone by
will exist only in the memories of Kazaks in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Nobel Prize Laureate Lauds China's Science, Technology Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- As for the achievements made in
China for the past 50 years, what strikes Nobel Physics Prize
laureate Chen-Ning Yang the most, as he said, is the progress in
the field of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Professor Yang, former director of the Theoretical Physics
Department of the State University of New York at Stony Brook,
told Xinhua in a recent interview that "China's history of science
and technology was a blank paper in the 1920s." "Soon after the
founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, science and
technology began to develop in a remarkably fast way," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Yang pointed to the successful tests of nuclear and hydrogen
bombs and the development of rocket and satellite technologies in
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
"Such accomplishments required the efforts of tens of thousands
of scientists and skilled workers," he said, adding that it is
unprecedented that so many qualified personnel were trained in a
short period of 15 years.
</P>
<P>
"Such an achievement is unprecedented even in the world history
of science and technology," said Yang, who shared the Nobel Prize
in 1957 with his friend and colleague Tsung-Dao Lee, another
Chinese American, for their penetrating investigation of the so-
called parity laws which has led to important discoveries
regarding the elementary particles.
</P>
<P>
In the years of reform and openness in China, new developments
have taken place, and there is a substantial increase of the
number of people receiving higher education, which laid a
foundation for further scientific and technological progress, Yang
said.
</P>
<P>
He drew attention to the growing funds the Chinese government
has been allocating for the science and technology education and
research in an effort to meet the needs of the country's
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old scientist also paid tribute to the Chinese
Communist Party for its "great contributions" to China's
reunification and construction and its international status.
</P>
<P>
Yang was born in 1922 when Chinese warlords were in tangled
fight with each other all over the country. He was encouraged to
study mathematics and physics by his father, a prominent
mathematics teacher.
</P>
<P>
After graduation in China, he was awarded a scholarship for
studying abroad. In 1945 he entered the University of Chicago,
where he received his doctorate in physics in 1948. The following
year he was named a member of the Institute for Advanced Study at
Princeton, N.J., and became a full professor there in 1955.
</P>
<P>
Yang recalled what he saw in the early years of his life. There
was no electric light in his native town of Hefei, capital of the
eastern Chinese province of Anhui. The situation was even worse in
many other parts of China, he said.
</P>
<P>
When he first returned to China in 1971, Yang was deeply
impressed by what happened there in the 26 years of his stay
overseas. Yang was named as one of the first foreign academicians
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in June, 1994. He was given the
1995 China International Science and Technology Cooperation Award.
</P>
<P>
As the biggest developing country, China has won international
recognition for its due status, noted Yang, who joined many
international figures in believing that China would score greater
achievements in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Yang, though in retirement since May this year, is still
following with keen interest the development in science and
technology both in the world and in China. He is now helping China
's Qinghua University to build a high-level academic center.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Timber Exports Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chile earned 917.5 million U.S.
dollars through timber exports in the first half of this year, an
increase of 6.1 percent over the same period in 1998, Chile's
National Forest Corporation (CONAF) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which consumed 23.4 percent of Chile's total
timber exports, was the largest importer of Chilean timber. It was
followed by Japan and China, which took 13.8 and 7.2 percent of
the country's timber exports respectively, said a CONAF report.
</P>
<P>
Other major importers of Chilean timber included South Korea,
Belgium and Argentina, each taking a share of more than 5 percent
in timber exports.
</P>
<P>
According to the CONAF report, cellulose was the leading timber
product exported, accounting for 39.5 percent of the total export
volume. However, refined timber products, such as moldings,
ribbons, blackboards, locks, doors, windows, frames, paper and
cardboard, were the most profitable items.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Cuba became a formal member
of the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's entry into the association shows that Latin America's
unity and integration is irreversible, said Jose Rafael Serrano,
president of the ALADI representatives committee, during a
ceremony at the group's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
This demonstrates ALADI's ability to remain flexible and
overcome political pitfalls in its search to strengthen relations
with all Latin American countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas expressed
confidence that his country will strengthen trade ties with other
ALADI countries including Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Cuba requested entry into ALADI in March last year. The
application was approved by the bloc's Council of Ministers at a
meeting held in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina are Cuba's main trading
partners inside ALADI.

<HEADLINE> Philippines May Hike Reserve Requirements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines may have to take drastic steps to avert a fall in the
peso if Treasury bill yields do not rise at Monday's regular
weekly auction after the recent rise in U.S. rates.
</P>
<P>
The Malaya newspaper Friday quoted Central Bank Governor Rafael
Buenaventura as saying that he may have to take the matter into
hand by increasing bank reserve requirements if the Bureau of
Treasury continued to reject bids at Monday's regular weekly
T-bill auction to keep rates low.
</P>
<P>
"reluctantly, we may have to, sooner rather than later," the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
Raising bank reserve requirements would mop up the peso
liquidity in the system which would help support the local
currency.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura said that the central bank has not intervened in
the foreign exchange market although the peso closed at 39.74
against the greenback Thursday, the lowest in about nine months.
</P>
<P>
But Social-Economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla was
quoted by the paper as saying that the yield on the benchmark
91-day Treasury bill rate could rise to 9 percent next week after
the 25 basis point hike in U.S. interest rates Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 91-day Treasury bill rate, a benchmark for pricing loans,
is now at a 12-year low of 8.426 percent after the central bank
cut overnight rates 20 times this year by a total of 437.5 basis
points.
</P>
<P>
The peso is now at nine-month lows because of the narrower
spreads between domestic and U.S. interest rates.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Mexico, the second largest
country in Latin America, spends less on defense compared to other

published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The monthly "Armed Forces-National Security" publication said

Argentina, the region's third largest country, annually spends
38 million dollars on its military.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is the region's largest country, with a population of
157 million. It boasts an army of 314,700 soldiers, compared with
182,382 armed forces personnel for 92 million Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
While the Mexican army is second only to Brazil in size in the
region, it has less military equipment than Brazil, Argentina,
Cuba and Chile.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's armed forces have 101 jet fighters, 845 armored
vehicles, and 169 helicopters, while Cuba has 130 jets, 1,500
tanks and 127 helicopters, it said.

<HEADLINE> Michael Johnson Breaks 400m World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Olympic and world champion
Michael Johnson broke the 11-year-old men's 400 meters world
record with 43.18 seconds and won the gold medal at the 7th World
Athletics Championships here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The previous record was set by his fellow American Butch
Reynoldson in Zurich on August 17, 1988.
</P>
<P>
Sanderlei Claro of Brazil finished second in 44.29 and
Aleiandro Cardenas of Mexico third in 44.31.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who also holds the 200m world record, is now tied with
Carl Lewis for the most career gold medals at the World
Championships with eight apiece.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long time in coming," Johnson said. "This was the
perfect setting. I wanted the medal but I also wondered how many
more times I would have to lower the world record."
</P>
<P>
"I want to take advantage of this opportunity," the jubilant
Johnson said. "I knew I'm in great shape. I now can go to the
Sydney Olympic Games as a world record holder in both events. "
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who was the first man in history to win a gold 200-
and 400 meters double at both the 1995 World Championships and
1996 Olympic Games, said he's confident of breaking the record
again.
</P>
<P>
"I know I can run faster," he said. "I know I can run 42 second
flat."
</P>
<P>
The American, who dominated the two events for about one decade,
has been plagued with injuries since last year.
</P>
<P>
He had to pull out of the 200 meters in the U.S. championships,
which doubled as qualifier for the championships, and entered the
400 meters with a wild card as the defending champion.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pround of myself to be able to come back from
injuries," he said. "My coach and I said early this year on what
to do this season. I said I want to break the world record."
</P>
<P>
In the day's other finals, Russian Maksim Tarasov carried out
his condition of favorite and won the men's pole vault final with
6.02 meters, a new championship's record, becoming the first man
to take the event after the six consecutive victories of the world
record holder, Sergy Bubka, absent here due to injury.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov, silver medalist in the last two editions, made a clean
series until 5.90m, after which he cleared 5.96 in the third
attempt, and made a splendid jump over 6.02m in his first attempt.
</P>
<P>
Australian Dmitriv Markov won the silver with 5.90m, jumped in
the first attempt, while the bronze medal was for the surprising
Aleksandr Averbukh of Israel, who set a new national record of 5.
80.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot be the new Bubka," Tarasov said. "I'm my own man.
about Tarasov. "
</P>
<P>
Australia's Cathy Freeman regained the world women's 400m
champion which she had taken in Athens worlds in 1997.
</P>
<P>
She clocked 49.67 seconds, the second world-best time this year.
The silver was taken by German Anja Bucker in 49.74 and the bronze
went to Jamaican Lorraine Graham in 49.92.
</P>
<P>
"I was just so pleased and relieve to cross the finish line,"
the 26-year-old Freeman said. "Now I'm going out to celebrate, it'
s been a long path back from injury to this performance. "
</P>
<P>
Gete Wami of Ethiopia, the bronze medalist in the Atlanta
Olympic Games, upset Paula Radcliffe of Britain in a temperature
of over 30 degrees centigrade to become Ethiopia's first women's
world champion with a sizzling last lap in the 10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Her time of 30 minutes 24.56 seconds, the fourth fastest time
ever, was nearly 25 seconds faster than the championships record
set by Chinese Wang Junxia in Stuttgart in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Radcliffe had the mild consolation of setting a national record
of 30:27.13 despite having to settle for a world championship
silver medal behind Wami for the second time in less than six
months.
</P>
<P>
World's marathon record holder Tegla Loroupe of Kenya finished
third in a national record of 30:32.03 but wasted little time in
criticising Wami for failing to help out with the pace at any
stage in the race.
</P>
<P>
Radcliffe, who was beaten in similar fashion by Wami at the
world cross country championships in March, led for much of the
race but again was found wanting for finishing speed when the gold
medal was decided and had no response when Wami stepped on the
accelerator with 200 meteres to go.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Hand Likely Behind Kandahar Blast: Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Thursday
said they cannot rule out foreign forces behind the recent
Kandahar blast, but did not single out any suspects.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Taliban senior official responsible for information
Amir Khan Muttaqi, addressing a press briefing here late Thursday,
said that probe is continuing into the blast which narrowly missed
Taliban's supreme leader Mulla Omar Tuesday night but no one has
been arrested so far.
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi said the blast was well organized and the material used
was very advanced and the device in best quality, which indicates
that a foreign hand might be behind the incident which left 10
people dead.
</P>
<P>
On Pakistan's latest peace initiative, Muttaqi said Islamabad
has offered no specific proposal, but he added that Taliban
welcome Pakistan's peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan opposition, instead of appreciating Pakistani peace
efforts, launched a baseless propaganda against Islamabad and that
"shows they want to continue war," he observed.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan recently sent a delegation to Dushanbe, Tajikistan,
for two rounds of talks with the Afghan opposition. The Pakistani
team also visited Kandahar and held meetings with Taliban
officials.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the issue concerning the alleged terrorist Osama
bin Laden, Muttaqi said Osama is a guest of the Afghan people who
are known for their hospitality for their guests, adding that the
Taliban will defend the Afghan tradition in Osama's case as well.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the Taliban are ready for talks with the
United States on the issue.
