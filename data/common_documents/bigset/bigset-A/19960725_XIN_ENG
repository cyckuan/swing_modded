<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Vows to Prevent Spread of Deadly Bacteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today vowed to take every conceivable means to prevent
the further spread of deadly food poisoning caused by a group of
e. coli bacteria known as O-157.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic has so far killed seven people and left more than
8,000 others, mostly school children, ill since the first
small-scale outbreaks of the disease in May in Okayama, western
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto issued a statement declaring his government's
determination to fight the mass poisoning following an emergency
meeting of cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
"The issue...is a national problem that has entered deeply into
Japanese people's lives," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
The government is doing its best to investigate the path of the
epidemic by investigating the distribution channels of food that
may have caused the poisoning, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers discussed issuing instructions to local
governments on preventive measures, including stricter hygiene
controls on school lunches.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, officials in the western Japanese city of
Sakai, where more than 6,000 school children have fallen victim to
the epidemic since early July, said the virulent bacillus had not
been found in lunches served during the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
A city task force has analyzed 1,352 school lunches served from
July 10 to 12 in all 90 of the city's elementary schools, food
collected from some 60 suppliers, as well as tap water and dust
collected from school kitchens, but no traces of the O-157
bacillus had been found, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The task force will investigate distributors and producers of
food in a bid to determine the route of the infection, the
officials added.

<HEADLINE> Alain Sergile: Only Swimmer From Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Like so many of his fellow
competitiors, Alain Sergile is making his first Olympic
appearance, where he will compete in just one event: the men's
100-meter butterfly.
</P>
<P>
Haiti is one of the many newcomers at the current Centennial
Olympic Games. As the only entrant in swimming, Sergile plans to
make the most of this long-awaited chance.
</P>
<P>
"I'am very honored that I am able to represent Haiti in these
Games, " he said, "Not only has it given me an opportunity to
represent Haiti, but also my family and heritage."
</P>
<P>
He considered that was a great way to finish his swimming
career. "To participate in the Olympic is my childhood dream."
</P>
<P>
The swimmer had trained in Dallas, Texas after graduated with a
degree in finance from Southern Methodist University in 1994. He
also do some part-time work to pay for his training fee there.
</P>
<P>
Sergile once decided to quit from swimming in the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
"It became very difficult for me to maintain a positive
attitude toward the sport when I was training all the time and not
competing very much at all."
</P>
<P>
However, that retirement was brief. In the spring of 1995, he
received a call from Haiti, asking him if he would like to
represent Haiti in the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the future after the Olympics, he answered: "At the
moment, I am planning to retire from swimming unless I have a
spectacular performance."
</P>
<P>
He clocked 58.23 seconds in the 100m butterfly heats, only
seventh in his 2nd group and was eliminated out of tonight's
final.
</P>
<P>
But he didn't care much about the results:"No matter what I do
in my event, I will never have regrets anymore. "

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Prepared to Meet Syrian Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy disclosed today he was trying to arrange a meeting with his
Syrian counterpart Farouk Shara in a bid to renew peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after talks with visiting
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette, Levy said the Israeli
control of the Golan Heights should not be made preconditions for
resuming Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Levy said he sent a message to Syria through Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat when they held on
Tuesday their first meeting at the Erez checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister told Shara in the message that "it is
primary that Syria should rethink the approach toward the peace
process".
</P>
<P>
"If he (Shara) is interested and thought peace is important to
his country, I am willing to meet him at any time in any place,"
Levy said.
</P>
<P>
"I will work personally very hard to make possible the renewal
of the discussions between Israel and Syria," Levy added.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Levy also defended his meeting with Arafat,
which aroused criticism from some members of his own Likud
faction, saying he went into the meeting as "the representative
of the democratically-elected government."
</P>
<P>
He challenged these critics:"If anyone thinks the right way to
run the country is to sit down and do nothing, and has no
alternative, let me present it."
</P>
<P>
Talking about Israeli-Syrian dialogue in today's Knesset
(parliament), Levy said he saw no change in Syria's position
which preconditioned the resumption of peace talks on Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights..
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, it was also "illogical" for Israel
to expect to receive Syria's recognition of its full control over
the Heights before the negotiations begin.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli new government has vowed not to relinquish the
Golan Heights for security needs and protection of water
resources, casting further doubt over the resumption of peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Syria has long insisted Israel fully withdraw from the Heights
before holding talks on the normalization of ties.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Leaders to Discuss Swazi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Presidents from southern
African countries are expected to meet in Maputo, capital of
Mozambique, today to discuss political situation in Swaziland,
said informed sources.
</P>
<P>
The "emergency consultative meeting" will be attended by South
African President Nelson Mandela, Botswana President Ketumile
Masire, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Mozambican
President Joaquim Chissano.
</P>
<P>
Swazi monarch King Mswati III was originally expected to
attend the meeting to brief southern African leaders on
constitution reforms he was set to introduce in the mountain
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
However, royal sources said the king has pulled out at the
last minute and dispatched his acting Prime Minister Sishayi
Nxumalo instead, as Swazi tradition dictated the monarch should
not leave his kingdom on the eve of a national meeting.
</P>
<P>
Both Swazi and South African officials declined to comment on
the nature of talks in Maputo.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana said the president flew
to Maputo early this morning and will issue a statement on his
return.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only southern African country where political
parties have been banned since 1973, and the king rules the country
by royal decree.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland has been plagued by industrial strikes and political
unrest since January, aimed at pressurizing the king to introduce
democratic changes.
</P>
<P>
Early reports said Mswati invited the Swazi people to a
national meeting at his Ludzidzini royal residence on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Plans to Become World "Tourist Capital" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore unveiled today its
ambitious plan to turn itself, an island republic with an area of
600 square kilometers, into one of the tourist capitals of the
world.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism 21", Singapore's national blueprint to develop the
tourism industry here, aims to make Singapore a tourism hub for
both tourists and tourist investors as well as make Singapore an
attractive location for tourism business, Yeo Cheow Tong, minister
for trade and industry, said at the launching of the plan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government had in principle approved a budget
of up to 60 million Singapore dollars (about 422.5 million US
dollars) to implement some of the key recommendations of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Among them, there is a new scheme to help the industry upgrade
its manpower and other software capabilities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government will repackage existing attractions
into special zones with individual themes.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB) will first try out
the concept in Chinatown. The government will help fund the
projects, but it sees the private sector as the main contributor.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism 21 Plan targets 10 million visitor arrivals and 16
billion Singapore dollars (about 11.27 billion US dollars) in
tourism receipts by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"These targets may appear overly ambitious. But they are
achievable with industry support," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism industry is an important engine driving the Singapore
economy. Last year it accounted for 5.2 percent of the country's
gross domestic product, providing well-paying jobs for many
Singaporeans.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, total tourism receipts amounted to 11.6
billion Singapore dollars (about 8.2 billion US dollars at current
exchange rate), as a total of 7.14 million visitors were attracted
to the island country last year.

DAMASCUS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
met today visiting U.S. coordinator of the Mideast peace process
Dennis Ross in the Syrian town of Latakia.
</P>
<P>
According to a Syrian official spokesman, the meeting was
attended on the Syrian side by Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara
and Syria's Ambassador in Washington Waleed al-Muallim, and on the
American side by U.S. Ambassador in Damascus Christopher Ross and
the U.S. presidential adviser for Middle Eastern affairs and
member of the U.S. National Security Council, Mubarak Paris.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital have anticipated that
Ross will convey to President al-Assad a message from U.S.
President Bill Clinton on the outcome of the Washington talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and on Israel's
suggestions regarding the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the message will underline the necessity of pursuing
the peace process and the resumption of peace negotiations between
Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Ross visit to Syria is taking place within the context of
U.S. efforts to activate the peace process and help resume peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Middle East peace talks have virtually been suspended since
hardline Likud party leader Netanyahu won the May 29 Israeli
elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Russia have agreed to
extend legal cooperation between them to include issues
concerning fugitives and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during talks between Cyprus'
Attorney General Alecos Markides and his Russian counterpart Yuri
skouratov, who is currently here on a visit to the island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference here today at the end of
the Russian official's visit, Markides and Skouratov said that
foundations were laid for long-term cooperation between the two
countries in legal matters.
</P>
<P>
Skouratov said an agreement was also reached on simplifying
the procedure of extraditing Russian criminals.
</P>
<P>
The Russian official said that during his meeting with Cyprus'
Justice and Public Order Minister Alecos Evangelou and Interior
Minister Dinos Michaelides, they discussed illegal money
laundering and the issue of Russian fugitives.
</P>
<P>
However, Skouratov described the relevant media reports as
"exaggerations" and noted that the rate of crimes committed by
Russian nationals in Cyprus was not as high as reported.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged, however, that cooperation on issues of
fugitives and money laundering should be more effective.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which has recently joined the Council of Europe, is
preparing to adopt the European convention on money laundering,
he noted, stressing that priority has to be given to harmonizing
Russian legislation with that of Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Cyprus' experience and expertise in this field will be useful
in helping us achieve this end," the Russian official said.

<HEADLINE> PAC to Discuss Participation in S.African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Pan Africanist Congress
(PAC) National Executive Council is expected to discuss its
participation in the government of national unity (GNU) at the
weekend, PAC National Convention Co-ordinator Ike Mafole said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Mafole said that the PAC
would open a convention in September to approve a new policy
direction for the party.
</P>
<P>
The PAC is operating in a changing political environment and,
in this regard, some of its policies will have to change.
</P>
<P>
The PAC was reportedly invited on several occasions by the
African National Congress (ANC) to join the GNU.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela said at the weekend that the PAC
leader Clarence Makwetu has declined four offers to join the
ANC-led government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PAC spokesman Mudini Maivha said proposed alliance
between parties will be discussed in the context of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
However, Maivha declined to comment on speculation that the
PAC, which has four members in parliament, has been offered
cabinet posts in an effort to bring them into the GNU.
</P>
<P>
If there is any proposal from the ANC and the government, the
PAC's National Executive Council will discuss it and take it to
the convention, he added.
</P>
<P>
The PAC, established in 1959, was one of the major political
organizations involved in the anti-apartheid liberation
movements.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Concrete Measures to Implement Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China today called on relevant
countries to intensify their efforts to bring into force as soon
as possible a major international agreement on banning chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
China also called for the comprehensive and effective
implementation of the Convention on Chemical Weapons adopted in
Paris in 1993 and aimed at banning the development, production,
stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and destroying those in
existence.
</P>
<P>
Some 160 countries have signed the convention, but so far only
60 have ratified it. The convention will come into force after it
has been ratified by 65 countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the Hague at the 14th session of the Preparatory
Commission of the OPCW (Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons) to implement the convention, Huang Yu, head of
the Chinese delegation, said China is a country with a significant
chemical industry and has on its territory large quantities of
chemical weapons abandoned by a foreign state.
</P>
<P>
"For China, the implementation of the Convention will certainly
be an arduous task. The Chinese government attaches great
importance to the ratification and implementation of the
Convention...and remarkable progress has been achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the difficulties we have," he said, "China is going to
further step up its efforts for the early deliberation and
ratification of the Convention by its legislative body, the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress."
</P>
<P>
China noted that as of today the two declared chemical weapons
possessors, Russia and the United States, had given no clear
commitment as to the timing of their ratifications and neither was
there any clear indication of the prospects of implementation of
their bilateral agreement on the destruction of chemical weapons,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We would regret to see this Convention being reduced from one
of genuine disarmament to that of mere non-proliferation and being
deprived of its intended significance due to failure on the part
of the two declared chemical weapon states to ratify," he said.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that in May and June this year, Japan, with China's
full cooperation, completed the fourth on-site investigation of
chemical weapons burial sites abandoned by the former Japanese
army.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes this progress and earnestly hopes that the
investigation will expedite Japan's efforts to develop its
destruction plan and finalize its destruction programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese side is not satisfied with the findings of
the Japanese investigation, since it was "preliminary."
</P>
<P>
Data obtained on the quantity of abandoned chemical weapons was
"neither complete nor accurate," and results of the environment
analysis did not conform with reality, Huang said.
</P>

"We insist that when the Japanese side submits to the
Secretariat of the Preparatory Commission relevant information
acquired in the investigation, or make public the findings of the

He concluded that the Chinese delegation has, as always,

the completion of the work of the Preparatory Commission," he said.

<HEADLINE> (Urgent)Burundi's President Takes Refuge in U.S. Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUJUMBURA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's President Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya took refuge in the U.S. embassy today for security
reasons, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
"It would be correct to say that a palace coup has occurred," a
European diplomat said on condition of anonymity. "The president
has sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy, and government institutions
stopped functioning several days ago. We're waiting to see what
happens."
</P>
<P>
The president's departure from his Bujumbura residence came
shortly after the main Tutsi Uprona party accused him of high
treason and withdrew confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
Journalists at the television station said the army had
deployed new guards at the station after removing the old regular
ones last night.
</P>
<P>
Other journalists said Ntibantunganya never returned to his
residence after he returned from Bungendana where he was pelted on
stones on Tuesday. He had gone there for the funeral of more than
300 members of the Tutsi minority massacred last Saturday by Hutu
rebels.
</P>
<P>
But military leaders denied there was an attempted coup.
Military spokesman Lt. Col. Longin Minani said Ntibantunganya "is
still our commander-in-chief and our president."

<HEADLINE> Children in Monrovia Suffer From Malnutrition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Malnutrition has affected up to
about a quarter of children under the age of five in the war-torn
Liberian capital of Monrovia, a French relief group announced
today.
</P>
<P>
Action against Hunger, the French aid group, was quoted by a
report obtained here today as saying that between 17 and 24
percent of Monrovia's children aged under five years old are
malnourished, while three to eight percent severely malnourished.
</P>
<P>
The group said some factions in Liberia's six-year-old civil
war are using hunger as a weapon, keeping groups of civilians
prisoners without feeding them.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the relief group said one of its field teams
discovered a group of 343 civilians held under such conditions on
July 10 at Suehn, north of Monrovia.

NEW DELHI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A Delhi local court today issued
an order fixing August 2 as the next date for the appearance of
former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao in the trial of a
cheating case, the Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
According to a summon issued by the court on July 9, Rao should
have appeared in the court today. The former prime minister was
accused of being involved in the 100,000-US dollar cheating case.
</P>
<P>
Rao, who is also president of the Congress Party, filed a plea
in the Delhi high court seeking quashing of the summon.

The Delhi high court Tuesday exempted Rao from personally
appearing in the Delhi local court today but reserved judgment
over Rao's petition.
</P>
<P>
During today's trial, the Delhi local court turned down a
request of Rao's counsel for fixing the next date at least two
weeks later and summoned Rao on August 2.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Jiang Chengji bettered his
own Asian record with a clocking of 53.40 seconds here on
Wednesday, slicing 0.40 seconds off the previous mark he set in
Tianjin two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, 20, finished fourth in the heats and secured himself a
berth in tonight's final.
</P>
<P>
"We really don't expect that he can break the Asian record in
the morning's heats, " said Zhou Ming, Jiang's coach, "that's
quite difficult, you know."
</P>
<P>
Zhou was quite satisfied with Jiang's timing, which is also his
personal best.
</P>
<P>
Jiang clocked 53.80 to set the previous Asian record at the
National Championships in Tianjin in 1994, which gave him the
fifth place in the world ranking then.
</P>
<P>
The 1.91 meter swimmer, Asian Games gold medalist in Hiroshima
and also Asian champion in the 50m free in Bangkok in May, said
that the results came out from hard and systematic training in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
"I really want to thank my coach, it's really nice." said
Jiang, who will also participate in the men's 50m and 100m
freestyle at the current Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Asked about tonight's final, he said: " I will try my best for
a faster time, but I do not expect a better placing in the final.

<HEADLINE> Peace Activists Criticize Netanyahu's Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Peace Now organization
today accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to
deceive the public with fault statistics about Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference held here, the organization said that the
number of Jewish settlers did not increase by 50 percent during
the period of the previous Labor government, as claimed by the
prime minister during his recent visit to Washington, but only by
39 percent from 105,000 to 145,000.
</P>
<P>
It said the increase of Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip under
the previous government was 55 percent compared to only 36 percent
for the West Bank and more than half of the increase in the
settler population in the territories was concentrated in six
large settlements close to the West Bank " Green Line."
</P>
<P>
Peace Now noted that Netanyahu announced to invest one billion
shekels (about 333 million U.S. dollars) a year in settlements,
which is equivalent to an expenditure of 1,000 shekels (333
dollars) for each family in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Peace Now activist Modechai Baron stressed that peace and
settlements do not go together although the Jews should be
allowed to live in the areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jewish settlers have so far created obstacles to a
solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and to increase
settlements will aggravate the situation.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the only way to achieve peace with the
Palestinians is to partition the land into two sovereignties," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is expected to hold consultations on settlement
policy Thursday and the issue is also likely to be raised at the
cabinet meeting Friday. It is believed that the hardline premier
maintains the option to expand settlements and build new by-pass
roads in the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Peace Now also announced that they are
stepping up efforts to monitor settlement activity.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean PM Calls for Measures Against "Ugly" Travelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 23 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Prime Minister Lee
Soo-sung ordered the cabinet today to take stern measures against
misdemeanors committed by Koreans during overseas travels.
</P>
<P>
Lee's order came after the recent wildlife killing in Thailand
and the plane-side sit-in at an Uzbek airport by South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
Five tourists from South Korea were arrested in Thailand
recently after police found the butchered remains of six bears in
their van during a routine check at a traffic stop.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four bears' paws, along with other organs preserved in
whisky, were found when police searched the van. The bear parts
were apparently destined for the cooking pot, to serve as a
special food reputedly good for increasing strength and vitality.
</P>
<P>
Presiding over a cabinet meeting, Lee told the foreign, justice
and culture-sports ministers and other related government
officials to take punitive measures against South Koreans going
abroad only to disgrace the nation by their misconduct.
</P>
<P>
Those traveling overseas only to gamble or seek tonic food
should be given corresponding disadvantages or punished in
accordance with pertinent laws at home, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Urges U.S. to Sign Peace Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) has again urged the United States to sign a peace
agreement to replace the existing Korean Armistice Agreement, the
official Rodong Sinmum newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has repeatedly called for the establishment of a new
peace deal between Pyongyang and Washington, saying that the
armistice agreement, which ended the three-year Korean War in
1953, is insufficient to ensure peace on the Korean Peninsular.
</P>
<P>
A peace deal between the two sides is imperative in order to
establish a new mechanism to guarantee permanent peace on the
peninsular, particularly when the north and south have signed a
joint declaration of mutual non-aggression, the paper quoted Yang
Hyong Sop, chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yang was speaking at a meeting to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the Democratic Front for the Re-unification of the
Fatherland (DFRF), set up to push for the re-unification of the
DPRK with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the development of the DFRF, he said the shortcut to
reuniting the fatherland is to unite the Korean people and to
establish a federal pan-national unified country, with neither
trying to destroy the other.
</P>
<P>
He urged all Koreans to make efforts to establish a solid
mechanism to guarantee peace on the peninsular.
</P>
<P>
Korea was divided in 1945 at the end of the the Second World
War, when the north was dominated by the Soviet Union and the
south by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Fighting erupted on the peninsular in 1950, which ended in
1953, when an armistice treaty was finally concluded between the
DPRK's People's Army and the Chinese Volunteers' Army on the one
side, and U.N. forces led by the U.S. on the other.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. still has a significant military presence in South
Korea.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Markswoman Wins Standard Rifle Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Aleksandra Ivosev of Yugoslavia
landed the women's standard rifle title by totalling 686.1 points
in the 26th Olympic Games here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first gold medal for Yugoslavia in the current
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Russian Irina Gerasimenok came second with 680.1 points, just
0.3 better than third-place finisher Renata Mauer of Poland,
winner of the air rifle gold last Saturday, the first gold for the
Games.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the men's rifle which can be customized with special
accessories and alterations to fit the shooter's need and comfort,
the women's standard rifle weighs up to 12 pounds and cannot be
modified in any way.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Ivosev, who placed 22nd in the Barcelona Games,
won her first world championship in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mauer, who topped the qualification round with 589 points, two
more than Ivosev and four over Gerasimenok, faltered in the final.
She scored 7.6 and 7.4 in the opening two shots and never had a
chance to catch up.
</P>
<P>
Mauer had once tumbled to the fifth after scoring 7.8 points on
the seventh shot. She clawed back to finish third after getting
high marks on the last two shots.
</P>
<P>
However, Mauer's score for the final was the worst of the eight
finalists. Her collection of 90.8 points was 8.3 points away from
the winner.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Vessela Letcheva of Bulgaria, who has made
the top three of world and international competitions 18 times in
the past five years, finished a joint 12th.

</P>
<P>
Hashimoto conveyed Japan's hope of China's early accession to

</P>
<P>
Wu hoped that discussions at a seminar on the WTO in Japan this

China as a member.
</P>
<P>
Wu was attending a regular Sino-Japanese consultation on
promoting Japanese investment in China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the meeting Monday, Wu said China is
doing its utmost to improve the environment for foreign investment
through continued economic and foreign trade reforms.
</P>
<P>
She hoped Japan will retain its status as China's biggest

<HEADLINE> China Plays Important Part in World Trade, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China is playing an increasingly
important part in world trade owing to its strong economy and
potential market, a senior British diplomat based in China said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar entitled "Trade Opportunities In The
Asia-Pacific Region", Simon Featherstone, Political Counselor of
the British Embassy in China, said the cumulative total of foreign
direct investment in China from 1979 to 1995 was 133 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Between 1953 and 1978 China's annual average growth rate was
about 6.5 percent. Since the present policy of reform and opening
was adopted, however, growth since 1979 has risen to an average of
9.5 percent, Featherstone said.
</P>
<P>
"In 1995 China's total exports were 143.7 billion US dollars,
representing a 21.7 percent share of GDP. Exports from foreign
funded enterprises totaled 46.6 billion US dollars, around one
third of the total. These figures demonstrate some of the
underlying strengths of the Chinese economy," Featherstone added.
</P>
<P>
China does have some problems in its structure transformation,
nonetheless, China's economy is basically strong, the diplomat
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Apart from its growth of around 10 percent, consumer price
inflation is under 10 percent, trade surplus was 6.6 billion US
dollars over the past l2 months, external debt as a share of GNP
is 19.1 percent and debt service to export ratio is 10.9 percent.
Both low figures by the standards of most developing countries,
Featherstone said.
</P>
<P>
Concerning Sino-British relations, the counselor said, having
a succession of high level visits in each direction, they are now
getting better and "are certainly better than they were 18 months
ago".
</P>
<P>
So climate for Britain doing business with China better than it
has been for some time, the British diplomat believed.
</P>
<P>
Britain enjoys the advantages in doing business with China,
Featherstone said. Because "the UK is the largest European
investor in China and also the largest EU source of technology for
China," he pointed out. All these demonstrated a long term
commitment to China's development, Featherstone added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Bangladeshi Government Treats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Although the opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) has set one difficult question after
another, the one-month old government led by Prime Minister Shiekh
Hasina has treated the opposition with graciousness in a bid to
maintain law and order in the country.
</P>
<P>
The recent development in the parliament was an example,
observers here said, adding that without graciousness from the
government side, the crisis in the House could not be solved
within days.
</P>
<P>
The BNP MPs have staged walkouts twice in protest against "the
denial of their right" to move adjournment motions since the
inauguration of the first session of the 7th parliament on July
14.
</P>
<P>
Refraining from making counter attacks against BNP's action,
the government side called upon the BNP MPs to return to the house
with patient persuasion while arranging a tripartite meeting of
the speaker and the leaders of both the treasury bench and the
opposition to resolve the crisis. The BNP returned to the house
session after a 2-day boycott in their second walkout last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Hasina government has announced its policy of
consensus from the very beginning. While "upholding constitutional
obligations and democratic norms" by informing President Abdur
Rahman Biswas of her visit to Saudi Arabia on July 9-12, Prime
Minister Hasina even invited BNP chairperson and ex-prime minister
Begum Khaleda Zia to join the new government though the gesture
was rejected.
</P>
<P>
The Hasina government took over after her Awami League (AL)
defeated the ex-ruling BNP by winning 146 out of the 300 seats in
the 7th parliamentary elections on June 12.
</P>
<P>
Why the AL government has offered olive branches to the
opposition even when it faced challenges?
</P>
<P>
As a new government which returned to power after 21 years,
priority must be given to national unity to keep political
stability, a diplomat believed, saying that Bangladesh has
suffered a lot from "civil wars" and people have placed great
hopes on the AL government to maintain law and order and get
democratic process going forward.
</P>
<P>
In view of the BNP strength, the government side does not dare
act rashly. Although the BNP has become the opposition party with
more than 60 seats less than the ruling AL in the parliament, it
remains a powerful political party in the country with strength
and influence in various walks of life, especially in the army and
among armed university students.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts warned that if the government-opposition conflict
becomes acute, the country would be once again locked in violence,
terrorism and unrest, and a possibility of military interference
may not be ruled out, threatening not only national stability but
also the rule of the AL government.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the AL has fixed a strategy of drawing more
support in the parliament to ensure a two-thirds majority for any
constitutional amendment. For effecting any constitutional
amendment, the AL must get cooperation from the BNP though it
commands the support of 30 JP MPs and another one from a smaller
party.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hasina has declared that the principle goal of
the government policy will be to enhance the image of Bangladesh
and generate confidence both at home and abroad. For that purpose,
the government is determined to wage a relentless war against
forces inimical to stability.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Industry on Way to Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- British manufacturing industry is
on the road to recovery after long period of weakness, with a
recovery in export demand and output in the second quarter and
their first rise in confidence for over a year, a leading business
survey revealed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) quarterly
industrial trends survey revealed the first rise in business
confidence for a year, with companies surveyed claiming to have
seen an improvement in recent months in both their order book
positions and in output levels.
</P>
<P>
According to the CBI's poll of more than 1,200 firms, around a
third of companies saw orders rise between April and July, against
24 percent reporting a drop. The eight percent balance is the
highest for a year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a balance of six percent of manufacturers said
output rose rather than fell in the four months to July, compared
with a zero balance in the April survey.
</P>
<P>
The balance of manufacturers expecting output to increase in
the next four months rose from 12 percent to 22 percent, the
strongest figure recorded in a quarterly survey since October
1988.
</P>
<P>
The picking up in manufacturing activity is accompanied by a
fall in prices in the latest four months for the first time in
more than two years, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
While the government and City economists welcomed the survey,
business leaders warned against predictions of a boom in
manufacturing, saying that the pace of improvement was "by no
means assured", and adviced the Chancellor against any further
changes in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that manufacturers' expectations have been
consistently disappointed over the past year. Manufacturing was
still not performing as well as the economy as a whole and
problems remain.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rosier outlook for output and orders, the decline
in factory jobs has continued as firms struggle to remain
competitive, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
Jobs were shed at the fastest rate for more than two years in
the past four months, and most manufacturers expect more
labour-shedding during the summer.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Train Blasted in Colombo Suburb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A train carrying several hundred
Colombo office workers back to their home towns in the south was
blasted by two bombs at a railway station in Dehiwala, the
southern suburban town of Colombo about 6 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
Government television Rupavahini in its 8 p.m. news bulletin
announced that 15 people were killed and several others injured in
the blast, which blew up three compartments and affected the rest
of the train and the station, but the radio said that 63 people
were killed and 245 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
However, informed sources believed that casualties will be much
higher, saying the death toll will be at between 50 and 100, and
the injured between 200 and 300.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, the injured in various conditions were sent
to the Dehiwala Hospital, the Colombo National Hospital and other
hospitals in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, three bombs had been planted in
separate compartments in the train. Two of them exploded one after
the other while the third was defused by the army later. The two
compartments were completely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
There have been no immediate claims of responsibility but the
police are certain it is an act of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
Intelligence reports had cautioned the possibility of such an
event and security had been heightened in Colombo. Cordon and
search operations with road blocks had enabled the police and
security forces to find out several suspected suicide bombers and
caches of arms and ammunition from "safe houses" in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels labeled this month "black July" because on
July 24, 1983, an unprecedented ethnic riot broke out in this
country, during which several hundred Tamils were killed and many
others rendered homeless.
</P>
<P>
Since then every year the rebels have created chaos in the
south of the country in July as a mark of remembrance.

ATLANTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Lin Li, 25, who won the women's
200-meter indiviudal medley title in the Olympic Barcelona Games
four years ago with a world record time of 2:11.65, finished
fourth in the event's heats Wednesday, which ensured her a berth
in the final.
</P>
<P>
Lin clocked in 2:16.31, nearly five seconds off her personal
best.
</P>
<P>
Her coach Zhang Xiong commented after the competiton: "She
performed well in the heats."
</P>
<P>
The eldest swimmer in the Chinese squad, coming back from
almost one-year layoff, was edged out in the 200m breasstroke
heats Tuesday. She was the silver medalist in the event four years
ago in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
"I think she was in form," her teammate Liu Limin said. "She
gave up systematic training for a long time, but she really
recovered quickly. That surprised me."
</P>
<P>
Marianne Limpert of Canada finished first in heats with a new
national record of 2:15.12.
</P>
<P>
Michelle Smith from Ireland, who has collected two gold medals
already, has another chance to extend her medal credit with a
seventh place finish.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yanyan, 18, from south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, who scored the year's best at the trials, failed to make
the final. She was 10th.
</P>
<P>
Her timing was 3.68 seconds behind her personal best of 2:12.87
in Tianjin in April.
</P>
<P>
"She didn't perform well in her specialty," said coach Wu
Jicai. "Anyway, we have tried our best. She was not well
physically."
</P>
<P>
"She will also participate in tonight's B final. We will do out
best whenever we have the chance," the coach added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Hungary's Karoly Guttler, whose world record in the
men's 100m breaststroke was shattered Saturday by little-knwon
Belgian Fred Deburghgraeve, found something to cheer as he

</P>
<P>
The world 36th-ranked breaststroker clocked in 2:13.89, ahead
of Russian Andrey Korneyev and American Kurt Grote.
</P>
<P>
Deburghgraeve came in a lowly 15th, crashing out of the final.
</P>
<P>
China's Wang Yiwu, the first Chinese male swimmer with a world

of the Tours-based TAT, and take care of a 600 million franc (120
million U.S. dollars) loss TAT has registered in the past two
fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
Marchais, who has been leading TAT for 30 years, said that he
is satisfied with the result of combination with BA in the past
three years, which he said has lowered 31 percent of TAT's costs.
</P>
<P>
France changed its civil aviation code in February to allow
foreign companies take over a French air company completely.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse quoted a representative of BA in Paris as
saying that the French market is very important for BA. He said
that half of the TAT flights towards Britain "feed" long
distance flights from the Heathrow airport.
</P>
<P>
He said that when inter-European air competition begins in
April 1997, BA expects no new French competitors.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen, Christopher Discuss Bilateral Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen told US Secretary of State Warren Christopher
here today that the Taiwan issue is the most important one in
Sino-American relations, to which the key lies in mutual respect
for sovereignty and territorial integrity and mutual
non-interference.
</P>
<P>
The common interests of China and the United States outweigh
their differences and both sides should treat and handle Sino-US
relations with strategic foresight and from a long-term point of
view, Qian and Christopher agreed at their talks, according to a
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the key to dealing with Sino-US relations is mutual
respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and
non-interference in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue has always been the most sensitive and
important one in the relations between China and the United
States, which has a direct bearing on the Sino-US relationship,
said the Chinese foreign minister who is attending the ASEAN Post
Ministerial Conference along with other ASEAN Dialogue Partners.
</P>
<P>
He said the principles defined in the three Sino-US joint
communiques should be strictly adhered to so as not to allow the
Taiwan question to hinder the improvement and development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Christopher reiterated that the US government will continue to
pursue the "One China Policy" and comply with the principles of
the three Sino-US joint communiques.
</P>
<P>
The two sides held that some positive progress has been made
recently in the relations between China and the United States and
there are emerging new opportunities for the development of the
Sino-US relationship.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should seize these opportunities, adopt
constructive attitudes and work together to reduce differences and
troubles, and seek more common ground and extend cooperation in
the interest of a healthy and stable development of the Sino-US
relations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that a normal, stable and healthy economic
and trade relationship between the two countries is in keeping
with the fundamental interests of the two peoples and the
development and prosperity of the world economy. Bilateral
economic and trade cooperation, therefore, should be boosted on
the basis of equality and mutual benefit and long-term stability.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also exchanged views on global and regional
issues of mutual concern.

<HEADLINE> Summer Break-ins Shoot up in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Summer is the busiest time of the
year for burglars in Greece, mainly in great Athens area, as they
take advantage of the opportunity presented by open doors and
window to break into homes.
</P>
<P>
According to Athens police today, the number of burglaries
committed during Summer months has more than doubled over the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
In the Summer of 1990, a total of 1,839 burglaries were reported
in great Athens area , while during the same period in 1995 the
number rose to 3,766.
</P>
<P>
More specifically, in 1990, 743 burglaries were recorded in
June, 397 in July and 699 in August. In 1995, police recorded
1,371 burglaries in June, 1,024 in July and 1,839 in August.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, 31,765 burglaries were recorded in all of Greece. In
1995, the number reached 42,365, an increase of about 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
Police said only 20 to 35 percent of the reported burglaries
are solved, and even in these cases police find it hard to retrieve
stolen possessions which usually change hands immediately following
the burglary.
</P>
<P>
Police advised people to protect their home from burglars by
locking doors and windows at night and while out and by avoiding
leaving ladders in the garden and near balconies.

<HEADLINE> BBC to Lose Exclusive Right to Queen's Christmas Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) is to lose its exclusive rights to produce the
Queen's Christmas speech, Buckingham Palace announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision means that the Independent Television Network
(ITV) and the BBC will take it in turn to produce the Queen's
Christmas speech to the nation and the Commonwealth in two-year
intervals.
</P>
<P>
The BBC will handle the broadcast this year and ITV will take
it over in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
BBC correspondents is reportedly to believe the decision is
linked to the BBC's decision to interview the Princess of Wales
last year for its program Panorama, in which Princess Diana made a
series of frank disclosures about her private life.
</P>
<P>
A BBC TV report said that the Queen was apparently upset that
she had not been informed in advance of the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
But a palace spokesman denied that there was any link between
the two incidents, saying that the palace has been considering the
matter for some time, so that the arrangement reflect the
composition of the television and radio industries today and
provide a fair balance for the production and distribution of the
Christmas broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
ITV director Marcus Plantin said: "I am delighted that ITV has
been given the opportunity to participate in this annual broadcast
which is so much part of the Christmas tradition in Britain and
the Commonwealth."

<HEADLINE> China's Basketball Team Upsets Argentina for Second Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China scored an unbelievable
victory Wednesday 87-77 over Argentina, who had defeated bronze
medalist Lithuania Monday, in an Olympic men's basketball Group A
match.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Wu and Hu Weidong led China in scoring with 22 points
each, followed by Li Xiaoyong. But 19-year-old and 2.13-meter
center Wang Zhizhi only grabbed six rebounds and had four points
for China.
</P>
<P>
The Asian champion team, which defeated Angola and lost to
Croatia in its first two games, took a 51-38 lead at halftime
after the lead changed hands several times.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, which missed starting centers Marcelo Nicola and
Ruben Wolkowisdy, came back strongly to tie 56-56 nine minutes
into the second half. However Hu Weidong led a 18-6 run to extend
the margin at 73-62 with less than five minutes left. Then
Argentina never had the chance to close the gap.
</P>
<P>
"The win is very important for us to qualify for the
quarterfinals," said Chinese Coach Gong Luming. "Our defense was
the key to our victory."
</P>
<P>
"Their two centers were injured, and this gave us a good chance
to win," said Hu Weidong, who also had four assists and four
steals. "We studied the Argentine games before the play and
thought it was possible to beat them if we would play our game."
</P>
<P>
Juan Espil scored 25 points to lead Argentina, which will miss
Nicola who has left for Greece for his serious injury in the leg
that needs to be a operation.
</P>
<P>
"We lost the game becuase we played a bad first half,
especially in the defense which let China score 51 points,"
Argentine coach Guillermo Vecchil said. "But the defeat will not
affect our confidence to enter the quarterfinals."
</P>
<P>
China meets the American Dream Team Friday that has scored two
straight wins over Agentina and Angola.
</P>
<P>
Argentina will take on Croatia which lost to Lithuania Saturday
but won over China.

<HEADLINE> EU Draws Up Priorities for Information Society Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC)
approved today a Communication entitled "The implications of
Information Society on European Union Policies", drawing up four
priorities for its policy-making efforts.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive EU information society strategy was launched in
July 1994 with the submission by the EC of an Action Plan celled
"Europe's Way towards the Information Society".
</P>
<P>
While the goals outlined in the Action Plan remain valid, the
EC stressed, the pervasive nature of the information society and
recent global developments require updating, reinforcing and
re-adjusting of actions already undertaken and the incorporation
of the information society dimension in policy areas not
originally addressed in the Action Plan.
</P>
<P>
Against this background, it has laid down four future
priorities for its information society policies:
</P>
<P>
-- Improving of the business environment, including enhancing
coordination between the relevant regulatory authorities,
particularly in the fields of licensing, frequency allocation,
numbering and sternal relations(e.g. with respect to the
International Telecommunications Union).
</P>
<P>
-- Paying more attention to information society related
research in the 5th Multiannual Research and Technological
Framework Program which will enter into force in 1999.
</P>
<P>
-- Putting people at the Center: to ensure that the benefits
are evently distributed between different parts of the European
Union and citizens. The EC intends to review the role of regional
policy, including that of Member States, in the information
society, to better protect consumer interests and to improve the
quality of public sector services.
</P>
<P>
-- Meeting the Global Challenge: establishing basic global
rules in order to create a level playing field, for example:
securing network interconnection and service interpretability,
protecting intellectual property rights, information security,
protecting privacy and personal data, promoting global standards,
removing trade barriers.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests Against Turkish Violations of Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has formally lodged a
protest to the United Nations against new Turkish violations of
its air space and Nicosia's flight information region (FIR) last
week.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency today, the protest letter,
which the U.N. circulated as an official document, said "such
actions increase tension on the island as U.N. Security Council
resolution 1062 testifies."
</P>
<P>
The resolution expresses "serious concern about recent military
exercises in the region, including overflights in the airspace of
Cyprus by military fixed wing aircraft, which have increased
tension."
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, five Turkish jets flew over Cyprus eastern tip,
the Karpass Peninsula, and the eastern coastal town of
Famagusta. Both areas have been under Turkish control since the
Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The letter notes that the violations are "an additional
indication of Turkish provocative behavior in that they took
place on the eve of the 22nd anniversary of the Turkish invasion
of Cyprus".
</P>
<P>
In a separate move, the Cyprus' permanent mission to the
U.N. lodged a strong protest over last week's visit by Turkey's
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan to the Turkish-controlled
northern part of the island.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister paid a one-day visit last Saturday
to attend so-called celebrations in the northern part of Cyprus
marking the 22nd anniversary of the Turkish invasion.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has also made representations in writing to
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali about the visit.
</P>
<P>
This Eastern Mediterranean island has been divided into the
Turkish-Cyprus community in the north and the Greek-Cyprus
community in the south since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
seized the northern third of the island following a short-lived
coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

experiences make her nervous," said her coach Han Bingyan.
</P>
<P>
"She eats little and has lost three kilograms of weight since
we arrived here. " said Han.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Italian cyclist Andrea Collinelli
shattered the world record for the second time in men's individual
pursuit here today, when competing in the quarterfinals at the
26th Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Andrea Collinelli clocked a time of four minutes and 19.153
seconds in the four kilometers event, trimming 0.546 seconds off
the world record he set just hours ago in the qualification round.
</P>
<P>
In the qualification round, Collinelli broke the world record
set by Graeme Obree of Britain at the 1993 World Cycling
Championships.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Phillipe Ermenault of France broke the
Olympic record when finishing in 4:21.295. The former record of
4:24.496 was set by Chris Boardman of Britain at the Barcelona
Games.
</P>
<P>
Collinelli was the silver medalist at the 1995 World
Championships in Bogota, Colombia in the event. He posted the
fastest time in the qualification round, but lost the finals to
Obree.
</P>
<P>
But this time he would not have to worry about Obree, since
Obree did not advance to the quarter finals after finishing 11th.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese official said here
today that the Chinese Government will back Macao government in
taking measures conducive to economic development and social
stability, and is also studying for ways of cooperation between
Macao and inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office of the State Council, said at a seminar that the Chinese
Government will do whatever it can to help the Macao Government in
taking measures to expand its economy and enhance its stability.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that the Macao Government could take some
concrete measures for the development of Macao's economy during
the remaining time of over three years before the handover of
power in 1999," he said. "We will offer our help."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said that the Chinese Government is making
studies for ways of cooperation between Macao and inland areas in
several aspects, such as the cooperation between companies, the
establishment of a joint coordination body on major projects, and
the proper control of the export of labor to Macao.
</P>
<P>
"We have always paid attention to the economic growth and
social development in Macao," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy director is optimistic about the economic prospects
of Macao, saying that he believes Macao's economy will step out of
difficulty under the joint efforts of Macao's industrialists and

<HEADLINE> Quickened Resolvement of Macao Transitional Issues Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese official said here
today that the resolvement of the three major issues in the
transitional period of Macao should be stepped up.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office of the State Council, said at a seminar that the three
leading issues in the transitional period of Macao, namely, the
localization of civil servants, the localization of law and the
use of Chinese as an official language, are the key questions for
the transitional period of Macao.
</P>
<P>
"The resolvement of the three major issues should be quickened
as there are only little more than 1,200 days left before the
handover of power in Macao," he said. "More local 'Macao people'
should be allowed to enter the higher rank of civil positions so
that they can gain experiences."
</P>
<P>
He noted that certain progress has been achieved with the joint
efforts of the Chinese and the Portuguese governments, but it
still lags behind the requirements for a smooth handover of power.
</P>
<P>
Most of the positions on the level of head of department and
chief of division are still held by people from Portugal, and only
a few laws have been localized and local legislative personnel is
in severe shortage. Chinese as an official language is still not
widely used in many government departments, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If those problems are not solved in a faster pace, the
administration operation after 1999 will be affected, and the
policy of 'laws basically remain unchanged' will be hard to
implement," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese Government hopes that a timetable
would be made through friendly consultation between the two sides
so that more Macao people may enter the government and gain
experiences through practice.

<HEADLINE> Special Policy Paves Bright Future for Macao: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese official on Hong Kong
and Macao affairs said here today that the policy of "one country,
two system" to be imposed in Macao after 1999 will bring a bright
future to Macao.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office of the State Council, said at a seminar that the it has
been proved in Hong Kong and Macao during the past decade that the
policy will be beneficial to all parties involved.
</P>
<P>
"It will be conducive to the stability, prosperity and
development of Hong Kong and Macao, to China's modernization
drive, to Britain, Portugal and other related parties which have
economic interests in Hong Kong and Macao," said the deputy
director.
</P>
<P>
The deputy director arrived in Macao on Wednesday for the
seminar on the basic law of Macao, which was sponsored by the
Promotion Association of the Macao Basic Law. He will also visit
some institutions and companies in Macao.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that in making the policy the actual situation in
Macao was taken into consideration, and the policy is totally
compatible to the general situation in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region, which
was promulgated in 1993 by the National People's Congress in
accordance with the "one country, two systems" policy, has ensured
the bright future of Macao as it has set the orientation of social
and economic development of Macao, he said.
</P>
<P>
The law will become effective on December 20, 1999 when China
resumes its exercise of sovereignty over Macao. According to the
law, Macao's capitalist system and basic life style will remain
unchanged for at least 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the Chinese Government is confident that a
bright future of Macao will appear under the policy of "one
country, two system".
</P>
<P>
"Although we still have a lot to do during the transitional
period, we are convinced that under the good cooperation between
the Chinese and the Portuguese governments, with the joint efforts
of Macao compatriots and all residents in Macao, a stable
transition and a smooth handover of power will be achieved, and a
long-term development and social stability will be maintained," he
said.

They also agreed to enhance bilateral ties by strengthening
political consultations between the foreign ministries of the two
countries, which will be held in the next few months before the
World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers promised that at the second
Japan-Singapore Symposium, which will be held later this year in
Singapore, there will be high level representation from both
sides.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two countries will review and broaden the
framework of technical assistance to third countries.

<HEADLINE> Canada Condemns U.S. Bill on Libya, Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Canada has condemned new U.S.
legislation aimed at punishing foreign companies making
significant oil and gas investments in Libya and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government said it strongly objects to the U.S.'
unilateral approach to economic sanctions against the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which cleared U.S. Congress on Tuesday, calls for the
president to impose sanctions on any foreign company investing 40
million U.S. dollars a year or more in oil and gas fields in Libya
and Iran.
</P>
<P>
European countries have also been quick to condemn the bill and
vowed to take counter measures.
</P>
<P>
The bill contains objectionable provisions, said a spokeswoman
at Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.
</P>
<P>
Canada considers this "extraterritorial application of its law
a disturbing trend in U.S. foreign policy," particularly in view
of Helms-Burton law on Cuba, she was quoted as saying by today's
Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Helms-Burton law, which punishes foreign firms doing
business in Cuba, the Libya-Iran bill is unlikely to cause any
immediate concern for Canadian companies. But the principles are
the same, Canadian officials stressed.

<HEADLINE> More Attention to Improvement of Economic Returns Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- An article in today's "People's
Daily" by Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo urges everyone in society to be
more aware of the improvement of economic returns in China's
enterprise reform.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China is undergoing a significant transformation
from its traditional planned economy to one that is
market-oriented and has a technical-intensive production model.
</P>
<P>
The active involvement of workers in state-owned enterprises
will be the transformation's foundation and guarantee of success,
Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the improvement of economic returns, which is a
key index to measure the quality of economic growth, should be
realized through readjusting resource allocation and management
structure in different industries, widely using the latest
scientific achievements, and upgrading industrial efficiency.
</P>
<P>
However, low economic returns will bottleneck the improvements
to the country's comprehensive power and people's living standard,
according to the Vice-Premier.
</P>
<P>
In his 1,400-word-long article, Wu praised an in-depth survey
of enterprises' economic returns, which was launched three years
ago. He called for promoting awareness of economic returns among
common people.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Investigate Border Incident in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is to dispatch military
representatives to Iran to investigate the recent rocket attacks
by Turkish helicopters in a border region, a press report said
here today.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Alaeddin
Boroujerdi in a report printed in the Persian daily "Iran".
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi said that the report on their findings will serve
as a basis for future decision-making on closing this undesirable
case.
</P>
<P>
According to early press reports here, two Turkish helicopters
flew over Iran's northwestern Silvana region on June 26 and fired
two rockets, killing six and injuring 15 others.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi said that incidents in such "sensitive" regions are
likely but he expressed the hope that the Turkish government led
by Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan would be able to overcome the
problems and work toward the creation of calm situation at the
country's joint borders with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The deputy foreign minister stressed that Iran is for friendly
and sound relations with Turkey but at the same time will not
tolerate "any aggression" on its territory.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Turkey, as two major Islamic and neighboring
countries, should enjoy growing relations and counter any move
which may upset this trend, he added.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi revealed that some Turkish ministers may visit
Tehran next month and these trips would pave the way for Prime
Minister Erbakan to visit Iran in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Macao-Born Portuguese Will be Free to Choose Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese official said here
today that Macao-born Portuguese people will be free to choose a
Chinese citizenship or a Portuguese citizenship according to their
willingness.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office of the State Council, said at a seminar today that the
Chinese Government will not force them to become Chinese citizens
and that they can make their own decision.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the question of citizenship will, as the
question in Hong Kong, be solved satisfactorily," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy director noted that Macao-born Portuguese people
have made contributions to Macao's development, adding that the
Chinese Government hopes they will continue to live in Macao after
China resumes its exercise of sovereignty over Macao, and do their
part for a better future of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Some Macao-born Portuguese people are now making preparations
to stay in Macao, learning Chinese, law and other necessary
knowledge, and it is a right choice of them, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chen explained that after 1999, the Portuguese language will
continue be used as an official language, and the operation of
Portuguese schools will continue as well. Local Macao-born
Portuguese civil servants may keep their positions with their
salary, allowance and welfare no less than their previous level,
except those otherwise ruled in the basic law.
</P>
<P>
He assured those local Macao-Born Portuguese who are very
concerned with their future nationality that they will not be
forced to become a Chinese, but instead, they will make their own
decisions to choose either Chinese or Portuguese citizenship.
</P>
<P>
As to the details of the choosing of citizenship, he said they
are being discussed at the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison
Group.

<P>
MACAO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese official said here
today that the promotion of the Macao Basic Law should be carried
out to a further degree in the coming time before the handover of
power in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office of the State Council, said at a seminar today that the
promotion of the basic law has become increasingly important as
time draws near 1999.
</P>
<P>
"More and more people want to know the law, which serves as the
constitutional law of Macao after 1999, and affairs in such
aspects as economy, culture and social affairs in the transitional
period should be transferred in accordance with principles of the
law," he said.
</P>
<P>
He highly praised the Promotion Association of the Macao Basic
Law, which organized today's seminar, saying that it has done a
great deal of effective work in the promotion of law, such as
opening special courses, compiling special textbooks and
introducing it into the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The deputy director stressed that promotion of the law is a
long-term task, and that he believes the promotion campaign will
continue to a further degree and to wider sphere.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile he said that people in China's mainland should also
study the law and abide by the law so that the policy of "one
country, two systems" will be implemented in Macao fully.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Stage Major War Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that
40,000 combat troops will begin to stage Thursday a series of
military exercises in northwestern province of East Azarbaijan.
</P>
<P>
The official Iran News Agency (IRNA) reported that the forces
are from the Basij (Volunteers) and the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps (IRGC).
</P>
<P>
The two-phase maneuver is intended to enhance the combat
readiness of participating forces, an anonymous commander of
Ashura-31 mechanized division was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here noted that the war games might be used
to alert the country's armed forces to what Iran has alleged as
"potential military threat" from the Israeli Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel signed a military accord early this year,
allowing Israeli air force to train over Turkish airspace. Iran
strongly opposed the military cooperation between Turkey and
Israel and claimed that it posed threat to its national security.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the first phase of the exercises will
be conducted for 10 days in the Sarab region.
</P>
<P>
Besides classic military training to keep the troops physically
fit, other camps for special training and ideological teachings
will be arranged during the maneuver, the commander said.
</P>
<P>
At the second stage, some 4,000 troops from the Basij and IRGC
are to perform the war games, but no details on the second phase
were disclosed, IRNA said.

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese Leader Stresses Top Tasks for Western Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese leader has
stressed that the essential tasks confronting ethnic minorities in
the western part of China are: developing the economy, improving
living standards, strengthening unity and maintaining stability.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and a member of
the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the remark during an
inspection tour to several cities in northwest China's Qinghai
Province between July 21-25.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC chairman, accompanied by provincial leaders Yin
Kesheng and Han Yingxuan, has visited a number of the state-owned
and township-run enterprises and exchanges views with the
entrepreneurs on deepening reform.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke highly of the achievements made by the Qinghai people
in economic and social development, particularly in areas of farm
and animal husbandry production, construction of a group of state
key projects, steady improvement of people's living standards and
the successful carrying out of the Communist Party's policies
concerning minority nationalities and religion.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that a wide gap still exists between western and
eastern areas of the country in terms of economic development and
people's living standards, and that greater efforts will be
required by from the western people to keep pace with their
eastern counterparts.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central government has formed the strategy to
expedite economic development in the western part of China, and
has offered energetic support in terms of finance, manpower and
talents.
</P>
<P>
He urged the western areas to open their minds, give full play
to their superiorities and work to turn their potential into
productivity.
</P>
<P>
The chairman noted that economic development cannot be
dispensed with unity and stability, which go hand-in-hand.
</P>
<P>
During his inspection, Li also visited the famous Tibetan
Buddhist Taer Monastery and had talks with members from religious
circles. He praised them for helping safeguard the unification of
the motherland and the unity between various Chinese nationalities.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said that in China, the fundamental interests and
goals are the same for both religious believers and
non-believers. He called on both groups to unite on the basis of
respecting the dignity of laws, guaranteeing the people's
interests, maintaining unity between nationalities and
safeguarding the unification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He hopes that the figures from religious circles in the
province will carry out their traditional patriotic values, and
continue to contribute to the province's stability and
development.

<HEADLINE> Algerian Airliner Hijacking Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The hijacking of an Algerian
jetliner with 232 passengers on board ended today several hours
after it began, reports reaching here say.
</P>
<P>
The Air Algerie Boeing 767, due to leave Oran Airport in
western Algeria for the capital Algiers, was hijacked by a lone
gunman at the airport at about 9 a.m. (0800 GMT), said the
reports, quoting an Interior Ministry statement.
</P>
<P>
Some five and a half hours later, the hijacking was announced
by authorities to have been "resolved," but no immediate details
were given.
</P>
<P>
Security forces had been deployed around the plane at the
airport in the coastal city some 360 kilometers west of Algiers,
said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker's nationality and motive are not known yet.
</P>
<P>
For the past five years, this north African country has been
plagued by a bloody civil war between the government and Islamic
extremists, who are trying to overthrow the secular government and
establish strict Islamic law. About 60,000 people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
In December 1994, Islamic extremists who were opposed to French
support of the Algerian government hijacked an Air France
jetliner, in which three passengers were killed.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Spurs Clinton on Settlement of Trade Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto has called on U.S. President Bill Clinton to settle
bilateral trade disputes on semiconductors and insurance by the
end of July, Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Clinton, Hashimoto said Japan is prepared to
take a flexible stance on insurance, saying a "political decision"
will be necessary to bridge the gap between the two sides, Kyodo
said, quoting government sources.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the United States are at odds over access to the
"third sector" of the Japanese insurance market which includes
such cover as nursing, cancer and personal accident insurance and
in which U.S. companies have a strong foothold.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. claims that Japan is poised to renege on a 1994 deal
by opening up this "third sector" before substantially
deregulating its primary life and non-life insurance sectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. says Japan should substantially liberalize these two
sectors of the insurance market before opening up the third.
</P>
<P>
But Japan argues that major Japanese insurers should be allowed
to tap the third sector by setting up subsidiaries. One of the
main sticking points is how soon Japanese subsidiaries should be
allowed to offer personal accident insurance.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are also in dispute over the replacement of a
five-year agreement on access to Japan's microchip market which
comes to an end on July 31.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto rejected as "meaningless" a U.S call for gauging the
foreign share of the Japanese microchip market using capital
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
Washington has demanded the two governments continue surveying
foreign market share after the current accord expires, fearing
that the foreign share will otherwise fall below its present level
of more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo, however, has rejected U.S. calls for another two-way
deal and says the surveys are no longer needed as they are
conducive to managed trade. Instead, Japan has proposed a global
government forum involving other countries to discuss the world
microchip industry.

"Now I really don't know to whom I should sell my grain," he
said.
</P>
<P>
His village, formerly a manor owned by one of the largest serf
lords in Tibet, is known for its grain production. It is located
in Changzhu Township in Nedong County.
</P>
<P>
His ancestors were all serfs of the manor. "My father told me
that my family rented 1.3 hectares of farmland from the serf
owner. But after delivering grain as land rents to the serf owner,
my father even had to borrow seeds from fellow villagers," he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
Later, his father was a serf of the Kaisong Manor and his
mother a serf at another manor. He did heavy farm work along with
his father when he was just eight.
</P>
<P>
"Even so, we did not have enough to eat the year round," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Before the serf system was overthrown in 1959, his family owed
the manor 14 tons of grain.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, we did not borrow so much grain. Our
heavy debt was caused by loans we had borrowed from the manor," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with the past, we are now living in a paradise," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Soinam Toinzhun's eldest daughter and son-in-law farm with
him. His eldest son drives a truck to transport goods for
customers and his youngest daughter studies in a city middle
school in another part of China.
</P>
<P>
His family of seven earned 54,000 yuan last year. He has built
an eight-room house and bought a color TV set and a variety of
furniture. His family also has a truck and a walking tractor.
</P>
<P>
"My family is rated as a middle-income earner in the village,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
As the head of the Kaisong Villages' Committee, he has led the
whole village to achieve prosperity.
</P>
<P>
His village now has 178 households with nearly 800
residents. Every family has built a new home, every two families
have a walking tractor, and the entire village has 100 farm
implements.
</P>
<P>
Its per-capita grain production was 1,000 kilograms and
per-capita net income -- 1,000 yuan -- in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"I am terribly sorry for being illiterate," he said, adding,
"Our generation grew up under the serf system, so we could not
afford to study. Now, we must do all we can to make sure our
children have a good education."
</P>
<P>
Ninety-five percent of the children in his village are now in
school, he said.

<HEADLINE> Anthrax Epidemic Hits Somali Camel Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 60 camels have died
of acute diarrhoea in the last ten days in the central Somali
Hiran and Galgudud regions.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr Mohamed Ahmed Jumale, a local veterinarian,
the camel population is suffering from a disease known as
anthrax.
</P>
<P>
Dr Jumale told the Xinhua correspondent today that the disease
is now confined to the camels only, "but it may as well pass to
the cattle and sheep if no preventive measures are taken".
</P>
<P>
The disease causes high fever followed by an acute diarrhoea.
It can kills all ruminants within a matter of a week.
</P>
<P>
Anthrax can also be transmitted to human beings (zoonosis) if
they eat its meat, drinking its milk or make a blood contact with
the sick animal.
</P>
<P>
Dr Jumale appealed to the international relief agencies to
provide the relatively safe regions of Somalia with veterinary
laboratories and drugs, so that the disease diagnosis would be
easier.
</P>
<P>
The doctor said vaccination is the best preventive action.
"Once the existence of the disease is discovered in the herd or
in the area, all animals in the nearby vicinity should be
vaccinated," he added.

<HEADLINE> US Peace Coordinator Visits Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Minister of Trade and
Industry Ali Abul Ragheb and visiting U.S. peace coordinator
Dennis Ross co-chaired a meeting here today to discuss bilateral
cooperation in the sectors of economy, trade, industry and
investment.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended on the Jordanian side by the
ministers of planning and finance as well as the governor of
Jordan's Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately known whether the meeting dealt with
U.S. economic aid to the kingdom, the local press and official
media said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. special envoy's tour came amid intensive efforts in
the region to give impetus to the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ross, the U.S. State Department's coordinator for the Mideast
peace process, tried to play down expectations from his visit by
saying, before he left for the Middle East, that his tour was not
aimed at restarting the frozen Israeli-Syrian talks or the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on final status.
</P>
<P>
Mideast peace talks have been stalled since hard-line Likud
party leader Benjamin Netanyahu won the Israeli May 29 elections.
</P>
<P>
The new Israeli prime minister has angered the Arabs by
rejecting the land-for-peace formula for peace talks. He also
opposes the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Ross described his modest goal of the tour as briefing Arab
leaders on Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's recent visit to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the U.S. envoy met with Jordanian
Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti late Wednesday, but the
outcome of the meeting was not disclosed, local media said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believed that Kabariti would have briefed Ross on
the outcome of his contacts with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
 Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara and Israeli Prime
Minister Netanyahu a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
They said the U.S. peace coordinator would have informed
Kabariti of his visit to Egypt and Syria and briefed him of
Netanyahu's visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ross met with Crown Prince Hassan, the Regent, before leaving
here today for Israel. King Hussein of Jordan is in London on
holiday.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived in Jordan late Wednesday on his Middle East tour
which also includes Egypt, Syria, Israel and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Arafat's visit to Syria most important </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The visit to Syria by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat is seen here as of great importance, a sign
of closer ties between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Arafat flew to Syria's Mediterranean port city of Latakia
Thursday and then drove to Kardahah to meet President Hafez
al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
According to informed Syrian sources, Arafat and Assad would
focus on the latest changes in the region and ways of reviving the
Middle East peace process stalled by Israel's hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital thought that Arafat's
visit was of great importance as it was the first to Syria since
the Palestinians and Israel signed the Oslo Agreement in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Syria complained about the lack of coordination when the
Palestinians decided to ink the accords, shedding light on
differences between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"The visit (by Arafat) can be seen as a thaw in the
Palestinian-Syrian relations," said a diplomat who referred not to
be named.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit was intended to coordinate Syrian and
Palestinian stands in the light of the Assad-Arafat meeting held
on the sidelines of the Cairo Arab summit convened last month.
</P>
<P>
His visit was also preceded by a meeting between him and
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Foreign Minister was reported to have asked Arafat
to tell Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al Sharaa that he was ready
to meet him "at any time and in any place."
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here remain cautious about what Syria may
reply to Levy's offer. "No breakthrough should be expected since
the two sides still are apart far," said a political observer.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, Arafat told reporters upon
his arrival at Latakia that his meeting with Assad was to take
place at a "critical time" since "we are facing dangerous
challenges."
</P>
<P>
He said he would "listen to his (Assad) precious advice in
order to be able to face these challenges."

<HEADLINE> Feature: A State Enterprise And The Market Economy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many state enterprises are following Huayao down the same road
to development. But sometimes it's a bumpy ride.
</P>
<P>
Huayao has launched joint ventures with overseas pharmaceutical
companies. It also has formed 14 foreign-invested programs with
companies mostly from industrialized countries, including the
Hoechst company from Germany, Wincent from the US, and Nichimen
from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, it introduced a contract system and leasing
businesses to improve its management.
</P>
<P>
All of these reforms brought sufficient capital, new management
methods and modern market strategies for Huayao. As many state
firms are hesitating or just testing the waters, Huayao's profits
have increased by 40 percent annually -- a miracle for a state
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Huayao bought a German pharmaceutical company. Its
target is to be named on the list of the world's top 100
pharmaceutical firms, and become the largest penicillin production
base on the planet.
</P>
<P>
"By noticing Huayao's success, we believe there will be a
bright future for state enterprises," said Feng Yu, an official
with the National Administrative Bureau of State-Owned Property.
</P>
<P>
Huayao is not a copy of a capitalist firm, though it adheres to
many management methods which are popular in the West.
</P>
<P>
"In business negotiation, if the foreign side insists on
controlling more than 50 percent of the shares in the joint
venture, we refuse its investment and look for a new one. We have
to make sure that the state always controls the corporation," said
Lian.
</P>
<P>
And Huayao always behaves like a gentleman when competing with
Chinese firms, he said. If it wanted to monopolize the market and
beat competitors, Huayao could adopt a price-cutting strategy, as
it is powerful enough to do so. But it never does, Lian said.
</P>
<P>
"This method can never be used, as it would ruin the entire
pharmaceutical industry of our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The firm's Party committees play a role in helping it operate
under a correct "political line," and the committees have
harmonious relations with the shareholders' groups.
</P>
<P>
It has a workers' representatives conference and trade
unions. Lian said that more workers are becoming bold enough to
write letters to the general manager, submitting suggestions for
improving management.
</P>
<P>
"I am proud to work for Huayao. And many of my friends asked me
to introduce them to work in the company," said Li Jun, a young
worker.

<HEADLINE> Feature: A State Enterprise And The Market Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- In 1958, when Wang Hongxing
became one of the first workers of the state-run North China
Pharmaceutical Factory, nicknamed "Huayao," he did not think that
the firm would one day become a partner with western entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Built with the help of the former Soviet Union and the former
German Democratic Republic, Huayao was a source of pride during
the Mao Zedong era, not only because it ended China's history of
importing penicillin, but also because it set an example of that
period's planned economy.
</P>
<P>
Based in Shijiazhuang, the capital of north China's Hebei
Province, the enterprise is now the largest pharmaceutical firm in
the country. Its huge empire includes 10,000 employees, a TV
station and newspaper, schools and kindergartens.
</P>
<P>
Wang, 59, still enjoys his nearly-free medical care and free
housing provided by Huayao. However, changes in Huayao have
affected many areas of his life.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Wang's salary and those of other workers have
increased yearly by an average 20 percent. His income is 15 times
higher than it was before the reform and opening-up. He purchased
10,000 shares of stock issued by his company in 1992, when many
other workers were afraid to take the chance.
</P>
<P>
Huayao was listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 1994. The
issuance of the shares has resulted in capital growth, and was one
of the reasons that Huayao generated profits.
</P>
<P>
The factory's former name has been changed to The North China
Pharmaceutical Group Corporation -- a change that hints at modern
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
The corporation now has a parent company and many autonomous
branches, none of which are manipulated by the government
departments as they were in the 1960s and 70s.
</P>
<P>
Huayao is a good example of a state enterprise that extricated
itself from a difficult position, said Lian Fazhe, vice-president
of the company.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises are the mainstay of the Chinese
economy. However, as they are affected by the planned economy,
many are not competitive in the newly-popular market model.
</P>
<P>
It remains an arduous job for the government to revive these
enterprises, whose recovery is important for the socialist nature
of the Chinese economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived Thursday at Syria's Mediterranean port city of Latakia for a
meeting with President Hafez al-Assad, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The visit, rare in years, was seen as a thaw in the relations
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, president of the Palestinian National Authority, was
greeted at the airport by Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa. They then drove to Assad's hometown of Kardahah to meet
the president.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have signed several agreements with Israel on
limited autonomy since 1993. But Syria had complained about the
lack of coordination with Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Assad met for the first time in years in Cairo a
month ago when a pan-Arab summit was held in the Egyptian capital.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak successfully mediated between the
two leaders.
</P>
<P>
For this time, they are expected to focus on the Middle East
peace process stalled by the change of government in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Likud -led new government has vowed to carry out hardline
policies toward the peace process, which provoke fears among the
Arab countries.

SINGAPORE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to fall

<HEADLINE> Burundian Army Denies Putsch Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A Burundian army spokesman today
denied the army was about to stage a coup, but "recommended" the
country's politicians work quickly avoid a "constitutional vacuum."
</P>
<P>
"If the army wanted to do a putsch, it could have done it long
time ago," Lieutenant-Colonel Longin Minani told the Agence France
Presse news agency in the Burundian capital Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to accusations by the party of Tutsi
President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, the Front for Democracy in
Burundi (PRODEBU) of a planned coup.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the deployment of parachute forces around the radio
and television stations in Bujumbura Tuesday evening, the army
spokesman said "the army can go where it wants."
</P>
<P>
Minani said, "The army is neutral. If (President) Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya stays in power, it is not a problem. If someone
else, it is a problem." he said.
</P>
<P>
"He (Ntibantunganya) leads the country from the (U.S.) embassy
and from Washington...We are there to make him safe," Minani said,
referring to deployment of the army in the capital following
outbreaks of fighting between troops and Hutu guerillas.
</P>
<P>
The president fled to the U.S. embassy in Bujumbura on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
Minani said that the army will not participate in negotiations
between politicians to find a successor to Ntibantunganya. "The
politicians should do it quick in order to avoid a constitutional
vacuum like the one in 1993. It is a recommendation," he said.
</P>
<P>
In October 1993, the Tutsi-dominated army staged a putsch and
killed Melchior Ndadaye, the first democratically elected Hutu
president of Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The country then plunged into inter-ethnic violence between the
majority Hutu race and the minority Tutsis, which has led to the
death of more than 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
In Nairobi today, Jean Minani, president of the FDB party,
accused the Burundian army of trying to finish the coup d'etat
they staged in 1993. He also denounced opposition politicians for
trying to choose a successor to Ntibantunganya.

<HEADLINE> Burundian President Appeals for Calm, PM Ready to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Burundian President Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya today appealed for calm, while the country's prime
minister has indicated that he will resign, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
"I beg the Burundian people to control themselves in these
difficult moments," Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted
Ntibantunganya as saying in a broadcast on Radio Burundi.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time the voice of the Hutu president had
been heard since taking refuge in the U.S. embassy in Bujumbura
Tuesday evening on fears of a coup d'etat by the country's
military which is dominated by the minority Tutsi race.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Belgian radio RTBF today, Ntibantunganya
said his own resignation is out of the question.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo, a Tutsi, said today
that he would resign as soon as a "competent authority is
available to receive" his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Nduwayo made the announcement in a letter to the Tutsi
opposition party of Unity for National Progress (UPRONA) in
Bujumbura, an AFP report said.
</P>
<P>
UPRONA president Charles Mukasi Wednesday read aloud a
declaration in front of the press denouncing Ntibantunganya and
said the party had "decided to withdraw consensus around Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya."
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Tutsi-dominated Burundian army
announced today that Hutu rebels staged two ambushes against
government troops in the south of the country, killing three
government soldiers.
</P>
<P>
But army spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Longin Minani, refused
to say whether there were any casualties on the Hutu side.
</P>
<P>
He described the whole situation in the country as calm. "There
isn't problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic fighting between the majority Hutus and the minority
Tutsis broke out in 1993 after the country's first democratically
elected Hutu president was murdered. More than 100,000 people are
estimated to have died in the conflict.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Who Manages China's Hotels? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua Correspondent Shi Xiaofan) -- Top
executives from world leading hotel management groups such as ITT
Hilton, Shangri-La, and Accor, have been shuttling to China in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
Their Asian excursions have been followed by announcements of
ambitious new expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
The hotel boom coincided with the headline news in the trade
media that 11 Chinese hotel management companies have won approval
from China National Tourism Administration. It brings the total
number of such firms to 27, injecting new vigor to the escalating
hotel management business in China.
</P>
<P>
But it poses the question: are these signals that Chinese and
overseas forces are on a par in their competition for the huge
hotel management market in China?
</P>
<P>
"'Survival of the fittest' still rules among the chandeliers,
the plush carpets and the en-suite bedrooms among China's
lucrative, but competitive, hotel trade.
</P>
<P>
Those who reign in the market in China will be those who have a
sharper competitive edge", commented Wei Xiao'an, Director of
CNTA's Department of Travel Agency and Hotel Management.
</P>
<P>
"While strongly supporting the growth of Chinese hotel
management forces, the Chinese Government always welcomes overseas
companies to enter the Chinese market," Wei added.
</P>
<P>
In 1983 the powerful Hong Kong-based Peninsula Group took the
lead by managing the Sino-overseas joint venture Jianguo Hotel in
Beijing, achieving a remarkable success.
</P>
<P>
It paved the way for overseas hotel management groups to enter
the Chinese market in a massive way.
</P>
<P>
More than a decade later, all of the world's leading hotel
management companies have a presence in China, with Holiday Inn,
Shangri-La, Hilton, ANA and Hyatt not only springing up in the
capital city of Beijing and metropolitan Shanghai, but also
remote regions such as Urumqi and Lhasa. They have brought a
world-standard 'room service' to choosy overseas tourists and
successful business customers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a newly-rising Chinese hotel management industry is
growing fast. Among its achievements is the winning of the first
and second places by White Swan Hotel in the selection of 100 best
Chinese hotels in 1995. White Swan Hotel in Guangzhou crowned the
list, while runner up was the Jinling Hotel in Nanjing. Both are
managed by Chinese hotel companies.
</P>
<P>
However, most Chinese hotel management experts hold that though
the Chinese hotel management companies have advantages such as
knowing the country better and being comparatively lower-priced,
they are still far from being on an equal footing with their
overseas counterparts.
</P>
<P>
With their advanced experience, strong personnel and technical
power and an international sales network, overseas hotel
management groups are now taking a lion's share of China's joint
venture hotels or five-star hotels, pointed out Mrs. Liu Wei,
chief of the Hotel Division of the Travel Agency and Hotel
Management Department of CNTA.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, except for a few outstanding exceptions such as
the Jinjiang and While Swan, most of the Chinese hotel management
companies are in their initial stages, either in terms of scale
and in terms of management level.
</P>
<P>
While a mature hotel management business is characterized by a
scientific management system, including an international sales
network, information system and pricing policies, most of the
Chinese companies are stressing service standards, service
procedures, and quality standards. But they cannot compete with
their overseas counterparts when it comes to international selling.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Sino-overseas competition can hardly be fair,
since overseas companies are enjoying preferential policies in
operations, taxation, and importation, Mrs. Liu noted.
</P>
<P>
"Overseas companies are expected to continue to expand their
markets, especially the up-beat market in China", Liu said.
</P>
<P>
She also noted that the hotel management market in China has
great potential, since among the over 1,900 star-rated hotels,
only less than 500 are managed by specialized hotel management
companies, which is in sharp contrast with developed countries.
</P>
<P>
For example, there are now over 2,000 hotels under the
franchise of Holiday Inn of the United States.

<HEADLINE> European Parliament's Resolution on Taiwan Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China's legislature has strongly
condemned the European Parliament's adoption of a resolution on
the so-called Taiwan's role in international organizations.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued today by the Foreign Affairs' Committee of
China's National People's Congress said the resolution
"constituted a wanton interference in China's internal affairs and
a reckless violation of the principles enshrined in the United
Nations Charter."
</P>
<P>
"We express our utmost indignation and strong protest" against
the European Parliament's behavior, which openly defies the basic
norms governing international relations," China's legislators said
in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament, instigated by a number of parliament
members, and regardless of repeated representations from the
Chinese side, passed the resolution on Taiwan on July 19 to echo
the anti-China forces in the world, the statement pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The resolution "brazenly and flagrantly supported the Taiwan
authorities' attempts to create 'two Chinas' and 'one China, one
Taiwan'" by attempting to "involve Taiwan in certain international
bodies in the first place and end up with Taiwan's 're-entry in
the U.N.'," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese
territory, and all affairs concerning Taiwan are the internal
affairs of China, which allow no external interference, be it from
a foreign government, a foreign parliament or a foreign force.
</P>
<P>
Some people in the European Parliament were poking their noses
too long, the statement said, adding that their 'disgusting
action', which runs counter to the common aspirations of the
international community and the policies of the European Union
member countries toward China, will come to no avail.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese legislature urged the European Parliament to face
up to the overall situation of friendly and cooperative relations
between China and European countries, and to take effective
measures to prevent such an event from being repeated.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banking Group Finances Teheran Subway Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese banks and monetary
institutions have decided to provide a 270 million US dollar worth
loan as buyer's credit for the Teheran Subway Project.
</P>
<P>
The Syndicated Loan Agreement which is organized by the China
International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) and signed
today involves more than a dozen of chinese noted commercial banks
and monetary institutions, including the China Construction Bank,
the Chinese Industrial and Commercial Bank, the Shanghai Branch of
Bank of Communications, CITIC Industrial Bank, the Bank of China,
the Import and Export Bank of China, and the Agricultural Bank of
China.
</P>
<P>
The project is the first with an overseas client being provided
with credit as a means of joint financing, and the biggest
mechanical and electronic product export deal the banking group
has made using that method. It is also the biggest consortium in
China so far in terms of number of participating banks and size of
financing, according to Wang Jun, chairman of CITIC.
</P>
<P>
The deal also includes export of 218 passenger carriages made
by the Changchun Passenger Car Company.
</P>
<P>
On a related note, the China North Industries Corporation will
begin construction work on an electrified railway in the Teheran
suburbs, as part of the underground railway project.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jun believed that the signing of the agreement has ushered
in a new chapter in the Sino-Iranian economic ties, technology
cooperation in particular. Iran has become one of the major
markets of China's exports of technology and complete sets of
equipment. Last year, the contracts for China's exports of its
technology and complete sets of equipment to Iran valued at 1.08
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's Population No Reason For Dalai Lama's Comments (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The population of Tibet, which has
often been distorted and used by the Dalai Lama to slander the
Chinese government, is in fact, at 2.39 million, almost twice what
it was in 1953, according to a 1995 survey.
</P>
<P>
In examining the facts, one can see very clearly that the Dalai
Lama, in "Shrinking of Tibetan population", has been lying and
that the following are true:
</P>
<P>
1). The Population of the Tibetan nationality has been on the
increase.
</P>
<P>
According to census data, the population of Tibetans in China
increased from 2.27 million in 1953 to 4.59 million in 1990, or 65
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the Tibet Autonomous Region, the total population increased
from 1.27 million in 1953 to nearly 2 million in 1990, a 72
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Data show that the birth rate and the population's natural
increase in Tibet have been higher than the average for China as a
whole. Tibet's population has never had a negative increase.
</P>
<P>
2). Ulterior motives in population rumor
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama left Tibet more than 30 years ago, so, in the
words of one Canadian Tibetologist, how can he be qualified to
know the facts there?
</P>
<P>
"China has made public the results of every census, but the
Dalai Lama ignores all these and continues his rumors," he says.
</P>
<P>
Although China's second census in 1964 showed a decline of
270,000 compared with the 1953 figure, it did not mean a negative
population rate, he says.
</P>
<P>
According to the scholar, because the first census in Tibet was
done by less experienced local personnel, there a discrepancy
between the results and reality.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a large number of young Tibetans studying in
inland areas and the flight of many people because of the
rebellion of the upper class in 1959 also account for the decrease
in the census.
</P>
<P>
A similar explanation was given by Chinese scholars quite some
time ago, but this has always been intentionally ignored by the
Dalai Lama, the scholar said.
</P>
<P>
In his book about modern Tibet, the scholar writes that because
of harsh natural conditions and the large number of celibate
Buddhist monks, the population in Tibet had been declining for
hundreds of years, and, that it was only after the democratic
reform that this trend was reversed.
</P>
<P>
"After the democratic reform, Tibet jumped directly into a
socialist society from a serf system, and everyone could get his
own land and enjoy free health care," said an official with the
Tibet Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"So the death rate suddenly dropped and the birth rate
increased," he noted, explaining that the birth rate in the 1953
to 1964 period was as high as 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Ever since the people's government started its work, the
population in Tibet has been increasing healthily," he added.

<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- General Zhang Wannian,
vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, said here
today that the development of co-operation between China and
Thailand and between the two countries' armed forces is conducive

</P>
<P>
The development is also conducive to the two countries'

co-operation. He said that the Thai government and people
appreciate China's serious and conscientious attitude toward peace

<HEADLINE> Guizhou Comprehensive Wildlife Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A survey of wild animals and their
living conditions in southwest China's Guizhou Province is now
being conducted.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 researchers from government departments, scientific
institutes, and universities are doing a thorough study
of species, numbers, habitat, and protection of wild animals, as
well as of domestication and trade related to them.
</P>
<P>
The survey is expected to be completed by 1999, at which time
researchers will choose places for longer-term observation.
</P>
<P>
They will also do a study of the environment of aquatic birds.
</P>
<P>
The province is located in a sub-tropical damp region with
rolling hills and mountains that are criss-crossed by rivers.
Advantageous geographical features and natural conditions provide
a favorable environment for wildlife.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jilin's Tree Planting Greater Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- This northeastern Chinese
province has planted more than 440,000 ha of forests over the past
15 years, or 114 percent of its targeted area, according to the
provincial forestry department.
</P>
<P>
The middle and western parts of the province, like many other
areas in north China, have been plagued by wind storms in the
past, so the government started working on a giant afforestation
project 15 years ago, to cover Jilin Province, as well as other
northern, northwestern, and northeastern areas.
</P>
<P>
To see that the project goes smoothly, a responsibility system
for provincial officials was introduced.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has invested 160 million yuan into
afforestation in recent years. According to the forestry
department, tree-covered areas in the middle and western parts
amount to 1.22 million ha, with forest coverage of 14.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's Population No Reason For Dalai Lama's Comments (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
3) Tibetans remain major part of Tibet's population
</P>
<P>
As the home of the Tibetan people, Tibet remains over 90
percent Tibetan since the peaceful liberation.
</P>
<P>
According to the second, third and fourth census, the
percentage of Tibetans in the region's entire population was 96.6
in 1964, 94.4 in 1982, and 95.5 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
According to Duntrul, vice chairman of the Tibet Autonomous
Regional People's Government, Tibetans account for major part of
Tibet's increased population, "The migrating population only
accounts for 16 percent of the region's population increase and,
most of those are workers and technicians coming to assist the
construction here and will go back to other provinces after the
completion of the construction projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Thubtan, director of the Tibet Public Health
Department, although since 1985, each couple has been encouraged
to have three children because of natural limits, at present,
four-children families still accounts for 40 percent of the total
families in the region.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by the year 2050 the population of
Tibetans in Tibet will reach 4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
4). Population policy based on public health and poverty relief
</P>
<P>
"In Tibet, the population policy is based on the real situation
and the needs of the Tibetan people", Thubtan said. He explained
that although the region is vast and thinly populated, its natural
conditions are harsh.
</P>
<P>
There are still 450,000 people in 17 counties living below
the poverty line. According to Thubtan, these families mostly have
six or seven, or even more, children.
</P>
<P>
"The family planning policy is well understood by farmers and
herdsmen, and many women of childbearing age give birth to only
one child. We have to persuade them to bear more," Thubtan noted.
</P>
<P>
He explained that currently the family planning policy only
applies to urbanites, and for farmers and herdsmen, only an idea
of fewer children brought up well is instilled.
</P>
<P>
"Such phenomena as forced abortions and sterilization that have
been mentioned by some people, don't exist," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the public health
department, most farmers and herdsmen think that three children
are enough, and don't want to have an unlimited number of children
like previous generations.
</P>
<P>
The government's goal in Tibet is to provide greater health
care for mothers and their children to relieve them from the
burden bearing too many and to improve the standard of living in
the whole region, Thubtan said.
</P>
<P>
China's population policy focused on mother and child care
efforts has been affirmed by the UN Children's Fund, the UN
Population Fund and the World Health Organization, and slanderous
remarks about this policy will be ignored by most of the world.

<HEADLINE> Black Boxes From TWA Crash Recovered From Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Divers searching the wreckage of
TWA Flight 800, which exploded and plunged into the sea near New
York City on July 17, recovered the flight data and cockpit voice
recorders shortly before midnight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The so-called black boxes were found by a robotic vehicle
probing through the largest concentration of plane wreckage down
on the ocean floor, said Robert Francis, vice chairman of the
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).
</P>
<P>
The devices, considered crucial for investigators to determine
the cause of the explosion a week ago that killed all 230 people
aboard the Boeing 747, would be flown immediately to Washington
D.C. for examination, he said.
</P>
<P>
The recovery represented a major breakthrough in the probe of
the second-worst airline disaster in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 747 jumbo jet exploded in a fireball and plunged
into the Atlantic Ocean around 20:45 p.m. U.S. eastern time (or
24:45 GMT) on July 17, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Flight data and cockpit voice recorders are installed on almost
all modern passenger planes as standard equipment.
</P>
<P>
The voice recorder picks up cockpit conversations and could, in
the TWA 800's case, indicate whether the crew knew if there was a
problem before the crash and what action, if any, was taken to try
to avoid the disaster.
</P>
<P>
The flight data recorder, meanwhile, picks up such information
as a plane's altitude, speed and various equipment functions. It
could help determine whether a mechanical problem caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
To date, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has not
determined whether the jetliner was downed by a bomb, a missile or
mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
Victims' relatives have been complaining bitterly about the
pace of the search, and the White House said President Bill
Clinton would fly to New York on Thursday to meet them.

BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The world's top bicycle producer
and consumer, with its annual production capacity of 55 million
units and 450 million in use, produced 14.48 million bicycles in
the first half of the year, 4.56 million fewer than the same
period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
These figures come from Qiu Boxin, deputy secretary-general of
the China Bicycle Association, who noted that China exported 4.14
million bicycles to North America alone last year. About 25
percent of the bicycles produced each year are for export.
</P>
<P>
During the country's Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995),
China turned out 196 million bicycles, 53.9 million of which were
sold abroad.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show that China exported 3.86 million
bicycles in the January-May period this year.
</P>
<P>
China has 250 bicycle manufacturers and more than 700 spare
parts producers.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Provide Food, Petroleum to Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has agreed to provide
food stuffs and petroleum to Afghanistan and two Afghan ministers
will come to discuss the issue in detail, a Pakistani Foreign
Office spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press briefing at the foreign office this
afternoon, the spokesman said that the supply of food and
petroleum was in response to a request of Afghan new Prime
Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
</P>
<P>
"Hekmatyar's representative in Pakistan, Ghariat Baheer, called
on Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on July 1, 1996 and
conveyed Hekmatyar's request for supply of food stuffs and
petroleum from Pakistan on the payment basis," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan always responds positively to the request of Afghan
people," he stressed, adding, "the government of Pakistan has
invited a ministerial delegation from Afghanistan to visit
Pakistan to discuss the supply in detail."
</P>
<P>
"We have been informed that Afghan Interior Minister Yunus
Qanooni and Finance Minister Abdul Arghandewal will reach Pakistan
on August 2 for discussing the modalities for the transport and
payment," he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the visit will prove fruitful and
further bilateral relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, the spokesman said that Pakistan has sent
a delegation to Kabul to assess the conditions for reopening the
Pakistani embassy in the Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
Reopening the embassy will mainly depend on the "security"
condition, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani Embassy in Kabul was badly damaged last September
when thousands of Afghan protesters attacked it.
</P>
<P>
Many Pakistani diplomats including the ambassador were injured
in the incident and Pakistan closed the embassy later.

DAMASCUS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Madrid formula is the only way to
resume peace talks in the Middle East, today's local newspaper
Al-Baath, the mouthpiece of the Syrian ruling party, said in an
editorial.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government headed by Benjamin Natanyahu has closed
the doors for pushing forward the peace process and blocked the
resumption of the peace talks, especially on the Syrian track,"
the editorial noted.
</P>
<P>
It said that Syria, which has cooperated with the U.S. and
other international parties in a bid to push the peace process
forward, appreciates the efforts of these parties made for the
continuation of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, it noted that Syria could not accept negotiation for
the sake of negotiation and that Syria is not in a hurry to hold a
new round of talks for the sake of talks only.
</P>
<P>
"It is no use to resume the peace negotiations unless they are
based on the principles of the Madrid conference and the relevant
U.N. resolutions," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad met Wednesday in Damascus with
Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator of the Middle East peace
process. Ross bought to the president a written message from
U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Ross's recent visit to Syria was intended to bolster the peace
process and to reconsider the possibility of resuming the peace
talks.

<P>
BANGKOK, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A female elephant with rare black
tusks has been found in Thailand's northern province of Phayao,
according to the Thai news agency today.
</P>
<P>
Veterinarians and experts have confirmed that the
three-inch-long tusks of the female elephant are authentically
black.
</P>
<P>
It is extremely unusual for a female elephant to develop tusks,
they said.
</P>
<P>
If a female elephant does develop tusks, the tusks should be
short and white, they added.
</P>
<P>
The owner of the elephant said he will follow the tradition to
bestow the elephant to King Bhumibol Adulyadej to mark the 50th
anniversary of his accession to the throne.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Completes Mission in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) concluded Wednesday the largest
repatriation and reintegration program in Africa, with about 1.7
million Mozambican refugees having returned home since 1993.
</P>
<P>
In formal ceremonies Wednesday, the U.N. refugee agency turned
over 1,571 integration projects worth 80 million U.S. dollars to
the Mozambican government, marking an end to its mission in the
country.
</P>
<P>
These projects, including rehabilitation and construction of
clinics, hospitals, schools and water facilities, would be
incorporated in Mozambique's long-term development plans, said
UNHCR in a press release.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR would close down the remaining few of a total of 20 field
offices in the African country by September, and would only
maintain a small presence in the capital of Maputo to handle
refugees and asylum seekers after that.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian agency completed the phasing-out of food
distribution to returnees, which at its peak had benefited over 1
million people by April 1996.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR had by October 1995 helped bring home some 378,000 of a
total of 1.7 million Mozambican refugees who fled civil war in
1980s to Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Swaziland, South Africa and
Tanzania. The 1.3 million others, majority of them in Malawi,
returned home spontaneously.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation operation started in 1993 following the
signing of a peace accord in October 1992, which ended a 20-year
civil war in the country. The war has left over 1 million people
dead and up to 4 million displaced internally during the
conflict.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Police Arrest Rebel Suspects After Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Police arrested 27 suspected Tamil
rebels in Wellawatte of Colombo today in connection with a train
blast in the Sri Lankan capital on Wednesday that claimed 78
lives, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
Police investigations have established that three briefcases
containing bombs were put into three compartments on the crowded
office train just before its departure from the Fort station in
Colombo.
</P>
<P>
After questioning several eye witnesses and railway workers,
the investigators said they believed the perpetrators alighted at
the Wellawatte station.
</P>
<P>
The sources said a railway employee removed one of the
briefcases after he found it looking suspicious. A bomb squad of
the army later defused the bomb.
</P>
<P>
When the train halted at Dehiwala, some passengers raised an
alarm for a possible bomb and police were alerted while all the
passengers alighted from the train. But they boarded it again
before the police could arrive.
</P>
<P>
The remaining two bombs went off in the second and seventh
compartments when the train was about to pull out of Dehiwala
station at 6:10 PM local time (1240 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The investigators, who suspected that the rebel Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) was responsible for the blast,
arrested 21 men and six women in a raid today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, official reports said that about 500 were injured in
the blast, some in critical condition.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Who Manages China's Hotels? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua Correspondent Shi Xiaofan) -- Top
executives from world leading hotel management groups such as ITT
Hilton, Shangri-La, and Accor, have been shuttling to China in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
Their Asian excursions have been followed by announcements of
ambitious new expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
The hotel boom coincided with the headline news in the trade
media that 11 Chinese hotel management companies have won approval
from China National Tourism Administration. It brings the total
number of such firms to 27, injecting new vigor to the escalating
hotel management business in China.
</P>
<P>
But it poses the question: are these signals that Chinese and
overseas forces are on a par in their competition for the huge
hotel management market in China?
</P>
<P>
"'Survival of the fittest' still rules among the chandeliers,
the plush carpets and the en-suite bedrooms among China's
lucrative, but competitive, hotel trade.
</P>
<P>
Those who reign in the market in China will be those who have a
sharper competitive edge", commented Wei Xiao'an, Director of
CNTA's Department of Travel Agency and Hotel Management.
</P>
<P>
"While strongly supporting the growth of Chinese hotel
management forces, the Chinese Government always welcomes overseas
companies to enter the Chinese market," Wei added.
</P>
<P>
In 1983 the powerful Hong Kong-based Peninsula Group took the
lead by managing the Sino-overseas joint venture Jianguo Hotel in
Beijing, achieving a remarkable success.
</P>
<P>
It paved the way for overseas hotel management groups to enter
the Chinese market in a massive way.
</P>
<P>
More than a decade later, all of the world's leading hotel
management companies have a presence in China, with Holiday Inn,
Shangri-La, Hilton, ANA and Hyatt not only springing up in the
capital city of Beijing and metropolitan Shanghai, but also
remote regions such as Urumqi and Lhasa. They have brought a
world-standard 'room service' to choosy overseas tourists and
successful business customers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a newly-rising Chinese hotel management industry is
growing fast. Among its achievements is the winning of the first
and second places by White Swan Hotel in the selection of 100 best
Chinese hotels in 1995. White Swan Hotel in Guangzhou crowned the
list, while runner up was the Jinling Hotel in Nanjing. Both are
managed by Chinese hotel companies.
</P>
<P>
However, most Chinese hotel management experts hold that though
the Chinese hotel management companies have advantages such as
knowing the country better and being comparatively lower-priced,
they are still far from being on an equal footing with their
overseas counterparts.
</P>
<P>
With their advanced experience, strong personnel and technical
power and an international sales network, overseas hotel
management groups are now taking a lion's share of China's joint
venture hotels or five-star hotels, pointed out Mrs. Liu Wei,
chief of the Hotel Division of the Travel Agency and Hotel
Management Department of CNTA.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, except for a few outstanding exceptions such as
the Jinjiang and While Swan, most of the Chinese hotel management
companies are in their initial stages, either in terms of scale
and in terms of management level.
</P>
<P>
While a mature hotel management business is characterized by a
scientific management system, including an international sales
network, information system and pricing policies, most of the
Chinese companies are stressing service standards, service
procedures, and quality standards. But they cannot compete with
their overseas counterparts when it comes to international selling.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Sino-overseas competition can hardly be fair,
since overseas companies are enjoying preferential policies in
operations, taxation, and importation, Mrs. Liu noted.
</P>
<P>
"Overseas companies are expected to continue to expand their
markets, especially the up-beat market in China", Liu said.
</P>
<P>
She also noted that the hotel management market in China has
great potential, since among the over 1,900 star-rated hotels,
only less than 500 are managed by specialized hotel management
companies, which is in sharp contrast with developed countries.
</P>
<P>
For example, there are now over 2,000 hotels under the
franchise of Holiday Inn of the United States.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scentist Challenges the Conclusion of Venus Reverse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist has sent the
solar system into a spin - by claiming that astronomy circles have
been spinning a wrong yarn for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Venus, claims Huang Yuan, is not the odd one out after all.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion accepted by world astronomy circles for more
than 30 years is that the planet Venus rotates in reverse compared
to all the other planets, including earth.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, people believed that all the planets in the
solar system should rotate in the same direction. But in 1961
through radar wave studies, it was discovered that Venus was
rotating in a reverse direction.
</P>
<P>
Since then the conclusion has been written into textbooks in
every country of the world. The reason why the Venus rotated
reversely remained a mystery for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Based on twenty years of observation and research, Huang, a
popular science writer from northwest China's Shaanxi province,
discovered that the Venus is actually rotating in the same
direction as the other planets.
</P>
<P>
He believes that instead of actual moving, the so-called
reverse rotation of the Venus is an unreal image of human
sight - a trick of the human eye.
</P>
<P>
In 1984 he noticed this phenomena through simulated tests. In
1994 he finished writing the paper "Truth of the Reverse Rotation
of the Venus" which will be read out at the coming 30th
International Geology Conference to be held in Beijing next month.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang Yuan, since the planets were originally
formed by the outer materials of the sun thrown out along a
magnetic line of force, their direction of rotation and revolution
should be in line with that of the sun, and, the Venus is no
exception.
</P>
<P>
According to his calculation, the Venus is a planet with
tendency of no rotation, its rotation is 13.2 times slower than
its revolution.
</P>
<P>
It is just because that the Venus's rotation is much slower, it
seems to be rotate reversely in observations from the Earth, the
scientist believes.
</P>
<P>
"This is just like that we see the Sun moving from the east to
the west, but actually it runs from the west to the east," he
says.

JAKARTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen today reiterated China's policy on the Taiwan
issue, saying that the issue can only be resolved by Chinese
people themselves.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at a joint news conference attended by
ASEAN members and their ten dialogue partners, the Chinese
minister said there is only one China in the world -- the People's
Republic of China -- and Taiwan is part of China.
</P>
<P>
The government of the People's Republic of China is the sole
legitimate government representing all China, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The policies of the government of the People's Republic of
China for the settlement of the Taiwan issue are peaceful
reunification and 'one country, two systems'," Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in the Taiwan Strait, Qian said that as long
as there is no foreign intervention or independence and separatist
activities in the Taiwan Strait, "no tension will be raised in the
Strait."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference
(PMC) and Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said ASEAN held

PARIS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The cohabitation between Hutus and Tutsis in Burundi has
ended. Burundi has never ceased to pay for the assassination of
its first democratically elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, who
was killed in the October 1993 putsch. Since the genocide took
place in neighboring Rwanda in July 1994, both Tutsis and Hutus in
Burundi have been living in psychosis of being exterminated by the
other.
</P>
<P>
-- Hundreds of Libyan prisoners were killed during the
suppression of a mutiny which took place in the Libyan capital
Tripoli early this month. "A unit of special security coming on
board vehicles equipped with missiles" attacked a prison in
Tripoli, which led to a massacre of prison inmates by the Guide of
Revolution elite unit.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey's new government led by Necmettin Erbakan is faced
with what it called "a blackmail of death." The third prisoner on
hunger strike died Wednesday. The international image of the
first Islamist government in the modern history of Turkey is
suffering from the prison rebellion.
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu re-launches
"Lebanese option" by proposing Israeli withdrawal from its
self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in exchange for a
disarmament of the Hezbolla guerrillas. The success of such an
operation will depend on the mood of Syria.
</P>
<P>
-- The expected return to earth in August of three Russian
astronauts on the Mir space station is postponed for at least six
weeks, because the Atlantis space shuttle which will go to fetch
them is having a break-down. Since the dismembering of the USSR,
Russia's space program survives on American aid.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar's Former Desert Peninsula Becoming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar's former Desert
peninsula of Nungwi is rapidly becoming a tropical resort under a
government investment plan worth millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
The London-based East Africa Development Company (EADC) and
the Zanzibar government are pouring a total of 540 million U.S.
Dollars into the 50-kilometer peninsula strip along which a
complex of luxury hotels, resort villages and marine facilities
are being built.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar government has agreed to contribute 24 percent of
the amount and the rest would be paid by the EADC, government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The project, scheduled to be completed by the year 2000, will
cultivate 3,936 acres of forest and parkland along the now desert
peninsula, by planting tropical pines.
</P>
<P>
So far, 100 million U.S. Dollars have been disbursed for the
commencement of the first phase which will see the building up of
a five-star hotel, and a golf and country club, they disclosed.
</P>
<P>
This would be followed by the construction of a presidential
villa to have 200 Mediterranean-style luxury apartments and
suites, coupled with a stretch of tropical plazas and gardens.
</P>
<P>
The second and final phase, to cost 340 U.S. Dollars, involve
the development of community buildings and services, construction
of a medical center with a police station, emergency facilities,
clinics, pharmacies, fire brigade and an ambulance station.
</P>
<P>
An ocean marine center, to be situated at eastern Nungwi, will
also be built, it was said.
</P>
<P>
The EADC and the Zanzibar government said all this has been
designed with environmental consideration in mind with solar
energy used. The planting of pines is also expected to reduce
erosion and curb the desertification of the peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Processing Trade in Shanghai Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Processing trade in Shanghai,
which accounts for nearly half of local export earnings, has
experienced slower progress so far this year.
</P>
<P>
During the first half this year, the city conducted 4.92
billion US dollars in foreign processing trade, an increase of 5.4
percent over the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But it was a big drop compared with the 50 percent growth rate
in 1995 over 1994.
</P>
<P>
The city now gives priority to processing service with imported
materials, to handle 3.91 billion US dollars in the sector's
foreign trade during the six-month period.
</P>
<P>
The city enjoyed a speedy development in processing with
materials provided by buyers. Such materials amounted to one
billion US dollars worth, an increase of more than 68 percent over
the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Local foreign-funded enterprises contributed a lot to the
city's processing trade, to conduct more than 3.2 billion US
dollars worth of foreign trade in the sector, rising nearly 30
percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Imported materials include steel, cotton cloth, components for
telecommunication equipment, semi-conductor parts, accessories for
clothing, plastic materials, and synthetic fibers for textiles.
</P>
<P>
The completed goods for export include machinery products,
garments, textile, rolled steel, toy, shoes and plastic products.
</P>
<P>
This year the city aims to get 1.5 billion US dollars by
exporting the completed goods made with materials provided by
buyers.

<HEADLINE> Doctors at Loss in Dealing With Food-Poisoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Japanese medical experts are at a loss
in dealing with the spread of food poisoning which has claimed
seven lives in just two months, Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
They blame the deaths mainly on hemolytic uremic syndrome
(HUS), a potentially fatal complication caused by a toxin called
vero which is produced by the bacteria and is marked by symptoms
such as kidney failure and a decline in blood platelets resulting
in bleeding.
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 6,200 children inflicted by the food poisoning
epidemic in Sakai, a southern suburb of Osaka in western Japan,
more than 100 have developed HUS. They need intensive treatment
such as hemodialysis.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has vowed to make every effort
to combat the epidemic as the number of victims stood at 8,495 at
6:00 p.m. Wednesday in all but four of the nation's 47
prefectures. More than 500 people remain hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
This is the nation's worst outbreak of food poisoning since
salmonella sickened about 10,000 people in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts say it is difficult to treat people with HUS as
antibiotics are neither the best preventive nor cure for the
syndrome.

<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Culture has taken
stern actions against a group of cinemas, cultural centers, and
video rooms that persisted in showing illegal video materials, and
closed many companies producing pornographic or pirated video
tapes, according to China Culture News.
</P>
<P>
Two shopping centers in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous

because they were dealing in illegal electronic materials.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Province Preparing To Repay World Bank Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China's poverty-ridden Guizhou
Province, in the southwest, intends to establish a reserve fund
for repayment of World Bank loans by the end of this year,
according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhi, an official at the province's office that oversees
World Bank loans, told reporters that Guizhou has had a fairly
good repayment record.
</P>
<P>
"However, repayment could be difficult as the World Bank-backed
projects here are mostly related to education, public health, and
poverty reduction and will quite likely yield few direct economic
benefits," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
To ease future repayment pressures, the provincial government
has decided to set up reserve funds in financial departments of
various levels and in units involved in the projects, Yang
explained, noting that a debt management system primarily based on
repayment funds is already in place in the province.
</P>
<P>
Official data show that a total of 15 World Bank-financed
projects have been implemented in Guizhou since 1983, with loans
adding up to 216 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"World Bank loans have helped to make up for shortfalls in
construction funds and bolstered our effort to alleviate poverty,"
Yang pointed out, citing the Bank's Southwest Poverty Reduction
Project, which will help lift 830,000 people out of poverty by its
completion in the year 2000, as an example.
</P>
<P>
In another case, Yang said, Guizhou has been able to build
1,162 new schools in 20 poverty-stricken counties since a World
Bank-backed education project was implemented in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Yang revealed that Guizhou, which has nearly eight million
people with a per capita annual net income of less than 300 yuan
(about 36 US dollars), plans to make use of 500 million US dollars
in World Bank loans from now until 2000.

<HEADLINE> Guerrillas Kill One SLA Officer in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 25 (Xinhua) -- One security officer of the South
Lebanese Army (SLA) was reportedly killed this morning by
guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the
so-called "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the militia wing of Hezbollah,
announced that one group of its fighters detonated a mine
targeting a white Mecerdez Benz on the road of Beit Lif, Bint
Jbail, at 8:00 a.m. (0500GMT).
</P>
<P>
Abou Kassem, a senior security officer of the Israeli client
militia SLA, was killed inside the car, the Islamic Resistance
said in a statement broadcast over Hezbollah's radio.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the operation, the Israeli occupation forces
from their positions in the border strip bombarded the
vicinities of Yater village, Bint Jbail, with a number of
heavy shells, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong SLA militia, commanded by General Antoine
Lahd, a retired Lebanese Army commander, is trained and armed
by Israel in order to assist some 1,000 Israeli troops in
patrolling the 850-square-kilometer buffer zone.

TOKYO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Market prices of basic materials
such as steel products, nonferrous metals and petrochemical
products in Japan are rising, showing a sign that deflationary
trends in such prices are coming to an end, a business daily

<P>
KAMPALA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 Plantation workers at
luwagala tea estates in southern Uganda joined their colleagues
in strike yesterday for more pay and better conditions, said a
report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The affected three estates are located near lugazi, a town
some 60 kilometers east of Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The workers demanded a 54 percent pay increase yesterday, and
they earned just 11,000 - 35,000 shillings (some 11 - 35 U.S.
Dollars) a month, the English daily ''the New Vision'' said.
</P>
<P>
The workers also complained about poor conditions including
leaking roofs and lack of proper toilets at their residence.
</P>
<P>
Three days earlier, another 2,400 workers in Kasaku tea
estates -- also near town lugazi -- laid down their tools,
demanding improvement of conditions and increase of pay.
</P>
<P>
However, the affected three estates were reported to be calm
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the management of Kasaku tea estates
ordered the striking workers to resume work by Friday or face
dismissal. The matter will be brought before the industrial
court, and the management will not negotiate with the workers,
the General Manager of Kasaku tea estates warned.

<P>
SHANGHAI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Pudong New Area, to the east of
China's economic powerhouse Shanghai city, has made a giant leap
forward in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
During the first half this year 1.93 billion
yuan has been injected into four key zones in the area, including
Lujiazhui Finance and Trade Zone, Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone,
Jinqiao Export Processing District and Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park.
</P>
<P>
The six-month period also saw the area invest 1.91 billion yuan
in infrastructure work, greatly advancing the task of building a
multiple-lane tunnel beneath the river, the east section of the
city's second subway route, and a power plant in Waigaoqiao zone.
</P>
<P>
During the period the number of new foreign-funded projects in
the area rose nearly 40 percent over the same period in 1995 to
reach 430, involving more than 1.5 billion US dollars in
contractual investment, rising more than 42 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Of the new projects, 51 are costing more than 10 million US
dollars each, with their contractual investment accounting for
nearly 84 percent of the total of the 430 projects.

<HEADLINE> New-type Laser Device Expected to Go into Use in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China has developed the world's
first new, ultra high-speed laser device.
</P>
<P>
It will increase the capacity of information stored on laser
discs, make radar equipment even more precise and improve the
accuracy of laser scalpels used in life-saving surgery, say
experts in China.
</P>
<P>
The ultra diffraction laser device is expected to go into use
in China soon.
</P>
<P>
The device was developed by a research team led by Wang
Shaomin, a professor of Hangzhou University in east China's
Zhejiang Province, and has been registered with the Patent Office
of China.
</P>
<P>
The new device will help reduce the volume of integrated
circuits, increase the capacity of laser discs and improve
precision radar devices and scalpels, according to Chinese
scientists.
</P>
<P>
The device poses a challenge to the conventional view that
Gaussian light beams set the diffraction limit for laser devices,
allowing for a new generation of laser beams of even higher
quality and properties.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Untied Nations Food Program
has initiated its second agricultural assistance program involving
more than 100 million yuan-worth of aid to southwest China's
mountainous Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural comprehensive development program, carried out
in Tongren Prefecture, provided 94,853 tons of wheat from the
United Nations Food Program and 72.8 million yuan from the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
The area, listed among the State Council's key poverty-stricken
areas that need relief, covers 17 townships and reaches 259,000
people -- some 62 percent of whom are of ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
In the natural disaster-ridden area, the annual per-capita
grain ration produced by local residents is registered at only 161
kg, and per-capita net income is less than 400 yuan. Residents'
financial survival depends primarily on state aid.
</P>
<P>
The UN program is aimed at renovating 9,362 ha of low-yield
field, improving 3,607 ha of irrigation area, planting 6,464 ha of
forest, building 14 roads and providing technical training to
650,000 farmers.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Fourth Prisoner dies in Hunger Strike in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A fourth prisoner, identified as
Huseyin Demircioglu, died in Ankara Center Jail this morning
following the deaths of three prisoners in Istanbul as a result
of a continuous hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
While the 67-day-long hunger strike in progress throughout Turkish
prisons claimed its fourth victim today, the Turkish Justice
Ministry refused to yield ground to prevent further deaths.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Sevket Kazan, a leading Islamist politician,
issued a call to the inmates Wednesday, urging them to end their
protest "if they want to enjoy facilities they were provided
beyond the limits permitted by existing laws and regulations."
</P>
<P>
Kazan said that the Turkish government will keep implementing
rules "being applied in prisons throughout the world."
</P>
<P>
The hunger strike started after former Justice Minister Mehmet
Agar issued decrees for the implementation of strict measures in
prisons repeatedly on May 6, 8 and 10.
</P>
<P>
Agar, now interior minister, reopened Eskisehir prison and
transferred prisoners there from Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Writers Yasar Kemal, Orhan Pamuk and Zulfu Livaneli made a
joint statement saying that the jails in Turkey were no different
from hell on earth. They said the hunger strike at present are not
meant to ask for political demands, but for very basic human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Kazan also said that the government was not insensitive to the
deaths in prisons and appealed for support to end the hunger
strikes.
</P>
<P>
He said that there were 8,900 people arrested and convicted
under the Anti-Terrorism Law and 53,000 prisoners in Turkey's
jails.

<HEADLINE> Being Prepared Saves Lives in Xijiang Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The six million people along the
reaches of the Xijiang River in Guigang, Guiping, Pingnan,
Tengxian, Cangwu and Wuzhou have survived one of the worst ever
floods - without a single casualty.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the counties and cities say it proves the old
proverb: where there is precaution, there is no danger.
</P>
<P>
From July 19 the section of the river between Guigang and
Wuzhou has risen sharply. Now the flood peak has passed the
reaches in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
In Wuzhou City and Pingnan Country, losses caused by the floods
this year are nothing compared to the massive losses of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years the region has given top priority to
flood control work.
</P>
<P>
Pingnan County designed and built a flood prevention dike,
while Guiping City set aside three million yuan (about 361,000 US
dollars) for the maintenance of dikes and reservoirs, prepared
350,000 sand bags and other materials, and organized a team of
300,000 people for flood prevention tasks.
</P>
<P>
Civilians in the reaches sought support from soldiers to deal
with flood emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Before this year's floods, cities and counties along the river
checked and consolidated their dikes - to prepare and avert danger
for the communities living along the river.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Maize Prices so Low in Zambia? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has reaped a bumper harvest
this year, bringing joy to the farmers, which suffered from
drought and famines some years ago, but their joy is eroded by
the low prices they face when selling their maize.
</P>
<P>
Some maize marketing agents are buying a 90-kilogram bag of
maize at 7,000 to 8,000 kwacha (about six to seven US dollars)
and in some parts of the country farmers can only get as low as
2,500 kwacha for a bag.
</P>
<P>
The farmers are making losses as at least 10,000 kwacha per
bag can make up for the maize production cost.
</P>
<P>
The maize marketing agents are pushing the maize prices down
and down by taking advantage of the abundant supplies and the
farmers' desperate need for money to survive, to pay their
children's school fees and repay their input loans.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the rush sale of the maize at the give away
prices is the experience the farmers had in 1993, when they
received pieces of paper in the name of promissory notes in
exchange for their maize.
</P>
<P>
Worse still it took the maize agents almost a year to honor
parts of the promissory notes and many of the notes have
allegedly never been honored in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
At that time the notes had made many cooperative societies
across the country collapse as members got so frustrated that
they abandoned farming. Now some farmers fear that the dreadful
notes might come back at last.
</P>
<P>
After a 10-day tour of his constituency, a local parliament
member appealed to the government to put in place floor prices
for maize to protect the farmers from being exploited. He warned
that if the prices are not improved the farmers will not be able
to repay loans to lending institutions even if they sell all
their maize.
</P>
<P>
One of the leaders of the collapsed cooperative said, "we had
a guaranteed market for our maize when government was buying from
us but we are now left at the mercy of private companies."
</P>
<P>
Small-scale farmers or peasants are struck heaviest because
large-scale farmers can afford to hoard and wait for good prices
or export their maize but the peasants cannot.
</P>
<P>
President ben kapita of the Zambia National Farmers Union
(ZNFU) warned that if the situation is not reversed maize
production will go down by as much as 40 percent during the next
farming season.
</P>
<P>
He said at that time Zambia will suffer as it has to spend
foreign exchanges to import maize.
</P>
<P>
According the a ZNFU survey, maize has become the least
profitable crop and this will discourage farmers from planting.
</P>
<P>
But the government has made it clear that as it now pursues a
market economy policy it is not its responsibility to decide on
the maize prices and it is the demand and supply in the market
that decides on the prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has urged the farmers to be patient
and wait for a good price and not to be cheated by some
unscrupulous maize traders.
</P>
<P>
But the farmers argued that in the face of the liberalized
agricultural marketing arrangement, the government, too, should
have its duty to protect their interests or else the envisaged
food security would be a sham.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here are of the view that it is tough for the
government to pursue a liberalized economy on the one hand and
protect the farmers' interest on the other.

<HEADLINE> Israel To Diversify Gas Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has
declared that it will buy its gas from more than one source in
more than one country, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon explained earlier this week
that by so doing the country will not have to depend
solely on a single supplier.
</P>
<P>
Such projects in the fields of gas and electricity can only
contribute to security and peace in the area, said the
rightwing Likud minister.
</P>
<P>
Sharon said that Egypt, Qatar, France, George and Germany
have been identified as possible partners. He added that he
believes the prices of gas for power stations and industry
will come down with time. Ministry officials have been
instructed not to sign hastily agreed deals, but to negotiate
for the best priced supplies.
</P>
<P>
Sharon's comments came before the start of work on a natural
gas pipeline from Egypt, a project he said he feels will lead to
increasing cooperation between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The minister has recommended that the gas from Egypt be
purchased directly by its users rather than by the government.
Research is commencing on how to distribute the gas once it
reaches Israel. The study will be conducted by Water Planning
for Israel Ltd. together with several foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Once the research is completed, the construction and
infrastructure management work will be given to as many private
Israeli companies and foreign ones as possible, Sharon said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Qatar are two major countries vying for selling gas
to Israel. But Egypt, due to its geographical proximity, appears
to be gaining an upper hand in the energy cooperation. On Sunday,
a 1.2 billion dollar joint venture for oil refinery in Alexandria,
the largest Arab-Israeli project of its kind, was launched in
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The refinery will produce an estimated 100,000 barrels a day,
or five million tons of crude oil a year, two-and-half times
the amount Israel annually imports from Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Impose Tax on Declared Interest Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller has said that the government will impose
a tax on declared interest earnings, the Turkish Daily News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ciller made the remarks Wednesday while addressing her True
Path Party (DYP). But she did not make further clarification,
saying only "this should not be seen as an intervention in the
market economy."
</P>
<P>
Under the current tax law, a tax exemption on annual interest
earnings in Turkey will expire at the end of 1996, after then,
interest earnings above 10 billion Turkish Liras (about 120,000
U.S. dollars) will be taxed.
</P>
<P>
Real interest rates are high in Turkey, with compound rates
running at around 140 percent a year due to the high borrowing
requirement of the cash-short treasury, while the year-on-year
consumer price inflation was more than 82 percent in June.

<HEADLINE> Chaos Erupts in Burundi as President Takes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Burundi sank into deeper crisis
on Wednesday as its Hutu president took refugee in the United
States Embassy after being stoned by a Tutsi mob.
</P>
<P>
Angry crowds of minority Tutsi stoned the helicopter of
President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya as he tried to attend the mass
funeral of 304 members of the Tutsi minority tribe slain over the
weekend, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Ntibantunganya's aide said the presidential helicopter landed
briefly at Bugendana in Burundi's central Gitega region to attend
the funeral.
</P>
<P>
"The people were angry and throwing stones. The helicopter did
land but the president thought it best to leave at once," said
the aide, quoted by local newspapers in Nairobi today, adding
that he left unhurt.
</P>
<P>
Ntibantunganya, now aged 40, succeeded Cyprian Ntaryamira who
was assassinated on April 6, 1994 when the plane in which he was
flying with late President Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda was shot
down.
</P>
<P>
His aide said he then flew to safety at the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
"He (the president) is not in his residence. He is at the U.S.
Embassy for reasons of security," said Nacaire Nahamina, deputy
chief of cabinet in the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Bands of Tutsi youths in military-style formation marched
through the streets of Burundi's capital Bujumbura shortly before
news of the president's move into U.S. protection.
</P>
<P>
It was uncertain whether the president had relinquished power.
</P>
<P>
Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army claimed that last Saturday's
massacre was committed by Hutu rebels of the exiled National
Council for the Defense of Democracy, but the group has denied
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Tutsi politicians accuse Ntibantunganya and his followers
in the mainstream Hutu party, Frodebu, of being apologists for
the Hutu rebels waging a bush civil war against the Tutsi army.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic civil war in the central African nation of Burundi,
which is claiming a least 1,000 lives a month, is reaching new
levels of barbarity.
</P>
<P>
However, western and African governments have wrung their
hands with despair for months over Burundi, saying they fear a
repeat of the 1994 genocide in Neighboring Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
And a regional plan to send African peacekeepers to Burundi is
stalled because the Tutsi military and politicians, as well as
Hutu rebels, opposed.

<HEADLINE> Fujian's Telecom Demand Swelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The telecommunications market of
Fujian, east China, will grow rapidly with the provincial
government's promise to provide a yearly investment of some five
billion yuan in the industry over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
According to "People's Posts and Telecommunications News," the
booming coastal province will add a switching capacity of between
three million and 3.5 million lines to its program-controlled
telephone exchange system, and will build 50,000 km of optical
cables by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The province's pelsio-synchronous transmission systems will be
gradually replaced by the SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy),
which is more technically advanced in transport capacity and speed.
</P>
<P>
Mobile telecommunications will be increased by 200 percent,
hitting some one million channels in switching capacity by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The application of CDMA (code diversion multiple access)
technology, which is regarded as the latest breakthrough in the
global wireless telecommunications field, will speed up to equal
the rocketing market demand for mobile telephone products.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Fujian branch of Chinapac (China Packet Exchange
Network) and DDN (Digital and Data Network) will be expanded by
more than 10,000 access sites, and the Internet and conference
television services will cover all cities and prefectures during
the 1996-2000 period.

<HEADLINE> S. Arabian Power Demands Expected to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 25 (Xinhua)-- Electricity consumption in
Saudi Arabia will reach 23,310 megawatts by the end of the decade,
according to projections made by the kingdom's Ministry of
Planning in the country's sixth five-year plan (1995-2000).
</P>
<P>
To meet this demand, the ministry is planning to increase
power generation capacity to 25,273 MW in the year 2000 from
18,238 MW in 1994-95 fiscal year, according to Saudi reports
monitored here.
</P>
<P>
Saudi state-run oil firm Saudi Aramco has to cut back its crude
exports to supply the power firms with extra fuel.
</P>
<P>
Saudi's biggest power firm Saudi Consolidated Electric
Company-East was awarded a 1.1 billion U.S. dollar contract to
build a 2,400 MW station at Gahzlan which will start generation
by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia's second largest electricity
firm invited contractors to bid for a two-billion-U.S.-dollar
power station at Shuaiba near the Red Sea city of Jeddhah.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Disappointed with Arafat's Letter on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has expressed disappointment with a letter by
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat on
confirming change of the PLO Covenant.
</P>
<P>
Arafat sent the letter to Netanyahu Wednesday night, declaring that
the Palestinian National Council (PNC) had canceled its covenant,
which called for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak was quoted as saying
that Netanyahu was "deeply disappointed" with the letter which was
reportedly identical to the one sent to the former premier
Shimon Peres in May.
</P>
<P>
"This is not what the government intended when it demanded the
Palestinian Covenant be canceled," Bazak said.
</P>
<P>
Bazak added that Netanyahu had asked Arafat for a letter
listing the specific articles of the charter, which had been
annulled.
</P>
<P>
On April 24, the PNC, in a historic vote, decided to amend the
charter by annulling all clauses contradicting the letter of mutual
recognitions between Israel and the PLO.
</P>
<P>
This step paved the way for holding the high-stake final
status talks with Israel in May, although they were delayed
indefinitely because of the May 29 Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
Arafat sent a letter to Peres to confirm the cancellation
of the clauses in the PLO charter, which called for the destruction
of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The PNC's decision was also welcomed by then opposition leader
Netanyahu, who praised it as a positive step but added the PLO
should list the specific articles being dropped from the
covenant.
</P>
<P>
PLO officials have said that the work on a new national
charter would depend on the final stages of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The hardline policies adopted by the new Israeli government
have cast deep doubts over future Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has rejected any compromise on the central issues,
such as the status of Jerusalem, expansion of Jewish settlements
and opposition to the Palestinian statehood.

investment at the '96 Guangdong Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation Fair, which is to take place from August 5 to 9 in
Hong Kong, the "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors can try establishing joint ventures, or

<HEADLINE> 38 Comatose Patients Regain Consciousness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 38 comatose patients
have regained consciousness in a ward that treats coma patients
specially in the capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
Of 131 patients in the local Recovery Hospital, 38 have
regained consciousness after receiving special medical treatment,
giving the hospital first place in its success in dealing with the
problem.
</P>
<P>
Many comatose patients who have been in a coma caused by brain
damage for a long time, are usually given up as a lost cause, and
eventually die.
</P>
<P>
Since the hospital set up the special ward in 1993, doctors
have come up with a series of special treatments, stimulating
patients with a combination of medicines, sound, light,
electricity, and acu-pressure.
</P>
<P>
One male patient, 45, was in a coma for six months after having
received a head injury. Two months after he was sent to the ward
and received comprehensive treatment, he woke up and started to
speak, and then could stand with the help of others.
</P>
<P>
The hospital continues to do research on dealing with coma
patients.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a hospital in Guangzhou, capital of south China's
Guangdong Province, also set up a special ward for coma patients
and so far has cured 11 people.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Opposes US Extra-Territorial Implementation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) has expressed concern with the tendency of the
United States to impose its domestic economic policies on other
countries, when the policies may not even be consistent with World
Trade Organization (WTO) rules.
</P>
<P>
The concern was expressed by Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas at the ASEAN-U.S. Dialogue Partner meeting here Wednesday.
Indonesia serves as coordinator of ASEAN-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Alatas Cited the case of Cuba, on which the U.S. has imposed
"very restrict" laws.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. restricts its trade with Cuba, then it says it will
impose penalties against everyone else doing business with Cuba,"
Alatas said, adding that "this is an example of the
extra-territorial implementation of a domestic law."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the United States and other western countries
have insisted on including non-trade issues, such as human rights,
environment and labor rights, on the agenda of the WTO's inaugural
ministerial conference in Singapore later this year, this will
only complicate the agenda of the WTO's first meeting.
</P>
<P>
At the dialogue meeting between ASEAN and Japan, ASEAN
countries asked Japan to reduce tariffs and import more goods
from ASEAN countries so as to reduce trade imbalance.
</P>
<P>
At the dialogue meeting with India, the two sides agreed to set
up joint committees on tourism, science and technology and trade.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN also held meetings with the European Union (EU),
Australia , New Zealand, Russia, Canada and South Korea on

CHANGSHA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A team of medical workers have
been rushed to central-south China's flood-hit Hunan Province to
prevent an outbreak of epidemic diseases.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Wuzhou Survives a New Major Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NANNING, July 25 (Xinhua) --Wuzhou City, in southwest China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, has passed the biggest flood
peak on the torrential Wujiang River without suffering deaths or
major economic losses.
</P>
<P>
More than 16,300 people helped fight the city's second severe
flooding this year. They succeeded thanks to the fortification of
dikes in the past years and a hard human struggle against the
floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
In the past years floods caused great losses to Wuzhou, and
hampered the city's chances of attracting foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
After an unusually large flood two years ago, the city raised
over 10 million yuan (about 1.2 million US dollars) to fortify
dikes, greatly improving its ability to resist floods.
</P>
<P>
In recent days five dangerous sections appeared on the
Changzhou Dike. The city's communist party secretary Lei Aizu and
mayor Ni Longsheng, led 2,000 civilians and policemen to shift
earth with forklift trucks, bulldozers, tractors and automobiles,
to fortify the dike.
</P>
<P>
In Cangwu County two dangerous sections were consolidated
after 200 people placed over 1,000 sand bags.
</P>
<P>
De'an Dike was made safe after 600 people spent ten hours
placing 2,500 sand bags.
</P>
<P>
The city mobilised 1,200 motor vehicles and 11,000 tons of
material into fighting the floods.
</P>
<P>
The city's social order is described as good, market supplies
are sufficient, prices are stable. There are no traffic jams and
more than 500 enterprises are operating.
</P>
<P>
But the city remains on high alert and is ready for any new
floods.

<HEADLINE> Black Boxes From TWA Crash Recovered From Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Divers searching the wreckage of
TWA Flight 800, which exploded and plunged into the sea near New
York on July 17, have found the flight data and cockpit voice
recorders, investigators said tonight.
</P>
<P>
The boxes would be flown immediately to Washington D.C. for
examination, said an official from the National Transportation
Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
The recovery, coming one week after the crash, represented a
major breakthrough in the quest to find out what caused the
second-worst airline disaster in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
Investigators expect these instruments to provide crucial
evidence as to what caused the 747 to explode in a fireball and
plunge into the Atlantic Ocean on July 17, killing all 230 aboard.
</P>
<P>
The voice recorder picks up cockpit conversations and could
indicate whether the crew knew if there was a problem before the
crash and what action, if any, was taken to try to avoid the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
The flight data recorder picks up such information as a plane's
altitude, speed and various equipment functions. It could help
determine whether a mechanical problem caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
To date, the FBI has not determined whether the jetliner was
downed by a bomb, a missile or mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
Victims' relatives have been complaining bitterly about the
pace of the search, and the White House said President Clinton
would fly to New York on Thursday to meet them, according to
reports by the local press.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Seeking to Shore up Bourse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Bodi
Chunnananda is calling for an urgent meeting of top financial
officials and investors to seek ways to arrest the falling index
of the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET).
</P>
<P>
The SET index further plummeted on Wednesday, losing 20.83
points, or 1.79 percent, to close at 1,143.98 on modest turnover
of 5,242.95 million baht (209.72 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors remained net sellers amid growing confusion
and uncertainty over political and economic developments.
Relatively poor second-quarter performances of listed companies
also dampened investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
Since June 11, when the index registered 1,259.75 points, it
has dropped 115.77 points, or 9.19 percent.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister wants the meeting, to be attended by
officials from the Bank of Thailand, the National Economic and
Social Development Board, the Finance Ministry and foreign
investors, to take place as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Bodi said the meeting is designed to identify the real causes
troubling the bourse and to formulate measures to help solve them.
</P>
<P>
But he said the authorities would not implement any measures to
interfere with the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons for the continued SET index plummet are that
foreign investors are worried the increase in Thailand's current
account deficit, inflation (at 5.7 percent in June), and the poor
performances of the listed companies.
</P>
<P>
In fact, foreigners are selling more Thai shares than they buy,
reflecting a credibility crisis that has seen the SET index
decline steadily since November last year.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners are worried the current account deficit, now
standing at about 8 percent of gross domestic product, might
trigger an economic crisis like the one which gripped Mexico early
last year, triggering a collapse in the value of the peso,
according to Supachai Panitchpakdi, a former deputy prime minister
in charge of economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
In order to restore foreign investors' confidence and reduce
current account deficit, Thai economists have urged the government
to increase Thai exporters' long-term competitiveness, watch out
its spending and limiting state enterprise borrowing.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said at a seminar this week that the government is
trying to solve day-to-day problems, mainly its own image, but had
no firm long-term development plan.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said the government need to push local industries
toward using high-technology, while finding new markets.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said, "the economic recession has started to show (in
Thailand). The decline in export volume and other economic factors
tell us the situation is worsening."
</P>
<P>
"I would say we are in the twilight zone and the sun is
setting," he warned.

<P>
DHAKA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) has decided not to join parliamentary
committees and said the formation of the committees violated the
constitution and rules of procedure.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by the deputy leader of the
opposition, professor A.Q.M. Badruddozza Chowdhury last night
after the formation of the committees amid a heated debate.
</P>
<P>
During the debate over the issue, the opposition protested and
argued that they had not been consulted before on the formation of
the committees.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the parliament also witnessed a heated debate over
President Adbur Rahman Biswas' address on its opening day on July
14. Some MPs from the treasury bench alleged that the speech
delivered by the president was not the one prepared by the present
government but of his own.
</P>
<P>
Biswas has been a BNP member and was elected president in 1991
as a candidate of the BNP.

<HEADLINE> EU Tries To Dispel Fears of Sheep Carrying Mad Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- In an apparent bid to calm fears
in the European lamb market, the European Union (EU) said
Wednesday that there is no evidence that sheep carry the mad cow
disease.
</P>
<P>
EU agriculture spokesman Gerry Kiely said new proposals to take
potentially infected sheep parts out of the food chain were purely
a precaution.
</P>
<P>
EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler on Monday called for
measures to require slaughterhouses to remove nervous tissue and
spleens from the food chain, citing a laboratory study showing
that the cattle disease is transmissible to sheep.
</P>
<P>
Lamb prices were reported down slightly on Tuesday around the
EU, which is repairing economic damage from the beef crisis this
spring.
</P>
<P>
Kiely shrugged off complaints from Spain and Portugal that
Fischler had unnecessarily triggered a new health scare, and
argued that the commissioner was merely drawing obvious
conclusions from a study published June 1 in a British science
journal.
</P>
<P>
In the study, scientists found that mad cow disease, formally
known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, can be passed on to
sheep fed with highly infected cattle remains.
</P>
<P>
But EU officials point out the study does not necessarily mean
that the disease is transmissible to sheep under ordinary farm
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Fischler plans to ask EU veterinary officials to approve the
new safeguards at a meeting August 1.
</P>
<P>
Britain sparked the mad cow crisis in March by announcing a
probable link between BSE, a brain-destroying disease found in
British herds, and a deadly human variant that has killed 10
Britons and one Frenchman.

<HEADLINE> Denmark Builds World-Class Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The construction of a
world-class bridge system across the 18-kilometer-wide Store Baelt
water between the Danish islands of Sjaelland and Fyn has reached
its final phase.
</P>
<P>
The two bridges will carry two railway lines and a four lane
motorway.
</P>
<P>
The West Bridge which is 6.6 kilometers long from Fyn to
Sprogoe, the mid-point of Store Baelt, is now finished. On the
East Bridge from Sjaelland to Sprogoe, the railways go underground
through two tunnels, eight kilometers long and 78 meters deep at
the deepest point.
</P>
<P>
The tunnels were finished in the summer of 1995, and the
highway bridge above the water is under construction now.
</P>
<P>
Part of the East Bridge is a suspension bridge whose towers are
254 meters high, the highest building projects in North Europe.
The distance is 1624 meters between two towers, topped only by
Japan's Akashi Kaikyo bridge which is under construction.
</P>
<P>
The height above water of the suspension bridge is 65 meters,
enough for all ships to pass beneath.
</P>
<P>
A total of 19,000 tons of steel cable are used on the
suspension bridge, and the diameter of the main cable is 85
centimeters.
</P>
<P>
The Store Baelt Bridge is one of the biggest building projects
under construction and its cost so far is 216 billion Danish
crowns (approximately 36 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The railways will start using the bridge at the beginning of
next year, and the highways are expected to open in the summer of
1998.
</P>
<P>
About 200 trains and 16,000 cars and buses are expected to pass
over (and under) the Bridge each 24-hour day. The passage time
for trains will be seven minutes, and 11 minutes for cars -- as
against the one hour taken by ships to cross the water.
</P>
<P>
The Bridge will be important for relieving transportation
difficulties between Denmark's two biggest islands and in
prompting economic development in Northern Europe.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Investment Arm to Issue Baht Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation, a World Bank investment arm, will issue
baht-denominated bonds worth up to 200 million U.S. dollars for
sales to Thais and foreigners, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
After the approval by the Thai Finance Ministry on Wednesday,
the corporation will swap baht into dollars for development loans
to Indochina, Eastern Europe and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry said that investors will be subject to
withholding tax when they transfer ownership of the bonds.
</P>
<P>
Certain restrictions will apply to the bonds. For example,
they are not considered liquid assets for commercial banks and
cannot be traded on the repurchase market, where only government
and state enterprise bonds are traded, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also believed that the issuance of the baht bonds
on international markets will not destabilize the baht and the
baht's exchange rate will remain stable.

WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States has decided
to lift the ban on weapons sales to six former Soviet republics,
the U.S. State Department announced today.

of normalization of relations that has taken place since the end

first ever gold medal for China in the Olympic gymnastics
all-around events," said Chinese head coach Qian Kui.
</P>
<P>
"It will surely inspire us to step out of the shadow of those
miserable failures in the team events and to display our top form
in the individual finals later."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, three Chinese gymnates dropped from the horizontal
bar, allowing Russia to walk away with the men's team gold medal.
World championships winners China had to settle for the silver,
only lagging behind 1.239 points.
</P>
<P>
In the all-round finals, an evil omen seemed to beckon to China
anew when Li Xiaoshuang ranked only fifth after he slipped a step
in his first apparatus on the floor.
</P>
<P>
But the two-time Olympic vetaran kept clam to display his
top-notched calibre as one of the top favorites for the title.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaoshuang overtook Nemov by 0.112 after the vault wherein
he scored his highest of 9.812 points.
</P>
<P>
Nemov regained his lead through the horizontal bar with a 9.800
performance, with Li chasing behind by 0.038 after a minor error
in his landing at the parallel bars.
</P>
<P>
After Nemov scoring 9.700 from the floor exercise, the majic
moment came when Li displayed his perfect performance on the
horizontal bar for 9.787 points.
</P>
<P>
With smile in his face, Li Xiaoshuang walked away the most
coveted gold medal in the gymnastics tournament.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy and exciting by winning the gold medal," said
Li Xiaoshaung, "It is the most importent gold for an individual
gymnast while the team title is for a country."
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaoshuang said he owes a lot to coach Huang Yubin before he
stepped in for the horizontal bar, his last apparatus in the
battle against Nemov.
</P>
<P>
"Usually, I don't care whoever is the rival, but I thought of
Nemov too much before I went on the bar tonight," Li said, "Should
he get 9.750 or more he will beat me."
</P>
<P>
"Then my coach came over and told me 'Don't think any more.
Just go ahead! Never look back!' I did as he told me, and my mind
was clean and my performance was perfect," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Nemov, a 20-yaer-old promising talent who stole the top spot in
the qualifying standing, said he did every thing he could but was
just unlucky in the running for the gold.
</P>
<P>
"I did my best today but was unlucky when I knew I lost the
gold by only 0.049 points," he said.
</P>
<P>
The women's all-around final will be held on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pakistan-South Korean Ties Enter New Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The three-day official visit to
South Korea this week by Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
is a significant development in Pakistan's efforts to further
enhance its economic cooperation with the newly emerged
industrialized country.
</P>
<P>
Benazir's latest tour of South Korea, as a part of the
implementation of the "Look East Policy" strongly advocated by her
government, is particularly important with the objective of not
only to diversify the bilateral trade but also to seek the flow of
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
It is Benazir Bhutto's first ever visit to South Korea, and
also the first visit to that East Asian country by the Pakistani
head of government since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Benazir, accompanied by the ministers, parliamentarians,
businessmen and the representatives of private sector, held wide
range talks with the South Korean leadership, focusing on further
strengthening the existing trade and commercial ties between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the leaders of the two countries have proved
to be fruitful, which was illustrated by the signing of two
agreements: an aviation agreement and an agreement for the
establishment of a joint cell in order to maintain consultations
between the two countries on policy issues.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the aviation agreement has paved the way for an
exchange of air services between the two countries for the first
time, and will undoubtedly contribute to the further enhancement
of the economic and trade relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The economic and commercial relations between Pakistan and
South Korea have been developing at a rapid pace. A number of
South Korean companies have invested in Pakistan in joint
ventures, some of which are already in production.
</P>
<P>
Such investment will foster mutually beneficial economic links
and contribute towards closer friendship between the two
countries, Benazir Bhutto said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has been making every possible effort
to improve the country's investment environment to attract more
direct foreign investment in the vital economic sectors such as
energy, petrochemical, automobile, engineering, textiles and
construction activity.
</P>
<P>
During her stay in Seoul, the Pakistani Prime Minister
inaugurated an investment seminar. It is believed that the
efforts by the Pakistani government are expected to promote South
Korean investment in Pakistan in various sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between Pakistan and South Korea has been
increasing steadily with an annual growth rate of 10 percent over
the last few years. The two way annual trade has reached over 600
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has emerged as the 13th largest trade partner of
Pakistan. Pakistan now enjoys a favorable balance of trade with
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's imports from Pakistan in 1995 amounted to 358
million dollars as against its exports of 279 million dollars to
this South Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
In view of the complimentary nature of the economies of the two
countries, both Pakistan and South Korea are keen and surely are
able to expand their cooperation in economic spheres.

<HEADLINE> Spain Makes Steps Towards Semifinal Berth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Spain remained unbeaten as it came
from behind to beat Argentina 2-1 in their group A competition at
the Olympic men's field hockey tournament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Following their surprise wins over group favorites Germany and
Pakistan in the first two matches, Spain is now almost certain of
gaining a place in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
In today's match, Jorge Lombi gave Argentina the lead with a
flicked shot in the 20th minute.
</P>
<P>
After the interval Spain came out in much more determined and
organised fashion but it was not until the 61st minute that they
were able to breach the Argentine defence when Juan Escarre
equalised from a clever corner drill.
</P>
<P>
Four minutes later Javier Arnau, receiving a free hit, lashed a
first time shot into the roof of the net from the circle's edge.
His spectacaular winning shot confirmed him as the tournament's
leading scorer with four goals.
</P>
<P>
Spain will make certain of a semifinal place if they beat the
United States, regarded as the weakest team in the group, in their
next match on Friday. It plays its final pool match against India
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
India gained their first win in their third match of the
tournament when they beat the United States 4-0. It was the
Americans third defeat in a row.
</P>
<P>
India's goals came from Ramandeep Singh and Dhanraj Pillay in
the first half, and Pillay and Sanjeev Kumar in the second.
</P>
<P>
World Cup holders Pakistan, three times Olympic champions,
almost certainly lost their chance of making the semifinals when
they lost 3-1 to Germany, the defending champions,.
</P>
<P>
Their second defeat left them in fifth place in group A with
just two points from three games.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Thirty key projects are to be
built in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region this

<HEADLINE> Closer Trade Ties Between China And South, Southeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China plans to increase its
economic cooperation with Southeast Asia and South Asia, a senior
trade official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Though great achievements have already been made in economic
and trade cooperation between China and southeast and south Asia
in recent years, there is scope for even bigger trading as the two
are close neighbors, and have forged good relationship, said Li
Guohua, vice-minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has become
the fifth largest trade partner of China after Japan, Hong Kong,
the United States and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the trade volume between China and ASEAN totalled 19.5
billion US dollars, a rise of 42 percent over the previous
year. The import and export value between China and the six
countries in southern Asia climbed to 3.1 billion US dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
There is a mutual complementarity between the two
sides. Southeast and south Asia can provide China with plentiful
supplies of timber, rubber and petroleum resources, while
China-made machinery and electronic products are well received in
southern Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Rapid economic growth of southeast Asian countries and the
opening-up of countries in south Asia served as important factors
to enhance cooperation with the two regions, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China will take a variety of measures to promote trade with the
two regions, and working still harder to maintain its prestige on
the Asian market by improving product quality and packaging.

<HEADLINE> Japan Wins Gold in Traditional Sport of Judo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenzo Nakamura unleashed his last
ditch effort to win the men's 71-kg lightweight title from its
traditional sport of judo at the Olympic Games here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese judo athlete stole the gold medal from South
Korean Kwak Dae-Sung through a 2-1 decision, awarding the second
gold medal for Japan after its first also grabbed from the sport,
but through a judoka named Yuko Emoto in the women's 61-kg class.
</P>
<P>
Kwak was only a step away from winning the third judo gold
medal after the first five day competition for South Korea before
Nakamura levelled the score in the last seconds.
</P>
<P>
While the referees ruled in fovor of the Japanese, Nakamura
raised his hands to the cheering supporters whereas Kwak slammed
his fists on the mat in desperation.
</P>
<P>
"I did win the gold but it was only by the narrowest of
margins," Nakamura said.
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal was shared by Frenchman Christophe Gagliano
and American Jimmy Pedro.
</P>
<P>
Minutes ago, South Korean judoka Jung Sung-Yong also lost the
finals to Cuban Driulis Gonzalez in the women's 56kg category.
</P>
<P>
It merely served as a repitition of the world championship
where Gonzalez became the champion by flooring the same Korean
opponent.
</P>
<P>
The women's bronze medals went to Belgian Marisabel Lomba and
Spaniard Isabel Fernandez.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan President Appeals for National Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga appealed for national peace in a televised speech last
night following the Dehiwala train bomb blast in the southern part
of the country that claimed at least 70 lives.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said that the explosion was carried out by the
rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who wanted to create
chaos in the south to divert the security forces from the north
and the east of the country.
</P>
<P>
She accused the LTTE of conspiring to provoke the Sinhalese
community to violence and set the stage for what the rebels call a
Black July in commemoration of their first major riot in July
1983.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said that the LTTE also wanted to use their
protests to hurt the image of Sri Lanka on the international
stage.
</P>
<P>
"If the people in the south get provoked by the situations, we
will be only falling prey to the LTTE's intentions," she warned.
</P>
<P>
The president urged the people of Sri Lanka to restrain
themselves in the hour of grief following the train blast and
cooperate with the government.

<HEADLINE> Pankratov Shatters Men's 100m Butterfly World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Pankratov of Russia again
proved that he was the world top butterflier, setting a new world
record of 52.27 seconds en route to winning the mens' 100-meter
Olympic title here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pankratov beat the challenge from Scott Miller of Australia,
top finisher in the morning's heats, and bettered his own wrold
mark of 52.32 set in Vienna on August 23, 1995 by 0.05 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"Everything happened the way I though it would," Pankratove
said at the news conference, "I was ready for it."
</P>
<P>
The Russian finished second in the heats this morning at 52.96.
</P>
<P>
"I just want to prove to every one that I can do better than in
the heats," he said, "and I just made it, because I have worked
for it for a long time."
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old swimmer also bagged the 200m butterfly title on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Born in Volgograd, Pankratov shattered two world records in
both the 100m and 200m butterfly in 1995, which ensured him a
convincing honor of "world best swimmer of the year". He set the
200m butterfly world mark of 1:55.22 on June 14, 1995 in Canet,
France.
</P>
<P>
Even more, the Russian clocked world records-beating time in
both the 100m and 200m butterfly at the Short Course World Cup
tournament in Paris in February, but later he was denied the
records as no doping tests were carried out after the
competitions.
</P>
<P>
The French organization explained that they just ran out of
bottles for the doping tests and apologized to him.
</P>
<P>
Scott Miller of Australia had to settle for the silver in
tonight's final, at 52.53.
</P>
<P>
"I'am a little disappointed. I thought I had it in me to win
that event. I did my best and the result is just not good enough."
</P>
<P>
The bronze went to another Russia Valdislav Kulikov at 53.13.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia, Bosnia Reach Trade, Travel Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 24 (Xinhua) - Yugoslavia and Bosnia reached three
agreements on trade and travel here today, which, said Ejup Ganic,
vice president of Bosnian Moslem-Croat Federation, indicated a
key step towards the gradual normalization of bilateral links.
</P>
<P>
The agreements are mainly on visas, communications and trade,
said Ganic, who arrived here Tuesday with a Bosnian business
delegation for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
He added that a Yugoslav business delegation was also expected
to visit Bosnia soon.
</P>
<P>
"Their business people told me they are ready, they can come in
a week, and we could soon reactivate many factories because
industries were interconnected in former Yugoslavia," said Ganic.
</P>
<P>
The first accord abolished the requirement for visas between
the two countries. The second provided for renewed road, rail and
air links and telecommunications. The third set up Yugoslav and
Bosnian chambers of commerce in Sarajevo and Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which included the Bosnian Foreign Minister
Jadranko Prlic, also talked with Yugoslav senior officials
including President Slobodan Milosevic and Deputy Prime Minister
Nikola Sainovic.
</P>
<P>
The ending of three-and-half-years fighting in Bosnia has made
it possible for people to travel by road between Belgrade and
Sarajevo. But the railways remain cut and telephone lines are
still limited.

largest Shanghai metropolis since so far this year has exceeded
hoped-for targets.

witnessed a sustained growth in its industry this year.
</P>
<P>
During the first half this year, Shanghai generated more than
244.5 billion yuan in industrial output value, an increases of
15.3 percent over the same period of last year, the municipal
statistical bureau reported.
</P>

Local hi-tech industries and six leading sectors, including
textiles, machinery and electronics, automobiles and
telecommunications, gave a great impetus to local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Reforms in the state-owned enterprises, and an upswing of
foreign-funded enterprises, also helped push forward the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
Now the economic growth speed of local heavy industry has
surpassed that of light industry.
</P>
<P>
In addition to industry, the municipality also enjoyed stable
development in agriculture, with the per-hectare yield and total
output of the summer-harvested grain rising 7.6 percent and 17.6
percent over the same period in 1995, respectively.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Early Implementation of Weapons Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China today called for concrete
measures and intensified efforts by relevant countries to make a
comprehensive and effective implementation of the Convention on
Chemical Weapons.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a session of the Organization for the Prohibition
of Chemical Weapons Preparatory Commission, Huang Yu, head of the
Chinese delegation, said that China is a country with a
significant size of chemical industry and has on its territory
large quantities of chemical weapons abandoned by a foreign state.
</P>
<P>
"For China, the implementation of the Convention will certainly
be an arduous task," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
But "the Chinese government attaches great importance to the
ratification and implementation of the Convention. A great deal
of preparatory work has been carried out by relevant governmental
agencies and remarkable progress has been achieved."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he continued, "China is going to further step up its
efforts for the early deliberation and ratification of the
Convention by its legislative body, the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the official voiced his disappointment that
as of today the two declared chemical weapon possessors had given
no clear commitment as to the timing of their ratifications, nor
has there been any clear indication of the prospects of
implementation of their bilateral agreement on the destruction of
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official told the meeting that from May to June
this year, Japan, with full cooperation of China, had completed
the fourth on-site investigation of the burial sites of chemical
weapons abandoned by Japanese aggressor troops in World War II.
</P>
<P>
He declared that China welcomes the progress and earnestly
hopes that the investigation would expedite Japan's efforts to
develop destruction plan and finalize destruction programs.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he also expressed China's dissatisfaction
about the findings of the Japanese investigation, pointing out
that the investigation conducted was still "preliminary" and data
obtained on the quantity of abandoned chemical weapons was
"neither complete nor accurate," and results of the environment
analysis did not conform with the reality.
</P>
<P>
"We insist that when the Japanese side submits to the
Secretariat of the Preparatory Commission relevant information
acquired in the investigations or make public the findings of the
investigations, it should exercise prudence and respect the facts
so as not to cause any misunderstanding or damage to the
cooperation of both parties," the official stressed.
</P>
<P>
He concluded that the Chinese delegation had, as always,
participated in the work of the Preparatory Commission in a
"positive and earnest way."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to participate in the negotiations in a
practical and cooperative spirit and make our due contributions to
the completion of the work of the Preparatory Commission," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since it was opened for signature on January 13, 1993 in Paris,
160 States have signed the Convention on Chemical Weapons, or the
Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production,
Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.
</P>
<P>
Up to now 60 countries have ratified the Convention, which will
go into force 180 days after it has been ratified by 65
countries.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Preparatory Commission, which was set up
in the Hague in February 1993, has established certain procedures
for the implementation of the Convention and for a future
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

ATLANTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian team carried away
the gold medal in the Olympic Equestrian team three-day event on
Wednesday in Conyers, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The United States, led by the husband-and-wife team of David

</P>
<P>
Australia finished the final show-jumping phase with 203.85
penalty points, America 261.1 and New Zealand 268.55.
</P>
<P>
Wendy Schaeffer of Australia, the competition's leading rider,
is still recovering from a broken leg she suffered two months ago.
Teammate Gillian Rolton didn't ride Wednesday after breaking her
collarbone and two ribs in a fall on the cross country course the
previous day, but her ability to finish Tuesday's event put
Australia in position to wrap up the gold.
</P>
<P>
The difference between the gold and silver came from the clean,
fast rounds turned in by Australia on the cross country course,
moving it up from sixth after dressage.
</P>
<P>
The other teams rode more conservatively and collected more
time penalties.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ivanisevic Ousted at Olympic Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Number two seed Goran Ivanisevic
of Croatia became the first seed victim in the tennis tournament
at the Olympic Games here on Wednesday, falling in straight sets
to South African Marcos Ondruska.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian, who is known for his giant serve in tennis, lost
to the South African underdog 6-2, 6-4 in a one hour battle in the
sweating heat at the Stone Mountain Park.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Enqvist of Sweden, who was seeded third at the Olympics,
needed two hours to survive a scare from Germany's Marc-Kevin
Goellner, winning in 7-6, 4-6 and 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Number four seed Malivai Washington of the United States had a
smooth way into the second round, beating Jan Kroslak of Slovakia
6-3, 7-6 (7-3).

<P>
Washington fought back from a 2-5 second-set deficit to force a
tie-break. He then nothced five of the last six points for a 7-3
tie-break.
</P>
<P>
"The key for my win was that I just played good in the tie-break,"
said Washington, the 1996 Wimbledon finalist. "I'm up 3-2 and then I
hit a forehand winner, then I hit a volley winner, then a backhand
winner. Then I am up 6-2. That was the difference."
</P>
<P>
While in the women's section, fifth seed Anke Huber of Germany
rallied from first set deficit to beat Catalina Cristea of Romania
2-6, 6-4 and 6-1.

<HEADLINE> France Insists NATO Reform Be in Line With Europe Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Defense Minister
Charles Millon said today that reform the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) is undertaking should be kept in line with the
needs of European defense.
</P>
<P>
France supports reform in NATO, but the reform should never be
construed as becoming competition with any other powers, Millon
said.
</P>
<P>
In a talk with his Italian counterpart, Benianmino Andreatta,
Millon said NATO's existence was necessary when considering the
defense and security of Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said France supported the decision made at NATO's Berlin
conference in June last year to form a multi-national force and
establish headquarters for the organization's reform.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta said that both France and Italy faced the question of
military reforms.
</P>
<P>
The two defense ministers also exchanged views on cooperation
between their troops in the Bosnian peace-keeping missions.
</P>
<P>
On defense industry, Andreatta said "all European countries
must cut the cost and profit of military supplies."

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Mexican companies, especially
small-sized service and food companies, are growing again, a Mexican
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Gutierrez Ruiz, president of the National Chamber of the
Manufacturing Industry, said that fewer companies have shut down
recently as compared with early this year, a sign that the more-
than-one-year crisis has hit the bottom.
</P>
<P>
According to the chamber's reports, there has been no rebound
in the manufacturing sector, but new jobs have been created to
resolve the economic problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ruiz added that his organization and the capital city government
will undertake a campaign soon so that businesses in Mexico City
will be able to make all back payments and comply with the
operation formalities.
</P>
<P>
As part of the program, he said that the authorities will
combat corruptions in companies and reward honesty.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are also being made to reduce the amount
of paper work and to back companies, especially those in the small
business sector, with technology and loans, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Spain managed to score twice in
the last 5 minutes to beat Australia in the men's soccer
tournament of the Centennial Olympics at Orlando on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish team legged 2-1 behind and seemed to be barred from
the quarter-finals. But at the 86th minute, Santiago Denia headed
home the equalizer and 2 minutes into the injury time, Raul
Gonzalez scored the winner to wrap up the match.
</P>
<P>
The victory put Spain, which won two matches and draw one from

together with France.
</P>
<P>
France scored a 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia at Miami on Wednesday

team qualified as the group winners as they had a better goal
difference than Spain.
</P>
<P>
France and Saudi Arabia fought to a 1-1 draw in the first half.
After the interval, Antoine Sibierski took a cross from Vikash
Dhorsoo from near the goalline and scored the winner.
</P>
<P>
In a match played at Washington, Portugal and the United States
played to a 1-1 draw.
</P>
<P>
The draw was enough to put Portugal into the quarter-finals
while the United States were eliminated from the Olympic soccer
tournament.
</P>
<P>
In Birmingham, Argentina were forced to a 1-1 draw by Tunisia
in Group C, but they still qualified for the quarter-finals with a

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan to Press on New Health Insurance Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Kazakh government promised
today that it will continue its reforms on health insurance system
so as to make it fit a market economy, the Kazakhstan Telegraph
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This came at a meeting today on health insurance reforms.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan introduced a new program early in April with the aim
of making the country's health insurance system self-financing,
which had been entirely dependent on the state budget.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, a health insurance fund, mainly financed by
the employer and employee contributions, was established to help
run the country's medical institutions together with the state
budget.
</P>
<P>
During the past three months the fund has collected a total of
36.7 million U.S. dollars, and 12.67 million Kazakhs, which
represents 75 percent of the country's total population, have
registered in the fund, according to Talapker Imanbaev, chairman
of the fund.
</P>
<P>
A number of plans designed to totally implement the reforms were
also worked out at the meeting, Imanbaev added.

<HEADLINE> China's Zhao Determined to Show his Guts under Hot Sun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China's World Cup winner Zhao
Yongsheng shaved his head to show his determination that he will
challenge the hot Sun and his rivals as well in the men's
50-kilometer walk, the most gruelling event in the current
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"I will challenge the hot and humid weather here, and show that
I'm a hard nut to crack in the race," said Zhao here today after a
training session.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old from Northeast China collapsed from dehydration
in the hot Sun after leading a brave solo pace in the first 45
kilometers in the 50km walk at the world championships in
Gothenburg, Sweden, last year.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid of the hot Sun here. I will show my guts again
this time. If the weather is too hot, everyone will suffer, so I'm
not worry about it," added Zhao, who ranked first in the world
last year with his winning time at the 1995 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Zhao arrived here two days ago with a group of China's gold
medal hopefuls including Wang Junxia and diving stars.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that in order to overcome the hot weather here,
his coach Wang Kui put them into a Sauna room, forcing them get
used to the hot and humid condition in the past months.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the weather can be as hot as that. Therefore, I
should say the hot Sun might be a good thing to our Chinese
walkers," said Zhao.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Zhao and other Chinese walkers also went to
Wuhan, a city dubbed as "the Hot Stove" in the Central part of
China, to train twice earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"For me, the crucial stage will be after 30 kilometers where
the other walkers may feel tired. I won't make my move until then,
and from there I will take the lead to the finish," revealed the
Chinese champion.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that Walentin Kononen of Finland and
Giovanni Perriceli of Italy should be his main rivals in the
event, which is scheduled to be held in the early morning on
August 2.
</P>
<P>
"So far as I have learned that I'm the fastest in the world
this year. My winning time at the China's Olympic trials is about
10 seconds better than Kononen's," Zhao added.
</P>
<P>
Kononen was beaten into second place by Zhao at last year's
World Cup, but reeled over the collapsed Chinese to win the world
title in 1995. Perriceli won the silver medal and Robert
Korzeniowski of Poland took the bronze at Goterborg Worlds.
</P>
<P>
Zhao's teammate Zhang Huiqiang will take part in the battle
with him, but Zhao said he will take his own pace throughout.
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather collaps the second time than go home with empty
hands," Zhao announced with a determination.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll of Sri Lanka's Train Blast Rises to 70 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The death toll rose to over 70 in
the train bomb explosion Thursday evening at Dehiwala in the
southern suburb of Colombo, police sources said here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that two powerful bombs ripped through the
Aluthgama-bound train at the Dehiwala railway station, killing at
least 70 people and injuring over 300.
</P>
<P>
The blast was caused by two parcel bombs placed in the second
and seventh compartments, and the sound of the explosion was heard
five kilometers away, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
This was the worst blast targeting at civilians after the
Central Bank bomb blast that claimed over 90 lives in Colombo on
January 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the two carriages that were turned into a
complete wreckage, the railway station and some other compartments
of the train were also damaged.
</P>
<P>
Though investigations are still going on, a senior police
officer said that the blast might be the work of the rebel
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) while two LTTE suspects
were taken into custody for questioning.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that a member of the railway protection force
had earlier spotted a suspicious-looking parcel on the train and
removed it to the platform.

<HEADLINE> Death of Dolphin Does Not Derail Protection Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- An examination of the rare river
dolphin found dead last month in the Tian-e-zhou National Baiji
Reserve shows it died from suffocation after being trapped in nets
which fence the reserve, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River dolphin is one of the world's 12 most
endangered animals, and it is estimated there are only 100 left.
</P>
<P>
Without special protection, the 25-million-year-old species
will completely vanish in 25 years, experts estimate.
</P>
<P>
The dolphin was the only one living in the reserve, and was
captured last December after three years of effort, said Li
Qianyun, an official with the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Undeterred by the death of the dolphin, reserve workers will
try to capture two to three groups of dolphins in the next two
years and relocate them to the Tian-e-zhou reserve for special
protection.
</P>
<P>
The Fisheries Bureau under the ministry is determined to
continue protection work in the 21-kilometer section of the
ancient course of the Yangtze, although the work poses serious
challenges.
</P>
<P>
The death of the dolphin from such an unforeseen tragedy just
illustrates how hard it is to protect the dolphin, even when all
intentions are good and research on protection is solid, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year-old dolphin was 2.29-meters long.
</P>
<P>
It normally swam with a pod of black finless porpoises in the
reserve, until this April when it began to leave the pod more
often, and swim at the ancient course entrance, according to
report to the ministry by the reserve.
</P>
<P>
The dead dolphin may have been in oestrum during the spring, Li
said, and was also probably weakened by the fact it faced serious
flood conditions in the reserve.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, before death, the dolphin was frail and ailing, but
experts experienced great difficulty treating it in the water.

Egypt was leading the game 12-9 with eight minutes to play when

"In handball there is always a fight between us. It's a matter
of establishing who is the best in Africa," said former Egyptian

</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has been tipped as an outside medal chance in the
competition, came back from an early bout of nerves to clinch
victory in the final five minutes.

<HEADLINE> Colombia to Introduce "War Tax" Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper announced today that he will introduce to Congress
a bill to establish a one-time "war tax" in the country to combat
drug trafficking and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony to celebrate the 173rd anniversary of
the navy, Samper said this measure will enable the government to
collect 500 billion pesos (500 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to improve the mechanism of the armed
forces and to combat more efficiently drug trafficking, subversion
and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
"My government is not going to finance bureaucracy any longer.
What we will do is to invest in better transportation,
communication equipment and helicopters to attain peace and
security for Colombians," said Samper.
</P>
<P>
The president made it clear that the tax cannot be considered a
war tax but rather a peace and security tax for citizens.
</P>
<P>
He added that tax will be paid only by those who have more than
88 million pesos (88,000 U.S. dollars) in assets, who represent
fewer than one percent of the country's total population.
</P>
<P>
However, Samper's announcement was greeted with rejections from
the union sector.

<HEADLINE> Open Policies Benefit China's Insurance Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China's preliminary experiment in
opening its insurance market is benefiting both foreign insurance
companies and the nation's fledging insuring business.
</P>
<P>
The American International Assurance Company, whose business
has expanded greatly since it opened a branch in Shanghai four
years ago, has helped introduce advanced insurance expertise into
China, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
The scope of insurance coverage in China, as a result, has
widened, and the number of insurance products increased, he added.
</P>
<P>
AIA has also helped establish a complete system for evaluating,
licensing and training insurance agents, as well as a supervision
system.
</P>
<P>
China first opened its insurance market to international
competition in 1992, when AIA took the lead by setting up a branch
in Shanghai. Last January, AIA opened its second branch in
Guangzhou, capital city of South China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Besides life insurance, AIA China branches are also allowed to
sell property, marine and financial insurance policies to
foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Following AIA, the Tokyo Marine and Fire Insurance Company of
Japan also entered the China market by opening a branch in
Shanghai in July, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Industry officials say China is ready to open its insurance
market in a gradual and planned manner to encourage fair
competition and promote the domestic insurance sector.

<HEADLINE> China's Tourism Source Countries Under Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANYA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Growing numbers of tourists are
heading for China from the Republic of Korea (ROK), Mongolia and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago over half of all tourists were from the United
States and Japan - now just 30 percent from those two countries
make up the army of China bound holidaymakers.
</P>
<P>
The decade has seen a dramatic chance in the major sources of
tourists, a high-ranking tourism official told an international
conference.
</P>
<P>
Yang Liuyin, director of the Department of Promotion and
Marketing of the National Tourism Administration told the
preparatory meeting for setting up the China Destination Marketing
Council that while Japanese and American tourists accounted for
51.8 percent of all tourists visiting China in 1985, this
proportion dropped to 30.9 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"What is remarkable is that the ROK became the second largest
source country in 1995, pushed up by a growth of 50 percent, and
outstripping the US," Yang revealed.
</P>
<P>
Other fast-expanding sources included Russia and Mongolia, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Another noticeable trend is that business people made up 19.9
percent of the 46.39 million tourists visiting China in 1995, 10
percentage higher than other groups, Yang noted.
</P>
<P>
The meeting which was held in Sanya, the southernmost city of
China, was co-organized by the London-based World Travel and
Tourism Council, and the China National Tourism Administration.
</P>
<P>
During the conference A China Destination Marketing Council was
formally founded, with members composed of Chinese and overseas
travel agencies, airlines and tourism offices.

ATLANTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia beat archrival Hungary to
take the men's team sabre title while France won the women's team
epee event Wednesday at the Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
In the men's sabre event, Hungary never recovered from a slow
start in the final and was denied its 11th gold medal. Hungary
beat Russia for the gold at the 1988 Seoul Games and then lost to
the Russians at Barcelona four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Individual sabre gold medalist Stanislaw Pozdiakov and silver
medalist Sergei Shariko gave the Russians a 10-3 lead after two
relays. The margin continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
Italy, also in the upper tier of international fencing powers,
settled for a bronze medal with a 45-37 victory over Poland.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming performance by individual gold medalist Laura
Flessel propelled the French to the gold medal in women's team
epee which was introduced to the Olympics for the first time. She
scored 25 touches in the 45-33 victory over Italy.
</P>
<P>
France trailed 15-10 in team play when Flessel fenced midway
through the bout. She outscored Italy's Elisa Uga in that relay,
and later clinched the gold with a low touch against Laura Chiesa.
</P>
<P>
In the women's bronze medal match, Yuliya Garayeva used a
twisting underhand move for the winning touch in overtime as
Russia beat Hungary 45-44.

<HEADLINE> China Almost Meets Half-Year Taxation Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial and commercial
tax revenue rose 22.4 percent to 299.64 billion yuan (about 36.1
billion US dollars) in the first six months of this year, the
State Administration of Taxation said.
</P>
<P>
The figure was 49.7 percent of this year's target, the
administration said, noting that the amount of taxes going to the
central coffer -- 164.1 billion yuan -- was only 47.9 percent of
the yearly target.
</P>
<P>
The tax revenue of local governments increased 23.5 percent to
135.57 billion yuan between January and June, about 52.1 percent
of the annual target.
</P>
<P>
Collection of the consumption tax and value-added tax, two
major taxes under China's new revenue-sharing taxation system
introduced in 1994, rose 19.1 percent to 169.6 billion yuan, which
represents 46.4 percent of this year's target.
</P>
<P>
The administration also said that tax rebates to exporters
during the January-June period grew by 8.3 billion yuan over a
year ago to 41.82 billion yuan, or 64.3 percent of this year's
quota.
</P>
<P>
"The tax rebates have proven effective in easing the capital
shortfalls of exporting enterprises and boosting exports," the
administration said.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the amount of delayed tax payment increased
monthly in the first half of this year, to 31.3 billion yuan by
the end of June, up 13.4 billion yuan over 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Taxation departments at all levels must beef up their effort
to collect delayed taxes so as to ensure the fulfilment of this
year's taxation target," the administration urged.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Shanghai: Good Model for Hi-Tech Joint Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Newly listed as the country's
largest fiber optical supplier, AT&AMP;T Shanghai Fiber Optics,
jointly founded by China and Lucent Technologies, has reported a
yearly production capacity of 500,000 km of fibers.
</P>
<P>
The new company was formerly the AT&AMP;T Network and System
Business.
</P>
<P>
The venture went into operation in Caohejing Hi-Tech
Development Zone of Shanghai in January, absorbing a 23.65 million
US dollar investment from the AT&AMP;T network and system business,
the Shanghai Optical Telecom Co., the China Posts and Telecom
Industrial Co. and the Shanghai Posts and Telecom Administration.
</P>
<P>
Lucent Technologies presently holds 56 percent of the stock
shares, the remaining 44 percent belongs to the three Chinese
partners.
</P>
<P>
The venture, boasting a 28,000 square-meter manufacturing area,
employs 118 workers, and names the single-model optical fiber as
its leading product.
</P>
<P>
The AT&AMP;T single-model fiber, composed of a germanium-bearing
core and a quartz-glass covering, is widely used in China's
high-speed and broadband information transport systems.
</P>
<P>
The fiber can transmit 7,560 telephone calls simultaneously,
and has the highest capacity compared with any system used in
China, according to the general manager, Lee How Giap.
</P>
<P>
So far, the venture has set up a 13-meter-high fiber-drawing
tower to manufacture optical fibers in scale. A second tower will
be completed by the end of this year, improving the venture's
producing capacity to one million km of fibers annually, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The general manager said he is confident about a stable growth
in China's demand for optical fibers, as the country turns out a
double-digit increment in its telecommunications industry every
year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China's demand for optical fiber
registered a year-on-year increase of 25 per cent since the
beginning of 1990s, and is expected to hit 1.6 million km this
year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the demand will maintain an annual rise of 30 per
cent over the next five years, reaching a total of five million km
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
To further enhance its competitive edge in the flourishing
market, Lee said that his venture will be given the ISO-9002
quality certification next year with help from Bell Laboratories,
its research branch.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 25 (Xinhua) -- This capital of south China's
Guangdong Province has issued regulations that will make it
illegal for slaughterhouses to perform animal vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
This is the first local law in the country to govern animal
slaughtering and vaccination.
</P>
<P>
According to the rules, the local government will send
quarantine officers to all its 368 slaughterhouses to perform the
vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
So far, 232 large-scale slaughterhouses out of the total 368
have relinquished their animal quarantine rights to the
officers. More than 8,000 hogs are slaughtered every day in
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Since the province opened its hog market in 1985, the state-
and collective-owned, and private slaughterhouses have been
booming, and carried out animal vaccinations themselves.
</P>
<P>
Sources said this is an old-fashioned practice which provides
the potential for illegally-operated slaughterhouses and threatens
the quality of the pork.
</P>
<P>
The separation of animal slaughtering and vaccinations should
link the local system with the international one, and help the
local livestock enter the worldwide market.

<HEADLINE> Aisha's Dream Of Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Old worker Aisha of the Uygur
nationality donated all his savings to set up a national unity
award at the Urumqi Chemical Factory where he worked. He could
never have dreamed
 that his award would one day extend far and wide.
</P>
<P>
Orphan Aisha pastured sheep for a landlord when he was just
twelve years old, and suffered greatly in the old days.
</P>
<P>
After liberation, the government sent him to study in Shanghai
and after graduation he became one of the first generation of
literate workers of the Uygur nationality.
</P>
<P>
For years Aisha was a model worker at his factory, in terms of
both his work and his love of national unity.
</P>
<P>
A lifelong bachelor, Aisha was cared for by one of his Han
nationality apprentices after his retirement. Aisha, acknowledging
that he had experienced the benefits of national unity,
contributed 1,000 Yuan, or US$120, to set up the Aisha National
Unity Award in his factory before he died in 1982.
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate the Party and the people's government very much,
and I strongly wish that more and more people would become models
of national unity after me", he said at that time.
</P>
<P>
Aisha's story caused wide repercussions not only in his
factory, but also around his whole community. Shortly after
Aisha's death, the award was extended to the subdistrict in which
his factory was located.
</P>
<P>
Several years later, the local government of Shuimogou district
of Urumqi decided to introduce the award to the whole district,
and the fund was also greatly enlarged.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people and 80 collectives have so far received
the award since it was set up. Encouraged by the award, more and
more people are living up to Aisha's dream of unity among people
of different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Shuimogou district of Urumqi has won the
Nationwide National Unity Prize awarded by the State Council.

<HEADLINE> Wang Aims at a Double in Olympic Track and Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- With only one race ran so far this
season, Wang Junxia of China wants to claim two big victories in
the Olympic track and field competitions.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old world record holder for the women's 3,000 and
10,000 meters said here today: "I am not worried about the heat
here nor my rivals. What I want is to win the 5,000m first, and
the 10,000m second."
</P>
<P>
Wang, who competed little after winning the world 10,000m gold
medal at the world championships in Goteborg in 1993, has given no
chance to her rivals in any international competitions to
challenge her since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese talented runner, who left her former coach Ma
Junren after a bitter dispute broke out, didn't appear at the
world championships last year, but she showed at the Chinese
national city games and clocked the year's fifth fastest 5,000m
mark in the world in October.
</P>
<P>
Now, under the training of her new coach Mao Dezhen, the
</P>
<P>
1.63-meter-height girl is eager to prove her superiority by
winning her first Olympic gold medal here.
</P>
<P>
"We tested her form with a 12-kilometer run in a training
session before we left home. She clocked 32 minutes something and
that showed she was in a brilliant form," Mao Dezhen said at the
training area today.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who arrived here two days ago, only put her legs into one
competition this year. The gifted runner clocked the year's world
best in the 10,000m with a time of 31 minutes and 1.76 seconds at
the China Olympic trials last May.
</P>
<P>
She ran four races in five days at that meet, registering
another world best this season in the 5,000m.
</P>
<P>
After that, Wang, who was dubbed as "the Magic Deer", buried
herself in hard training at the Duoba Plateau, a training camp
2,300 meters above the sea level.
</P>
<P>
"We left the Duoba camp for Beijing two weeks ago. I believe
that she can run much better than what she did in Nanjing," said
Mao, who took over the coaching last August after the Chinese
runner failed to train herself well following her escape from the
Ma's Family Army.
</P>
<P>
According to a theory that Ma summed up in the past, Wang
usually reachs her top form around 15 days after descending from a
plateau training camp. That is why Wang didn't came here earlier
with the Chinese delegation by a charted plain.
</P>
<P>
"I feel good now, but the food at the Olympic village is
awful," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The slim girl had four tough races ahead of her in the coming
 days, with three daily runs scheduled from this Friday to
 Sunday, and the 10,000m final on August 1.
</P>
<P>
"The 5,000m final on Saturday is the toughest race for her.
Fernanda Ribeiro of Portugal and Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland will
be her most dangerous opponents in the showdown," Mao predicted.
</P>
<P>
Wang Mingxia and Yang Siju, two other Chinese distance runners,
will team up with Wang Junxia to run a tactical race.
</P>
<P>
"We will work out a plan, but now I cann't tell you anything
about it," the coach told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Ribeiro, the world 5,000m record setter who had bettered Wang's
world best time in her specialty with a time of 14:52.66 last
month, and O'Sullivan, world champion last year, should challenge
Wang all the way to the finish.
</P>
<P>
According to Mao, Wang has overcame the effect of the time
difference after a 36-hour flight, and she has no pressure now.
</P>
<P>
But with a hot afternoon which might reach as high as 35
degrees, Wang still has to beat the weather first before
destroying her rivals for her first big win.

ATLANTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- World champion Pablo Lara of Cuba
came from behind to beat his rivals here on Wednesday, winning the
men's 76-kg category in weightlifting tournament of the Centennial
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban strongman, who won the world championships in
Guangzhou, China last November, snatched 162.5 and jerked 205 for
a combined total of 367.5 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Yoto Yotov, a lifter from Bulgaria who was second at the last
world championships, won the silver at 360, with 160 in the snatch
and 200 in the jerk.
</P>
<P>
Jon Chol-ho of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
finished third at 357.5. The Korean lifter, who made his debut at
the Olympics, won the bronze medal on lighter bodyweight over
Viktor Mitrou of Greece, who also registered 357.5 kilograms in
the total.
</P>
<P>
Armenian Khachatur Kyapanaksian showed his prowess in the
snatch with a good lift of 165 kilograms from his third attempt.
However, he failed three attempts in the jerk and had no combined
weight in the final placings.
</P>
<P>
After the snatch competition, the 28-year-old Cuban lifter, who
finished fourth going into the jerk, confidently opened his jerk
at 200 kilograms and lifted himself to the first place.
</P>
<P>
"I was not worried about jerk, even though I was fourth in the
snatch," said Pablo, who has the world records in the jerk and
total in hands.
</P>
<P>
"I lifted 162.5 kilograms in the snatch, so I need not to worry
about the jerk and the total," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the second attempt in the snatch, Pablo had his right hand
blistered and "it hurt a lot in the third try in snatch," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The blistering of my right hand hurt a little bit in the clean
and jerk," said the Cuban strongman, who finished second at the
last Olympics in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
After finishing second lift at 205 kilograms in the jerk, Pablo
tried a new world record weight of 210 in the third. He managed to
lift bar to his chest, but failed to make it a success.
</P>
<P>
Yotov, who was ranked seventh after the snatch, jumped to the
second with his lift of 200 kilograms in the second attemtp in the
jerk. Without any chance to take the gold, he gave up his last
lift in the competitions.
</P>
<P>
"Anyhow, I am happy with the silver medal," the Bulgarian said.
"I will dedicate the silver to my six-month-old son Denis."
</P>
<P>
After five-day lifts in the 10-category weightlifting
tournament, China and Turkey each collected two gold medals with
Cuba having one.
The 83-kg division competition is slated for Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Shooter Hits First Gold for Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Ivosev Aleksandra won Yugoslavia's
first gold medal at the Centennial Olympic Games as she landed the
women's standard rifle title by totalling 686.1 points here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Russian Irina Gerasimenok came second with 680.1 points, just
0.3 better than third-place finisher Renata Mauer of Poland,
winner of the air rifle gold last Saturday, the first gold for the
Games.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the men's rifle which can be customized with special
accessories and alterations that fit the shooter's needs and
comforts, the women's standard rifle weighs up to 12 pounds and
cannot be modified in any way.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Aleksandra, who placed 22nd in the Barcelona
Games, won her first world title in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mauer, who topped the qualification round with 589 points, two
more than Ivosev and four than Gerasimenok, faltered in the final.
She scored 7.6 and 7.4 in the opening two shots and never had a
chance to catch up.
</P>
<P>
Mauer had once tumbled to fifth after scoring 7.8 points on the
seventh shot. She clawed back to finish third after getting high
marks on the last two shots.
</P>
<P>
However, Mauer's score for the final was the worst of the eight
finalists. Her collection of 90.8 points was 8.3 points away from
the winner.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Vessela Letcheva of Bulgaria, who has made
the top three of world and international competitions 18 times in
the past five years, finished a joint 12th.
</P>
<P>
In the men's double trap event, Mark Russell pulled away in the
final to win Australia second shooting gold since Michael Diamond
got the men's trap event on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Russell, the 1994 world champion, scored 141 hits in the
qualification round and then got 48 hits in the final for a total
of 189, beating the runner-up by six hits.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Bing of China, Albano Pera of Italy and Park Chul-Sung of
South Korea, each garnered 183 hits to make a tie-breaking
shoot-out necessary.
</P>
<P>
Park was the first one out of the shoot-out. In the ensuing
two-men duel, Pera triumphed for the silver with Zhang getting the
bronze.
</P>
<P>
The Italian seemed unhappy with his second place. "The final
placings can be changed given another competition," he said.

<HEADLINE> French Tomb Desecrators Motivated by Neo-Nazi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- French police said that the four
youths arrested last month in the southern city of Toulon for
desecrating a cemetery are motivated by Nazi ideologue, reported
Le Monde in its Thursday edition.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that police found in the homes of the four young
people documents and photos that have a clear Neo-Nazi
inclination.
</P>
<P>
The four youngsters, aged around 20 years, a 22-year-old girl
called Lawrence and three boys, are now jailed at the Saint-Roch
de Toulon prison for desecrating the tomb of Yvonne Foin, a woman
entrepreneur of forgery industry in the 19th century, at a local
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
One of the publications seized in their homes said, "All racial
mixture is forbidden. Only eugenics can purify our race. The
non-whites (with the exception of the Asians whose past is
comparable with ours) are inferior parasites."
</P>
<P>
Police also found a letter written with left hand by one of the
desecrators Anthony Mignoni, which was addressed to Jean-Marie Le
Chevallier, the mayor of Toulon who came from the ultra-rightist
Front National.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Mignoni claimed responsibility for the
desecration in the name of a Muslim group, said Le Monde quoting
police sources.

<HEADLINE> SACP to Celebrate 75th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- South African Communist
Party (SACP) General Secretary Charles Nqakula today announced a
nationwide program to celebrate the party's 75th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Johannesburg, Nqakula said the high
point of the celebrations would be a mass rally at a sports hall
in Cape Town on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The SACP was established in Cape Town in July 1921.
</P>
<P>
The planned rally would be attended by President Nelson
Mandela and Sam Shilowa, a SACP Central Committee Member and
Secretary-General of the Congress of South African Trade Unions
(COSATU), said Nqakula.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, SACP Deputy General Secretary Jeremy Cronin said
the SACP was a living party, rooted to the reality of South
African politics.
</P>
<P>
With 75 years behind, it still had a role to play, best
described by the slogan for the party's 75th anniversary:
"Advance, deepen, defend the democratic breakthrough", said
Cronin.
</P>
<P>
However, he dismissed speculation of a rift within the
tripartite alliance with COSATU and the African National Congress
(ANC) over the government's recently released macro-economic
policy.
</P>
<P>
But Cronin admitted his party was dissatisfied with certain
aspects of the policy, saying the SACP had a right to voice its
concerns robustly and constructively. enditem

<HEADLINE> UN Council Warns Against Any Burundi Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
warned today any attempt to overthrow the government of Burundi,
whose president has taken refugee in the U.S. embassy in
Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council is gravely concerned at recent
information on political developments in Burundi," said a
presidential statement of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"It strongly condemns any attempt to overthrow the present
legitimate government by force or coup d'etat," it said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya of Burundi was
reportedly pelted by stones and cow dung by an angry mob when he
turned up at the funeral of 340 Tutsis massacred by Hutu rebels or
civilians. He fled the scene by helicopter and took refugee in the
U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
Ntibantunganya is the third Hutu president in a country where
the army is controlled by the Tutsi minority. His two predecessors
were killed in coup d'etats by Tutsi soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The massacre of 340 Tutsis by rebel Hutus last weekend in
Bugandana commune in Gitega province worsened an already tense
relationship between the president and radical Tutsis, who vowed
to overthrow the government by force.
</P>
<P>
The council called upon all parties to the conflict in Burundi
to cease immediately any acts of violence and to cooperate fully
with all those who are seeking to bring an end to the vicious
cycle of violence.
</P>
<P>
It urged all parties to exercise restraint and requested the
Burundi authorities to conduct a proper investigation of the
massacre last weekend.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The dispartiy between the
poor and rich countries in the world has widened alarmingly and
it may take up two centuries for the former to catch up unless
concrete measures are instituted to accelerate their economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Discussing the 1996 human development report of the U.N. with
local journalists here today, the resident representative of the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP), J. Victor Angole

enable these poor countries move forward. He said the sub-Saharan

of which only seven billion had been written off. This debt
burden, he said, should either be written off or rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
He said sub-Saharan Africa is at the bottom of the growth
table.
</P>
<P>
For the poor countries to attain the growth levels of the
rich, they must attain economic growth rates of at least three
percent in real terms,he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 19 sub-saharan countries are still at
the level of growth achieved in 1960 or before, six at the 1960s
level, 11 at the 1970s level and seven other are at the growth
level of 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The countries falling in the first category are the Central
African Republic, Chad, Ghana, Liberia, Madagascar, Niger,
Rwanda, Senegal, Zaire and Zambia while Cote d'ivoire,
Mauritania, Sao Tome and Principe, Sierra Leone, South Africa and
Togo fall in the second category.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, Cameroon, Comoros, Gabon, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau,
Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe are at the growth
level of 1970s while Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Congo,
Ethiopia, Kenya and Swaziland are at the 1980s level.

<P>
Clinton has twice vetoed Republican welfare bills on grounds
they were harsh and would cut the bottom out of a federal "safety
net" for the needy, especially children.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers are preparing to hold a conference committee to merge
a new proposal passed last week by the House of Representatives
with a more moderate plan the Senate approved Tuesday and expect
to be delivering a compromise bill to Clinton next week.
</P>
<P>
The House and Senate proposals would dismantle complex federal
bureaucracy by converting the existing programs into block grants
that states could use to tailor poverty programs to their
individual needs.
</P>
<P>
They also would require adult welfare recipients to work after
two years, cut benefits off after five years, discourage
illegitimacy, set eligibility requirements for minor parents on
welfare, permit states to disallow additional benefits for
recipients who have more children, and prohibit benefits for
people who aren't U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican leader Trent Lott and House Speaker Newt
Gingrich said in a joint letter today that Clinton's failure to
accept a third Republican welfare bill would represent a "serious
breach" of his word, referring to Clinton's 1992 campaign promise
to "end welfare as we know it."
</P>
<P>
Welfare reform was part of the Republican's "Contract With
America," a series of promises that helped Republicans win control
of the House and Senate for the first time in four decades.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Vows to Bring Back all Prisoners and Bodies from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 24 (Xinhua)-- After swapping remains of two
Israeli soldiers for dozens of prisoners and over 100 bodies of
guerrillas on Sunday, the Lebanese government vowed tonight to
seek a return of all Lebanese prisoners and bodies of "martyrs"
from Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, opening a weekly session
of the Council of Ministers in his Beirut office, expressed a
condolence to the families of the martyrs whose bodies were
brought back on Sunday under a German-brokered swap deal.
</P>
<P>
He also congratulated the Lebanese prisoners released by the
Jewish state on their safe return to their homes, Information
Minister Farid Mkari told a press conference at the end of the
cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the premier pledged that Lebanon will continue to ask
Israel to hand over all bodies of the martyrs and to release all
the prisoners held in Israel's jails.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said the government would continuously stick to its
"rightful policies" which give priorities to the liberation of
Lebanon and the restoration of all the occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday swap was the biggest deal between Israel and
Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in more than 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah handed the remains of Rahamim Alsheikh and
American-born Rossi Fink to German mediator Bernd Schmidbauer, a
top intelligence adviser of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who escorted
the remains aboard a German air force transport plane to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Shiite Moslem group also turned over 17
militiamen of Israel's proxy South Lebanon Army to a delegation
of the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
Israel, on the other hand, handed over the bodies of 123
guerrillas and 45 captives to the ICRC which then delivered them
to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At a funeral held on Tuesday for some of the guerrillas'
bodies in Beirut's southern suburb, Hezbollah's Secretary General
Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah said that "the file of the remaining
martyrs' bodies is not closed."
</P>
<P>
"If we get any new information on the presence of
guerrilla remains with Israel we will demand their return from
the German mediator who committed to return to us all the
martyrs' bodies," Nasrallah said.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah claimed that there are 70 prisoners still held in
Israel and 112 others by its client militia in Khiam jail
in southern Lebanon, saying that it wants to secure their
release.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the German security official who
brokered the exchange said Tuesday that he believed Ron Arad,
an Israeli navigator who was missing after his plane was shot
down over southern Lebanon in 1986, was still alive.
</P>
<P>
Israel believes Arad is alive and in Iranian hands. Iran has
denied holding him.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Italian cyclist Andrea Collinelli
shattered the world record for the second time in men's individual
pursuit here today in the quarterfinals at the 26th Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Andrea Collinelli clocked 4:19.153 in the four-kilometer event,
trimming 0.546 seconds off the world record he set just hours ago
in the qualification round.
</P>
<P>
In the qualification round, Collinelli broke the world record
set by Graeme Obree of Britain at the 1993 World Cycling
Championships.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Phillipe Ermenault of France broke the
Olympic record when finishing in 4:21.295. The former record of
4:24.496 was set by Chris Boardman of Britain at the Barcelona
Games.
</P>
<P>
Collinelli was the silver medalist at the 1995 World
Championships in Bogota, Colombia in the event. He posted the
fastest time in the qualification round, but lost the finals to
Obree.
</P>
<P>
But this time he would not have to worry about Obree, since
Obree did not advance to the quarter finals after finishing the
11th.

<HEADLINE> French FM: France Wants to Play Active Role in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALEXANDRIA, EGYPT, July 24 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister
Herve de Charette said here today that France wants to play an
active role in the Middle East peace process, but admitted that
"the road of peace will be a difficult and long road."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after a two-hour meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in this Mediterranean port city.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was de Charette's last leg of his Middle East tour which
also took him to Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister told reporters that despite the
difficulties facing by the peace process, the encouraging signs
were that Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians were serious in
their pursuit of a lasting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he noted that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu seemed to have softened somewhat his hard-line stands on
the peace with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
He described Tuesday's meeting between Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy as "good"
and said "we want more of this."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, de Charette met in Jerusalem Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Foreign Minister David Levy and
President Ezer Weizman.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after the meetings that both Syria and Israel
want to make peace and that France will play an active role in
resuming the stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza, he assured Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat that
France was committed to supporting the peace process and will urge
Israel to honor its pledge to withdraw from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut Tuesday, De Charette said France now was a "major
actor" in the Middle East and would launch its own initiatives to
secure the resumption of the Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Either the stalled talks develop or I want to go anywhere,
even to the moon, to get them started."

<HEADLINE> US Personal Incomes Up 1.2 Percent in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Personal incomes in the U.S.
increased by 1.2 percent during the first quarter of this year,
the same as during the final three months of 1995, the U.S.
Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
That was double the 0.6 percent increase in prices that
Americans paid during the period, as measured by a price index for
personal consumption expenditures, the department's Bureau of
Economic Analysis said.
</P>
<P>
Personal incomes in 43 states of the country grew faster than
inflation from January through March. But the changes in personal
income varied among states and regions as usual, ranging from 3.6
percent growth in Idaho to a 0.6 percent decline in Michigan,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The West had nine of the 13 states with the fastest growing
incomes, due to increases in earnings in durable goods
manufacturing, retail trade, construction and farming.
</P>
<P>
In those 13 states, increases in personal incomes were 0.6
percentage point or more above the 1.2 percent national average.
</P>
<P>
Five of the seven states with the slowest growth were in the
Great Lakes region, where GM production is centered and a strike
by GM workers reduced the income, and the Mid-Atlantic. They were
Michigan, Delaware, Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
Massachusetts and Hawaii also ranked in the bottom seven.
</P>
<P>
Personal income is described as that received by all
individuals from all sources, less Social Security payments. It is
measured before tax deductions and is not adjusted for inflation.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Increase Depth of Suez Canal to Attract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISMAILIYA, EGYPT, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Egypt plans to increase
the depth of the Suez Canal so that it can handle ships with a
draft of up to 62 feet (18.9 meters) by the year 2000, Chairman of
the Suez Canal Authority Ahmed Ali Fadel said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held on the occasion of the 40th
anniversary of Egypt's nationalization of the canal, Fadel said
that a highly-efficient dredger is being built in the Netherlands,
and it will be added to a fleet of dredgers that have been used
for increasing the depth of the 193-kilometer-long canal, which
links the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
The project of dredging the canal is aimed at attracting more
oil tankers and bulk carriers to use the canal, which is facing a
tough challenge in hanging on to its customers, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
More regional highways, railroad links and particularly fuel
pipelines have affected revenues gained from the canal. People
have become more and more relying on pipelines to transport oil
and gas instead of oil tankers.
</P>
<P>
Revenue from canal tolls dropped by 23 million U.S. dollars in
the first six months of this year, Fadel said.
</P>
<P>
The canal, which opened nearly 127 years ago as a shortcut
between Europe and the Far East, earned Egypt 923 million dollars
in the first half of 1996 compared with 946 million dollars for
the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Fadel said that this drop in revenue was mainly due to
decreased number of oil tankers using the canal, which was
nationalized on July 26, 1956, after it had been long controlled
by the French and British.
</P>
<P>
"It is normal because of a slump in the oil world market," he
told the news conference held in the Research Center of the Suez
Canal Authority in Ismailiya, a town halfway along the Western
bank of the canal.
</P>
<P>
He said that changes of foreign currency exchange rates have
also affected Suez Canal revenue.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference which lasted for nearly two hours, Fadel
said that Egypt has a more ambitious plan to deepen the canal so
that it can handle ships with a draft of up to 72 or 73 feet.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be carried out after the year 2000 in a second
stage of the dredging project, he said. The canal currently can
allow the passage of ships that need up to 58 feet of water to
float.
</P>
<P>
The number of ships using the canal have been decreasing since
1993. In 1993, it was 17,317; In 1994, 16,370; In 1995, 15,051.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, 7,417 ships passed
through the canal compared with 7,627 for the same period of
1995.
</P>
<P>
But Fadel expressed confidence that the canal, to be developed
in the near future, will keep its position as one of the largest
sources of Egypt's foreign currency income despite the competition
it is facing.

WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States today pledged

</P>
<P>
"We need to be more effective in fighting the
narco-traffickers. We will continue to work with the Zedillo

"They (Mexicans) need the help of the United States government,
they need the help of the Colombians and others, and they need the

States," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that any of us in this hemisphere are satisfied
with any of our efforts to fight counter-narcotics -- fight the
narco-traffickers, including American efforts; we need to do much
more," the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Belarus President Visits Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko arrived in Turkey today for talks with Turkish leaders
in a bid to improve bilateral ties strained by a spy scandal two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko came here this morning for a three-day state visit
to Turkey at the invitation of his Turkish counterpart Suleyman
Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Belarus expelled two Turkish diplomats in 1994, who were
accused of spying. Turkey rejected the allegations and sent
several protest messages.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that Turkey supported Belarussian reforms in the
fields of economics and politics. " We believe that this
transformation, in spite of the difficulties involved, will be
beneficial for the Belarussian people, the whole region, Turkey
and the international community," Demirel said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Turkish regional aim of improving
relations with the newly-emerging states after the collapse of
the Soviet Union would contribute to peace and stability in
the region.
</P>
<P>
He added that bilateral economic ties between Turkey and
Belarus were rapidly growing, which is a hopeful sign.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko's visit is the first at the presidential level,
marking what Demirel called the start of "a new era."
</P>
<P>
Last year, the trade volume between Turkey and Belarus was
53 million U.S. dollars, leaving room for improvement,
Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Belarus signed an agreement to provide Belarus
with a credit of 20 million U.S. dollars for several projects
in Belarus.

<HEADLINE> Ganic's Trip to Belgrade Strengthens Two-Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The first visit ever paid by a
high-level Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation delegation to
Yugoslavia over the past four and half years has achieved concrete
results with a number of agreements on cooperation being signed.
</P>
<P>
Ejup Ganic, vice-president of the Muslim-Croat federation and
head of the current political and business delegation, assessed
the cooperation prospect with Yugoslav Vice Premier Nikola
Sainovic here today at the end of their talks.
</P>
<P>
Both agreed that economic bonds and major interests were the
solid basis for renewing cooperation between the two economies,
especially for restoring the broken links in the domain of
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Ganic arrived here Tuesday for a two-day visit to Yugoslavia.
He has met with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and major
Yugoslav business leaders to discuss broad economic and transport
cooperation between the two parties after five years of
loggerheads.
</P>
<P>
At their talks today, both Ganic and Sainovic reaffirmed the
readiness for a gradual normalization of mutual relations, for
further headway in the implementation of the peace agreement and
for the solution of concrete problems, the Yugoslav Information
Secretariat said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It was noted that the program for the reconstruction of
Bosnia-Herzegovina, along with the equal treatment of the two
Bosnian entities -- Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat
federation -- constituted one of the key conditions for economic
recovery and for broader-based integration processes, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Information Secretariat, the two parties have
reached an accord in principle on the re-opening of road, rail and
air transport, and representatives of both sides have signed the
relevant minutes in this regard.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to carry on with the work to establish or improve
the telecommunications and postal traffic between Yugoslavia and
Bosnia' Muslim-Croat federation, and an accord to open offices of
their chamber of commerce in Belgrade and Sarajevo respectively,
have also been reached at the two-day talks.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also dealt with the transportation of
natural gas and cooperation in the iron and steel and chemical
industries, and in banking, whereas experts would in their future
contacts work out the concrete modalities of cooperation, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav and Muslim-Croat federation officials have agreed
in principle to resume contacts through meetings of
representatives of relevant ministries for further and detailed
discussion to carry out the programs.
</P>
<P>
According to the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug, representatives
of the Bosnian federation and Yugoslav business circles held
meetings at the Yugoslav chamber of the economy today on the
re-establishment of economic links broken in 1991 when the former
Yugoslavia disintegrated.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Set Up National Sports Academy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
announced here today that the government is to pledge 100 million
pounds (155 million U.S. dollars) from the country's successful
national lottery to set up a national sports academy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering of school children and sports stars in
his Downing Street residence garden, Major called on the country's
businessmen to submit bids by October to build the national
academy.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose is to provide an academy that will provide the
best training, the best coaching, the best sports medicine, the
best sports science for elite sports men and women," Major said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister announced plans for the national sports
academy last year as part of a broad initiative to reverse the
decline of sports in schools and to improve sporting standards at
all levels.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, called "Raising the Game" also aims to build
schools and sports clubs and to double the number of U.S.-style
sporting scholarships by the time the Sydney Olympic Games in the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Major, a sports fan himself, also unveiled plans to halt the
sale of school playing fields and earmark schools that specialize
in porting skills.
</P>
<P>
"It is an initiative that is very close to my heart. The best
days of my life at school were spent when we had some form of
cricket, or soccer or rugger," Major said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Swaziland Moving Towards Full Democracy: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said today he was convinced Swazi monarch King
Mswati iii had embarked on a path to a full democratic state.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria after his return from
Maputo, where he attended talks on problems in Swaziland, Mandela
said moves towards democracy in the kingdom had to be expedited.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that his majesty on his own is already taking this
role. For that reason we are convinced the way forward that he
mapped out is one that, in due course, will mirror the
aspirations of the people of Swaziland," said the president.
</P>
<P>
The "emergency consultative meeting" in Maputo, mozambique,
was also attended by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, Botswana
President Ketumile and host President Joaquim Chissano.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Swaziland Acting Prime Minister Sishayi
Nxumalo briefed the four presidents on the king's strategy to
bring democracy to Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
Swazi monarch King Mswati iii, originally planned to attend
the meeting by himself, dispatched Nxumalo to the meeting instead
because he "had contracted flu".
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only southern african country in which
political parties have been banned since 1973, and the king
currently rules the kingdom by royal decree.
</P>
<P>
The mountain kingdom has been plagued by industrial strikes
and political unrest since January, aimed at pressurising the
king to introduce democratic changes. enditem

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD To Set up Micro-Business Unit in Soweto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UMCTAD) is to set up a
micro-business centre in Soweto later this year, the South
African Broadcasting Corporation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The pilot project, called "win-win village", is a joint
venture between UNCTAD, local authorities, non-governmental and
civic organisations, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Project coordinator Ceda Ogada said the centre would offer
services such as marketing, training and servicing to the local
people.
</P>
<P>
Once people had been trained, they would qualify for loans of
up to 10000 Rand (about 2325 U.S.Dollars ) to start their own
business, said Ogada.
</P>
<P>
He said if the project in Soweto turned out to be a success,
it would be duplicated in other areas of the country as well as
elsewhere on the continent.

<HEADLINE> Botswanans Require Visas for Entering S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Botswanan citizens must have
obtained visas beforehand to enter South Africa if they intend to
stay in that country for more than 30 days, said reports reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
The South African Department of Home Affairs had already
advised Air Botswana that all non-South Africans who hold
residence, work or study permits in South Africa would have to
apply for permits to re-enter the country, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The department said if Air Botswana transported any person to
South Africa who did not have the necessary permit or visa, the
airline would be fined 5000 Rand (about 1163 U.S.Dollars ).
</P>
<P>
Previously, visa-free visits for Botswana citizens were
allowed to stay in South Africa for a period up to 90 days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, negotiations by the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) countries to allow the free movement of people
throughout the region are on the verge of breakdown.
</P>
<P>
A proposed SADC protocol in this regard is supported only by
Tanzania and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the 12-member SADC states had rejected the
protocol, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
However, this was denied on Wednesday by a SADC spokesman in
the Botswanan capital Gaborone, saying there would be a delay in
presenting the draft protocol for approval by SADC heads of state
at the forthcoming summit in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
"There is agreement on the board principles, but two or three
articles have not been sorted out, it has certainly not been
rejected," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
SADC groups 12 southern African countries, They are Angola,
Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South
Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Urges World Leaders to Aid Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali today urged political
decision-makers to implement their commitments to assistance of
developing countries and eradication of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Economic and Social Council, Boutros-Ghali
said, "Such implementation requires foremost political will by all
actors at all levels."
</P>
<P>
"Too often the gap between what has been agreed and what is
implemented leaves much to be desired both at the national and
international levels," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the international cooperation for development
stood at a crossroads. Over the past few years, profound changes
had occurred, which questioned some of the traditional ways of
addressing the challenge of development, he added.
</P>
<P>
With the waning of ideological confrontations, the rise in
globalization, and the deepening of interdependence among nations,
a historic opportunity had arisen for political mobilization in
support of international cooperation for development based on
genuine partnership, mutuality of interests and benefits among all
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
While globalization of the world economy generated greater
openness, freer movement of goods and people and created greater
opportunities for international cooperation, he noted an
increasing number of problems could not be effectively addressed
by countries individually. They required international
cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, non-state actors, such as transnational
corporations, private financial institutions and non-governmental
organizations, had important roles to play in the emerging network
of international cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Though a number of developing countries had experienced rapid
economic growth in recent years, many developing countries had
shown slow or negative growth and continued to be marginalized,
the U.N. chief said, adding that poverty continued to affect far
too many people in all parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
He quoted the 1996 Human Development Report to show the extent
of the problem: some 100 countries, with a population of 1.5
billion, had experienced a total failure of growth since 1980; and
the income disparity between the richest 20 percent and the
poorest 20 percent of the world's people had widened from 30:1 to
60:1 over the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
The existence of widespread absolute poverty also inhibited the
full and effective enjoyment of human rights, and weakened
democracy and popular participation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is unacceptable that absolute poverty, hunger and disease,
lack of adequate shelter, illiteracy and hopelessness should be
the lot of over a billion people," he added.
</P>
<P>
"This is why it is especially important that commitments and
targets agreed upon since 1990 to achieve the overall of poverty
eradication be fully implemented by governments, in partnership
with all development actors, the United Nations system, NGOs and
the international community as a whole," he said.

<HEADLINE> France Says Situation in Burundi "Very Worrying" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- France today described the current
situation as "very worrying" in the central African state of
Burundi, and condemned "the pressures exercised with means all out
of legality" upon President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry issued a communique today saying
that peace in Burundi "cannot be maintained other than through a
renunciation of violence by all Burundians, which means an
immediate cease-fire."
</P>
<P>
The communique also called for "the establishment of a
dialogue of all components of the nation which will lead to a
lasting reconciliation" between all ethnic factions of the
country.
</P>
<P>
"We are very evidently in permanent contact with our partners
in the U.N. Security Council and the European Union, as well as
the Secretariat of the Organization of African Unity," it said.
</P>
<P>
Tension is mounting in Burundi after the massacre of 330 Tutsi
civilians last weekend by killing bands presumed to be Hutu
guerillas.
</P>
<P>
President Ntibantunganya took refuge in the U.S. embassy in
Bujumbura today amid rumors of a coup d'etat by the country's
Tutsi-dominated military.
