<HEADLINE> Protesters, Police Clash in Belarus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moscow, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The situation in Minsk, capital
of Belarus, sharply aggravated today after some 2,000 to 3,000
protesters clashed with riot police in the center of the city,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was organized to protest against President
Alexander Lukashenko, who scheduled a referendum on constitutional
amendments that would extend his term from five years to seven
years and give him more power than the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Lukashenko rally began peacefully in the morning with
several hundred participants, but their number soon snowballed to
2,000 or 3,000. Demonstrators broke through riot police near the
government building in the Independent Square as of 14:00 local
time.
</P>
<P>
Tear gas was used against the protesters. Armored personnel
carriers have been spotted in some areas in downtown Minsk and
police have cordoned off all major state buildings there.
</P>
<P>
Following the clash, the situation in Minsk was coming back to
normal. Cars with riot police were also leaving downtown areas.
Normal traffic was restored along central streets and in the
Independent Square, the scene of the clash.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said demonstrators called on compatriots to
gather again on Monday afternoon to back the opposition-dominated
parliament in its current standoff with the president.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China's Environmental Protection Regulations Worked out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
province, which borders Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar, has written
some regulations on environmental protection in areas around ports
of entry.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has the largest number of ports of entry of all Chinese
provinces and regions, with ten each of Category 1 and 2 ports of
entry, and more than 80 border passages.
</P>
<P>
With the growing border trade and exchanges in recent years,
pollution has been increasing and has become a major problem in
borders areas, with an influx of used cars and other machines that
are dismantled on this side of the border.
</P>
<P>
To check the growth in pollutants and to protect local
residents from harmful effects, the new regulations call for
authorities at ports of entry to establish special ways of dealing
with the problem and to increase efforts at environmental
protection. They also encourage the development of
environment-friendly industries such as ecological tourism and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Construction companies are required to provide new houses with
special garbage disposal facilities, and garbage can only dumped
and buried at designated sites.
</P>
<P>
Without approval, no one can bring in used motor vehicles or
other machines to get rid of them. Dumping of industrial waste,
garbage, oil, acids, alkalis, or poisonous liquids in
international rivers is strictly prohibited, as is bringing of
garbage into China for disposal.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the regulations stipulate that any dispute involving
environmental issues along the border should be submitted to the
state and provincial environmental protection authorities for
settlement.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: French Government Holds on to Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The French government is holding
on to economic and social reform one year after the announcement
of a drastic social security reform plan by Prime Minister Alain
Juppe.
</P>
<P>
Despite endless protests of the people and increasing quarrels
within the ruling majority, Juppe finally made it by controlling
the public deficit of 1996 at 287.98 billion francs (57.6 billion
U.S. dollars), around 4 percent of the gross domestic product
(GDP), according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
This would pave the way for attaining a ceiling of budget
deficit below 3 percent of GDP in 1997 to meet the criteria of the
entry into the European Monetary Union, which is expected to
launch a single European currency by 1999.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac last week praised Juppe for his
courage and perseverance in carrying out the reform, and retorted
accusations by former interior minister Charles Pasqua and
president of the Union pour Democratie Francaise party Francois
Leotard against Juppe's plan.
</P>
<P>
However, the government is still facing very difficult jobs of
lowering the 12.6 percent unemployment rate, cutting a 50 billion
franc deficit of social security spending, and reforming
money-losing state-owned enterprises such as the National Railway
Company and Credit Lyonnais, and facing up to bitter social
discontent.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of French people took to the streets across
the country Saturday to protest the presentation one year ago by
Juppe of the social security reform plan, calling for social
protection for all, protection of employment, and maintaining
public services.
</P>
<P>
The social security reform plan, aimed at balancing the budget
in two years and eliminating a 230 billion franc (46 billion
dollars) state debt in social security in 13 years, is moving
forward, if at all, at a very slow pace.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions have warned against any attempt to privatize the
social security system, and have predicted its failure within two
years after its presentation, because of strong opposition from
both employees of state-owned companies and professional unions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several privatization projects, including those of
the Credit Industriel et Commercial and the Thomson Multimedia,
have been shelved by the government after meeting strong protests.
</P>
<P>
The plan to reform the National Railway Company of France by
separating its management from technical operations is also
deadlocked due to union opposition.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent poll, more French people now trust the
left-wing parties more than the right-wing ones in "managing the
country," mainly because the leftists are more concerned about
social protection, fight against marginalization and employment.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party has recently presented an economic platform
for the 1998 legislative election, which promises the creation of
700,000 jobs in two years and calls for the drafting of a law
reducing weekly working hours to 35 without reduction of salary to
protect employment.
</P>
<P>
In a country with a strong socialist tradition, Juppe's reform
will no doubt follow a zig-zag path before it could go somewhere.

Unofficial final vote count shows that the New Aspiration Party

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Athens Stock Exchange Reopens After Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Athens Stock Exchange (ASE)
reopened earlier this week after a three-day suspension of
operations caused by the declared bankruptcy and alleged fraud
committed by the major stock brokerage company Delta Stock Brokers
s.a.
</P>
<P>
Trading resumed on a limited scale, as a compromise formula
worked out following government intervention allowed the
participation of only some 30 stock brokerage firms which proved
they had fully covered their commitments to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
The turnover of the trade at the first few days stood at 600
million drachmas (2.6 million u.s. dollars) daily, about a tenth
of a normal day's before the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Suspension of the ASE's operation began last friday, following
the discovery that Delta had issued checks which bounced to the
value of 2.6 billion drachmas (11.3 million u.s. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Initial investigations showed that eight other smaller stock
broking firms were also found to have been acting as
intermediaries between Delta and small-time shareholders and the
total amount of bad checks issued for share transactions may reach
10 billion drachmas (43 million u. s. dollars). The three top
executives of Delta have been charged with fraud and prohibited
from leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
The ASE crisis, worst in its 120-year-old history, is also
reflective of the country's economic problem and cash flow
shortage as a result of the government's drive to meet the
European Union's convergence criteria for monetary union, which
has led to severe spending cuts, the large-scale closure of
enterprises, increased taxation and a crackdown on Greece's
notorious parallel of "black" economy. This has resulted in
extensive use of post-dated checks
</P>
<P>
Delta's declared bankruptcy over bounced checks came as the
bank of Greece announced that the amount of such checks nationwide
reached an all-time record of 265 billion drachmas (1.15 u.s.
billion dollars) in the first 10 months of the year.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to quickly restore confidence, National Economy
Minister Yannos Papantoniou has promised that losses of share
holders will be covered both through the ASE's guarantee fund and
through direct payments from companies whose shares had been
traded by Delta.

<HEADLINE> Iran Threatens to Sever Ties With Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran today threatened to
sever its diplomatic relations with Germany in a protest against
Bonn for insulting the Iranian authorities, including Supreme
Leader Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Iranian parliamentarians today signed an
unprecedented letter and urged the Iranian Foreign Ministry to
seriously reconsider its ties with Bonn.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here noted that Tehran would lose much more
than Bonn if it dares to sever its ties with Germany, which is
Iran's largest Western trading partner, with bilateral trade
expected to reach 4 billion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they doubt the Iranian government will take
further step to worsen the bilateral relations between Iran and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Addressed to Iran's Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri,
the letter called as "political theatrics" the latest verdict by
German prosecutor on the assassination of Kurdish dissidents in
Berlin in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"We, the representatives of the beloved nation of Iran, call
on the Foreign Ministry to provide a full report to the
Parliament on the revision of ties between Iran and Germany,"
the letter said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, German prosecutors recommended that Kazem Darabi,
an alleged member of the Iranian intelligence, and another
suspect be sentenced to life imprisonment for the September 1992
killings of a Kurdish opposition leader and three aides.
</P>
<P>
German prosecutors have accused Iran's supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hashemi Rafsanjani of
complicity in the murders.
</P>
<P>
German accusations that Iran's top leaders had ordered the
murders have unleashed a storm of protests in Iran, with
newspapers calling on authorities to sever ties with Germany.
</P>
<P>
Today, some 2,000 Iranian student marched on the street and
staged an anti-German demonstration, throwing rotten tomatoes,
eggs and stones at the German Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Refuting the accusations of the German court, Iranian Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said the German government is
responsible for controlling those who have embarked on such
"unlawful actions" under any excuse.
</P>
<P>
He added that according to the civil legislation of almost
all countries the heads of state of other countries should not
be insulted and that the German court has violated the
international norms and made statement contrary to the
internationally recognized principles.
</P>
<P>
He said Mykonos court has based its accusations on the
testimony given by the two "political fossils" that have become
isolated and unaware of the developments in Iran.

<HEADLINE> UK Opposition Pledges Poll on Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Labor party has
promised to hold a referendum before joining a European single
currency if it won next election.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition party's U-turn was aimed at preventing Labor
being seen as too pro-Europe during what is likely to be a highly
charged election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Labor sees the advantages of a single currency but, like the
Convervatives, insists that the economic conditions must be right
and says it will keep its options open.
</P>
<P>
The party's new move was announced by its economics spokesman
Gordon Brown, who told BBC today that a referendum was now seen as
"the most appropriate" way to ensure that any move into a
Euro-currency holds public support.
</P>
<P>
It was now clear that crucial aspects of economic and monetary
union (EMU) would not be settled in time for Labor to make up its
mind before the election, he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the Labor's move will undermine
Tory government's efforts to concentrate debate on purely economic
matters.
</P>
<P>
Labor strategists are convinced that the lull in Tory
infighting over Europe since the party conference will be ended by
a debate on whether to go further on a single currency.
</P>
<P>
Up to now all Britain's main parties are committed to holding a
national vote before joining EMU.

ABU DHABI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- President of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan al Nahyan met here today
with Hadi Manafi, Assistant to Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
According to the UAE News Agency, during the meeting, the
Iranian official conveyed the congratulations of the Iranian
president, government and people to Sheikh Zayed on the occasion
of his return home after recovery.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed relations between the UAE

</P>
<P>
The UAE president returned home Wednesday after a successful
neck surgery in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Though the visit to the UAE by the assistant to the Iranian
president was announced as conveying the greetings of the Iranian
president for the recovery of Sheikh Zayed, observers here hold
that it actually demonstrates a positive attitude on the part of
the Iranian government toward the UAE in the wake of repeated UAE
criticism of the Iranian occupation of the three disputed
islands, namely Greater and Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa.

<HEADLINE> Golan Vitally Strategic for Israeli Security: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said today that considering the "threat" Israel
is facing, the Golan Heights are vitally strategic for the
country's security.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Golan, a strategic plateau, from Syria in
the 1967 Middle East War
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Mordechai said only when
the threat changes and there is a chance to talk about
alternatives, will it be possible to discuss everything.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Minister warned that Israel would hit back hard
if attacked by Syria, adding that the Israeli counter attack
would be so hard that it could topple Syrian President Hafez
Assad's regime.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel knows that Syria is "manufacturing
chemical weapons for military purpose" with the Russian help,
and it must take the threat into account.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that Israel wants peace with its Arab
neighbors, including the Syrians, and hopes the Syrian side will
return to the negotiating table with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Situations along the borders between Israel and Syria have
been intensified since the new Israeli government, led by
hardline Likud party's Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu, took office
in June.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israeli media reported that Israeli airplanes
scrambled to quickly confront suspicious Syrian aircraft
movements over the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Although the aircraft movement did not turn out to be a
threat, it underscored the level of alert the Israeli army has
adopted in light of the latest Syrian troop movements.
</P>
<P>
Israeli defense sources said they have been closely
monitoring the Syrians, amid growing reports that they are not
just saber rattling, but preparing a military option against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The three Syrian mechanized divisions permanently stationed
along the Golan Heights conducted annual maneuvers last month,
only this year the Israeli army was paying close attention to
the exercise, since it could quickly turn into an offensive.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Israel had not reinforced its troops
along the front in order not to have this misinterpreted by the
Syrians. but reports indicated that the Israeli army has
continued to stage "exercise" on the Golan as a way of keeping
forces on hand for any eventuality.
</P>
<P>
On 14 December, 1981, the Knesset (Israel's parliament) passed
the Golan Law, announcing "the law, jurisdiction, and
administration of the state shall apply to the Golan Heights."
</P>
<P>
At previous peace negotiations, Syria demanded a total Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, but the new Israeli government
rejected the idea, arguing that talks should be held without
preconditions.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Consul Allowed to Visit Suspected Spy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian prosecution
authority today sent a letter to the Israeli consul here,
allowing him to meet with an Israeli suspected of spying.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian prosecution also will issue an official charge
sheet today or Monday against the Israeli man and an Egyptian
citizen, now interned in Tora Prison, south of Cairo, according
to the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) today.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian public prosecution source said Saturday the
prosecutor had questioned Azam Azam, an Israeli of Arab origin,
and Egyptian national Emad Eddin Abdul Hamid and would issue
charges detailing the accusation in the next three days.
</P>
<P>
Azam was held earlier this week on suspicion of recruiting the
Egyptian to spy for Israel's Mossad secret service, officials
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The government will also allow the Israeli Embassy to name an
Egyptian lawyer to defend Azam, a mechanic at the textile factory
Tefron, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Azam, a 35-year-old Israeli Arab, was seized last week outside
a Cairo hotel by about 10 men said to be Egyptian security
agents. The factory is owned jointly by Egypt and Israel.
</P>
<P>
His arrest has strained already tense relations between Egypt
and Israel, which insists he is not a spy and should be freed.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to establish diplomatic
relations with Israel. The Israeli government's intransigence in
Israeli-Arab peace talks has hindered the expansion of
Egyptian-Israeli ties.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak told an Israeli newspaper
Thursday that the Egyptian had admitted selling information to
Azam, who had been caught in Cairo with invisible ink and other
unspecified items, according to the local press.

<HEADLINE> World Food Summit Ends in Rome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The first-ever World Food Summit
devoted solely to food security and hunger eradication ended here
this evening with a call for concrete follow-up actions to
implement the decisions made at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference marking the conclusion of the
summit, FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf said that the summit
has been successful in raising worldwide awareness on the
importance and urgency of realizing universal food security and
eradicating hunger and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
Diouf said that while food security is primarily the
responsibility of sovereign states, international cooperation is
also essential, especially for the low-income food-deficit
countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are living in a planetary village and we must help each
other in achieving food security," Diouf said.
</P>
<P>
In all, 45 presidents, 15 vice presidents, 41 prime ministers
and deputy prime ministers and 74 senior officials including
ministers spoke at the five-day summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit's greatest achievement is the adoption of two major
documents, the World Food Security Rome Declaration and the World
Food Summit Plan of Action, which reaffirm the right of everyone
to have access to safe and nutritious food and set an immediate
goal of reducing the number of undernourished people to half their
present level by the year 2015.
</P>
<P>
Widely represented as the summit was, there was an obvious
difference between the developing and developed countries in their
attitude toward the meeting itself and toward how to achieve food
security and eradicate hunger.
</P>
<P>
Summit organizers had explicitly declared in advance that the
meeting would not be a pledge one in order to attract as many top
leaders from the developed world as possible. However, many major
developed countries, with the exception of France, were
represented only by ministerial officials.
</P>
<P>
The emphases of speeches were also different. Most developing
countries emphasized the urgency of eradicating hunger and
malnutrition, the necessity for the developed countries to come to
the aid of the developing countries, and the need to refrain from
using food as an instrument for political and economic pressure.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, many speakers from developed countries
emphasized that food security and hunger eradication were
primarily the responsibilities of individual developing countries,
and put forward some pre-conditions for external assistance that
were unrealistic and unpracticable to the developing countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian authorities today
claimed that the United States should recognize not only the
Islamic system but also Islamic tradition and values as a
prerequisite for holding dialogue between Tehran and Washington.
</P>
<P>
This is the statement made by Habibullah Askaroladi,
Secretary General of the Islamic Coalition Society, at a press
conference as his reply to a question posed by an American
woman correspondent Today.
</P>
<P>
Askaroladi, who was former commerce minister during the cabinet
headed by Mir-Hussein Musavi, said the dialogue between Iran
and the United States requires a "necessary prelude, which does
not exist yet."
</P>
<P>
"The United States should first recognize the Islamic Republic
of Iran before the dialogue between the two (countries)," he
added. He noted that "dialogue in the absence of the
U.S. recognition of Iran would be deception."
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that Washington had sent a message
to Tehran through Swiss Embassy in Iran and it warned to
take action if Iran continued what it says "support for
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati denied
receipt of the threat letter from the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We have not received the letter from the United States. They
know the limit and nobody can threat us," he said. "We know how to
deal with Americans if they threat us. We will give them crashing
guns."
</P>
<P>
On November 3, Iran staged nationwide rallies against the
United States to mark the 17th anniversary of the takeover
of U.S. embassy by radical students on November 4, 1979.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the United States have remained hostile to each other
for 17 years. The United States accuses Tehran of supporting
international terrorism and seeking nuclear weapons. It even
threatened to launch a military strike against the Iranian
targets.

BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of China
and Russia held talks in Beijing today, where they said they will
work hard to develop a Sino-Russian "partnership with strategic
coordination" and a vision of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen welcomed
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov, by expressing his
pleasure at being able to "exchange views on bilateral relations
and international issues of shared interest."
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who started his China tour yesterday, said that he
was deeply impressed by Shanghai's development during his visit
there Sunday and congratulated China on its great economic
achievements. "The stronger China becomes, the more peace and
stability in the region will benefit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides said they value the establishment of a strategic
coordination partnership between the two countries, and Primakov
noted that this is a strategic option for Russia, which hopes that
bilateral relations will continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that President Jiang Zemin and President Boris
Yeltsin announced the forging of a Sino-Russian strategic
partnership in April, which has had positive reverberations in the
world.
</P>
<P>
"China's and Russia's treating each other as good friends, good
partners and good neighbors, and intensifying all-round
cooperation is where the fundamental interests of our two peoples
lie, and is beneficial to the maintenance of world peace and
stability," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
They said that they agree on joint efforts to make the results
of the April Sino-Russian Summit manifest and to advance bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also discussed the development of bilateral
ties in the near future and came to a consensus, including

<P>
SHANGHAI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony was held in
Shanghai today to announce the start of the Donghai Pinghu
Offshore Oil-Gas Extraction Project in the East China Sea, some
420 km southeast of the city.
</P>
<P>
China began to look for oil and gas there in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the central government approved the Pinghu project,

about 20 sq km at a cost of five billion yuan, coming from
Shanghai, the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, and the
China National Offshore Oil Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The three parties have set up a joint venture, the Shanghai Oil
and Gas Corporation, to manage the project, which includes an
offshore platform, oil and gas wells, oil pipe, a gas plant, and a
crude oil boosting station.
</P>
<P>
It is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1998, by which
time the field will supply 1.2 million cubic meters of gas to
Shanghai daily.
</P>
<P>
The drilling of the first oil well will start on Tuesday,
official sources said.
</P>

Qian said that the Chinese and Russian presidents, during their
meeting last April, shared the view that the two countries' annual
trade volume should be no less than 20 billion dollars by the end
of the century.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that trade and economic cooperation could reach a
higher level as long as our governments and businesses work
together and take effective steps," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that Russia is glad to see the steady progress in
bilateral trade, which increased by 48 percent in the first 10

efforts," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the border issue, Qian said that China and Russia
share one of the longest borders in the world, running some 4,300
kilometers, and have made important progress in border talks and
border demarcation work.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of agreements on the eastern and western sections
of Sino-Russian border and their taking effect show the extent of
legalization of most of the border area," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We take note of the fact that President Yeltsin approved the
fundamental principles of Russian border policy not long ago and
we appreciate the Russian stand that these principles will not
affect Sino-Russian talks on the border and the demarcation work,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a common objective of making our border a bond of
peace, stability, cooperation and prosperity," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Khmer Rouge Denies Abduction of Foreign Mines Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PNNOM PENH, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Khmer Rouge has denied
involvement in the kidnapping of a British mine-clearing expert
and his colleague in March.
</P>
<P>
In a message to King Norodom Sihanouk released today but dated
November 12, Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan said, "We have
completely and strictly verified that the National Army of the
Democratic Kampuchea have not been involved in this matter."
</P>
<P>
Khieu Samphan was responding to a message dated November 2 by
the king who asked for information on the fate of British
mine-clearing expert Christopher Howes and his Cambodian
interpreter Houn Hourth.
</P>
<P>
Howes and Hourth were kidnapped by armed men in late March in
the northwest province of Siem Reap, about 17 kilometers from the
famed Angkor Wat temple.
</P>
<P>
They were members of a team of 23 mine-clearing experts held up
by an armed group. Most of the team managed to escape or were
released by the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
Conflicting accounts of the whereabouts of the two men and who
their captors were emerged over the following weeks. The Royal
Government was led to believe that they had been moved to the
Anlong Veng, a Khmer Rouge stronghold near the northern
Thai-Cambodian border.
</P>
<P>
A report in the Bangkok Post in late August quoted an
unidentified source on the Thai-Cambodian border as saying that
Howes and his colleague were dead.
</P>
<P>
But the Agence Khmers de Presse cited breakaway Khmer Rouge
officers as telling reporters on October 20 in the northwestern
town of Sisophon that the two men were still alive.

"Facts show that the practise that only one country has the
final say in international affairs would not work," he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Pak Govt Expanding Privatization Net </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's caretaker
government is working to expand the scope of privatization in the
transportation sector including airlines, railways, shipping
companies and airports for their modernization.
</P>
<P>
"There needs to be a major injection of capital into the
transportation sector," the newly-appointed chairman of the
Privatization Commission (PC), Salman Shah, said in an interview
with the local press here today.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker government has asked the commission to expand the
range of assets for privatization especially in the transportation
sector.
</P>
<P>
"We want to come up with the coordinated plan as a whole to
make it flourish under healthy, dynamic private initiatives," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Shah emphasized the imperative need of modernization, saying,
"We have not been able to keep up with the equipment and
investment in the infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
He put the financial sector on top of the priority list and
said the government intends to move very fast in the area.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would set up a resolution trust bank
(RTB) to take account of bad debts taken out from some banks and
initiate moves to recover them.
</P>
<P>
"The RTB would devise ways and means of collecting on those bad
debts with the full backing of law and government. We intend to
recover all the bad debts, which have been accumulated over the
past," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Shah said, "We would clean up the public sector financial
institutions and we would then initiate process to privatize
them."
</P>
<P>
He termed the energy sector as "a very complicated area" in
privatization and the privatization of gas sector is highly
technical and complex due to a monopoly situation.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the spending of proceeds from privatization, he
said, it should go towards debt retirement because Pakistan
currently has a really high level of outstanding debt, both
internal and external.
</P>
<P>
"We have more than 30 billion dollars of external debt and 30
to 40 billion dollars of internal debt. It is very difficult to
service this debt," he said. "So we are generating the cash flows
from state owned assets to pay off our debts."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan started its nationwide privatization process in 1989.
A number of industrial units and national banks have been
privatized so far.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Denies Peres' Advice on Hebron (I) (By Wang Yukui) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat today denied reports
that Israeli opposition leader Shimon Peres advised him not to
sign an agreement on the Israeli army's redeployment in
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's comment was conveyed by his political advisor Ahmed
Tibi, who said that Israel's delays were the only reason why
the accord on the redeployment in the West Bank town had
not been signed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Labor Party officials have demanded Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to investigate the matter, and take
steps against the unnamed cabinet minister who made the allegation
about Peres.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu called Peres, who is currently abroad, and told
the Labor Party chairman that he does not believe the story
about him.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party faction in the Knesset (Israel's parliament)
is to meet at a special session to discuss the matter later today.
</P>
<P>
The development came at a time when Israel and the
Palestinians are blaming each other for the delay of concluding
the agreement on the Israeli redeployment from Hebron, the last
West Bank town still under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
There have been intensive negotiations between Israeli and
Palestinian officials for the last two weeks, however, no
progress has been made so far.
</P>
<P>
The main issue in dispute still concerns Israel's demand for
"free action" and "hot pursuit" of suspected extremists in the
areas, which constitute 80 percent of the Hebron to be put under
Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been refusing to renegotiate the
existing agreement, known as the Oslo accords, and would
accept only joint action by mobile units in Palestinian rule
areas in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, Israeli army was originally
supposed to have completed its redeployment in the Hebron area by
March 28 and pulled back from approximately 80 percent of the
town.
</P>
<P>
However, following a series of suicide bombing attacks in
Israel last February and March which left over 60 people
dead and more than 100 wounded, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres
delayed the redeployment.

<TEXT>
<P>
In May, the previous Israeli government announced that
the army's withdrawal from Hebron would be carried out after
the May 29 general elections, due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres, defeated by Likud chairman Netanyahu in the
elections, said afterward that he would leave the decision of
the redeployment to the new prime minister and his government.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 30 kilometers south of Jerusalem, is a place of
pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Muslims alike, and tradition
has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives are
all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There are some 450 Jewish settlers now living in the
center of Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish
neighborhood after the 1967 War, during which Israel took over
the town from the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surrounding the Jewish community, there are more
than 200,000 Palestinian residents living in most other parts
of the city.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaign, Netanyahu said that he would
like Hebron to be part of the final status arrangements with the
Palestinians, but, at the same time, he also said he would stand
by the international agreements.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, Israel and the Palestinians started a
new round of continuous talks on the redeployment in Hebron,
which had already been delayed for more than half a year.
</P>
<P>
At the negotiation table, Israel insisted on changes in the
security arrangements agreed to under the Oslo accords, in light
of the violent confrontations between the Israelis and
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in September.
</P>
<P>
During the confrontations, triggered off by the opening of
the Hasmonean Tunnel by Israel in Jerusalem's Old City, more
than 70 people were killed and hundreds of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the confrontations, which had included
exchanges of fire between Israeli troops and the Palestinian
police, U.S. President Bill Clinton called for an emergency
summit in Washington to resuscitate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
As one of the few results of the summit, Israelis and the
Palestinians agreed to hold round-the-clock talks, in an attempt
to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
However, after four weeks of continuous talks, with the
participation of U.S. special Middle East coordinator Dennis Ross
and other US officials, Israel and the Palestinians failed to
complete a deal on the Hebron redeployment.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Meets with Oceanic Peace Delegates (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), met with forty delegates to the 24th World
Conference on Oceanic Peace (Pacem in Maribus), at the Great Hall
of the People here today.
</P>
<P>
Li welcomed the guests on behalf of the Chinese Government and
extended his congratulations on the occasion of the conference, in
reference to which he emphasized three points:
</P>
<P>
First, that oceans play a leading role in human existence. They
cover more than 70 percent of the earth's surface and constitute
an essential part of the planet's support system.
</P>
<P>
Oceans are a storehouse of resources, Li said, and for millions
of years, much of the protein consumed by human beings has come
from them.
</P>
<P>
With a growing need for natural resources and the decline in
global resources, Li noted, modern society has shifted its focus
to the oceans, which still need to be exploited. The progress of
humanity depends more and more on oceans, and future civilizations
must look for a way out in the oceans.
</P>
<P>
The oceans, in an interrelationship with land the air,
determine the ecosystem. A good ocean environment will guarantee
the existence of mankind, Li said, and a deterioration of the
ocean environment, especially maritime disasters, will cause heavy
damages.

<TEXT>
<P>
Li noted that oceans connect the world, and throughout history,
have played a dual role of both separating and connecting people
in different continents or countries.
</P>
<P>
Although oceans separated more often than connected people in
ancient times when the productivity was low, Li said, in modern
times, their connecting function outweighs their separating
function, and it is growing.
</P>
<P>
As is obvious to all, almost all developed nations today are
next to oceans, and almost all developed areas in countries are in
coastal areas, because of the fact that oceans provide the most
convenient and extensive channels for foreign trade and exchanges,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said the important role of oceans cannot be replaced by any
other link between human beings, even though they become more
diverse and efficient.
</P>
<P>
The second point, he acknowledged, is that maritime development
is a major component part of China's long-term strategy, with the
country's 18,000-km-long coastline.
</P>
<P>
China was one of the first countries to explore and make use of
the ocean, Li said. He went on to point out that since the
launching of the reforms and opening to the outside world, the
country has had some important maritime development, improving
maritime controls, emphasizing protection of the oceans, funding
maritime research, expanding maritime services, and, especially,
developing the ocean economy.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, China's maritime development does not
live up to the country's status as an ocean power, and that its
people should and can be more successful in maritime affairs and
should make a greater contribution to world maritime development.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that the Chinese Government upholds the
following principles of maritime development:
</P>
<P>
-- Rational utilization. He said that, as a densely-populated
developing country with serious population problem, China should
seek solutions to these problems through further ocean use, and
maritime growth for the national economy and people's lives, for
the nation's future.
</P>
<P>
The full use of the oceans' geographic advantages is essential,
Li said, and China should continue its opening-up program in
coastal areas to improve economic growth in inland areas.

<P>
Another point is increased protection of the oceans. This
includes prevention of over-use and pollution, to maintain a good
environment for marine resources and to leave rich oceans for
future generations.
</P>
<P>
A third is rights and obligations as set forth in the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. According to the
convention, China is duty bound to safeguard its rights and
interests in the oceans and to handle international ocean affairs
with neighboring countries in a just and reasonable way.
</P>
<P>
Li said China should also co-operate internationally in ocean
development. The oceans' nature assures that their development is
an international affair, and that problems should be settled
through international cooperation. China lags behind in ocean
development and should learn from advanced countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the Chinese government places great emphasis
on enhanced co-operation with foreign countries or international
organizations in ocean development, in ocean controls, personnel
training, technology exchanges, and regional research.
</P>
<P>
The 21st century will see further development of the oceans and
reinforced control of the oceans, Li said, and it is the
responsibility of our generation to get oceans to contribute more
to the development of mankind, and to leave healthy oceans for
future generations.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Ranked High in WEF Competitiveness Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong ranks second in
the Competitiveness Index contained in a report issued by the
World Economic Forum (WEF) here today.
</P>
<P>
Issued by WEF President Jeffrey Sachs at a press conference for
the opening here today of the three-day European/East Asia
Economic Summit, the Global Competitiveness Report 1996 includes
such tables as the Competitiveness Index, Growth Ranking and
Market Growth Index.
</P>
<P>
"The report offers a wealth of statistical data useful to
government and corporate decision makers in understanding the
sources of international competitiveness and long-term economic
growth," Sachs said.
</P>
<P>
Competitiveness signifies the ability of an economy to achieve
high rates of sustained economic growth, as measured by the annual
 change in gross domestic product per person, according to the
author of the report.
</P>
<P>
The rankings in the Competitiveness Index are based on
quantitative and survey data, collected and combined into eight
factors of competitiveness. Measurements of these eight factors
are then combined into one overall ranking of competitiveness
called the Competitiveness Index.
</P>
<P>
Singapore ranks top in the Competitiveness Index with 2.19,
followed by Hong Kong 1.89, New Zealand 1.57, the United States
and Luxembourg 1.34 and 1.29 respectively, among a total of 49
countries and regions listed.

PARIS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- France Info, the non-stop news
radio station of Radio France, was ordered by the Paris Tribunal
of Grand Instance to broadcast today and Tuesday a judicial
conviction of its slander against a Morocco-based radio station.
</P>
<P>
The Paris court judged on October 30 that Radio Info committed
slander on May 23 and 24 against Radio Mediterranee Internationale
(Medi 1) by accusing the latter of spreading false news about
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The Medi 1, based in Tanger, Morocco, broadcast in March a
faxed declaration by the Armed Islamic Group claiming
responsibility for the murder of seven French Trappist Monks in
Algeria on March 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Medi 1, which has broadcast several declarations by Islamic
extremists of Algeria since the beginning of this year, has a
strong French background.
</P>
<P>
The court said that the commentaries, written by a
correspondent of Radio Info in Algiers and broadcast on the radio,
harmed the professional reputation of Medi 1 by "putting into
doubt the independence, the seriousness and objectivity of the
information as well as the indispensable credibility for an organ
of the press."
</P>
<P>
Radio Info and its correspondent in Algiers were also ordered
to pay one symbolic franc (20 U.S. cents) to Medi 1 for the
damages suffered by the radio.

<P>
He said, "Upon conviction, punishment is seven years, apart
from disqualification for five years for public representatives
and termination of services from office."
</P>
<P>
He said that the law would encompass officials of federal and
provincial governments, corporations, organizations, banks, public
representatives and army officials working in government
organizations.
</P>
<P>
However, the sitting president, governors of the four
provinces, judges and army officers in service are exempted from
the law in accordance with the constitution.
</P>
<P>
A chief judge commissioner will be appointed for a term of four
years by the president to inquire into allegations of corruption
and corrupt practices and for investigation and prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner will be either a sitting or retired judge of
the Supreme Court and, once appointed, he cannot be removed.
</P>
<P>
He must conclude the investigation within one month.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker law minister made an offer of amnesty.
</P>
<P>
If within 10 days of the announcement of the law, if a public
official makes full and complete declaration in writing to the
commissioner of acquisition of property through corruption and
corrupt practices and voluntarily returns such properties, no
penal action will be taken under the ordinance or any other law
for the time being in force.
</P>
<P>
"He will of course stand disqualified for five years if he is
holder of a public office and if a bureaucrat he will cease to
hold his post," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Accountability Ordinance, the law minister said,
there is a provision for freezing of property during the pendency
of proceedings.
</P>
<P>
As an incentive to the public, he said, if on an individual's
complaint, a public official is convicted and his conviction is
maintained by the Supreme Court, the complainant will be entitled
to a reward to be determined by the court.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, if a complaint is false or with ulterior
motives, he can be punished for a term up to three years.
</P>
<P>
The law minister said, even at the High Court stage, the
accused will have the opportunity to repent by returning the
assets, properties which were acquired by illegal means subject to
such terms and conditions as the High Court may deem fit.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, the accused will stand disqualified in
case of public representative and dismissed from service in case
of an officer.
</P>
<P>
The accused, he said, may only be arrested with prior written
approval of the chief commissioner, and in no case his detention
will be for a period exceeding 14 days as a whole.
</P>
<P>
President Farooq Leghari dismissed the government of Benazir
Bhutto and dissolved the National Assembly on November 5.
</P>
<P>
A caretaker government was set up at the same time which
promised to hold free and fair elections within 90 days and hold
accountability process against corrupted politicians and
government officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will spare no effort to
strengthen friendly cooperation with China for the benefit of the
two peoples, the peace and development of Asia and the world,
Vietnamese National Assembly (NA) Chairman Nong Duc Manh said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Manh was speaking at a welcoming banquet in honor of Qiao Shi,
Chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National People's
Congress (NPC), who is on a three-day visit to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his cordial and friendly talks with Qiao
earlier today, the two agreed to promote friendly cooperation
between the two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Qiao said he was pleased to see the great
achievements of the Vietnamese people in their renovations and
opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the normalization of relations between the
two countries five years ago, friendship and cooperation has been
developing rapidly through joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
Qiao spoke about the achievements of China's reforms and
socialist construction guided by Deng Xiaoping's principle of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
He said China will push forward the course of reform and
socialist construction under the guidance of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee led by General Secretary Jiang
Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said a peaceful international environment is necessary for
 China's development.
</P>
<P>
China opposes power politics and hegemonism and will never seek
to be a superpower, Qiao said, stressing that China's development
will pose no threat to any country and region, but will strengthen
the peace and development of the world.
</P>
<P>
He added that China and Vietnam, which have many similarities
in building socialism and developing their economies, will
together explore the great potential for bilateral cooperation and
develop good-neighborly relations for the benefit of their two
peoples and regional and international peace and development.

<HEADLINE> S'pore PM on Coming General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Goh Chok Tong, prime
minister of Singapore and secretary-general of the ruling People's
Action Party (PAP), said that in the upcoming general election,
his party would fight each constituency election like a local
government election.
</P>
<P>
According to a local television report today, Goh said at a PAP
Party conference Sunday that the real test for the PAP would be
the number of seats it would win in the general election.
</P>
<P>
The real issue in the coming general election was to put in
place a group of men and women who would lead Singapore in the
21st century, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the 24 new candidates the PAP had just fielded
for the general election to draw up plans for house upgrading, for
better bus services, wet markets and so on, so as to force the
opposition to compete on the basis of a program for each
constituency.
</P>
<P>
Goh said over the last five years, the government had addressed
issues of concern, like the cost of living.
</P>
<P>
On the subject of the current economic slowdown, Goh said this
should inject some caution into Singaporeans to be solidly behind
the government.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was watching the situation closely and
would act decisively if the economy continued to head for slower
growth next year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets Japanese Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo said
today, in a meeting with a delegation from the Democratic Party of
Japan (DPJ), headed by its leader Yukio Hatoyama, that he believes
the DPJ will make a contribution to Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is also a member of the political bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party's (CPC) Central Committee, said the DPJ's visit is
the first overseas trip it has made and that this demonstrates
that it attaches great importance to developing relations with the
CPC and China.
</P>
<P>
Friendly ties between China and Japan are hard-won, Wu noted,
and said that the CPC and the Chinese Government take this
friendship seriously.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the growth of bilateral relations was seriously
affected, Wu said, but that he hopes the two countries will keep
bilateral relations on the right track, based on the Sino-Japanese
Joint Communique and the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and
Friendship, eliminating negative elements to build ties.
</P>
<P>
Wu stressed that long-term, healthy and stable cooperation
between China and Japan is not only in the two peoples' interests,
but is also conducive to peace, stability and development of the
Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Hatoyama said that, by examining historical issues and
exchanging views on issues of common concern with the Chinese
side, the delegation expects to strengthen cooperation with the
CPC and to help the two countries establish a true and trusting
relationship.
</P>
<P>
The DPJ delegation held talks with Li Shuzheng, head of the
International Department of the CPC Central Committee, after its
arrival in Beijing Sunday, where they discussed the two countries'
relations, the two political parties, and the international
situation, and agreed to increase cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun
said today that China has made a contribution to world grain
assurances by feeding its 1.2 billion people and by ensuring rapid
and healthy development of its economy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's statement came this afternoon in a meeting with
Setiawan Djody, head of Indonesia's SETDCO Group, who is in China
to explore the possibility for cooperation in agriculture,
telecoms, and transportation.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier, who is in charge of China's agriculture, said
the Chinese government has always placed great importance on
agricuture, and that it is high on the country's economic
development list.
</P>
<P>
Since the reforms and opening to the outside world started 18
years ago, agriculture and the rural economy have had remarkable
progress, with marked improvements in grain, cotton, cooking oil,
the rural economy, and farmers' incomes.
</P>
<P>
Jiang added that, for the past few years, friendly cooperation
between China and Indonesia, which are both developing countries,
has expanded a great deal, with frequent visits from leaders of
both sides and trade, economy, culture, and other areas increasing.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that this visit by an important Indonesian
political and business leader will promote bilateral relations and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also expressed his appreciations for SETDCO's plan to get
involved in China's agriculture, which Djody hopes to share for
mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
Djody spoke highly of Indonesia and China's important role in
geoeconomy, and said that economies of the two populous countries
are quite complementary.
</P>
<P>
A rising Indonesian financial group, SETDCO is mainly involved
in telecommunications, real estate, agriculture, and petroleum
transport, and has some two billion US dollars in fixed assets.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Calls for Arab Cooperation Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa has called for holding an Arab conference on cooperation where
governments and private sectors will help crystallize the formula
stemming from the recent Cairo economic conference.
</P>
<P>
In an Interview with the London-based Arabic "Al Hayat"
newspaper, which was published today, Moussa said such a conference
will not constitute an Arab bloc against other parties in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Cairo economic conference developed a special
formula for regional cooperation against the Israeli
non-adherence to agreements it had earlier accepted and signed.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Israel will not accede to the Arab world
except through the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Israel sent a 60-strong delegation to the economic conference
here in a bid to win lucrative deals and lure international
investment.
</P>
<P>
The intransigent policies of right-wing Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu, including the closure of the West Bank and
Gaza and foot-dragging on a Hebron troop deployment deal, resulted
in many Palestinian businessmen staying away from the conference
and other Arab participants calling for greater inter-Arab trade.
</P>
<P>
Moussa stressed during his interview with the paper the need
for an equilibrious agreement in which Israel gives up its strange
demands like "hot pursuit", dividing the city of Hebron, and
granting Palestinians a form of hollow authority.
</P>
<P>
Moussa warned that the redeployment in Hebron is only a point
in a complicated issue and there are other major requirements,
including resumption of talks on the final settlement and halting
the construction of settlements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Egyptian foreign minister expected the U.S. to
keep its commitments in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Washington would not throw everything achieved behind its back
simply because Netanyahu is not ready to pursue the peace march,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Asks for Money, Not Multinational Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda said today that it is now
completedly opposed to the deployment of a multinational force in
the Great Lakes region and wants to have the money intended to be
used for such a force used for humanitarian purposes.
</P>
<P>
"A multinational intervention force is by no means necessary.
Now that things are done all by themselves, the force should not
be imposed," Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana told the
Agence France Presse (AFP) and Radio France Internationale in
Kigali.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the sudden and massive return home of
350,000 Rwandan refugees from Zaire in the past three days.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the big spendings expected for this force be
re-oriented. If the word `humanitarian' makes sense, the money
should be intended for refugees," said Gasana, who had a meeting
today with French State Secretary for Emergency Humanitarian
Action Xavier Emmanuelli.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France and some international humanitarian groups
today continued to call for the deployment of the multinational
force, which is described by Paris as "indispensable."
</P>
<P>
"We observe that several hundreds of thousands of refugees are
still in Kivu (in eastern Zaire), especially in the south of this
region, in a very precarious situation," said French foreign
ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
About half a million refugees are staying around Bukavu, South
Kivu, said the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Indian External Affairs
Minister I.K. Gujral said today that it would have been difficult
for India to expect a temporary membership in the UN Security
Council after taking an uncompromising position in opposing the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Gujral said this here while responding to concern expressed by
members of the parliamentary consultative committee attached to
his ministry at a meeting.
</P>
<P>
Both India and Japan contested for the seat. While Japan got
140 votes in the recent elections for a non-permanent seat in the
UN Security Council, India only got 42 votes.
</P>
<P>
"We knew it was an uphill task but a withdrawal from the
contest would embolden the Group of Seven developed countries in
its attitude towards India," Gujral said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Indo-Pak talks, the Indian external affairs minister
expressed the hope that Pakistan would create the "proper
atmosphere" for resumption of the foreign secretary level dialogue
stalled since January 1994.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's response to India's offer to resume the talks is
still awaited, he said.

<P>
The New Aspiration Party, securing 125 out of the 393 seats in
the House of Representatives, won the mandate to form a new

</P>
<P>
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, leader of the New Aspiration Party, has

Caretaker Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa's outgoing
government.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index began sliding
shortly after trading began in the morning today.
</P>
<P>
It gained a little in the afternoon when it was learned that
former prime minister Chatichai Choonhavan's Chart Pattana
(National Development) Party had agreed to join the new
government.
</P>
<P>
The index plummeted 58.39 points to close at 942.34, down 5.83
percent, with a turnover of 9,181 million baht (367.24 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Investors are waiting to see who in the new government is going
to be in charge of economic affairs.
</P>

Last week, the share market was bullish at the expectation that
the Democrat Party was going to win in the election.

Last Friday, the last trading day before the election, the

<HEADLINE> South Korea Sets Terms for Return of Dead DPRK Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will only negotiate
the return of the bodies of the crew from a Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) submarine if Pyongyang first apologizes,
Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha said today.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK must also pledge never to allow such an incident to
happen again, Yoo told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But today, the DPRK demanded South Korea apologize for what it
called the cold-blooded killing of its seamen and demanded the
unconditional return of the bodies and the submarine.
</P>
<P>
South Korea claims 26 armed soldiers from the DPRK
"infiltrated" the country's Kangwon Province from a submarine
which ran aground in the East Sea (Sea of Japan) on September 18.
</P>
<P>
After a manhunt, 11 seamen were found dead, 13 were shot dead
by South Korean troops, one was captured alive and another remains
at large.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has said that the submarine ran aground by accident
during a training mission. Engine trouble caused the vessel to
drift and hit rocks.
</P>
<P>
However, Seoul claims the intrusion was not an "inadvertent
incident that occurred during routine training" but was a
"carefully premediated act of provocation."
</P>
<P>
The DPRK today threatened to "retaliate by all means" if South
Korea rejects its demands for the return of the submarine and crew.
</P>
<P>
A statement aired by Radio Pyongyang said that the seamen were
victims of the wreck who, encountering the mishap unexpectedly
while on routine sea training, had no choice but to go ashore.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Military Operation Launched Against LRA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Cai Guozhong)
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA) have committed untold crimes and atrocities
to destabilize northern Uganda since it infiltrated into the
country last February from its base in neighboring Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The first contingent of 570 LRA rebels entered Kilak County of
the Gulu District on February 6 to start their sabotage
activities, killing innocent people, looting shops and burning
down houses, inflicting huge personnel and property losses on the
northern Ugandans. Since early February,stories about the LRA
atrocities and battles between the government troops and the LRA
often occupied the first pages of almost all the newspapers here.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 months, over 3,300 LRA rebels with arms and
ammunition have infiltrated into Uganda from Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Facing the rebels' destabilizing activities, the government
launched a six-month military operation against the rebels. About
4,000 government soldiers have been sent to the north in addition
to the deployment of 3,000 militiamen.
</P>
<P>
In the operation, both soft and harder ways had been used, in
which the rebels were kept constantly on the move by denying safe
passages and the suspected rebel agents or their collaborators
were confiscated of their property.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has since October 15 stayed
in the Gulu District to make constant inspects and contacts with
army officials in the region. The president said he will stay in
Gulu until the rebels have been crushed.
</P>
<P>
The LRA was founded by Joseph Kony, a 32-year-old catechist in
April 1987 after he fell out with the catholic church. In October
1994, Most of the LRA rebels fled into neighboring Sudan
following the intensified government attacks on it. But in
Feburary this year, the rebels began infilitrating into northern
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The continuing insecurity in the north has absorbed an
increasing part of the national budget which is desperately
needed in the other key sectors for the country's national
development. It was reported that of the 20 million Dollars
budgeted goverment expenditure for October, 7.65 million Dollars
virtually went into the war.
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper "The New Vision" has attributed the
economic downturn in the past three months to the war in the
north which has swallowed up large amount of of the limited
budget for the current financial year. Local newspapers worried
that Uganda's image abroad has much improved since 1986 when the
current government came to power and began with the
reconciliation policy and economic reform, but the on-going
conflict between the government and the LRA could easily damage
it.
</P>
<P>
At the mediation of Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani, a draft agreement was signed in October between
Uganda and Sudan in a bid to settle their border disputs, but at
a meeting on November 4, the two countries failed to sign an
agreement which calls for pulling back their troops 100
kilometers from the common border.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges U.S. to Quicken Talks on China's WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- European Commission
Vice-President Leon Brittan urges the United States to adopt the
European approach to speed up the negotiations on China's entry
into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that China is still developing, therefore China
can't be asked to accept all the obligations," Brittan said in an
exclusive interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) insists that China accept some of the
obligations at the point of entry, but enjoy a period of time to
meet the other requirements.
</P>
<P>
China has asked to be admitted under the more lenient rules for
developing countries and criticized Washington for setting up very
high obstacles to Chinese membership in the trade group.
</P>
<P>
In his trip to Beijing last week, Brittan put forward the EU
idea for solving the long-stalled issue when he met Chinese
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji and Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi.
</P>
<P>
"They all agree it is a good approach," said the EU official.
"On this basis, I'll ask America to accept that approach."
</P>
<P>
"The first step is for the United States to accept the basic
approach, and the next step is for us to accelerate the
negotiations up onto a higher level. We will get on to the detail,
and then we can see whether the U.S. is asking too much or whether
China is giving enough," he said.
</P>
<P>
Brittan has written to U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher about China's accession to the WTO before the latter
visits Beijing this week. He hoped that America would accept the
EU initiative.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that the EU meet with the United States,
Japan and Canada at the first ministerial meeting of the WTO,
scheduled to be held in Singapore in December.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the EU will elevate talks with China on details of
what commitment China can take, the EU official said.
</P>
<P>
Although lots of negotiations are needed on exactly what is
acceptable, and when, Brittan said he is optimistic about bringing
the process to an early conclusion.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the re-election of Bill Clinton will be a
favorable element, the EU official said: "It's easier for a
president who has been re-elected to make decisions about what is
necessary."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated: "The EU is in favor of China's membership in the
WTO." Having China in the WTO will enhance the eminence of the WTO
and strengthen the international trading forum, declared Brittan,
who has been in charge of external relations and trade policy in
the EU since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Brittan is in Hong Kong to open the Europe/East Asia Economic
Summit organized by the World Economic Forum. He is also expected
to take part in a panel discussion on "what to expect from the WTO
ministerial meeting in Singapore" during the three-day forum,
scheduled for November 18-20.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, Chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC),
and Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said today that vast
potential exists for expanding bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Kiet said Qiao's current visit to Vietnam
is of great significance and reflects the profound brotherhood and
friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two men exchanged views on economic reforms in their
countries and praised each other's achievements in economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said great potential exists for developing economic and
trade relations. He praised Vietnam's rapid economic development,
particularly in the agricultural sector, over the past 10 years.
He also noted the development of township enterprises and growing
foreign investment in Vietnam as well as the new era in its
foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
Kiet said that both China's economic restructuring and
Vietnam's innovations were bearing fruit and noted that their
success had been achieved by sticking to the socialist path.
</P>
<P>
He added that Vietnam, which began its reforms 10 years after
China, should learn from China's experience.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said relations between China and Vietnam were good and
that problems which did exist could be gradually solved through
consultation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese NPC chairman, who arrived in Hanoi Sunday evening

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets With Hong Kong Bankers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said
here today that Hong Kong's present financial system will remain
unchanged after 1997, with the Chinese government's "one country,
two systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
Qian placed special emphasis on this point during a meeting in
Beijing this afternoon with a delegation of Hong Kong bankers, led
by Joseph Yam Chi Kong, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority. Qian said that Hong Kong will maintain its trade and
financial links with the outside world as a Separate Customs
Territory.
</P>
<P>
In commenting on economic links between the interior area and
Hong Kong, Qian said the links will become closer after 1997, but
that the links are only commercial and financial, and that the
Central People's Government will neither draw funds from Hong Kong
nor collect taxes from it.
</P>
<P>
In referring to Hong Kong's future, Qian said, "It is my view
that the Hong Kong people have increasingly greater confidence in
its future. Hong Kong's economy is not bad, with the Hang Seng
Index rising, and the whole economy in Hong Kong is prosperous."
</P>
<P>
He said he is confident about Hong Kong's prospects and
expressed the belief that with the joint efforts of Hong Kong
financial circles and other sectors, its prosperity and stability
are guaranteed, as long as the principle of "one country, two
systems" is implemented. And, Hong Kong will maintain its position
as an international banking, trade and shipping center after it
returns to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Qian extended a welcome on this first visit to Beijing by 12
members of the Hong Kong Association of Banks, and said that for
the Hong Kong bankers to come here to exchange views on issues of
common concern with their counterparts in the interior area is
beneficial as Hong Kong's return to the motherland is approaching.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yam said that the financial systems of the interior area
and Hong Kong will be relatively independent after 1997 and that
they will not be subordinated one to the other, and that Hong
Kong's financial circles welcome this policy and hope that it will
be concretely implemented.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 3,000 Journalists to Cover APEC Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A total of 2,774 journalists
have so far sought accreditation to cover the week-long meetings
of the 18 member economies of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC), the APEC '96 News Bureau said today.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 2,774 applicants, 1,168 are visiting foreign
journalists from APEC and non-APEC economies, while 1,224 are from
various local news publications, television and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
The rest are members of the Foreign Correspondents of the
Philippines, the locally based representatives of international
news agencies, the news bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Hector Villanueva said that at least 80 percent
of those who applied for accreditation have been documented. The
applications of the rest or those which have been handed in only
in the past few days are still being processed.
</P>
<P>
The failure of some applicants to complete their documentary
requirements was observed to be slowing down the processing of
their accreditation. So far, only one application has been denied,
because of the applicant's inability to produce the necessary
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Accreditation is expected to be completed and closed before 9
a.m. November 20, the official start of the informal Senior
Officials Meeting, which will be held at the Philippine
International Convention Center (PICC) in Manila.
</P>
<P>
The accreditation unit was moved today from the PICC to Hotel
Sofitel since non-accredited media will not be allowed inside the
PICC.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Outlines Ruling Party's Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong has outlined the platform of the ruling People's Action
Party (PAP) for the coming elections, local television reported
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the party platform, called "Singapore
21 -- Make It Our Best Home," is based on five pillars, namely, to
create wealth, share success, invest in the young, look after the
old, and build ties among Singaporeans.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a PAP conference on Sunday, Goh observed that while
Singapore was ranked among the top ten countries in terms of per
capita income, there was no guarantee it would remain so 30 years
from now.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government cannot make Singaporeans rich, but
it could provide the conditions for them to do so. The "Singapore
21" would provide the optimum conditions for Singaporeans to do
well through their own efforts, he added.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who is also PAP secretary-general, promised
that Singapore in the next century would be a place with good
paying jobs, while companies and individuals would be lightly
taxed.
</P>
<P>
However, Goh warned that Singapore would have to watch out for
structural unemployment as the economy matured.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government had already taken steps to ensure
that Singapore would not suffer the high unemployment of
industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
On sharing wealth, Goh said that the government would announce
new schemes next year to help the singles and the very poor. He
also said that more new ideas to share Singapore's success were in
the pipeline. These include selling savings bonds and unit trust
shares at a discount.

<HEADLINE> China Investment Bank Sets Up Office in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- China Investment Bank (CIB),
 one of China's major commercial banks headquartered in Beijing,
opened a representative office here today with the approval of the
 Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
</P>
<P>
Liu Dawei, governor of the bank, said that the opening of the
bank office indicates CIB will enhance its linkage with its
counterparts in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CIB office will help the bank learn about the
economic, legal and banking systems in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It will also play a role in promoting the development of the
economy and trade in Hong Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, CIB has formed business ties with over 80
banks in Hong Kong and it successfully issued
100-million-US-dollar floating rate bond certificate in Hong Kong
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Liu assured that his bank will cling to the banking ordinances
and international practice and open more channels for his banks to
cooperate and exchange with overseas banks.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1981, the bank operates an extensive branch
network which includes 16 regional branches and a number of
sub-branches and local offices in 24 provinces, autonomous regions
and municipalities.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Germany Wants to maintain Ties with Iran: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel made a response to his Iranian counterpart, saying
"Germany did not want its ties with Iran to be marred," Iran's
official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel and Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati had a
telephone conversation Sunday over the crisis between Tehran and
Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 students staged an anti-German demonstration here
Sunday, throwing tomatoes, eggs and rock at the German Embassy in
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 parliament members signed a letter, urging the
Foreign Ministry to reduce the diplomatic ties and economic
relations with its biggest trade partner of Germany as a protest
against the German accusation that Iranian authorities, including
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Hashemi Rafsanjani were
involved in the Mykonos case.
</P>
<P>
Former leader of Iran's outlawed Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP) Sadeq Sharafkandi and three of his companions were killed
by unidentified persons at the Mykonos restaurant in Berlin on
September 17, 1992.
</P>
<P>
The German Federal Prosecutor charged the Iranian government
with state terrorism and held Iranian leaders accountable for the
Mykonos case.
</P>
<P>
The Mykonos case led to the crisis in relations between Iran
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
According to the IRNA's report, Kinkel expressed concern over
the recent developments in the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He told Velayati that Germany did not want its ties with the
Islamic Republic to be marred, stressing that the issues raised
at the Mykonos trial are not the stands of the German
government. He also expressed hope that Tehran-Bonn ties would
continue.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said in response that what has been done by the
German judiciary on the basis of statements of fugitives and
terrorists does not correspond to any international criteria.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister stressed that Tehran's ties with
other countries are established in the framework of values and
respect for these values. He added that Tehran cannot tolerate
sacrilege to Islamic sanctities.

<HEADLINE> Macao Media Calls HK Chief Executive Nomination Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Leading newspapers in Macao have
 praised the nomination of candidates for Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) chief executive as "democratic,"
"open" and "fair," saying that it is a model for Macao.
</P>
<P>
The "Macao Daily News" said in a commentary today that the
smooth nomination of candidates for HKSAR chief executive
following democratic balloting is quite different in nature from
the appointment of the Hong Kong governor by the British queen.
</P>
<P>
"The appointment of the Hong Kong governor by the British
queen is quite different in nature (from the democratic election
of the Hong Kong chief executive)," the commentary said. "That
appointment was never done by consulting local HK residents, let
alone democratic election."
</P>
<P>
The commentary said the successful experience of Hong Kong in
choosing the chief executive is a model for Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Today's Hong Kong might be tomorrow's Macao," it noted. "The
nomination of candidates for HKSAR chief executive is not only a
great concern to Hong Kong people, it is also a great concern for
people in Macao."
</P>
<P>
"Macao should learn from the successful experience in Hong
Kong."
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese newspaper, "Tai Chung Pou," described the
nomination of HKSAR chief executive candidates as a remarkable
event in Hong Kong history, because it represents the process of
Hong Kong marching toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
"It demonstrates an unprecedented democracy as the chief
executive will be elected by a committee representing the
interests of all walks of life in Hong Kong," the paper said in a
commentary. "Over the past century or more, governors of Hong Kong
 and of Macao were all appointed by the British government or the
Portuguese government respectively. The local Chinese community
had no say in it."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the commentary said, the way in which the future
chief executive is elected assures people that the Chinese
government will unswervingly carry out the policy of "one country,
 two systems." "Residents in Hong Kong and Macao should not worry
about their future."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-language "Correio Sino-Macaense" newspaper praised
 the founding and operation of the Selection Committee as a
milestone for Hong Kong's real democracy.
</P>
<P>
"The nomination of candidates for HKSAR chief executive is a
demonstration of democracy as it was conducted under the principle
 of openness and fairness," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"The success of Hong Kong should be a model for Macao," it
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's unemployment
rate in the August-October period this year was 2.6 percent, the
same as in the July to September period, according to the latest
official statistics on labor force released today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest figure, a government spokesman said
that for the latest three-month period, declines in the
unemployment rates were seen in the construction and the
community, social and personal services sectors, while slight
increases were observed in the manufacturing and transport
sectors. As a result, the unemployment rate was kept unchanged in
overall terms.
</P>
<P>
He said growth in total employment continued to outpace that of
 labor supply. In the three months ending September 1996, total
employment showed a notable increase of three percent over the
same period last year, while total labor supply grew 1.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Sets Terms for Return of Dead DPRK Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will only negotiate
the return of the bodies of the crew from a Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) submarine if Pyongyang first apologizes,
Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha said today.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK must also pledge never to allow such an incident to
happen again, Yoo told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But today, the DPRK demanded South Korea apologize for what it
called the cold-blooded killing of its seamen and demanded the
unconditional return of the bodies and the submarine.
</P>
<P>
South Korea claims 26 armed soldiers from the DPRK
"infiltrated" the country's Kangwon Province from a submarine
which ran aground in the East Sea (Sea of Japan) on September 18.
</P>
<P>
After a manhunt, 11 seamen were found dead, 13 were shot dead
by South Korean troops, one was captured alive and another remains
at large.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has said that the submarine ran aground by accident
during a training mission. Engine trouble caused the vessel to
drift and hit rocks.
</P>
<P>
However, Seoul claims the intrusion was not an "inadvertent
incident that occurred during routine training" but was a
"carefully premediated act of provocation."
</P>
<P>
The DPRK today threatened to "retaliate by all means" if South
Korea rejects its demands for the return of the submarine and crew.
</P>
<P>
A statement aired by Radio Pyongyang said that the seamen were
victims of the wreck who, encountering the mishap unexpectedly
while on routine sea training, had no choice but to go ashore.

HONG KONG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's flag carrier
Cathay Pacific began to construct its new corporate headquarters

staff members, is designed to be a comfortable, healthy and
attractive environment.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tribunal Set up to Settle Maritime Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Conflicts over seas can
receive a fair trial from the newly-established International
Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, a tribunal judge has claimed.
</P>
<P>
Judge Alexander Yankov said that conflicts usually arise over
maritime sovereignty, the division of continental shelves and the
discharge of nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal was set up in August in the German port city of
Hamburg. It is one of the two international law organizations,
along with the International Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The new tribunal accepts cases involving international
conflicts over the sea, maritime areas, the exploration and use of
oceanic resources, scientific study, environmental protection and
the blocking of foreign ships into domestic waters.
</P>
<P>
Yankov, who is now attending the World Conference on Oceanic
Peace in Beijing, predicted that the conflicts over maritime
petroleum development will increase in the next century, when the
output of maritime petroleum will make up half of the world's
total.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts over nuclear testing along ocean beds and other forms
of oceanic pollution are also big problems, he said, adding that
some African countries have already protested against the
discharge of nuclear waste in African seas by developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal has 21 judges, selected from 100 countries, which
observe the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.
</P>
<P>
According to the UN Charter, Yankov said, if the countries
concerned do not accept the tribunal's final judgement, the case
will be turned over to the United Nation's Security Council.

<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- China now boasts 1,500
security companies which have 250,000 employees and provide
services for 90,000 clients, a senior official with the Ministry
of Public Security said today.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1995 alone, those security companies assisted
the national police force in solving 80,000 criminal cases,
preventing a direct economic loss amounting to 260 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Security companies across the country offer numerous services,
he said, adding that high-technology for the sector is still in
the development stage and needs to be expanded in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The first Chinese security company was established in 1984,
offering limited coverage. It has grown to include protection
services for large enterprises, mines, museums, civil airports, as
well as foreign embassies and consulates in China.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that China prohibits security companies
from providing private bodyguards and demanding the payment of
clients' debts.
</P>
<P>
He said that public security bureaus nationwide are responsible
for the management and supervision of security companies, in order
to ensure that those companies work for the promotion of social
security.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that China is considering adopting laws and
regulations governing the development of security companies and
defining the legal role, responsibilities, rights and obligations
of security companies.

<P>
LAGOS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, a major African oil
producer and OPEC member, may run out of its oil reserve by the
year 2017, Ministry of Petroleum Resources said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in its latest report that if no major
addition is made to its estimated 20.5 billion barrels of
reserve, Nigeria's oil production may cease by the year 2017,
puting the annual production at 918.6 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
The country produced a total of 369.46 million barrels of oil
and condensates in the first six months of this year, earning
3.492 billion US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government now plans to increase the reserve to 25 billion
barrels by 1999 and lift the daily production to 2.5 million
barrels, from the present 2.05 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
Oil industry offcials said that current efforts at offshore
exploration might increase reserves substantially and expanding
the life span of the industry.
</P>
<P>
The country's gas reserves, however, will be able to last for
72 years, given the 110 trillion cubic meters of reserve and an
annual production of 1.55 billion standard cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
From January to June, the country produced 17.7 million cubic
meters of natural gas, however, the report said only 27.5 percent
of the production was utilized, the rest 72.5 percent cent was
flared. enditem

<HEADLINE> Mandela Urges South Africans Not to Panic Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, November 18 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
today urged South Africans not to panic about the spread of the deadly
disease Ebola, said a spokesman for his office in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said: "The President is
satisfied with the work done by doctors handling the case."
</P>
<P>
A 46-year-old nurse at a private clinic in Johannburg, Marylin
Lahana, was diagnosed as having been infected with the deadly Ebola
virus on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lahana, fighting for her life during the weekend at an
isolation ward in Johannesburg Hospital, is the first victim of
Ebola in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana said Mandela was thoroughly briefed by health officials
and specialists dealing with the Ebola case.
</P>
<P>
The President appealed to all South Africans not to panic and urged
them to go about their normal business because no one was under
threat, said Mankahlana.
</P>
<P>
"There is only one person affected by this disease in the country
and every one that has been in contact with her has been contacted,"
added the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for Johannesburg Hospital Monday morning,
Lahana was still in critical but stable condition since her admission
to the hospital on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
South African medical experts had identified a Gabon doctor, who
had treated Ebola patients, as the person who infected Lahana with
the Ebola virus.
</P>
<P>
The Gabon doctor, admitted to a private clinic in Johannesburg on
October 27 for "raging fever", has been nursed by Lanaha during his
stay at the clinic. enditem

<HEADLINE> Talks Between Zimbabwean Government, Strikers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations between the
Zimbabwean government and the striking junior doctors and nurses
went into a deadlock yesterday over the reinstatement of the
dismissed health workers.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), which
facilitated the negotiations, said last night it had failed in
its efforts to mediate in the four-week strike by the government
health workers.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU Secretary-General Morgan Tsvangirai said, "Ultimately it
is the government's responsibility to provide the essential
service to the population. It must resolve this dispute with the
leadership and compassion that is required. This professional
service is indispensable to the provision of a normal health
service.''
</P>
<P>
He said the government's position remained that after
dismissal, employees in the civil service must reapply as
individuals, while the striking workers insisted an unconditional
reinstatement of the dismissed workers ensuing concrete
guarantees and safeguards in the negotiation framework which will
ensure a lasting solution.
</P>
<P>
The striking doctors are prepared to resume work anytime once
these guarantees were met by the government.
</P>
<P>
The strike by nurses and junior doctors entered its fifth week
yesterday with only critically ill patients being offered medical
service at harare's major hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The opposition ZANU (ndonga) leader Ndabaningi Sithole has
called on the government to resign in favour of a caretaker
government because of the government's failure to resolve the
current crisis in the health delivery system, the Daily Herald
reported today.

LAGOS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The second black box recording

<P>
The day before, the flight date recorder has been found by the

The two discoveries are expected to be of great help in

</P>
<P>
Yesterday's rescue work also led to the recovery of parts of
the cockpit, a wheel, a skull, clothes, bags and other personal
effects from the muddy water.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the hope of recovering the fuselage and any

<HEADLINE> China's Coal Output Hits 1.1 Billion Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 18 (Xinhua) -- China produced 1.01 billion
tons of raw coal in the first three quarters of this year, 75
million tons over that in the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The output exceeded the increased demand of coal on the
domestic market, according to a national coal-ordering conference
which opened today in Fuzhou, the capital of east China's Fujian
Province.
</P>
<P>
The amount of coal in stock across the country by the end of
September rose to 192 million tons, 30 million tons over that at
the beginning of this year, said Ye Qing, vice minister of the
State Planning Commission, at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that China's coal industry will maintain a rapid
growth in 1997, which may satisfy the rising domestic demand -- an
increase of 45 million tons over this year.
</P>
<P>
The coal transport capacity of railway and shipping lines will
be improved greatly next year with the opening of the
Beijing-Kowloon Railway line in 1997, Ye said.

<HEADLINE> Hussein to Officially Voice Support to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The hotly-argued introduction of
the Norwegian-type Law in Jordan is expected to gain King
Hussein's official support in his address to the parliament
tomorrow, English daily Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
But officials and parliamentarians don't expect the king to
unveil a plan soon to introduce such a law, a move intended to
effectively separate the powers between government and parliament.
</P>
<P>
The king will make his opening speech at Tuesday's fourth and
last ordinary session of the current 12th Parliament which will
end its four-year term in October next year.
</P>
<P>
His speech will outline the government's program of action,
which was discussed and approved by the Council of Ministers and
serves as the government's policy statement to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"But one of the most important points in the speech will be the
expression of the King's intention to assert the separation of
powers..." said a senior cabinet member.
</P>
<P>
Officials and deputies expected the King to announce the
Norwegian plan at a time close to the elections next year.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian-type law prevents deputies from retaining their
parliamentary seats upon becoming ministers. Currently, there are
22 deputies who hold the government portfolio.
</P>
<P>
The controversy over the issue sparked in 1989 when some
politicians calling for effective separation between the executive
and legislative authorities.
</P>
<P>
The issue turned conspicuous and heated this year when two
thirds of the cabinet members of the government headed by Prime
Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti were selected from Parliament.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, only the government of Abdul Salam
Majali stayed deputies away from the executive body.

<HEADLINE> First ATM Joint Venture to be Established in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- NCR, the former computer arm
of AT&AMP;T, will establish its first two joint ventures in China
early next year in an effort to enhance its presence in the
world's largest emerging computer market.
</P>
<P>
Lars Nyberg, NCR chief executive and president, who concluded
his first China visit today, said the first joint venture to be
established will engage in the production of Automatic Teller
Machines (ATM). The other will specialize in the repair of ATMs
and NCR's open computer systems.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, NCR is negotiating details of the plan
with research institutes under the Ministry of Electronics
Industry. But he declined to provide other details about the joint
ventures, such as the amount of investment involved.
</P>
<P>
"If everything goes smoothly, it will be the first joint
venture for NCR, and NCR will be the first foreign company to
jointly produce such products in China," said a senior executive
of NCR, which solely owns 1.100 branches and offices in over 130
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
NCR, whose China connections date back more than 100 years,
reorganized its Asia regional offices in Greater China, Southeast
Asia and the Republic of Korea earlier this year, the senior
executive said.
</P>
<P>
NCR is the world's fifth-largest computer company, with a sales
volume of over eight billion US dollars. The company was
incorporated with its parent company AT&AMP;T in 1991, and will spin
off from AT&AMP;T to become an independent operation early next year.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, NCR has been known in China for the
compatibility, wide-ranging scale and competitive prices of its
products, which make up more than half of China's computer
sales. A larger growth rate in sales is expected to be registered
this year.
</P>
<P>
By now, the People's Bank of China, the Construction Bank of
China, the Agriculture Bank of China and Bank of Communications
have become major NCR customers in China. The US company has also
sold a computer system to Xinhua News Agency, China's largest wire
service organization, linking the headquarters in Beijing with its
30 domestic and 100 overseas bureaus.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Airports to Provide TeleFlight Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 18 (Xinhua) -- All the six
international airports in Malaysia will be provided with
nationwide TeleFlight services by the middle of next year,
according to Malaysian Deputy Transport Minister Mohamed Ali
Rustam today.
</P>
<P>
The TeleFlight service, to be available 24 hours a day, seven
days a week, is a fully integrated Interactive Voice Response
system (IVR) designed to provide information on flight arrival
and departure schedules, destinations, terminal and gate numbers,
check-in counters and flight airlines by dialing a number at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
All information would be obtained from the Flight Information
Display System (FIDS) and made available on the TeleFlight, he
said after the launch of the service, a joint venture project by
the Malaysia Airports Corporation and the Telecom Malaysia
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Subang near here
would be the first to provide the facility and the service would
be extended to the other five international airports in Langkawi,
Pulau Pinang, Johore Bahru, Kuching and Kota Kinabalu respectively
in the next five months, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the introduction of the TeleFlight service is timely
as the number of flights and passengers increased significantly
over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The number of flights at all airports is expected to rise by
8.3 percent for both international and domestic flights this year,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the number of flights at all airports recorded a
5.9-percent increase over the previous year, from 63,757
international and 70,304 domestic flights to 94,204 international
and 293,884 domestic flights departing from the Kuala Lumpur
International Airport alone, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the TeleFlight service, customers can retrieve
information on a faxed copy for reference on the same call without
disengaging the line through their fax machine connected to the
phone line.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Aspiration Party Clinches Narrow  Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The New Aspiration Party led
by outgoing Caretaker Deputy Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
narrowly beat the Democrat Party in the general election Sunday,
winning the mandate to form the new government.
</P>
<P>
The final official results released this morning by the
Interior Ministry put the New Aspiration Party merely two seats
ahead of outgoing opposition leader Chuan Leekpai's Democrat
Party.
</P>
<P>
Out of a total of 393 seats in the Lower House, the New
Aspiration won 125 seats, against 123 seats by the Democrats,
according to the Interior Ministry's official results.
</P>
<P>
At 20:55 last night (1355 GMT), when the unofficial count
showed that the Democrats were three seats behind the New
Aspiration, at 122 to 125, and that the ballot counting was near
completion, Chuan Leekpai, expecting that the Democrats would get
no more seats, conceded defeat in his home province in southern
Thailand, saying that his party would be in the opposition to
check the performance of the government.
</P>
<P>
However, 20 minutes later, there was a dramatic change when
unofficial figures shown on television indicated that the
Democrats had caught up and tied the New Aspiration at 124 seats
each.
</P>
<P>
Cheers broke out from among hundreds of supporters who gathered
outside Chuan's home to watch vote counting on television.
</P>
<P>
When the unofficial ballot count put the New Aspiration Party,
which is one of the six parties in the outgoing government, in the
lead, the party moved quickly to discuss the formation of a new
government with leaders of the four existing coalition partners in
the outgoing government.
</P>
<P>
The other party, Nam Thai, had disbanded just before the
general election. Most of its former MPs joined the New Aspiration
Party.
</P>
<P>
Among those who attended the closed-door five-party meeting
Sunday night were Caretaker Prime Minister and Chart Thai (Thai
Nation) Party leader Banharn Silpa-archa, Social Action Party
leader Montri Pongpanich, Prachakorn Thai (Thai Citizen) Party
leader Samak Sundaravej, Muan Chon Party leader Chalerm Yubamrung,
and New Aspiration Party Secretary-General Sanoh Thienthong.
</P>
<P>
The informal meeting decided not to sign any agreement on the
formation of the new government, when Banharn insisted that it
should be signed only after the official results have come out.
</P>
<P>
The former coalition party leaders are expected to meet again
this evening to express personally their support for Chavalit as
the country's 22nd prime minister.
</P>
<P>
If the new government comprises all five former coalition
parties, the government would command 204 seats in the 393-member
Lower House, a slim and shaky majority of only seven seats over
the required minimum 197 seats, or half of the total seats.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the stability of the new government, Chavalit will
have to include at least one or two more parties in his
government.
</P>
<P>
Around mid-day today, Chavalit announced that former prime
minister Chatichai Choonhavan's Chart Pattana (National
Development) Party, with 52 seats, had agreed to join the new
government, greatly boosting the new government's stability.
</P>
<P>
With Chart Pattana's participation, the new coalition
government will command 256 of the total 393 parliamentary seats.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Airlines is
looking forward to forging additional strategic alliances with
other airlines, especially in Europe and North America, according
to its chairman Tajudin Ramli.
</P>
<P>
The search for partners is necessary in view of the fact that
the telecommunications and aviation industries constantly require
new capitalization and technology and upgrading of fleet and
equipment all the time, said Tajudin in an interview with the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Bernama as saying that even British Airways
and U.S. Air have recently entered into such an alliance.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia Airlines has already forged alliances with
Virgin Atlantic of Britain and Ansett Airlines of Australia.
</P>
<P>
The search for alliances would continue, he said, adding that
whether they would lead to equity participation or not is
something for Malaysia Airlines to consider at a later date.

<HEADLINE> India's Software Gong to 75 Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- India's software exports
today are destined to 75 countries compared with just 40 countries
about five years ago, said a recent study of software companies of
India.
</P>
<P>
Market diversity has significantly helped India's software
industry to achieve a quantum growth of exports, the performance
of which reached 26,500 million rupees (828.13 million US dollars)
during 1995-96, recording a growth of 80 percent over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
India's software industry is extremely adaptive to new markets
that offer different characteristics and at times many new
challenges. This has enabled it to quickly move into new emerging
markets and create market niches especially in Southeast Asia and
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The diversification of exports into a large spread of countries
has also perfected Indian companies about the quality of
persistence in some difficult markets like Japan and Germany, the
study said.
</P>
<P>
With a view to further expanding India's reach in the Middle
East markets, Indian Electronics and Computer Software Export
Promotion Council (ESC), in association with the Department of
Electronics and the Indian Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, has
concluded a detailed market study that reveals significant market
opportunities for Indian exporters in the segment of application
software and services especially in the areas of banking,
industry, manufacturing sector and hospitals in Saudi Arabia, the
study added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Find Leptin May Lead to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Leptin, the much-heralded
protein believed by some to be the greatest hope of dieters after
it was discovered to reduce obesity in mice, has been found by
Weizmann Institute researchers to be a possible cause of type ii
diabetes, reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
The report, quoting a study published in the latest issue of
Science, said that high levels of leptin disrupt some of the
activities of insulin, the hormone that controls blood-sugar
levels.
</P>
<P>
Since obese people -- unlike the genetically obese mice
that received so much publicity -- are known to have high leptin
levels in their blood, this finding may explain why overweight
people have a tendency to develop type ii (adult-onset)
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
It may also lead to the development of new treatments for this
most common type of diabetes, which strikes mostly overweight
people over the age of 40.
</P>
<P>
The research, led by Prof. Menachem Rubinstein of the
molecular genetics department, suggests that if leptin is
developed into a weight-loss drug, it should be used with
caution, because it may cause the patient to develop
diabetes-related symptoms.
</P>
<P>
"We have shown that excessive leptin leads to reduced
activity by insulin," says Rubinstein. "All the evidence now
points to the probability that excessive leptin may be one of
the causes of type ii diabetes, although it is probably not the
only cause. More studies are needed to examine the link between
excess leptin and diabetes and to determine whether anything can
be done about it."
</P>
<P>
Leptin, which is produced in the fat cells, raises body
temperature and lowers food intake. The rights to the substance
were purchased from Rockefeller University in New York by the
Amgen Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Leptin was first identified two years ago by scientists who
found that it was absent in genetically obese mice and that
daily leptin injections caused the rodents to eat less and lose
weight.
</P>
<P>
However, further studies found that injecting leptin works
mainly on obese mice with a genetic defect that results in an
absence of leptin. Genetically normal mice, as well as obese
humans, actually have too-high levels of leptin.
</P>
<P>
Working in the lab with cells derived from human livers and
using a quantity similar to that present in the blood of obese
people, Rubinstein and his colleagues found that while leptin
does not affect insulin's conversion of glucose into glycogen
and fat, it does significantly suppress its ability to slow down
gluconeogenesis, in which unused stored fat is turned back into
glucose until it is needed. This can cause raised blood-sugar
levels, the researchers found.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Says APEC Will Benefit Philippines' Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today said that the Philippines will get many economic
benefits by hosting the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
meetings next week.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the 57th anniversary of the Philippine National
Defense Department in Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City, Ramos said the
APEC meetings will be a vehicle to further hasten the development
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The APEC economic forum will bring about growth in exports and
investments to each APEC member economy, the Philippine president
said, adding that for the Philippines, it will improve the
country's competitiveness because the Philippines will have the
privilege to present its products to 17 other APEC members.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Philippines will get more foreign
investments as a result of the open and free trade policy adopted
by the 18 APEC economies.
</P>
<P>
The president said that with the pouring of investments, the
economy will grow, with more jobs created, livelihood improved and
 the capabilities of Filipino technology expanded.
</P>
<P>
The APEC brings about cooperation that includes information
exchange, technology transfer, human resources development,
environmental management and research.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine president said the Philippine government has
been doing its task for providing the minimum basic needs of the
people such as jobs, housing, environmental protection, health and
the daily needs of ordinary Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
The hosting of APEC meetings by the Philippines "symbolizes our
country's continuing effort and determination to catch up and
then keep in step with, and may be to overtake, our more
prosperous neighbors in Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The APEC economies occupy more than 30 percent of the world's
land area, 40 percent of its population and a combined 56 percent
of gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that as chairman of this year's APEC leadership
conference, the Philippines will spearhead the promotion of
greater private business participants.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Conference Discusses Environmental Effects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 18 (Xinhua) -- An international
conference opened here today to discuss the long-term effects of
the 1991 Gulf War on the local and global environment.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day conference, experts from 17 countries
would discuss ways of how to minimize the environmental impacts of
the Gulf War on the marine and atmosphere in the region, said
Saleh M. Al-Muzaini, chairman of the organizing committee, at the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf War triggered off by Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990
resulted in one of the worst environmental catastrophes in the
history of the mankind.
</P>
<P>
About 6 to 8 million barrels of crude oil was released into the
sea. Around 800 oil wells in Kuwait remained burning for several
months after the war, emitting huge quantities of pollutants. And
60 million barrels of crude oil gushed from the burning wells
created oil lakes over a vast area on Kuwait's desert land.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti and international environmental agencies have been
jointly monitoring the pollution caused by the war.
</P>
<P>
The conference held at the headquarters of the Kuwait Institute
for Scientific Research (KISR) is jointly sponsored by the KISR,
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization and the Gulf Cooperation Council.
</P>
<P>
A total of 69 scientific papers will be presented in the
conference which is attended by experts from 17 countries,
including Britain, the U.S., Japan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
France, Canada, Iran and Italy.

<HEADLINE> Rolls Royce Sets up Aircraft Engine Joint Venture in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A 30 million US dollar joint
venture to manufacture components for aircraft engines has been
recently established in Xi'an in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an XR Aero Components Co. Ltd., co-founded by Rolls Royce
International Ltd. and Xi'an Aircraft Engine Co., is the first
such venture funded by the British conglomerate in
China. Construction on workshops for the company will begin this
month.
</P>
<P>
By 2,000, the joint venture is to have over 300 employees,
which will be gradually expanded to over 600. It will eventually
become the single supplier of aero foil castings -- or engine
blades -- for aircraft engines produced by Rolls Royces and
BMW-Rolls Royces based in Germany, according to Bob Pitt, general
manager of the joint company.
</P>
<P>
In another development, an aviation training center jointly
funded by the Civil Aviation Administration of China and the
British company will soon go into operation at the Civil Aviation
College in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Gurr, President of Rolls Royce China, noted that the two
projects will facilitate the transfer of technology from Rolls
Royce to China, something that started more than two decades ago,
to help China's aviation industry attain world-class status.
</P>
<P>
Rolls Royce is a global leader in the production of aircraft
engines and equipment for power stations. At present, five Chinese
airlines are clients for its aircraft engines, including renowned
carriers such as China Southern Airlines and China Southwest
Airlines.

<HEADLINE> Computerized Management for Registration of State Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- During the Ninth Five-Year
Plan period (1996-2000), China will use computers to register
state assets and properties in enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Information from the State Administration of State Properties
shows that a complete property registration network, consisting of
databases at the central, provincial and prefectural levels, will
be formed over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
As the socialist market economy develops, the activities of
state-owned enterprises, including their investment and transfer
of property rights, are becoming more and more frequent.
</P>
<P>
Due to inadequate management systems, many parent companies do
not know the economic activities of their subordinate firms,
leaving the state unaware of the overall situation of state-owned
enterprises, as well as changes in property rights issues.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at improving the daily screening of
adjustments in state property rights in enterprises, and also
providing convenience for assessing and auditing the steady and
increasing value of state assets in firms.

<HEADLINE> Chirac, Hashimoto Sign Action Plan to Promote Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto today signed an
action plan, pledging to strengthen ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The document, signed after summit talks between the two
leaders, also called for a meeting of foreign ministers twice a
year and more frequent working-level talks, Japanese officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which includes 20 measures, was designed to further
deepen bilateral relations in political, security, economic and
cultural fields toward the 21st century, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
It also urged Japanese and French companies to cooperate in
Asia and Africa, they said.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Tokyo and Paris will work together to promote
reform of the United Nations, nuclear disarmament and
non-proliferation and regional security, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The plan also called for regular meetings of various ministries
from the two countries to improve economic ties and encourage more
exchanges between their citizens in a wide range of fields,
including politics, business and culture.
</P>
<P>
"We were able to start on making our bilateral relationship the
most important one for Asia-Europe cooperation," Hashimoto said at
a joint press conference held after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that as both France and Japan are trying to promote
reform, he thinks the efforts of both countries will contribute to
resolving bilateral trade and investment problems.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations deteriorated after France carried out a
series of nuclear tests in the South Pacific last year.
</P>
<P>
With Chirac's visit, the two countries will accelerate efforts
to enhance ties as Tokyo considers Europe increasingly important
to Japan in terms of politics, economy and security, amid
continuing integration of the European Union, according to
analysts.
</P>
<P>
Japan's efforts to forge closer ties with France is one sign of
this, they say.
</P>
<P>
Chirac arrived in Japan on Sunday for a six-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Improves Land Use Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The land use structure in
southern China's Guangdong Province, an economic powerhouse, has
improved remarkably after three years of macro-control.
</P>
<P>
By cracking down on illegal land use, the rampant encroachment
and willful squandering of land resources, land supplies and
economic construction demands have become basically balanced,
according to the provincial land administration.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, the use of land in Guangdong has
continued to decrease. In 1993, 36,600 hectares were taken over
for development; in 1994, 21,800 hectares were used; in 1995,
19,100 hectares; from January to August this year, only 9,100
hectares.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, cultivated land used for development was 40 percent
less than in 1993. In 1995, use of such land further dropped by 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
One sign of the improvement of land use structure is that over
the past three years industrial development has accounted for a
lion share of the land supplies. In 1993, 33.7 percent of the land
was used for industrial development. In 1994, the figure was 27.8
percent; in 1995, 40 percent; and in the first eight months of
this year, 37.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The area of land needed for transportation, energy and
municipal works has also increased: in 1993, these sectors
accounted for seven percent of the land supplies. In 1994, 14
percent. In 1995, the proportion rose to 20 percent, and in the
first eight months of this year, it rose again to 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the space of land for real estate development has
declined year on year. In 1993, 8,778 hectares of land were used
for real estate development. In 1994, the area decreased by 49.81
percent. In 1995, the figure further dropped by 15.95
percent. During the January-August period this year, land used for
property development shrank by 30 percent from the same period
last year.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Anti-TB Work Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The prevention and cure of
tuberculosis in Beijing has reached an advanced level based on
international standards, according to reports from a recent public
health conference.
</P>
<P>
Aided by advice from foreign medical personnel, the Chinese
capital has adopted series of measures to curb the disease,
including controlling the infectious sources and pursuing a
comprehensive and supervised chemical treatment plan.
</P>
<P>
The TB infection rate fell from 0.127 in 1979 to 0.016 percent
in 1990, with an average annual decease rate of 17 percent during
the period.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has one of the lowest rates of TB cases, and has seen
the most rapid decline in occurrence of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The capital has eliminated 110,000 TB sources and protected 1.1
million people from infection, an achievement that has been
praised by the World Health Organization and world-renowned
experts as a breakthrough in global anti-TB work and a model for
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
At the last International Anti-TB Conference, Beijing's success
rate won unanimous praise from 1,200 experts and scholars of 108
countries, and the city was awarded an international prize for its
efforts.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC),
said here today that Sino-Vietnamese friendly relations have been
completely restored and further developed since the two countries
normalized their ties five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Qiao made the remarks during his talks with Nong Duc Manh,
chairman of the Vietnamese National Assembly at the Vietnamese
Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Through close contact and frequent exchanges of visits, the
leaders of the two countries have indicated the right direction
for development of the bilateral relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that he is pleased to see the progress in economic
and scientific cooperation between China and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
He said that China believes there is great potential for
development of the friendly cooperative relationship between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
It is very important for the NPC and the Vietnamese National
Assembly to increase exchanges and expand cooperation, which will
play a major role in developing Sino-Vietnamese relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that china is paying close attention to the
achievements of Vietnamese innovations and opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the
Vietnamese Communist Party, will make new progress in their
efforts to achieve the goal of industrialization and modernization
which was set at the Eighth National Congress of the Vietnamese
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Manh, who held a welcoming ceremony for the Chinese NPC
delegation in front of the Presidential Palace this morning, said
that Qiao's visit has brought the friendship of the Chinese people
to the Vietnamese people.
</P>
<P>
He added that it is a great event in the development of
friendly relations between the two countries and the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
As friendly neighbors, China and Vietnam have many
similarities, Manh said, adding that Vietnam will never forget the
Chinese people's support for its revolution.
</P>
<P>
He said that Vietnam will spare no efforts to strengthen the
friendship and cooperation between the two countries for the
benefit of the two peoples as well as peace and development of
Asia and the world as a whole.

development in China and Chinese foreign policies.

<HEADLINE> Wife-Beating Phenomenon Rife in Israeli Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Yael Dayan, Member of
knesset (Israel's parliament), is calling for punishment on her
fellow MK Haim Dayan for allegedly beating his wife, even
though his wife withdrew Sunday her police complaint against
him, reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Yael Dayan, who chairs the Knesset Committee on the Status of
Women, noted that the police are required to investigate
complaints of family violence even the complainant -- in most
cases the wife -- cancels the police complaint.
</P>
<P>
She said some women had withdrawn charges. "Usually the
reasons for withdrawing the charges are for fear of physical
revenge; for the sake of the children; for fear of the
embarrassment; or because the husband is the major wage earner,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
Yael Dayan, daughter of former Israeli defense minister Moshe
Dayan, said she considers the case of Haim Dayan particularly
serious, because he is not only a MK who sits on the Knesset
Labor and Social Affairs Committee -- which deals with
domestic violence -- but he is also a former police
officer. "Any way you look at it, he should be setting an
example," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by Israel Women's Network, 10
percent of all married women have been beaten by their
spouses. In 1995, an estimated 200,000 married women were
beaten.
</P>
<P>
Seven percent of these women are beaten consistently and
systematically. Each year, 40,000 women are brought to hospital
emergency wards because of beatings.
</P>
<P>
Every year, police receive 9,000 complaints of being beaten by
spouses. 30,000 women appealed to Na'amat, women's organization
under the Israeli Federation of Trade Unions Histadrut, for help
between 1984 and 1994.

<HEADLINE> Reform Revitalizes Small Enterprises in Anhui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A great number of small and
unprofitable industrial firms in east China's Anhui Province have
become dynamic in recent years as a result of reorganization and
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Anhui has 21,700 industrial firms, 98 percent of which are
small-sized. Their output value accounts for 53 percent of the
province's total.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the provincial government has campaigned to
revitalize small enterprises by reforming property rights, mergers
and other forms of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A total of 106 small enterprises have practised new reform
measures and some have turned into local economic pillars.
</P>
<P>
The Tongbao Automobile Plant in Wuhu increased its assets over
two years from three million yuan to 100 million yuan by annexing
23 small firms.
</P>
<P>
Reorganization of the Dongfang Garment Company Ltd. in Huaibei,
which was composed of four unprofitable state-owned small plants,
helped these firms pay back 14 million yuan in debts, and also
turn over to the state nine million yuan in profits and taxes in
1995.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Tracks Down Ebola Carrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, November 18 (Xinhua) -- South African medical
experts have worked around the clock to identify a Gabon doctor
as the person who infected a 46-year old nurse Marilyn Lahana
with the deadly Ebola virus, said sources obtained here today.
</P>
<P>
Lahana, who was fighting for her life during the weekend,
became the first victim of the deadly disease in South Africa
when she was positively identified as having been suffering from
Ebola on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Gabon doctor, whose name has not been released, had
treated Ebola patients but did not have the tell-tale symptom of
Ebola when he was admitted to a Johannesburg private clinic for
"raging fever" on October 27.
</P>
<P>
The doctor had been nursed by Lahana at the clinic before his
discharge last Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, Johannesburg medical authorities moved quickly to
identify the source of the outbreak and to reassure the public
that there was no need to panic as the disease was under control.
</P>
<P>
Doctors and officials traced the Gabon doctor to a house in
Johannesburg, where he was recovering from his fever, on Saturday
and drew blood samples, confirming the man had been infected by
the Ebola virus.
</P>
<P>
Lahana was reported to fall ill and was admitted to a local
hospital with early symptoms of Ebola on November 6 and was
diagnosed positively as having been infected with the deadly
disease on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Since the confirmation of the disease, Lahana has been
transferred to Johannesburg Hospital, where she has been sedated
and was hooked up to a ventilator in an isolation ward.
</P>
<P>
According to doctors, Lahana experienced kidney failure as a
result of the virus and has had to undergo dialysis. Her
condition was not deteriorating, but was still serious.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 200 people were being monitored for symptoms
of the Ebola virus after coming into contact with Lahana, said
Neil Cameron, Director of National Department of Health
Communicable Disease.
</P>
<P>
Ebola is one of the most virulent disease known to human
beings thus far. There is no drug or vaccine for the disease,
which kills up to 90 percent of its victims. enditem

<HEADLINE> New Effort to Develop Tourism for Home of "Big Foot" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Tourism authorities are taking
advantage of the popularity of the legendary "Big Foot" -- the
mysterious half-man, half-ape -- to upgrade tourism facilities
along a 60-km-long river in the Shennongjia Mountains.
</P>
<P>
More and more tourists have traveled to the mountains, where
local residents report sightings of the "Wildman" or "Big Foot" --
a half-man, half-ape creature.
</P>
<P>
No scientific evidence has so far been found to support the
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The Shennong River runs from the southern mouth of the
Shennongjia Mountains to Wuxia, one of the Three Gorges. Next to
the river are magnificent mountain peaks, scenic valleys,
waterfalls, springs, tomb ruins, and a large variety of animals
and birds.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang Zhuping, governor of Hubei Province in
central China, the provincial financial departments and Baxi
County will invest 4.5 million yuan (about 542,000 US dollars)
respectively to widen and improve a road from Dongrangkou, a
tourist destination, to Yeziba, the entrance of the Shennong
River. The project will be completed next year.
</P>
<P>
Another tourist berth will be built on the river at a total
cost of 3.3 million yuan (about 398,000 US dollars). Also added
will be a pleasure-boat and 20 mini-buses with
air-conditioning. The facilities will be put into use by April
next year, a peak tourism season for the river region, the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
To date, the Shennong River area has played host to 380,000
tourists, including 75,000 overseas visitors. The tourists have
brought in more than 33 million yuan (nearly four million US
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Palestinians Resume Talks on Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators resumed their talks on Hebron redeployment in the West
Bank town of Jericho Sunday night, but no progress was made,
reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Chief Israeli negotiator Dan Shomron said he does not expect to
reach an agreement this week and the talks will take a long time.
</P>
<P>
One of the obstacles is still the dispute over the right
demanded by Israel of "hot pursuit" of suspected militants in
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Sunday on
Israel Radio that Israel is demanding what he called "freedom of
action" in Hebron after it was handed over to the Palestinian
Authority.
</P>
<P>
However, Palestinian security chief in Gaza Mohamed Dahlan
reportedly said Palestinians will continue to reject the Israeli
demand for the right of entry into the Palestinian self-rule areas
after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Another issue is the reopening of Shuhada Street, the main
artery through the Jewish settlements. Israel has agreed to reopen
the street to Palestinian business and to through-traffic in
stages "in accordance with security considerations." The
Palestinians demand a timetable for the reopening.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side wants any Hebron agreement to link with
further implementation of the signed agreements. But Israel
demanded "reciprocity" from Palestinians in the observance of the
Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israel-PLO accords, Israel was to hand some 80
percent of the town of Hebron to the Palestinian Authority in March.
</P>
<P>
However, the move was delayed by the previous Israeli
government following a series of suicide bombing attacks in
February and March and further delayed after hardline Likud Party
won the May general election.

<P>
HOHHOT, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Tourism authorities in north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have taken measures to
protect the fledgling tourism industry here by cracking down on
the illegal activities of some local travel agents and tour guides.
</P>
<P>
This June, local tourist administrations, with the help of
public security, commerce and industry departments, launched a
campaign to investigate the unlawful practices of some agents and
individuals, according official sources here.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the tourism sector has boomed in this
grassland autonomous region, bringing huge earnings to local
people, but some local agents and guides were profiting by
cheating or bullying tourists for extra cash, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
To further protect the interests of tourists, some local
governments have set up special administrative bodies to supervise
the activities of local travel agents and tourist spots.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A province in China has
established an enterprise which is aimed at helping senior and
middle-ranking professional personnel find ways to better show off
their talent.
</P>
<P>
Located in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan
Province, the new firm will be run similar to the way a bank is
operated, according to an official from the company, the first of
its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
By the fourth day after its opening, the "bank" had attracted
more than 3,000 potential clients, and it is currently negotiating
with units who want to employ workers.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the "bank" now offers to job-seekers
such services as "current deposit," "time deposit," "transfer,"
"bank loans" and "credit cards."
</P>
<P>
The official said that his company mainly works with those who
are returned students or have been employed for at least three
years in solely foreign-funded enterprises, receiving an annual
income of over 36,000 yuan; those who have diplomas at the
university level or have polytechnic school diplomas; those who
have professional titles above middle-range or have been appointed
section chief or above; and those who have special skills in
certain fields.
</P>
<P>
Sociologist Chen Deshu, a researcher from Sichuan Provincial
Academy of Social Sciences, pointed out that Chengdu has the
largest number of scientific and technical workers in China.
</P>
<P>

play an active role in promoting the improvement of technical and
management levels in local enterprises, especially
non-governmental enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Strengthens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
firmer against the US dollar today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was traded at 79.14 US cents at the close
from 79.08 US cents at last week's close.
</P>
<P>
But it was weaker against the Japanese yen, ending at 87.92 yen
from 88.08 yen on last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended firmer against the German mark at
1.1924 marks from 1.1920 marks on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Local traders said that the Australian dollar would be stuck in
the range between 78.80 US cents and 79.20 US cents this week.
</P>
<P>
Local economists expected a flat October imports growth figure
to be released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A flat imports figure would add to the likeliness of another
official interest rate cut, which in turn would drag down the
local currency in exchange rates against other major currencies.
</P>
<P>
However, a strengthening US dollar against the Japanese yen
would provide some support for the Australian currency.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New System Brings About Changes to New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in New
Zealand, the election in October this year failed to produce a
government and now the nation is still waiting for politicians to
decide what kind of government will lead the country in the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
The election, the first under the Mixed Member Proportional
(MMP) representation, did achieve the prime goal as envisaged by
the advocates. It ended the monopoly of state power by the two
major parties -- the National Party and the Labor Party -- which
had held power alternately since 1853.
</P>
<P>
Six parties are now represented in the 120-member parliament,
compared with four in the last parliament elected in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Representation in parliament has also been broadened.
Forty-five of the parliamentarians are new faces, with 15 of them
being Maoris. The first ever Chinese MP has been elected.
</P>
<P>
The election also confirmed the dominating positions of the two
big parties, with National leading with 44 seats followed by Labor
with 37.
</P>
<P>
But their dominance has been put on check as neither of them
has won a clear majority to set up the new government on its own.
Each of them will have to negotiate with smaller parties to form a
coalition, or to rule by itself as a minority government.
</P>
<P>
Such a situation gives the third largest party, New Zealand
First, which has 17 seats in parliament, the opportunity to play
the crucial role in the country's political game. Both National
and Labor are doing their best to win its support in their bid to
form the new government.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand First will certainly no let such a good chance slip
by and is making use of the coalition talks to extract as much
concession as possible from the two bigger parties.
</P>
<P>
This is what many voters had not expected: a small party will
have the final say on the shape of the government. Some
pessimistic analysts forecast that the bargains among parties
would be a long drawn-out process possibly extending into next
year.
</P>
<P>
To strike a coalition deal, each of the three parties needs to
adjust its policies to accommodate the views of its potential
partner. This may cause politicians to break some campaign
promises, which voters do not like to see.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the National Party promised a second-round of tax
cuts starting next July to the delight of the middle- and
high-income classes.
But New Zealand First said it wanted to increase the government
spending.
</P>
<P>
There is already a report that National is considering to delay
or ultimately cancel the next round of tax cuts to woo New Zealand
First. Although the report has been denied by National,
modification of certain economic policies seems inevitable.
</P>
<P>
In turn, New Zealand First is reportedly planning to soften its
stand on some issues to please its potential partner.
</P>
<P>
Before the election, many people expected New Zealand First was
more likely to work with Labor as they share a larger common
ground on policy issues. But now, the chance for a coalition
between National and New Zealand First seems to be on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Whichever parties form the new government, the bargain process
is bound to be delicate and time consuming as each option will be
carefully weighed.
</P>
<P>
Advocates maintain that this is just what the MMP system is
intended for.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Historic Summit to Free World From Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Rome World Food Summit which
ended today may well be remembered as one of the most important
efforts devoted to the noble and arduous task of freeing mankind
from hunger and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
In all, 187 heads of state and government or their
representatives voiced their views at the meeting on how to
overcome food insecurity and eradicate hunger and malnutrition,
the two evils haunting most developing countries, especially the
"low-income food-deficit" ones.
</P>
<P>
The summit adopted two major documents, the World Food Security
Rome Declaration and the World Food Summit Plan of Action, setting
the goal for hunger eradication and committing governments to
incorporating the goal into their national plans and strategies.
</P>
<P>
With the world population growing, arable land shrinking and
the "north-south gap" widening, food insecurity and hunger have
become a problem that no country can ignore. Sense of urgency must
prevail, new concepts must be developed, sound strategies must be
worked out and, above all, concrete follow-up actions must be
taken if mankind is serious about the task ahead.
</P>
<P>
This summit has precisely laid a spiritual groundwork for
future practical success.
</P>
<P>
And there are also successful precedents for others to follow.
China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Costa Rica and Turkey are all
cited by the summit's technical documents as having made marked
progress in achieving food security and alleviating hunger and
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
But globally, the task remains formidably difficult. While most
developing countries, anxious for improvements, hope the developed
countries to come to their help in the forms of food aid, capital
and technology transfer and debt relief, the developed countries
are, to say the least, lukewarm to their pleas.
</P>
<P>
"The rich knows no hunger." Cuban President Fidel Castro could
not be righter when he was criticizing the attitude of some
"north" countries.
</P>
<P>
All said, the Rome summit is still a historic event with
far-reaching significance, for it is the first time in history
that the issue of food security and hunger eradication has been
fully presented at the world's highest political level.

<HEADLINE> High Spending Reported for Nepali Students Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Nepali students studying at
universities abroad are spending much more money than the
country's prestigious state-run Tribhuvan University, the
Kathmandu Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said students going abroad for self-financed studies took
away from Nepal a hefty amount of 9 million U.S. dollars last
year, equivalent to 513 million rupees, more than 2.5 times the
annual budget of the Tribhuvan University.
</P>
<P>
According to the Education Ministry, nearly 4,900 Nepali
students have gone overseas for higher education since 1991 and
560 students have left the country this year.

</P>
<P>
Former Soviet Union countries, the United States and Australia
are favorite destinations for aspiring students from affluent
middle-class families in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Many of the students choose to work in foreign countries after
graduation, the report said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> International Consortia Eye China's LNG Power Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A representative from Amoco
Oriental Company recently announced that the firm has completed a
feasibility study for the construction of a power project in the
Yangtze River Delta area that uses imported liquefied natural gas
(LNG) as fuel.
</P>
<P>
If implemented, the project will cost an estimated three
billion US dollars and is expected to supply six million tons of
LNG to China each year, increasing China's generating capacity to
an additional 5,000 megawatts a year.
</P>
<P>
The representative made the announcement at a two-day seminar
on LNG power projects held from November 12-13 in Hangzhou, the
capital of east China's Zhejiang Province. The meeting was jointly
sponsored by Amoco and the Zhejiang Provincial Institute of
Economic and Construction Planning.
</P>
<P>
The company is the fourth international consortia that has
shown interest in launching LNG power projects in China's
economically-developed Yangtze River Delta area.
</P>
<P>
The other three transnational companies are Shell, Exxon and
Enron, which have all conducted thorough investigations in the
energy-starved Delta, and have worked out a package of development
plans for the region.
</P>
<P>
The demand for electricity is increasing day by day in the
delta, due to rapid economic expansion in the region. But the
development and use of the traditional energy store has caused
serious environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
As a result, provinces in the delta area are looking for new
energy sources, while actively working to develop "clean energy."
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Province, located in the delta, has several thousand
kilometers of deep-water coastline, and many favorable conditions
for building LNG-burning power stations.
</P>
<P>
LNG was first used as an energy source several dozen years
ago. Many countries in the world have built LNG power stations,
which have proved to be even more efficient, operate at a lower
cost and are cleaner than nuclear or hydroelectric power stations.
</P>
<P>
Amoco is the world's fourth largest private natural gas
production company, with an annual output of 43 billion cu m and
more than 31 billion US dollars in sales. The company has 30
billion US dollars in assets.
</P>
<P>
Amoco's investment in China now totals one billion US
dollars. The company has set up offices in Nanjing, Shanghai,
Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Beijing, which coordinates operations for
the Chinese offices.

<HEADLINE> China Urged to Strengthen Awareness of Maritime Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Qin Dahe, the first Chinese
scientist to cross the South Pole on foot, has called on the
Chinese government to expand the scale of its maritime development.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea, which went into effect on November 16, 1994, the sea area
over which China has sovereignty equals about one-third of its 9.6
million-sq km sovereign territory, said Qin, who is participating
in the ongoing 24th World Conference on Oceanic Peace in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the sea is rich in fishing and mineral resources
such as petroleum and natural gas, which are important to China,
as it is heavily populated. "China must keep tight control over
the use of its natural resources," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard its maritime rights and interests and fit into the
new international maritime order, Qin said, China should not only
adjust its maritime policy, view maritime development as its
fundamental state policy and strengthen maritime affairs
legislation and management, it should also step up efforts for the
development of maritime high-technology to accelerate maritime
economic development and strengthen China's competitiveness in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Qin, now chief of the Resources, Environment and Technology
Department under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that the
scale of the maritime industry in China is limited, and its
science and technology level is low compared with that of
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese Academy of Sciences will readjust its
research programs, tasks and mechanism in line with the economic
and social development and the development trend of frontier
maritime science. The Academy, he added, will also muster the
country's elite science personnel to solve the crucial, strategic
and comprehensive scientific issues that are most urgently needed
by the country.

<HEADLINE> China Promulgates Regulations on Jewelry Appraisal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- China has made public the
first set of unified regulations governing the jewelry business,
the overseas edition of the "People's Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
They cover three areas of the industry, including the
classification of diamonds, the naming of jewelry, and the
appraisal of jewelry.
</P>
<P>
The regulations were drawn up by the National Jewelry and Jade
Quality Supervision and Examination Center and approved by the
State Bureau of Technological Supervision.
</P>
<P>
Jewelry and jade are considered special commodities in China,
and so far, no unified regulations have been issued in the country
to supervise actions, though some local regulations have been in
effect. Consequently, market transactions in the past were often
confusing, and there was no national standard to solve the
disputes that occured.
</P>
<P>
The promulgation of these regulations is of great significance
to the development of the jewelry and jade industry, the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Economy Shows Positive Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's economy showed a
positive trend in the first three months of the current 1996-97
fiscal year with money supply under control and a slightly
decreased inflation rate, the country's central bank said today.
</P>
<P>
According to Nepal Rastra Bank's quarterly report on the
country's macroeconomic situation, monetary restraints were
maintained in the three months till mid-October with money supply
down 0.3 percent, as against the 0.6-percent decline in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the inflation rate, measured by the Urban Consumer
Price Index, showed a slightly slower growth in the review period,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The price index was up 10.1 percent in mid-October 1996 as
against 10.4 percent three months ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank, remarkable improvements were
witnessed in the country's foreign trade with a sharp decline in
import growth.
</P>
<P>
During the review period, exports of woolen carpets and
ready-made garments, Nepal's major export items, grew
significantly over a year earlier when a negative increase was
recorded, the bank added.
</P>
<P>
Total trade deficit went up by 0.7 percent to around 235
million U.S. dollars in the period, compared with a 51.2-percent
rise in the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the slowdown of the trade deficit growth was not
enough to reverse an adverse impact on government revenue, the
bank said.
</P>
<P>
The government's fiscal deficit, though on a declining trend,
continued as the revenue failed to meet the total expenditure in
the review period, according to the central bank.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Tops China on Tourist Attraction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- With the '97 China Tourism
Year on the horizon, the Chinese capital has vowed to strengthen
its status as home of the country's top tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
Wu Tonghui, newly-appointed director of the local tourism
administration, said the tourist industry has become one of the
city's pillar industries. In 1995, the city hosted 2.07 million
overseas tourists, and earning 2.1 billion US dollars worth of
foreign currency, accounting for 25 percent of the country's total
in the sector.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, Beijing is expected to attract 152 million
domestic visitors and 3.23 million overseas tourists a year,
gaining profits of 4.12 billion US dollars, said Wu, a former dean
of the Beijing Tourism Academy.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the city has tabled a new tourism strategy
which stipulates that by the mid-21st century, Beijing should
serve as a world-wide tourist attraction site, featuring its new
socialist images and striking Oriental flavor.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, with 3,040 years of urban history and 800 years as the
country's capital city, is also making every effort to be listed
among the world's top cities for its prominent historical and
cultural aspects, and as a modernized international metropolis.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the city plans to regulate the local tourist
spots, build a more standard infrastructure and offer quality
services in a bid to ensure an orderly tourist market, Wu
added.

<HEADLINE> Aquatic Products Market Steady in 4th Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- China's aquatic products market
is running steadily in the fourth quarter of the year, with the
rate of price increase so far roughly the same as in the first six
months.
</P>
<P>
Aquatic products distributors expect a yearly price rise rate
below 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Stable growth of aquatic production is the main reason for the
steady performance of the market, according to analysts. They
expect the output to reach 27 million tons for the year, a growth
of 10 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition, due to the state's tight monetary policy, the
overall rate of price increases has been less than before, and
that of aquatic products was no exception.
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese no longer concentrate their food consumption on
a few major holidays in the last quarter of the year -- such as
the National Day and the New Year's Day -- there is no longer a
remarkable peak season in the period. This quarter is also harvest
season for aquatics breeding industry, so supply and demand have
maintained a balance.
</P>
<P>
However, oversupply of fresh-water fishes continues to be a
problem in some areas.

NEW DELHI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) is working out a new version of the Foreign Exchange
Regulation Act to make it easier for Indian nationals abroad to

</P>
<P>
There would be a complete overhaul of all the past amendments
and a streamlined and pragmatic version of the act would be

</P>
<P>
The existing act has many contradictory and conflicting clauses
due to a number of amendments, which were open to various equally
contradictory interpretations, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The new version would be less regulating and more encouraging
in promoting savings by Indians abroad, the sources further said.
</P>
<P>
The entire current exercise by the RBI, in consultation with
the Indian Finance Ministry, to reform act, is aimed at achieving
the full capital account convertibility of the rupee, the sources

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Poised to Become Petrochemical Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia, the biggest
producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG) with an annual output of
16 million tons at present, is poised to become a regional
petrochemical center in a few years.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is now engaged in several large-scale petrochemical
projects which will transform the country into a regional
petrochemical center by the turn of the century, with its LNG
production expected to increase to 22 million tons per annum
following the recent launching of a third LNG plant by the
national oil company Petronas, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
said today.
</P>
<P>
"The continued development of the country's gas reserves has
provided Malaysia with a stable supply of feed stock, enabling
further diversification downstream," he said at a four-day Gas
Information Exchange 1996 here.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a need for greater cost reduction over the
entire gas supply chain to allow the full benefits of natural gas
to be realized.
</P>
<P>
On the utilization of gas in the Asia-Pacific region, Anwar
said Malaysia expected the demand for natural gas to expand by 16
percent between now and the year 2000, compared with 4 percent for
oil in the same period.
</P>
<P>
At present, natural gas accounts for 22 percent of the
region's energy demand compared with 42 percent for oil and 26
percent for coal.
</P>
<P>
For Malaysia, he said, the contribution of natural gas to the
country's energy mix has been growing steadily from 3 percent in
1985 to 29 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
"We expect, in the next five years, gas will account for
one-third of Malaysia's total energy requirements," he said.
</P>
<P>
LNG has become a major export for Malaysia with the interim
September trade figures showing that lower earnings from other
exports were offset to some extent by higher receipts from LNG
which recorded an increase of 67.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Australia Calls Russian Rocket Crash "Happy Ending" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The crash of the disabled
Russian Mars Space Probe in the southwest Pacific was a "happy
ending," Australian Prime Minister John Howard told the federal
parliament this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"It does appear that what we all have is a happy ending to the
saga of the Russian spacecraft," he told the House of
Representatives in an address during the question time.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the spacecraft touched down in the southwest
Pacific, some 1,300 miles (1,000 kilometers) west of San Diago in
South America, at 12:34 PM local time.
</P>
<P>
The splashdown site was at deep open sea well outside
Australian territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
The Mars-96 probe contained plutonium batteries. A leakage of
radioactive materials was considered the greatest danger to be
posed by the 6.8-ton spacecraft, which fell out of control after
being launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Howard said U.S. President Bill Clinton telephoned to brief him
on the potential danger early this morning.
</P>
<P>
"It has been assumed widely for some time that it would touch
down in Australia and some the debris might have exposed
Australian citizens to risk -- a matter that the government has to
take contingency arrangements against," he said.
</P>
<P>
At one stage, the most likely touchdown site was said to be
somewhere near Tibooburra in the far northwest side of New South
Wales State in eastern Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Space Debris Emergency Search Team under
Emergency Management Australia had been put on top alert while the
Australian Defense Forces were also kept on standby earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Howard held an urgent press conference this morning to inform
Australian people about the potential danger and called on them to
remain calm.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, he thanked Clinton for his efforts and
also indirectly criticized Russia for not informing Australia
about the potential danger.
</P>
<P>
"It is obviously one of those situations where there is a
proper obligation to share that kind of information in the
interests of people taking adequate preparation," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a clear sign of relief, Howard reported to the parliament
that a pub in Tibooburra offered all its customers free beer on
hearing the news about the final splashdown of the spacecraft.

<HEADLINE> Battle for Survival Leads to Drug Abuse: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Faced with hunger and
fatigue and in order to forget the harsh realities of violence and
exploitation, street children in India are increasingly taking to
drugs, said a just-released national report on the country's
homeless children.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse is widespread among street children and the average
age of first-time drug users appears to be getting younger.
</P>
<P>
Younger street children generally use readily accessible and
cheap drugs such as solvents, alcohol and tobacco while others are
more likely to turn to a greater variety of drugs including heroin
and other opiates, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, needle sharing among drug abusers and unsafe sexual
practices under the influence of drugs and alcohol increase the
risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases and hiv/aids.
</P>
<P>
Peer group influence, social acceptability in community and the
influence of media are cited as the most important factors
influencing a child's drug abuse behavior.
</P>
<P>
As the street environment is conducive to drug abuse, it is
extremely difficult to help detoxified children stay away from
drugs, the report further said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Rocket Crashes Into South Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The disabled Russian Mars
Space Probe crashed into the South Pacific Ocean about 1,000 km
west of South America, near Easter Island, at 31 degree south, 96
degrees 30 minutes west at 12:34 local time, Emergency Management
Australia confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
Though there are people living on the island, the point of
impact was at such a distance from the island that it would not
pose any radioactive threat to the population there, sources from
the emergency management office said.
</P>
<P>
Emergency Management Australia director-general Alan Hodges
said that the splash down site had been confirmed by the North
American Air Defense Organization.
</P>
<P>
He said that the splash down point was at deep ocean and that
the prospects for recovering the plutonium aboard the spacecraft
were "very slim."
</P>
<P>
The seven-ton probe contained plutonium batteries. A nuclear
leakage was considered the greatest danger from the crash.
</P>
<P>
Australia's national plan on radioactive space debris has been
put into operation earlier today, with an emergency team on
stand-by. But the emergency team is unlikely to go into action now
as the crash site was well outside Australia's territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Hodges said that the radioactive material in the probe was not
expected to break up.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Defense Forces were also put on standby earlier
today, when the point of impact was estimated to be in
well-populated east Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Space Debris Emergency Search Team comprises
military personnel and experts from the nuclear science
organization ANSTO.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard held an urgent press
conference this morning after being informed about the expected
crash by US President Bill Clinton over telephone at 8:00 a.m.
local time. Clinton is to visit Australia on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Mars-96 probe, containing research laboratories to be
landed on the Martian surface, was launched from the Baikonur
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Saturday. The fourth-stage rocket,
which was supposed to work for three minutes, only worked 20
seconds. As a result, the probe was trapped in Earth's orbit while
monitors on the ground lost contact with the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
It became clear this morning that the probe would crash into
earth.

<HEADLINE> Constantinescu's Backers Celebrate Victory in Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of Emil
Constantinescu took to the streets today to celebrate the
Democratic Convention leader's victory in the second and last
round of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of cars sounding their horns and thousands of jubilant
demonstrators on foot filled the streets of downtown Bucharest in
celebrations. And similar celebrations were reported from other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
At the University Square of Bucharest, the crowd waved national
flags and portraits of the president-elect, and prepared to make a
night of celebrations.
</P>
<P>
At a balcony facing down the square, Constantinescu, who beat
incumbent President Ion Iliescu by a margin of 7 percentage points
in the runoff Sunday, delivered a speech to his audience.
</P>
<P>
"The time for hate has passed. There will be no persecution, no
punishment. We are going to build, not to destroy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told his supporters: "You have conquered. Romania will at
last become the democratic, free and prosperous country of which
we have dreamed."
</P>
<P>
"Till the end of my mandate I will fight for truth and
justice," he said before calling on the crowd to recite the Lord's
Prayer, a regular feature of demonstrations against Iliescu in the
past seven years.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu, a 57-year-old geology professor, was pronounced
winner of the election by the national television today. He
accused the president of corruptive mismanagement that has left
Romanians in poverty.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's constitution, Iliescu would remain
president until Constantinescu is sworn into office in the next
few days. A specific date is yet to be set for the handover
ceremony.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The New Aspiration party won
126 out of a total of 393 seats in the House of Representatives in
Sunday's general election.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry's latest results show that the New
Aspiration beat the Democrat party by only four seats, with the
latter winning 122 seats.
</P>
<P>
Although the final official results are still not yet
available, all vote counts put the New Aspiration in the lead.
</P>
<P>
The Chart Pattana (national development) party comes third with
51 seats, while outgoing prime minister Banharn Silpa-Archa's
Chart Thai (Thai nation) party ranks fourth, with 38 seats.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the New Aspiration party late last night
began negotiating with all coalition parties which were in
Banharn's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
If all agree to join the New Aspiration party-led coalition,
the new government will be the same as the one just before the
dissolution of the parliament, commanding 203 seats.
</P>
<P>
If any of the former coalition party refuses to join, it will
put New Aspiration party leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh in a
difficult position. He will then have to get a partner from the
former opposition camp, most likely the Chart Pattana party.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if Chavalit fails to form a government
commanding a majority in parliament commanding a minimum 197
seats, the Democrat party will get the mandate to form a
government.
</P>
<P>
Standings of other parties are: the Social Action party won 21
seats, Prochakorn Thai (Thai citizen) 18, Solidarity 8, Seritham
(liberal democratic) 5, Muan Chon (mass) 2, Palang Dharma (virtue
force) 1, and Thai party 1.

<HEADLINE> Social Insurance System Takes Shape in Hunan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A social insurance system
covering all the urban area in central China's Hunan Province has
been established, according to vice governor Zhou Bohua.
</P>
<P>
So far, all state-owned enterprises and many non-governmental
enterprises have introduced the pension system and unemployment
insurance system, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
The social insurance system has been implemented in more and
more enterprises since it was introduced to the province ten years
ago. To date, 17,813 enterprises in the province have introduced
the pension system, covering 2.58 million workers and 677,000
retired workers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 71,000 temporary workers, workers in private
enterprises, joint ventures and township enterprises as well as
self-employed individuals have taken part in the social insurance
system.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the pension system, three million workers in 19,575
enterprises are receiving unemployment benefits. The province has
also established 160 training bases for the unemployed. Over the
past few years, unemployment insurance agencies in the province
have issued 22 million yuan in relief funds to 70,000 workers who
lost their jobs, and 60 million yuan to 900,000 workers in
enterprises that have faced serious operating difficulties.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the province has also implemented a medicare
insurance program in 1,177 enterprises, an industrial accident
insurance plan in 2,840 enterprises, and a birth insurance system
in 449 enterprises, providing services to 1.15 million workers.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said the social insurance system has played an important
part in maintaining social stability and promoting the development
of the national economy. Following a rare flood in the province,
social insurance departments provided 71 million yuan to the
retired or the unemployed workers affected by the disaster.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the government will draft more
regulations in order to establish an employment insurance system
for all workers in the province.

<HEADLINE> Runaway Actress Brought Back to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's TV actress Zarina,
who had escaped to the United States after being charged with
possessing almost 30,000 Ecstasy pills, was brought back to
Jakarta on Sunday, the official Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old actress was first detained in August after
police said they found 29,667 pills of the illegal drug at her
home. But she ran away from custody when she was allowed to go
home for a bath.
</P>
<P>
On November 4, Zarina was detained by U.S. police in Houston,
Texas, on charges of illegal immigration as Indonesia had canceled
her passport.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Attorney-General Singgih said that Zarina would
receive heavy penalty for escaping from custody.
</P>
<P>
The case was an embarrassment for the police following the
escape from prison in May of businessman Eddy Tansil who was
serving a 20-year term for his part in a major banking scandal.

Goodison was hobbled in the first half when a stud from the
shoe of Jamaican defender Linval Dixon caught him on the knee. He

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
urged developed countries to invest in the fertilizer industry to
help enable farmers in developing countries to produce lower-cost
farm products, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the press here last night after returning from the
U.N.-sponsored Food Summit in Rome, Italy, Soeharto said developed
countries should help to keep fertilizer prices low if they want
developing countries to be self-sufficient in food production.
</P>
<P>
"If developed countries are committed to assisting the
developing or poor countries, they should make fertilizer
production cheaper so it would not burden farmers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is willing to receive investment from developed
countries and set up fertilizer plants not only for domestic
consumption but also for farmers in other countries, said
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed cooperation among developing countries to
overcome the food crisis.

<HEADLINE> Medical Research Gives Ancient Prescriptions New Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 years ago, the
Chinese used a medical preparation to cure heart pains that had
the same function as modern-day nitroglycerine.
</P>
<P>
Information taken from a medical document discovered in
northwest China's Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes, where thousands of
written materials were stored by residents in ancient times,
revealed that people of the Tang Dynasty developed a mixture of
nitre and realgar powder to place under the tongue to treat angina.
</P>
<P>
Now, pharmacologists at the Traditional Chinese Medical College
of Gansu Province, where the Mogao Grottoes are located, are
researching the documents, hoping that some of the findings can be
applied to modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
Several important discoveries have been made: new medicines
developed according to ancient prescriptions have proved
successful, including a pill to treat hair loss, an acupuncture
treatment to cure urological diseases in men, and an herbal
medicine to promote health and prolong life.
</P>
<P>
They are currently developing a medicine, based on the ancient
writings, to cure sterility.
</P>
<P>
About 45,000 square meters of murals and 40,000 scrolls of
writings have been preserved in the 1,600-year-old grottoes. They
cover religion, art, dance, music, science and technology,
medicine, and folk customs from the ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and foreign experts have made decades-long research on
every aspect of the Dunhuang heritage, including traditional
Chinese medical theories and clinical practices.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts from Lanzhou, Beijing, Tianjin and overseas
have carried out independent research, and held international
symposiums on Dunhuang traditional medicine, believing their
efforts would give the thousand-year-old prescriptions new life.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Women's weightlifting is
likely to be added in the 2000 Sydney Games, International Olympic
Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch said Sunday in Cancun,
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said the IOC will add more teams and disciplines in
women's sports while keeping to the ceiling of 10,200 athletes
agreed upon this week with Sydney organizers.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 women athletes, or 37 percent of the total,
competed in last summer's Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said in a news conference at the end of a joint
session of the IOC executive board that they wanted the competing
women athelte number to arrive at 40 percent in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Two teams will be added for both women's hockey and handball,
bringing the total to 10 in each sport, while women's
weightlifting could also be included on the program.
</P>
<P>
A total of 250 competitors in 10 men's weight categories took
part in the Atlanta Games. If women's events are added for Sydney,
the Weightlifting International Federation would be asked to
reduce the number of men's weight classes to keep the total of
competitors to a maximum of 250.

GUANGZHOU, November 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 90 percent of
people in Guangdong Province turn to the market when they want to
look for a job, so various labor organizations have grown up

</P>
<P>
In turn, the province has been working hard to make the labor
market a bit more orderly and standard in its practices, according
to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The number of registered job services now stands at 1,500, and
they are found in every corner of the province. Last year, more
than 500,000 people found jobs with their help.
</P>
<P>
To impart order to the labor market's operations, departments
in Guangdong have cooperated with each other in regularly
screening the go-betweens, a move which has proven effective in
standardizing the market.
</P>
<P>
The province has also worked out a series of rules and
regulations to complement the Labor Law, which further define the
legal status of the government, the employer, and the job seeker,
and the principles that are to be followed.

<P>
BUCHAREST, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of Emil
Constantinescu, the main presidency challenger in Romania, scented
victory today when two influential polls put Constantinescu seven
percentage points ahead of incumbent President Ion Iliescu.
</P>
<P>
The result of IRSOP, a poll institution in Romania, showed
Constantinescu could win 53.9 percent of the electorate and
Iliescu 46.1 percent. The German polling institution IMAS said the
challenger would win 53.5 percent of the votes and the president
46.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The first round, which took place two weeks ago, gave the
president a slender four-point lead over his challenger. But
Constantinescu turned the tables on the president in the second
round on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the constitution, the first two candidates in the
first round are entitled to continue their presidential race in
the runoff election.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu's victory would put an end to Iliescu's
seven-year rule in the highest post.
</P>
<P>
According to local television reports, Iliescu conceded defeat
without waiting for the official result due to be announced later
today.

<HEADLINE> Novotna Wins Title Through Graf's Back Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Steffi Graf broke down
with a back injury at the end of the first set to hand Jana
Novotna victory in the final of the 450,000 dollar Advanta tennis
championships on Sunday in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
Moments after the No. 3-seed Novotna won the set 6-4, Graf
notified chair umpire Donna Butler she would be unable to
continue. The German's default gave Novotna her third consecutive
tournament victory.
</P>
<P>
The unfinished match started out even, as neither player faced
a break point in the first six games. Novotna broke through in the
seventh game.
</P>
<P>
The victory was only Novotna's fourth in 29 matches against
Graf, and her first since defeating her at the 1992 French
Open. Graf had won the last 14 meetings between the two players.
</P>
<P>
Graf, the No. 1 seed and defending champion, was unable to
finish her second consecutive tournament. She retired from a
match in Leipzig against Anke Huber last month with a sore left
knee, and originally had withdrawn from the Advanta tournament
before reconsidering last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Graf complained of soreness in her lower back on Saturday
night after a semifinal victory over Marianne Werdel Witmeyer.
</P>
<P>
"I tried a lot of treatment last night, but it wasn't enough,"
Graf said Sunday, "It didn't make sense (to continue) because I
wasn't able to move or turn."
</P>
<P>
However, Graf said that she would still try to play in next
week's year-ending Chase Championships in New York. Graf is the
No. 1 seed and defending champion.
</P>
<P>
The Czech, who earned 79,000 for the victory, will move up one
spot to No. 3 in the WTA Tour world rankings this week.

<HEADLINE> French Far-Right National Front Tops Municipal Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Marie-France Stirbois, the
candidate of the far-right National Front (FN) party running for
the mayor of Dreux, 80 kilometers west of Paris, got most of the
votes in the first round of municipal election of the city today.
</P>
<P>
Local media quoted definitive results of the election as saying
that Stirbois had won 36.45 percent of the votes, against 34.73
percent obtained by the outgoing mayor Gerard Hamel, who ran for
the ruling Rassemblement pour la Republique.
</P>
<P>
The socialist candidate Maurice Ravanne, who got 24.76 percent
of the votes, and two other leftwing candidates were knocked out
from the run-off scheduled for next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An FN candidate also entered the second round of municipal
elections in Gardanne, near Marseille, last month and a FN mayor
controls the southern port city of Toulon.
</P>
<P>
Stirbois today claimed her party as "the number one party of
the working class".
</P>
<P>
The FN is making a more and more blaring voice in the social
affairs of the country, which is troubled with a 12.6 percent
unemployment rate and is subjected to an austerity social security
reform plan presented by Prime Minister Alain Juppe one year ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Polling stations closed at 8
p.m. on Sunday in Serbia, ending the run-off elections for 5,603
deputies for municipal authorities.
</P>
<P>
Voters cast their ballots to choose between two or three
candidates for the undecided seats in municipal and city councils.
Candidates need a simple majority to win.
</P>
<P>
The run-off elections for local and provincial authorities took
place in a calm and orderly atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
In the first round of the elections held on November 3, only
2,067 of the 7,670 councilmen were elected in 188 municipalities
in Serbia, which means that 5,603 members of municipal and city
councils are to be elected Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's election results will be made public by the election
committee 48 hours at the latest after the polling stations close.
</P>

Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic said Sunday that the
success of the local elections in the republic would greatly
contribute to the implementation of the development program
through the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after casting ballot in the local elections
that the development program "covers every village and every town,
which means that the local authorities have a very important
role."

<HEADLINE> World Food Summit Ends in Rome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The first-ever World Food Summit
devoted solely to food security and hunger eradication ended here
this evening with a call for concrete follow-up actions to
implement the decisions made at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference marking the conclusion of the
summit, FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf said that the summit
has been successful in raising worldwide awareness on the
importance and urgency of realizing universal food security and
eradicating hunger and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
Diouf said that while food security is primarily the
responsibility of sovereign states, international cooperation is
also essential, especially for the low-income food-deficit
countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are living in a planetary village and we must help each
other in achieving food security," Diouf said.
</P>
<P>
In all, 45 presidents, 15 vice presidents, 41 prime ministers,
12 deputy prime ministers and 74 senior officials including
ministers spoke at the five-day summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit's greatest achievement is the adoption of two major
documents, the World Food Security Rome Declaration and the World
Food Summit Plan of Action, which reaffirm the right of everyone
to have access to safe and nutritious food and set an immediate
goal of reducing the number of undernourished people to half their
present level by the year 2015.
</P>
<P>
Widely represented though the summit was, there was an obvious
difference between the developing and developed countries in their
attitude toward the meeting itself and toward how to achieve food
security and eradicate hunger.
</P>
<P>
Summit organizers had explicitly declared in advance that the
meeting would not be a pledge one in order to attract as many top
leaders from the developed world as possible. However, many major
developed countries, with the exception of France, were
represented only by ministerial officials.
</P>
<P>
The emphases of speeches were also different. Most developing
countries emphasized the urgency of eradicating hunger and
malnutrition, the necessity for the developed countries to come to
the aid of the developing countries, and the need to refrain from
using food as an instrument for political and economic pressure.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, many speakers from developed countries
emphasized that food security and hunger eradication were
primarily the responsibilities of individual developing countries,
and put forward some pre-conditions for external assistance that
were unrealistic and unpracticable to the developing countries.
