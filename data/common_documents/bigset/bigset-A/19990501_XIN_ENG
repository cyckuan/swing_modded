<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Meets with New U.N. Envoy to DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has met with the newly appointed U.N. special envoy to the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Mustafa Niasse at his home in
the southwestern district of Mbarara Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the President's Office said they discussed
the general situation in the Great Lakes region and reviewed
proposed measures and possibilities of ensuring a viable peaceful
process in the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
Niasse, former foreign minister of Senegal, has recently been
appointed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan as a special envoy
for the DRC peace process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by State Minister of Foreign
Affairs Alfred Mubanda and other senior officials, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is one of the key players in the DRC issue. It has been
accused by DRC President Laurent Kabila of backing the rebel
forces trying to overthrow Kabila's government. Uganda has denied
this charge and defended its military presence in the eastern part
of DRC as a move to ensure security of its borders.
</P>
<P>
Museveni recently signed a ceasefire agreement with Kabila in
Libya, a deal which has been played down by both Rwanda and the
Tutsi rebels.
</P>
<P>
The nine-month armed conflict in the DRC has sucked in several
neighboring countries into the war and many regional and
international efforts aimed at achieving peace in the country have
failed with both sides of the conflict refusing to compromise.

airlift 5,000 Kosovo refugees in Canada at the request of the
United Nations, Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard told the
House of Commons Friday.

Robillard told the House.

She said the refugees will begin arriving Monday.Canada will
airlift 300 people a day to Canada for about two weeks, the

offered safe haven in Canada, but the United Nation refugee agency
decided to postpone a massive airlift, keeping refugees close to
Kosovo in the possibility of returning to their homeland.

<P>
ATHENS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Protestors in the northern Greek
port city of Thessaloniki Friday began a two-day blockade of the
port to protest NATO using the port to ferry troops and supplies
to neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The blockade is expected to last until midnight Saturday, the
semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
A banner hung on the port's main gate read:"this city belongs

</P>
<P>
Greece, both member of NATO and the European Union (EU), has
refused to participate in the NATO military operations against
Yugoslavia directly, but has provided the use of Thessaloniki as a
transit point for NATO troops in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The blockade is a symbolic demand for NATO's airstrikes against
Yugoslavia to end and for the Greek government to stop providing
facilities to NATO.

Schroeder stressed in the statement the demands of what he

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Six Iraqi civilians were killed
on Friday in U.S. and British bombardment on some civilian and
military targets in northern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman
announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that one shepherd and five of his family
members were killed when their home was hit during the bombardment.
</P>
<P>
He said that at 14:08 (1008 GMT) 15 formations of enemy planes of
F-14, F-15, F-16 and AEC6B coming from Turkish airspace violated
northern Iraqi airspace over Erbil, Dohuk and Neineva provinces.
</P>
<P>
These enemy planes fired 20 laser-guided bombs at some civilian
facilities and military sites in this region, including a
shepherd's house, killing him and five of his family members, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The enemy planes dropped three laser-guided bombs, each
containing 1,000 pounds of explosive, on the shepherd's house,
which also led to the killing of his 250 domestic animals,
the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi anti-aircraft forces in this region fired backed and
forced the invading planes to flee to their base in Turkey
at 17:45 (1345 GMT), said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the U.S. and British warplanes have intensified
their attacks on Iraqi targets recently.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, 24 Iraqi civilians were injured in U.S. and
British bombardment on residential quarters in the north and
some civilian and military targets in the south.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, U.S. and British warplanes attacked some Iraqi
civilian facilities in the north, killing four civilians and
injuring several others.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four-night of airstrikes
against Iraq last December, their warplanes have been regularly
attacking Iraqi targets in the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leaders have repeatedly declared that Iraq does not
recognize the no-fly zones and vowed to continue confronting
any allied warplane violating its airspace.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq in
the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Condemns NATO Attacks on Central Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- NATO bombing overnight on
buildings of the Yugoslav General Staff and the ministries of
defense and interior was intended to undermine diplomatic efforts
for a political solution to the Kosovo crisis, a senior official
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"By bombing the heart of Belgrade, NATO splashed a new tide of
terror as part of its policy of intimidation," said Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Nebojsa Vujovic.
</P>
<P>
Vujovic, who is also assistant foreign minister, told a press
conference that three innocent civilians were killed in Belgrade
NATO's air raids and 24 were seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
Three bombs dropped in an residential area in Vraca, destroying
two families' houses and damaged a large apartment complex nearby,
Vujovic said.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO, by intimidating the civilian population, was
trying to cause cracks in the unity of the nation.
</P>
<P>
"There are no cracks in the unity of this nation," the
spokesman said. "There is a united front, which is pursing two
strategic goals in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. First, to
defend the country from aggression, and second, to energetically
pursue the political process."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the bombing raid, which happened at the
dusk of the arrival of Russian special envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin,
was also an attack on the seven-point plan laid out previously in
joint statements.
</P>
<P>
Vujovic said Belgrade remains committed the plan which includes
the following principles:
</P>
<P>
-- to find a political solution to the Kosovo issue based on
the respect of territorial integrity and sovereignty of
Yugoslavia;
</P>
<P>
-- to provide humanitarian assistance and facilitate the
speedily return of refugees in cooperation with the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of
the Red Cross;
</P>
<P>
-- Kosovo, the Republic of Serbia and Yugoslavia should get
economic assistance in the reconstruction of the region;
</P>
<P>
-- An international presence in Kosovo under the auspices of
the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
On security presence in the Kosovo province, the spokesman said
that Belgrade can talk about adjusting this presence in accordance
with a peace-time environment.
</P>
<P>
"But this requires an immediate withdrawal of NATO offensive
forces located and strengthened on the borders with Albania and
Macedonia," Vujovic said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that ration will prevail and that aggression cease
immediately," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, the Tanjug news agency, in a terse
report, said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic met with
Chernomyrdin Friday and they held talks on "checking NATO
aggression and pursuit of a political solution to the Kosovo
crisis."

on encouraging and protecting investments in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also stipulates the two countries will promote
cooperation in the economic and trade fields, especially after
Lisbon assumes the rotating presidency of the European Union
in January, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 2000, Portugal will cooperate with the

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos Friday met with visiting Minister of Economy and Petroleum
Victor Mpoyo of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on
bilateral cooperations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place at a time when rumors said there are
discrepancy between dos Santos and DRC President Laurent Kabila.
Some independent newspapers here claimed that dos Santos expressed
his dissatisfaction over Kabila's intention to negotiate with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Mpoyo told the press after the meeting that he had conveyed
Kabila's " cordial regards" to the Angolan president."
</P>
<P>
The relation between the two presidents are "close and stable",
with no need for any go-between to "communicate", he said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have enjoyed political and economic relations
in the past, and now such cooperation "is much closer", the
minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident of future cooperation," said the minister.
However, he did not emphasize bilateral military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Angolan president insists in resolving domestic rebellion
military means.
</P>
<P>
Since the armed uprising erupted in the DRC in August last year,
Angola had sent troops along with Zimbabwe, Chad and Namibia to
prop up the Kabila government.
</P>
<P>
On April 8, Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia and the DRC signed a
defense agreement. But reports said dos Santos was quite annoyed
by the fact that Kabila signed the peace deal with Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni without notifying him before hand.

<HEADLINE> Cease-Fire Reached in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 30 (Xinhua) -- An unofficial cease-fire has
been reached by members representing three Islamic courts of south
Mogadishu and the militiamen loyal to faction leader Mohamed
Qanyareh Afrah.
</P>
<P>
The development was made Thursday night when serious talks took
place between the two sides and a 13-member committee was
established for the implementation of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Although sporadic gunfire was heard early Friday morning in
parts of the capital city, the people who worried that the two-day
fighting could degenerate into a clannish one have somehow felt a
bit relieved.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire committee persuaded the two sides to stop the
fighting near the largest business center of Bakara market, which
had killed at least 22 people and wounded 40 others, so as to give
a chance to the mediation role.
</P>
<P>
The mediation is still going on with both the Islamic courts
and the joint businessmen on the modalities and ways of ending the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The hot issues include the future control of the Bakara
junction which the three Islamic courts have seized Thursday
afternoon after Afrah's militiamen were pushed back.
</P>
<P>
Should the discussions Friday afternoon succeed, the current
temporary cease-fire will be officiated and the Islamic courts
will be licensed in handling the overall security responsibility
in Bakara market area.
</P>
<P>
Osman Ali Atto, another faction leader who is now in Mogadishu,
has called upon the warring parties to discuss how to stop their
hostility.
</P>
<P>
Atto, a hard-line opposition leader to the Banadir
administration of Afrah and the Islamic courts as well, said that
if necessary, his faction is ready to contribute to the peace
efforts either politically or militarily.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Friday that the Egyptian-French initiative aimed at
salvaging the Mideast peace process is still "on the table."
</P>
<P>
Egypt and France proposed last May that an international
conference be convened to seek ways of advancing the peace process
stalled due to the intransigent policy of Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"Matters will become clear in a few weeks," Moussa told
reporters, implying that Egypt and France would wait for the
results of Israel's general elections on May 17.
</P>

"Coordination will continue between Egypt and France in this
regard," he said, adding that he would soon discuss, among other
things, the issue with his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
The French official is scheduled to arrive in Cairo on
Saturday, accompanying Prime Minister Lionel Jospin for a two-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
Moussa denied that the objection of the United States has
forced the freeze of the initiative, saying that "both Cairo and
Paris thought it was logical to make room for" the U.S.-brokered
Wye peace accord.
</P>
<P>
"What matters is the immediate implementation of the Wye accord
by the next Israeli government after the elections," Moussa
underlined.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel signed the peace agreement last
October in Washington, under which Israel should have withdrawn
from another 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January.
</P>
<P>
But Israel suspended the deal in early December after finishing
the first phase of withdrawal, citing non-compliance from the
Palestinian side.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Ready for Int'l Land Mine Meeting: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao
said Friday that Mozambique is now all ready for the international
conference on land mines to be convened in Maputo next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here in the Mozambican capital,
the foreign minister said at least 750 representatives from 72
countries and the international organizations are scheduled to
attend the the meeting and these nations have signed on the Ottawa
convention of banning the production, exportation and use of
lethal land mines.
</P>
<P>
Simao disclosed that the conference will cost over one million
U.S. dollars but Mozambique will pay very little because it has
suffered a lot from land mines. The United Nations will provide
financial assistance for the meeting, he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some two million land mines had been
planted across Mozambique during the 16-year-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in Maputo will focus on efforts to wipe out land
mines on the earth by the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
Simao also noted that 135 countries have signed on the Ottawa
convention but only 74 including Mozambique approved the
convention.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Friday condemned the coup in Comoros, calling on all
political, military and civil society leaders in the island
country to "make every effort" for an early return to peace and
stability in the nation, a U.N. spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Manoel de Almeida e Silva, U.N. spokesman, told a press
conference "the Secretary-General condemned the coup d'etat in the
Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros, which overthrew the
constitutional government."
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General reiterates his condemnation of any
attempt to change the government of any country by force or by
other unconstitutional means," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General "calls on all political, military and
civil society leaders to make every effort to avert violence in
the country and to work for an early return to peace, stability
and constitutional order" in the Indian Ocean country, the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The army in the Comoro Islands Friday seized power in a
bloodless coup to try to end a drive for independence on two of
the country's three islands, reports said.
</P>
<P>
An army spokesman said the army had toppled the government of
President Tadjiddine Ben Said Massonde to preserve national unity.
</P>
<P>
The military takeover followed an agreement last weekend by
Tadjiddine's government to grant greater autonomy to the two
smaller islands of Anjouan and Moheli, which declared their
secession form the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros in
August 1997.
</P>
<P>
The agreement sparked three days of violent protests from
opposition politicians and youths on the main Grande Comore island
this week and Tadjiddine took steps to restore order on the
streets of the capital Moroni, said the reports.

<HEADLINE> Ozone Layer Destroyed Faster Than Predicted: Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A plunge in temperature in the
Earth's higher atmosphere is causing the ozone layer to vanish at
twice the predicted speed, reported the latest issue of New
Scientist magazine.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have found that cooling in stratosphere, which is
immediately above the troposphere, the lowest layer of the
atmosphere, has been greater than predicted for the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
The stratosphere extends from around 15 kilometers to about 50
kilometers above the Earth's surface and contains the layer of
ozone that protects people from the worst of the Sun's ultraviolet
rays.
</P>
<P>
Because ozone depletion occurs faster at lower temperatures,
scientists warned that cooling in the stratosphere could
accelerate ozone destruction and yield and Arctic ozone hole as
severe as the one over the Antarctic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they also found that the mesosphere, lies above the
stratosphere and between 50 and 90 kilometers up the Earth, has
been cooling by as much as a degree every year for the past 30
years, a speed ten times faster than anyone had predicted.
</P>
<P>
The cooling of the mesosphere may be a climate warning, Gary
Thomas, from the University of Colorado in Boulder, the United
States, told New Scientist.
</P>
<P>
He believed that it is the "biggest and most unequivocal sign
that the world's climate really is changing."
</P>
<P>
The cooling phenomenon in the Earth's upper atmosphere is being
blamed on the worldwide increase in greenhouse gases, usually
associated with global warming.
</P>
<P>
As greenhouse gases accumulate in the lowest layer of the
atmosphere, they absorb heat radiated from the Earth that would
otherwise escape, therefore result in cooling rather than warming
of the upper atmosphere.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Removes All References to Capital Punishment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Nepal has removed references to
capital punishment in all law books, a reliable government source
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was announced Thursday that King Birendra had amended the
Succession to the Throne Act 1987 and given assent to the bill
designed to amend some Nepal acts concerning the Punishment Bill
1998.
</P>
<P>
The source said references to capital punishment are removed
now.
</P>
<P>
Under Article 12 of the constitution promulgated in 1990, no
law shall be made which provides for capital punishment. The
constitution, however, did not mention laws adopted before 1990.
</P>
<P>
Before 1990, some offenses including those against the royal
family members carried capital punishment in the Himalayan
kingdom. In 1978, two people were executed for attempting to harm
the king.
</P>
<P>
King had absolute power in Nepal in the partyless Panchayat
period from December 1962 to April 1990.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1990 constitution, Nepal is a constitutional
monarchical kingdom.

<HEADLINE> SADC Projects 1.92M Tons Maize Shortfall This </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) is projected to have a maize shortfall of 1.92
million tons for the 1999/2000 marketing season, the regional food
security body said here friday.
</P>
<P>
The SADC Regional Early Warning Unit said in its monthly update
that harvests for the staple crop in 1999 were forecast to decline
by 13 percent to 14.75 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"Incessant rains in southern SADC dampen production prospects
while prolonged dry spells depress yields in some parts," the unit
said.
</P>
<P>
The National Crop Estimates Committee of South Africa has
estimated that the harvest for South Africa would be reduced by 15
percent to 6.39 million tons although their would still be a 1.28
million exportable surplus.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland, forecasted to produce 108,000 tons of maize, would
have a surplus of 18,000 tons while Mozambique, where production
increased by six percent this year, might have a domestic maize
surplus of up to 217,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Malawi is also expected to have a maize surplus of 361,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
Among the countries projected to have shortages during
1999/2000 marketing season were Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Zambia had forecasted a one million ton maize harvest this
year, which was 55 percent higher than last year, but a deficit of
216,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has already estimated a maize output of 1.54 million
tons which suggest a projected domestic maize deficit of 1.05
million tons for the 1999/2000 marketing year to be covered by
imports.
</P>
<P>
In Angola, cereal harvest declined by 30 percent as a result of
the intensification of the civil war between government forces and
Unita rebels since December, last year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Grows at 4.5 Percent in the First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30(Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy grew at a
rapid 4.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter of this year
because of the strong consumer demand and tight labor markets,
according to the Commerce Department's report on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Department said that the strong growth in the gross
domestic product(GDP), the total output of goods and services,
underscored the U.S. economy has managed to prosper despite the
nation's trade deficit, hit by global economic turmoil, rose to a
record level from January through March, subtracting 2.4
percentage points from overall growth.
</P>
<P>
The loss of overseas markets has been offset by the strong
consumer spending, which soared at a 6.7 percent rate in the first
three months of the year, the biggest increase since a 7.2
percent rise in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the strong spending has been bolstered by the lowest
unemployment in 29 years, a soaring stock market and record highs
for consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
The GDP report showed that U.S. is enjoying the best
combination of strong growth, low unemployment and low inflation
in three decades.
</P>
<P>
The report said since consumers are so confident, the personal
savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable income,
dropped to a negative number of minus 0.5 percent in the first
quarter, an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
Inflation remained at an annual rate of just 1 percent,
compared with 0.9 in the fourth quarter of 1998, despite the
strong consumer demand and tight job markets.
</P>
<P>
Also, the falling import prices, including dropping petroleum
prices last year, have played a major role in keeping the
inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
Business investment was strong as well, rising by 10 percent
with heavy investment in computers continuing, a gain in that
category of 10.5 percent, the report said. Housing construction,
which has been propelled by low mortgage rates and low
unemployment, rose 15.6 percent, the fastest increase in a year.
</P>
<P>
In commenting on Friday's GDP report, President Clinton said
"driven by high investment and vigorous consumer demand, America's
economic expansion continues to grow steady and strong," though
the administration was disappointed this week in the nation's
trade deficit.

<HEADLINE> Africa Records 3.3% GDP Growth in 1998: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Economic Commission
for Africa (ECA) said Friday that in 1998 Africa enjoyed its
fourth consecutive year of positive gross domestic product (GDP)
growth at 3.3 percent, despite global financial and currency
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
ECA Executive Secretary K.Y. Amoako told the 19th Meeting of
the Technical Preparatory Committee of the Whole and 7th
Intergovernmental Group of Experts here that the growth rate is
not high enough, nor sufficiently broad-based, or sustained long
enough, to make a real dent in poverty.
</P>
<P>
""This favorable outcome cannot be assumed to mean that the
average African economy has crossed the critical threshold to a
self-sustainable, poverty-reducing growth path," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Amoako said that on the eve of a new millennium, Africa faces
several challenges, key among which are poverty reduction and
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that African heads of state and government have
endorsed the U.N. target of reducing poverty by half by the year
2015, saying that "this implies a reduction of poverty by four
percent per annum."
</P>
<P>
"In order to meet these targets, Africa would need to raise its
GDP growth rates to an average of seven percent per annum for the
region as a whole, compared to an average of 4.5 percent annually
during 1995-98," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official urged African countries to step up their
effort to mobilize domestic resources for sustainable development
and poverty reduction, through policies to raise savings,
including tax reforms, financial and capital market reforms, and
sound interest rate policy management.
</P>
<P>
In his statement at the opening of the meeting, Mekonnen
Manyazewal, Ethiopian Vice-Minister of Economic Development and
Cooperation, said that in contrast to the 1980s and early 1990s
Africa has seen an improvement in a number of indicators.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1995, GDP in real terms grew by 4.5 percent between 1995
and 1997 -- registering positive per capita GDP growth," Mekonnen
said. "Export growth doubled, from an annual average of about four
percent between 1990- 1994 to about eight percent between 1995 and
1997."
</P>
<P>
Referring to Africa's financing problem, the Ethiopian
vice-minister said that African countries have lower savings, 17.6
percent of GDP in 1997, compared to 24 percent for all developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The five-day preparatory meeting will prepare an agenda for
action for the forthcoming Joint Conference of African Ministers
of Finance and Ministers of Economic Development and Planning to
be convened in Addis Ababa on May 6-8, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the conference is "the challenge of financing
development in Africa".

The WFP office in Addis Ababa said that pregnant women, nursing
mothers, and children under five years of age who are particularly
vulnerable to nutritional problems during such times of crisis,
will be provided with specially blended foods that are high in
protein content to help them recover.
</P>
<P>
Head of WFP's relief unit in Ethiopia Rebecca hansen was quoted
by the press release as saying that "We're going to try and give a
complete food package to everyone."
</P>
<P>
He said, "we know that the nutritional status of many people in
the Tigray region has deteriorated over the past few months and we
want to help restore their health as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
"The operation will continue until the end of december 1999, by
which time it is hoped that most people will have returned to
their original homes and resumed agricultural activities," the
press release said.

NICOSIA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The 28 crew of a Maltese-flagged
commercial ship, which caught fire Thursday off the western coast
of Cyprus, were safely evacuated Friday morning, Cypriot marine
police said.
</P>
<P>
The 17,944-gross ton Evxentios Pontos is still burning, the
police added.

The coast guard remained by the burning vessel after the crew,
nine Greeks and 19 Filipinos, abandoned it.
</P>
<P>
Police said the ship had issued a Mayday signal after catching
fire.
</P>
<P>
The fire was out by the time the coast guard arrived Friday
morning to arrange the evacuation of the crew and tow the
vessel. But police said that the ship was in flames again later.
</P>
<P>
The ship, which is managed by the Aegean Shipping Management of
Piraeus of Greece, was on its way to Piraeus from Lebanon, where

<HEADLINE> Arab League Welcomes Palestinians' Decision on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League Friday welcomed
Palestinians' decision on postponing declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the league secretariat, Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid lauded the unison of the Palestinian
people and the unanimity of the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) Central Council.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League "firmly supports" any option the Palestinian
leadership picks up regarding the statehood and "has full
confidence" in the wisdom of the Palestinian people and
leadership, Abdel-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Central Council voted Thursday to delay a
decision on the declaration of statehood until after the May 17
Israeli general elections.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had hinted repeatedly that he
would declare the Palestinian state on May 4 when the five-year
interim period under the Oslo Accord signed with Israel in 1993
expires.
</P>
<P>
But many countries that Arafat visited recently advised him to
put off declaration of statehood to avoid giving Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fodder in the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid expressed confidence that the Palestinian people
will achieve their objectives, including ending the Israeli
occupation and establishing the future state with East Jerusalem
as its capital.

PARIS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The international humanitarian
group Medecins du Monde (MDM) condemned on Friday the oil embargo
imposed by the European Union (EU) on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
``MDM has been since the beginning of the crisis in the Balkans
by the side of the civilian population...in its permanent will to
protect the civilian population,'' said the group in a published
communique.
</P>
<P>
Eight delegations of the group from Argentina, Cyprus, Spain,
France, Greece, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland ``denounce once
again any policy of embargo which, far from attaining the
announced objectives, touch directly the civilian population by
aggravating their situation of precariousness and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
EU decided to apply from Friday an oil embargo against
Yugoslavia, assumedly to deprive its army of oil supply.

<HEADLINE> Chad to Pull Troops Out of Congo: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Chad has decided to retreat its
troops from Congo (K) backing the Laurent Kabila government
following a regional accord brokered by Libya, a Chadian minister
said in Abidjan Friday.
</P>
<P>
Details of the withdrawal of the estimated 1,000 troops would
be decided with the government of Kabila, a report reaching here
from the Cote d'Ivoire capital quoted Chad Information Minister
Moussa Dago as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The withdrawal will be done according to modalities that will
be decided with The Democratic Republic of Congo, and that will no
doubt take some time," Moussa told Radio France Internationale.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed in the Libyan city of Sirte earlier this
month. The signatories were Kabila, and the presidents of Chad,
Uganda and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have troops in Congo backing rebels battling
Kabila's government since last August, while troops from Angola,
Chad, Namibia and Zimbabwe are fighting on the side of Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea and Libya agreed under the accord to send military
observers to Congo to take over from foreign troops involved in
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda, which backs the rebels in the conflict, did not sign
the Sirte deal and its officials have since dismissed it as of
little significance.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan officials have also played down the accord, but Moussa
said he believed the Ugandans would honor their engagement.

<HEADLINE> Commodity Prices Up By 150% in Zimbabwe Over 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A research by the Consumer Council
of Zimbabwe revealed Friday that the prices of commodities have
gone up by 150 percent over the past three months.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the council, Elizabeth Nerwande said in a
 statement that consumers now required 5,400 Zimbabwean dollars
(142 U.S. dollars) per month to cater for an average family of six
people.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency Friday quoted Nerwande as saying that
this made it necessary for consumers to change their consumption
patterns if they were to survive.
</P>
<P>
"Times are so hard we need to sharpen our budgeting skills and
assume responsible roles," she said.
</P>
<P>
The price increases were not justified, as some companies were
profiteering by taking advantage of the lack of legal mechanism to
deal with the issue, she added.
</P>
<P>
However, the Zimbabwean government recently announced that it
would revert to price controls if manufacturers continued to hike
prices.
</P>
<P>
Nerwande said the interest rates were so high that indigenous
businesses could not borrow from banks.
</P>
<P>
Most banks hiked interest rates in February this year from 39
percent to 45 percent and there were speculations they could hike
them again in response to rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
The year on year inflation for March stands at 52.8 percent
with economic analysts forecasting that the levels might rise to
60 percent due to continuing inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
Nerwande said there was need to carry out a national study on
production costs to see if they justified price increases.
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturers are coming up with high production costs as
justification for price hikes. Some of these production costs are
on personal benefits," she said.

<HEADLINE> Vivendi, Filter Merger Wins EU Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s
executive branch, the European commission, said here Friday that
it has approved the proposed acquisition by France's Vivendi of
the United States' US Filter.
</P>
<P>
The parties activities only overlap in Western Europe in the
design, engineering and provision of water and waste-water
treatment systems, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
Although the operation will lead to further concentration in
this sector, the merger will not create a dominant position given
the strength of existing competitors on the market under the EU
competition regulation, according to the EU executive.
</P>
<P>
The Vivendi (France) has acquired control of the whole of US
Filter by way of public bid. Vivendi is mainly active in the
building industry, real estate, telecommunications and media as
well as environmental activities. It is particularly involved in
the supply and distribution of network drinking water and in the
operation of waste water management.
</P>
<P>
US Filter provides on a worldwide basis industrial, municipal
and consumer water and waste treatment systems and services. In
adition, US Filter manufactures and supplies sophisticated process
piping systems for the delivery of high purity fluids, chemicals,
gases and water; equipment for preparation of many types of
product surfaces and finally, filtration and separation equipment.
</P>
<P>
The combined market shares of the parties will be below 15
percent for the total market for water and waste water treatment
systems, the commission's investigation shows.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Europe's big markets closed higher
Friday thanks to strong U.S. economic growth and another record
breaking start on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The markets experienced temporary tremors after the release of
stronger-than-expected U.S. GDP growth data, showing a 4.5 percent
rise in output. But the overall pattern the rest of the day was
one of rebound.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 climbed 54 points to end at 6,552.2, a rise
of 0.84 percent, on a day when traders drew initial inspiration
from what they see as the Dow Jones industrial average's
inexorable march to 11,000.
</P>
<P>
The index finished the week 124 points higher than it started,
and just 47 points shy of its closing record of 6,598.8, set
Wednesday. It was up 1.2 percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas stocks supported the FTSE's gains. BP Amoco rose
0.90 percent to 1,182 pence, while Shell added 1.03 percent to
470.5 pence.
</P>
<P>
Leading German shares Xetra Dax closed up 37.38 at 5,360.44
having moved in a range of 5,311.25-5,403.26 on the session.
</P>
<P>
Chemicals stocks were in the limelight again. Hoechst closed
2.15 euros higher at 44.65 euros on an upgrade from Banque
Nationale de Paris.
</P>
<P>
Leading French shares pushed to a new closing high on the day.
The Cac 40 index of leading shares rose above the 4,400 level for
the first time. The index put on 0.77 percent to end at 4,405.35
points.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Paper Criticizes NATO's Bombing on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A leading U.S. newspaper
Friday criticized the bombing of Yugoslavia by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), saying that the action is subject to
jurisdiction of the International Court.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, The Washington Times said that "there is no
legal basis" for the air campaign, which started on March 24.
</P>
<P>
"Neither the United States nor its NATO allies have been
attacked. Our national interests are not at stake. Congress has
not declared war," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, the U.S. attacked Serbia with bombs and cruise
missiles, targeting both civilian and military sites and killing
both military and civilian personnel. However we cut it, our
action constitutes aggression," it said.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's destruction of the passenger train and the deaths of 64
Kosovo refugees... could qualify as accidents rather than the
intentional endangerment, but the conscious targeting of the
television station in Belgrade, which knowingly caused civilian
deaths, is a crime subject to the jurisdiction of the
International Court," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
"National sovereignty might seem an old-fashioned idea, but
it remains the only basis for international order. Actions that
infringe upon sovereignty undermine world order.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the military outcome in Serbia, the Clinton
administration has foolishly created a precedent that erodes the
protection afforded us by sovereignty," the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Vows to Find Peace for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. official
Friday said that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who returned
Friday from a trip to Germany and Russia, is determined to seek a
diplomatic solution to the crisis of Kosovo, a Serbian province,
despite some problems which need further discussion.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official, who declined to be identified, told a press
briefing here that Annan and Russian leaders "are determined to
make every effort" to find a diplomatic solution to the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"But, clearly, certain issues still remain, and which have come
out during the Secretary-General's talks" with both German and
Russian leaders, said the U.N. official, who was with the
Secretary-General on his just-concluded visit to Germany and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
"One of them is the withdrawal of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia's armed personnel from the province of Kosovo," he
said. "The question is what personnel exactly will be withdrawn
and how much of it will be withdrawn."
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO, which is staging air strikes on Yugoslavia,
insists all military forces, including military police and
paramilitary forces withdraw from Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians
make up some 90 percent of the province's population of 2 million.
</P>
<P>
"This is clearly an area that still needs considerable
discussion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also discussed in the talks between the Secretary-General and
German and Russian leaders are the deployment of international
military forces.
</P>
<P>
It is widely known Belgrade rejects the deployment of
international troops in Kosovo, otherwise it will be seen as an
aggression of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Annan is currently engaged in what he said "a flurry of
diplomatic activity" to seek a political settlement to the Kosovo
crisis, but the U.N. chief has said that "no quick solution is
expected."
</P>
<P>
"An interim arrangement should be established in Kosovo between
the cessation of violence and the initiation of negotiations for a
long-term solution," said the senior U.N. official, who declined
to give any further details on the long-term plan.
</P>
<P>
The interim arrangement should be a mixed presence in the
authorities for Kosovo, he said, and "this not only should be
lawful, but should provide a kind of security (for all residents
in the province) and encourage the safe return of all those who
left their home in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"This is a difficult issue, there have been a number of views
stated" over the past weeks, he said, adding that "this is also a
big challenge."
</P>
<P>
NATO, without the authorization of the U.N. Security Council,
launched air strikes on Yugoslavia, a sovereign and independent
country, on March 24, violating the U.N. Charter and international
law.

WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military launched a
Titan 4B rocket Friday carrying one of its most sophisticated and
costly satellites, an apparently successful launch following two
costly failures.
</P>
<P>
The 20-story rocket lifted off from its Cape Canaveral launch
pad in Florida State with the 4,540-kilogram Milstar
communications satellite nestled in its giant nose cone.
</P>
<P>
After two consecutive rocket failures that cost more than 1.7
billion U.S. dollars, the U.S. Air Force hoped for success with
Friday's 1.2-billion-U.S.-dollar mission.
</P>
<P>
Last August, a Titan 4A rocket exploded less than a minute into
flight and on April 9, a 250 million-U.S.-dollar missile warning
satellite was stranded in the wrong orbit because of problems with
an upper-stage booster.
</P>
<P>
The rocket which was launched Friday carried an 800 million
U.S. dollars Milstar satellite for the Defense Department. It was
bound for a 360,000-kilometer-high orbit where the first Milstar
was placed in 1994 and the second in 1995. In all, six Milstars
are planned. The satellites are designed to provide secure,
jam-proof communication between U.S. commanders and troops in the
field.
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials said once the newest Milstar reached orbit,
they would be unable to release any information if something goes
wrong until a security review is conducted.
</P>
<P>
The military is less worried about nuclear war and more worried
about conflicts like the one in Yugoslavia, said Mike Kelly, an
Air Force deputy commander. But he said the satellites are still
useful. They have carried targeting information for cruise
missiles, for instance, Kelly noted.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Belgrade's New Peace Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States Friday
rejected a new peace proposal by Yugoslavia for resolving the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told a press
conference that she did not believe any of Belgrade's proposals
for ending the Kosovo conflict so far were serious.
</P>
<P>
In Belgrade, during talks between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and Russia's Balkans envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, the two
sides had agreed on a seven-point peace plan, a Yugoslav Foreign
Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The key element was that only unarmed observers under U.N.
auspices would be allowed into Kosovo -- not the tough
peacekeeping force demanded by NATO, with Western troops making up
the core of the deployment.
</P>
<P>
However, Albright rejected the proposal, saying, "I think we
are not anywhere near a serious proposal."
</P>
<P>
"It is my sense from some of the statements emanating from
Belgrade and some of the theoretical plans that they have
presented, I think that we are not anywhere near a serious
proposal," Albright said.

LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and more
than 70 injured in a bomb blast at a gay bar in Soho, central
London on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry, head of the
anti-terrorist branch, said he was linking the explosion with the
two other "cowardly attacks" in Brixton and Brick Lane.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw said: "This is a terrible outrage
committed by people with no humanity. I know that the police are
devoting huge efforts to find the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
Twenty one ambulances were called up, and the injured were
taken to University College, Guys and St Thomas' Hospitals.
</P>
<P>
One block away from the blast scene, in Soho Square, ambulance
crews and paramedics set up an emergency field hospital.
</P>
<P>
It was the third bomb attack in London in the past fortnight.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday's blast in Brick Lane, which injured six people,
was at the heart of the Bangladeshi community in London.
</P>
<P>
Thirty nine people were hurt the previous weekend in Brixton,
which has a large black community.
</P>
<P>
Several far-rightwing groups have claimed they were responsible

<HEADLINE> Romania to Get Loan, Non-Repayable Funds From EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union could allot
to Romania about 200 million euros (211.9 million U.S. dollars) to
help it adjust and stabilize its macro-economy, the national
Rompres news agency Friday cited governmental sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of the European Commission is expected to arrive
in Bucharest after mid-May in order to set up details of the
macro-financial assistance program.
</P>
<P>
Initially, EU officials had tied the loan to Romania's signing
accords with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
and therefore deferred its disbursement after September this year.
However, taking into account the fact that Romania has to face two
peaks in external debt service in June and September, the EU may
grant the money in three monthly tranches, starting in July.
</P>
<P>
This has been recently confirmed by Romania's Minister of
Finance Decebal Traian Remes, who specified that the EU loan might
be granted to Romania in July, as soon as the WB and IMF boards
gave an okay to accords with Romania's government.
</P>
<P>
Besides the 200 million-euro loan, Romania is to receive a
non-repayable financial aid worth 200 million euros as well, the
sources said.

NEW YORK, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
fell Friday in renewed fears of higher interest rates from a
government report on strong economic growth in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed at 10,789.04, down 89.34 from a strong rally in

at a 4.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter of this year
</P>
<P>
The report sparked fears among investors that the strength of
the economy would prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest
rates to cool off the economy. The 30-year Treasury bond yields
soared to 5.66 percent from 5.52 percent Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Summon Youth Violence Summit on May 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
decided Friday to hold a White House summit on youth violence on
May 10.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that he would invite representatives from the
movie industry and the Internet, the gun industry, government and
religious leaders, and police force leaders to debate ways to
avoid youth violence like the Colorado school massacre.
</P>
<P>
"As we have united in grief, now we should unite in action," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"If citizens, parents and children alike, working together in
their communities, can reduce teen pregnancy, reduce drunk
driving, make seat belt use nearly universal, then working
together we can protect our children," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
As many as 15 people died in the campus shooting in Colorado
State on April 20.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy has shocked the whole nation and triggered a heated
debate on the gun control issue. American people blamed the youth
violence mainly on easy access to weapons, violent cultures such
as movies, TV programs and computer games.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the tragedy, the Clinton administration launched a
campaign to restrict the sale of guns and explosives to juveniles.
</P>
<P>
The democrats are working hard to push the gun control
legislation in the Congress.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Oil Reserves Surpass 1 Billion Barrels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The oil reserves explored in
Hegleg, central Sudan, is expected to reach 1.2 billion barrels by
the end of this year from the current 650 million barrels, a
senior Sudanese official has said.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary of the Energy and Mining Ministry Ali Ahmed
Othman told the General Congress of the Sudanese National Union of
Youth on Thursday that the recently discovered reserves were
proven 60 percent successful, which is the highest percentage in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Othman also said Sudanese oil was heavy crude, 98 to 99 percent
of which were Hydrocarbonic elements and less than 1.1 percent
were sulphur, thus its damage on machines and environment was very
limited. He predicted a promising market for the oil.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese firms will yield 70 to 80 percent of the total oil
production in the coming five years from the current 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has started cooperation with China, Malaysia and Canada
in oil exploration in Hegleg since early 1997. So far some 100
wells were drilled with a total production capacity of 7 million
tons annually.
</P>
<P>
The construction of oil pipelines between Hegleg oilfields and
Bashaer port and Port Sudan are being finalized.
</P>
<P>
President Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir said last year that Sudan
would export oil by the end of June on the occasion of the 10th
anniversary of the Sudanese National Salvation Revolution which
brought the current government to power.

<HEADLINE> Mail bomb Injures 40 in Gay Pub in Central London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- At least 40 people were injured,
three seriously, in a bomb blast at a gay bar in Soho, central
London.
</P>
<P>
It rocked the Admiral Duncan pub in Old Compton Street, at 1837
local time (1737 GMT), police and witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Around 20 ambulances were at the scene and there were reports
of people covered in blood lying motionless in the street. The
injured were taken to Guys and St Thomas' Hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The blast followed two other mail bomb blasts in London in the past
fortnight. Six people were hurt last Saturday in Brick Lane, the
heart of Bangladeshi community, and 39 the previous weekend in
Brixton with a large black community.
</P>
<P>
Several far-rightwing groups have claimed they were responsible
for those two blasts.
</P>
<P>
The Pink Paper, a gay newspaper, this week warned readers to be
on their guard against possible attacks.
</P>
<P>
Roger Goode, spokesman for the Soho gay association Stonewall,
said the pub was an exclusively gay establishment and there was no
question who the intended victims were.
</P>
<P>
"The Admiral Duncan is a small place that would have been very
crowded after work on a Friday afternoon. If the (bomb) package
wasn't detected with all those people inside, I'm surprised if no
one was killed," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Targets EU, Canada in Trade Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) - The Clinton administration
announced on Friday it would launch seven trade actions against
the European Union (EU), India, Argentina, South Korea and Canada
for alleged violations of international trade rules.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Charlene Barshefsky said the
government would bring the seven new cases before the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in Geneva ranging from EU aviation practices to
Indian barriers affecting U.S. automakers.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky also announced the initiation of an investigation
under section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 regarding Canadian
government measures, which the United States says hurts American
hotel and other businesses on the border with its northern
neighbour.
</P>
<P>
"Today's initiation of Section 301 and WTO enforcement actions
underscores the determination of the United States to ensure that
it receives the full benefit of its Uruguay Round agreement,"
Barshefsky said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the USTR, the United States will request WTO
consultations with the EU regarding subsidies granted by France
for the development of a new flight management system adapted to
Airbus aircraft. The USTR said the specific purpose of the system
was to displace U.S. products.
</P>
<P>
The government will also request WTO consultations with the EU
regarding its regulation governing the protection of geographical
indications for agricultural products and foodstuffs, which the
United States said violates EU obligations under the WTO Agreement
on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights.
</P>
<P>
USTR's two cases against South Korea involve government
procurement in airport construction as well as its beef import and
distribution system.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration would also request WTO consultations
with India over auto trade and with Argentina and Canada over
patent protection.
</P>
<P>
The actions were taken under U.S. laws under which the United
States identifies trade practices by other countries it accuses of
thwarting U.S. commerce, the USTR said.

The incident took place between 3 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. Iraqi time

WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military launched a
Titan 4B rocket Friday carrying one of its most sophisticated and

costly failures.

After two consecutive rocket failures that cost more than 1.7

Last August, a Titan 4A rocket exploded less than a minute into

<HEADLINE> hke050155- S.Lanka Must Control Fiscal Deficit to Ensure Growth: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Central Bank Saturday
urged the government to take immediate steps to control a
ballooning fiscal deficit to ensure sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report for 1998 released on Saturday, the bank
said the fiscal deficit rose sharply to 9.2 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP), due to the higher cost of the war with
Tamil rebels and lower tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
Government troops have been fighting Tamil rebels who demand a
separate homeland in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983. The
ongoing war is a huge financial burden on the government.
</P>
<P>
The goods and services tax (GST), introduced in April last
year, had been set below the "optimal rate." The bank was also
critical of general tax exemptions which eroded revenue
collection.
</P>
<P>
"The large widening of the fiscal deficit in 1998 was somewhat
disturbing," the bank said in a 30-page report, adding that if not
controlled soon it might lead to galloping inflation.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier aimed to lower the deficit to 6.5
percent of GDP in 1998. The deficit was 7.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgent need to bring the fiscal deficit reduction
program back on track to protect balance of payments viability,
avoid rekindling of inflation, reduce pressure on the exchange
rate and avoid an erosion of private sector confidence in the
government's economic policies," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report also said Sri Lanka's GDP expanded by a provisional
4.7 percent in 1998 against a rise of 6.3 percent in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the deficit had made it difficult to relax the
monetary policy, adding that high inflation and high interest
rates would slow down economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
It said measures should be put into place to reduce the deficit
to around 7.5 percent of GDP in 1999 so that further consolidation
could be targeted for 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippines President Joseph Estrada
unwrapped Saturday a package of non-wage benefits, including a
500- million peso (about 12.5 million U.S. dollars) loan
assistance program for small entrepreneurs, as part of his
commitment to protecting the rights of workers.
</P>
<P>
Another main benefit is the allocation of 25,000 unoccupied
government-owned housing units to workers in the government and

Estrada also ordered concerned government agencies to implement
a series of initiatives to support the labor sector.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Cities all across China held
activities today to celebrate International Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, more than 20,000 people joined 4,000

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns U.S. for Accusation Over Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran Saturday condemned a recent
U.S. report on Tehran's support for international terrorism,
while accusing Washington of being the main supporter of state
terrorism in the world.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi dismissed the
U.S. report as "baseless" and an indication of the U.S. double
standard policy, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department said in a report Friday that Iran was
among countries which persisted in their direct and indirect state
sponsorship for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable that the U.S. government, which is itself
one of the main supporters of terrorist groups and state
terrorism, such as the Israeli regime, levels such baseless
accusations against the Islamic Republic of Iran," Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. administration "to correct its double
standard policy before accusing others of supporting terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Terming Iran as one of the biggest victims of terrorism in the
world, Asefi noted that Tehran condemns terrorism on the basis of
human and Islamic value and calls for all-out efforts of the
international communities to deal with the evil phenomenon of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, Iran has been on the U.S. black list of
countries supporting terrorism after the two countries severed
their diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has repeatedly denied its support for terrorism and
blamed Washington for supporting its opposition groups and arming
the Israeli government against Arab and Islamic states.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Mock Glacier at Horti-Expo Lures Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Although Switzerland is not so
renowned for its horticulture, its garden with a mock glacier has
become a focus of attention at the China '99 Kunming International
Horticulture Exposition.
</P>
<P>
With its unique design and clever use of water, the garden
attracted a legion of visitors in the opening day.
</P>
<P>
"Switzerland is not so good at horticulture," said Stefan
Rotzler, chief designer of the Swiss garden. "But it is a famous
tourism country with the splendor of mountainous natural scenery.
That is what I want to present to the visitors the design of the
whole garden." .
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to the neighboring French Garden which
features the classical squared lines of the formal gardens at the
Versailles palace, the Swiss garden presents a mammoth mock
glacier and a winding stream with huge buckets floating on it one
after another.
</P>
<P>
"Sitting in the buckets, the visitors can enjoy the beauty of
Switzerland and travel through the glacier," said Rotzler.
</P>
<P>
Known as a "pond in Europe", Switzerland is a convergence point
of five major rivers, namely Rona, Rhein, Danube, Po and Adige
River and therefore it has rich water resources. The towering
scenic Alps also makes the nation a world-renowned skiing paradise.
</P>
<P>
Fresh water is supplied in the country at a very low price. But
the Swiss people cherish the natural resources and new
technologies are applied to reduce water consumption by washing
machines and toilet facilities. Strict law has also been drafted
to protect the water sources, thus improving fresh water quality
greatly.

<HEADLINE> Coach Ma's Runners Crash in National Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, Shandong Province, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Legendary coach Ma
Junren's runners crashed on Saturday in the fourth stage of the
National Grand Prix series, the first national competition they
have taken part in since October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Bo, who broke the women's 5,000 meters world record in
the Eight National Games in 1997, finished a distance sixth place
in the 1,500 meters with a time of four minutes 21.70 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Her teammate Dong Yanmei, whose 5,000m time also surpassed the
world record in the National Games, wound up fifth in 4:21.70.
</P>
<P>
The top two place went to Yan Junli and Zhou Chunji, both from
Henan Province, with a time of 4:18.11 and 4:18.64, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Dong complained the absence of coach Ma for her defeat, while
Jiang refused to answer questions after the race.
</P>
<P>
"Coach Ma is no longer our coach now," Dong said. "I hope he
can train us again."
</P>
<P>
"But I still hold on to my confidence (despite the loss).
Anyway, this is not an important competition," Dong added.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon's 10,000m race, Dong placed just third, timing
33:16.85, a far cry from her winning mark of 30:38.09 in the 1997
National Games.
</P>
<P>
"We have not been normally training this year," Dong said.
</P>
<P>
"Last year before the Asian Games we had been well prepared,
but were not allowed to run in Bangkok."

JINAN, Shandong Province, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Wei broke the
women's hammer Asian record of 62.28 meters with a toss of 63.50
in the fourth stage of the National Grand Prix here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, 20, achieved the result in her final attempt, beating
Asian record holder Gu Yuan to the second.
</P>
<P>
Gu, who set the old mark in the Asian Track and Field
Championships last year in Japan, also broke her won record in the
last attempt with 62.50 meters.
</P>
<P>
"I had never expected to break the Asian record," Zhao said. "
My personal best in training was just around 61 meters."
</P>
<P>
"That's a surprise for me," her coach Ji Shaoming said. "She
turned to hammer from shot put for only one year."
</P>
<P>
Gu, who had a personal best of 65.00m, attributed her loss to a
flu sustained last week.
</P>
<P>
"Fearing there may be some possible trouble in the drug test, I
cannot take any medicine, so I have not recovered until now," Gu
said.

<HEADLINE> PNG Mercenaries Affair Settled With 25m U.S. Dollar Payout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinean (PNG) Prime
Minister Bill Skate said Saturday PNG settled a long-running legal
dispute with mercenaries Sandline International over the hire of
men and equipment to end the secessionist conflict on the
Bougainville island, which claimed about 15,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
The PNG government and Sandline announced Saturday that they
had reached a "binding agreement" to settle Sandline's claim
against the PNG government for the outstanding 18 million U.S.
dollars plus legal and other costs and interest, totaling 25
million U.S. dollars, the Australian Associated Press reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, PNG will pay Sandline 13.3 million U.S.
dollars in four installments over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The former PNG government under the then Prime Minister Julius
Chan signed a 36-million U.S. dollar contract with Sandline in
January 1997 for the supply of men and equipment to help PNG
overcome Bougainville rebels, but the mercenaries were ordered out
of the country after a revolt against their hire by PNG Defense
Force Commander Brigadier-General Jerry Singirok.
</P>
<P>
The Chan government had already paid Sandline half the money
under the contract, and the current PNG government of Skate had
until now refused to pay the balance, claiming the contract was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
But Skate said Saturday that continuing the legal battle
against Sandline to stop the payment would probably cost PNG 49
million U.S. dollars to 57 million U.S. dollars, and would also
hamper PNG's ability to raise 250 million U.S. dollars through the
country's first sovereign bond issue.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday we made a decision that we should settle this issue
(Sandline) out of court, basically because we were weighing up the
economic effect," Skate told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Sandline's commercial adviser Michael Grunberg said in a joint
statement with the PNG government Saturday: "I am pleased that we
have been able to agree to a settlement with Papua New Guinea
which is acceptable to both parties."
</P>
<P>
The 10 year-old Bougainville conflict began in 1988 with
landowner disputes over the world famous Panguna copper mine on
the island but it escalated into a war for independence from PNG
after the mine closed in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Warring factions signed a historic ceasefire agreement on
Bougainville on April 30 last year.

cleared Saturday the men's pole vault at 4.95 meters to surpass
the standing Southeast Asian (SEA) Games record as the 1999 Milo
National Open Invitational track and field championships ended at
Manila.
</P>
<P>
Obiena eclipsed the 4.90 SEA Games mark set by Fil-Am Edward
Lascuete during the 1995 Chang Mai event enroute to breaking his
personal best of 4.90 meters.
</P>
<P>
After winning the event, Obiena was given a chance to shatter
the Philippine record of five meters set by Lascuete during the
1992 Barcelona Olympic Games but he failed after two attempts.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure I can still improve performance and learn some more
techniques in taking off before the SEA Games," said Obiena, who
just recuperated from infra spinouts injury on his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
Obiena is one of the 12 athletes recommended by Philippine
Track and Field Association for a two-month training in Melbourne,
Australia through Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) as part of
their rigid preparation for the 20th SEA Games on August 7-15 in
Brunei, Darussalam.
</P>
<P>
In the final day where the athletics officials were looking for
record-breaker, it was unknown Marvin Cacho of VMU-Centrex who
became the only third record-breaker after resetting the boy's 110
hurdles.
</P>
<P>
Cacho submitted a clocking of 15.6 seconds, eclipsing the old
mark of 15.7 set by Rene Gabuat in the 1992 National Open.
</P>
<P>
The two other record-breakers after the four-day tournament
include Arnel Ferrera hammer throw and Marestella Torres in triple
jump girls and boys.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Economy Grows 1.2 percent in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong Saturday asked workers to moderate their expectation although
the country's economy grew 1.2 percent in the first quarter of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the point while speaking at the May Day
rally with participation of some 7,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
Goh said Singapore's economy grew 1.2 percent year-on-year in
the first quarter and unemployment rate eased to 3.9 percent in
March this year from 4.4 percent at the end of December last year.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed the Ministry of Trade and Industry has revised its
GDP Growth forecast from between minus one percent to plus one
percent to between zero to plus two percent.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the cost cutting measures taken last year have
worked, Goh said Singapore has done better than he expected in the
first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned Singaporeans to be cautiously optimistic about
the economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
Goh said there are continued uncertainties in the global and
regional economies, adding he has three main concerns about the
external environment.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the slowdown of the U.S. and Europe's
economic growth, Japan's lack of means to stimulate its economy
and the social and political instability in Singapore's
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prime minister said Singapore's National Trades
Union Congress (NTUC) should be put on Guinness Book because
Singapore's workforce has been rated as number one in the world
since 1980.
</P>
<P>
NTUC Secretary-General Lim Boon Heng, who doubles the Minister
without Portfolio, reported to the rally that Singapore's
workforce has been rated number one in the world by the Business
Environment Risk Information (BERI) for the 19th consecutive year
(since 1980) and created a record for the century.
</P>
<P>
Goh praised NTUC for its efforts in convincing workers to
accept cost cutting measures and help the retrenched workers learn
new skills and take on new jobs by changing their mindset and
upgrading their skills. The cost cutting measures include
reduction of bonus and Central Provident funds to be paid by
employers to employees.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tanzanian Telecom Services in Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With active participation of private firms, the east African
country has introduced mobile cellular services, value added
services such as data transmission and Internet in recent years.
</P>
<P>
What's more, Tanzania opened in March the iridium satellite
telephone service, making it the first country in Africa to
communicate with any remote corner of the globe using a mobile
wireless phone, thanks to a Motorola-led investment of 1.2 billion
U.S. dollars worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Tanzania's telecom network was characterized by
severe congestion at most exchanges and trunk routes.
</P>
<P>
The network, however, has been more than doubled to 200,000
lines following an over 200-million-U.S. dollar Telecom
Restructuring Program since 1994, with the help of foreign
investors and donors.
</P>
<P>
At present, reconstruction is finalizing. The aim has been to
raise the country's telephone density to 0.7 per 1,000 people.
Compared with North America or Europe, this is a tiny advance. But
it's a considerable improvement on the 0.3 ratio of six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Waiting time to get a line installed in urban areas, meanwhile,
has slowly dropped from several months to a matter of weeks or
even days now -- the country realized that development of
telecommunications is crucial to social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
One technology already being deployed is wireless local loop
(WILL) connections, which do away with the costly and often
difficult installation of cable connections from telephones to
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of this year, the WILL system is scheduled to be
in place in tourist destinations of Arusha and Zanzibar, as well
as Pemba, Morogoro and other selected high demand areas in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania Communications Commission (TCC) has licensed three
mobile cellular phone services and three public data communication
services, said Penina Mlama, the chairperson, at a workshop this
week in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Also licensed are four public radio paging services, about 100
local telecommunications contractors in the fields of installation
and maintenance of telecommunications and radio communication
equipment, and about 80 local companies to import and distribute
equipment, she said.
</P>
<P>
Mobitel, the first cellular phone company to penetrate the
Tanzanian market, has invested over 100 million dollars since 1994
and is still aggressively expanding services.
</P>
<P>
The entry of Tritel, another private cellular phone firm, has
boosted competition in the market which used to be dominated by
the state-owned Tanzania Telecommunications Company (TTCL).
</P>
<P>
This year, TCC said it has plans to licence more operators for
mobile cellular phone and data communication services, Internet
providers and global mobile personal communication by satellite.
</P>
<P>
To increase efficiency, Minister of Communications and
Transport Ernest Nyanda said the government wants to sell part of
shares of the TTCL to strategic investors.
</P>
<P>
TTCL managing director Adolar Mapunda said the intention is to
sell 35 percent of the company and he expects to raise at least
200 million U.S. dollars from the investors.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye has challenged
telecom companies and service providers to chart out mechanisms
through which disadvantaged groups, especially those in rural
areas where most Tanzanians reside, can have access to services.
</P>
<P>
The government goal is to attract more investments and
encourage competition in the telecom market so that service
charges could be brought down.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PM Awards Indonesia FM Peace Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen, in the name of King Norodom Sihanouk, conferred on Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas a medal of "the Grand Cross of the
Royal Order of Sahametrei" Saturday for his peacemaking efforts in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Ali Alatas, who arrived here Saturday morning for a two-day
official visit, was the first foreign leader to visit Cambodia
after it became the 10th member of the Association Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the conferring ceremony, Hun Sen highly praised Alatas for
the significant role he played in Cambodia's peace process.
</P>
<P>
Alatas was a key mediator for the country's warring factions
before and after the Paris Peace Agreement in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said that the significant role that Alatas played as
the co-chairman of the Paris Conference on Cambodia led to the
signing of the Paris Peace Agreement on Cambodia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He has, therefore, made an important contribution to the peace
process and national reconciliation in Cambodia, Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
"The medal is also a symbol of gratitude conveyed through Your
Excellency to the people and the government of Indonesia for their
support and assistance in many fields to the Kingdom of Cambodia,"
Hun Sen added.
</P>
<P>
Alatas thanked the government and people of Cambodia for this
singular honor and congratulated Cambodia on its admission as a
full member of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Indonesia, as a traditional friend of Cambodia since
ancient times, has always supported and will continue to support
the noble endeavors of the Cambodian people in national
development and reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen reaffirmed that "Cambodia, as a new member of ASEAN,
will make all efforts to contribute to the development, and
strengthening of unity, solidarity and close cooperation within
ASEAN as well as with dialogue partners for the sake of
prosperity, peace and stability in the region and in the world."
</P>
<P>
Alatas also paid courtesy calls on Senate President Chea Sim
and the National Assembly President Prince Ranariddh Saturday
separately. Alatas will leave here Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Visitors to Horti-Expo Gardens Exceed One Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1.08 million people have
visited the gardens at the '99 International Horticultural
Exposition since its trial opening in mid-February, a local
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The 218-hectares massive garden in the northeastern suburbs of
Kunming displays the world's prettiest and most special flowers
and plants and architectural and landscaping masterpieces. It was
officially opened to tourists at around 10:30 a.m.today.
</P>
<P>
"More than half of the visitors, or 580,000 toured the massive
gardens during its 15-day trial opening around the Chinese Lunar
New Year holidays in mid-February when many of the gardens had not
been fully completed," said Guo Fangming, director of the Yunnan
Provincial Bureau of Expositions.
</P>
<P>
After the official opening of the garden show this morning, it
received some 12,000 Chinese and foreign guests this morning,
including Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
and some distinguished foreign guests, said Guo.
</P>
<P>
"Altogether, at least 20,000 people were estimated to have
visited the garden show today though the opening ceremony affected
the influx of visitors," he said. "The number of visitors to the
garden show will come to at least 50,000 a day in the next few
weeks," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
The current development shows that the objective of receiving
some 10 million domestic and overseas visitors anticipated by the
Expo Organizing Committee is very likely to be realized during the
six-month run, said Yunnan Governor Li Jiating, who is vice-
chairman of the Kunming Expo '99 Organizing Committee.

<HEADLINE> NATO Rejects Belgrade's Peace Plan, Steps Up Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- NATO on Saturday launched its
second-day intensive air-strikes against Yugoslavia after
rejecting a seven-point peace offer presented by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman Peter Daniel said here Saturday that the
alliance will continue to keep the pressure on Yugoslavia and
speed up the pace.
</P>
<P>
During a 24-hour period, he said, NATO aircraft flew more than
600 sorties, hitting transmission towers and control buildings
forming part of the Yugoslav radio relay network in several
locations.
</P>
<P>
NATO warplanes also bombed seven bridges providing key
communication lines between the Serb forces in the field in Kosovo
and the rest of the Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
NATO stepped up its air-strikes Friday by launching over 600
sorties to bomb various targets in Yugoslavia while Russian peace
envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin was seeking a solution to the current
war crisis in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
After he had discussions with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, the Belgrade government put forward a seven-point peace
plan.
</P>
<P>
But NATO rejected it, saying the proposal fell far short of
NATO's five-point demand and that an unarmed United Nations force
going into Kosovo was not worthy of serious consideration. The
West insists that an armed force go into Kosovo with NATO at its
core to police any settlement there.
</P>
<P>
Daniel said NATO also bombed "a complete range of forces" in
Kosovo, the southern Serbian province, including tanks, armored
vehicles, mortar positions and command posts.
</P>
<P>
NATO had again encountered weather problems, such as
thunderstorms over Belgrade and clouds elsewhere, he added.

<HEADLINE> Russian Labor Day Demonstrators Denounce NATO Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of Muscovites took
to the streets to mark Labor Day on Saturday and denounced NATO's
flagrant bombings of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Apart from demanding better living conditions, the
demonstrators were strongly indignant with the U.S.-led military
alliance launching massive strikes against Yugoslavia, a close
ally of Russia in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally in the theater square, Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov voiced Russia's firm support for the
Yugoslav people's just struggle against NATO's aggression.
</P>
<P>
Yuri Luzhkov, mayor of Moscow, also demanded that NATO
immediately halt its military action in Yugoslavia, saying the
alliance would run risk if it takes action on Russia's tankers
shipping oil to Yugoslavia.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iranian Minister Gains Vote of Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran's moderate Minister of Culture
and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani on Saturday won a vote of
confidence from the Majlis (Parliament) after the conservatives
accused him of failing to uphold Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 263 votes cast by the Majlis deputies, only 121
votes supported the impeachment motion against Mohajerani, while
135 against the motion and seven others were abstentions.
</P>
<P>
A group of 31 conservative Majlis deputies on April 21 tabled a
motion against Mohajerani with five-point charges which accused
him of failing to uphold Islamic and revolutionary values by
adopting a liberal policy on the press, book publishing and the
arts, and misappropriating public funds for minor Hajj rituals.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Majlis (Parliament) started its debates on the
impeachment against Mohajerani on Saturday morning with presence
of senior government officials including First Vice President
Hassan Habibi, Vice President for Legal and Parliamentary Affairs
Mohammad Ali Sadouqi, and six cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
The minister, a strong supporter of President Mohammad
Khatami, defended his policies on the country's press and cultural
affairs with a smooth and confident tone at the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani is the second minister of Khatami's cabinet targeted
by the powerful conservatives, who still dominate the country's
most important organs, such as the judiciary, the Majlis and armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
After his close friend, former Interior Minister Abdollah
Nouri was impeached by the Majlis last June, Mohajerani became
the main target of the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Before the Majlis debate, Mohajerani stated that the
impeachment motion against him was politically motivated, but
would backfire.
</P>
<P>
"I consider the motion to impeach me to be a totally political
move," he said, "experience has shown that such moves will
backfire and only add to the popularity of the person put under
pressure."
</P>
<P>
Local observers see Mohajerani's vote of confidence as a
success for the political reforms of President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's policies have won more and more support from the
people and the conservatives are losing their influence, even in
the conservative-dominated Majlis, they noted.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Shuttlers Aim at World Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's men's doubles shuttler
Candra Wijaya expressed optimism he would retain his badminton
World Championship title in Copenhagen this month with new partner
Tony Gunawan.
</P>
<P>
He said Tony had gained more confidence since the duo won the
men's doubles title at the 1999 All England in Birmingham in March.
</P>
<P>
"Tony has been performing differently since we won the All
England. He has more motivation and more of a fighting spirit. He
is more confident now," Candra was quoted by The Jakarta Post
Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Candra won the men's doubles at the 1997 World Championships
with Sigit Budiarto. Sigit was suspended by the International
Badminton Federation for using nandrolone, a banned substance. His
suspension will end on November 15.
</P>
<P>
Candra said he was better prepared this year compared to two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Our preparation is much better and I have more confidence. Me
and Tony are not burdened with our ambition to win the men's
doubles," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Candra and Tony mentioned Indonesian and South Korean
doubles teams as their toughest rivals. Tony said although he and
Candra lost to Kim Dong-moon and Hae Tae-kwon in the Japan Open
last month, he was optimistic they could overcome the Koreans.
</P>
<P>
Tony and Candra are the world's number three doubles pairing,
after Antonius and Denny Kantono and Flandy Limpele and Eng Hian,
all from Indonesia. The 1996 Olympic gold medal pairing of Ricky
Subagja and Rexy Mainaky is ranked fourth in the world.
</P>
<P>
The World Championships will take place from May 16 to May 23.
They will follow the Sudirman Cup, which will be held from May 10
to May 15.
</P>
<P>
The Badminton Association of Indonesia is placing its medal
hopes on the men's doubles in the biennial World Championships.

MACAO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Association of Banks has
decided to cut the association's deposit rate by 0.25 percent,

Some business people said that the interest cut will not play a

<HEADLINE> Interest Rate Cut to Boost HK Economy: Bankers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Bankers in Hong Kong have
expressed the belief that the fresh interest rate cut will help
boost Hong Kong's economic recovery and strengthen people's
confidence in its future.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Association of Banks announced the savings
deposit rate cut by 0.25 percent to 3.5 percent, which was the
second reduction in April and the seventh in a half year.
</P>
<P>
Leading banks also decided to cut their prime lending rates
from 8.5 to 8.25 percent following the association's move
effective from May 3.
</P>
<P>
Banks and analysts held that lower rates will be beneficial to
the recovery of Hong Kong's economy and the stabilization of
property prices.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's gross domestic product shrank 5.1 percent in 1998,
with unemployment rate reaching 6.2 percent in March. Its exports
and imports also saw a decline.
</P>
<P>
However, the share prices have risen strongly in recent weeks
with Hang Seng Index climbing up 153.5 points or 1.16 percent to
close at 13,333.2 Friday.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jinbao, chairman of the bankers group and chief executive
of the Hong Kong Branch of the Bank of China, said lower rates
will further decrease the burden on businesses and mortgage
holders, and promote economic improvement and reduce the Hong Kong
dollar risk.
</P>
<P>
Hang Seng Bank senior economic research manager Vincent Kwan
noted that high real interest rates will definitely make
corporates more hesitant to commit to new investments.
</P>
<P>
He said interest rate cut will help reduce the debt burden on
companies and promote consumption.

Hadash, organized a mass rally Saturday in Nazareth to mark the
International Labor Day which falls on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Hadash members and supporters attended the rally
held at the market place on Tawfiq Zayad Street in Nazareth,

Equality, is set to announce its support for the candidacy of
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak for the post of prime minister in
the upcoming May 17 elections, the party spokesman Dror Nissan

Under the present elections system and with a big party behind
him, Barak is believed to have the best chance of toppling the
incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Nissan said, adding
the Hadash secretariat would issue an unequivocal call to its
supporters to vote for Barak.
</P>
<P>
Nazareth is deemed to be the place where the Jesus spent his
childhood and the majority of the city population are Israeli

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tanzanian Telecom Services in Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's telecommunications
services are making positive changes as the government takes bold
steps to attract investments and adopt new technologies during the
privatization process.
</P>
<P>
With active participation of private firms, the east African
country has introduced mobile cellular services, value added
services such as data transmission and Internet in recent years.
</P>
<P>
What's more, Tanzania opened in March the iridium satellite
telephone service, making it the first country in Africa to
communicate with any remote corner of the globe using a mobile
wireless phone, thanks to a Motorola-led investment of 1.2 billion
U.S. dollars worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Tanzania's telecom network was characterized by
severe congestion at most exchanges and trunk routes.
</P>
<P>
The network, however, has been more than doubled to 200,000
lines following an over 200-million-U.S. dollar Telecom
Restructuring Program since 1994, with the help of foreign
investors and donors.
</P>
<P>
At present, reconstruction is finalizing. The aim has been to
raise the country's telephone density to 0.7 per 1,000 people.
Compared with North America or Europe, this is a tiny advance.
But it's a considerable improvement on the 0.3 ratio of six years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Waiting time to get a line installed in urban areas, meanwhile,
has slowly dropped from several months to a matter of weeks or
even days now -- the country realized that development of
telecommunications is crucial to social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
One technology already being deployed is wireless local loop
(WILL) connections, which do away with the costly and often
difficult installation of cable connections from telephones to
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of this year, the WILL system is scheduled to be
in place in tourist destinations of Arusha and Zanzibar, as well
as Pemba, Morogoro and other selected high demand areas in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania Communications Commission (TCC) has licensed three
mobile cellular phone services and three public data communication
services, said Penina Mlama, the chairperson, at a workshop this
week in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Also licensed are four public radio paging services, about 100
local telecommunications contractors in the fields of installation
and maintenance of telecommunications and radio communication
equipment, and about 80 local companies to import and distribute
equipment, she said.
</P>
<P>
Mobitel, the first cellular phone company to penetrate the
Tanzanian market, has invested over 100 million dollars since 1994
and is still aggressively expanding services.
</P>
<P>
The entry of Mobitel, another private cellular phone firm, has
boosted competition in the market which used to be dominated by
the state-owned Tanzania Telecommunications Company (TTCL).
</P>
<P>
This year, TCC said it has plans to licence more operators for
mobile cellular phone and data communication services, Internet
providers and global mobile personal communication by satellite.
</P>
<P>
To increase efficiency, Minister of Communications and
Transport Ernest Nyanda said the government wants to sell part of
shares of the TTCL to strategic investors.
</P>
<P>
TTCL managing director Adolar Mapunda said the intention is to
sell 35 percent of the company and he expects to raise at least
200 million U.S. dollars from the investors.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye has challenged
telecom companies and service providers to chart out mechanisms
through which disadvantaged groups, especially those in rural
areas where most Tanzanians reside, can have access to services.
</P>
<P>
The government goal is to attract more investments and
encourage competition in the telecom market so that service
charges could be brought down.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Festival Begins Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Flocks of Tibetan people in this
capital of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region today poured
into parks in urban areas and forests in the suburbs to enjoy the
beginning of "Lynkau," a traditional Tibetan festival for
gathering together and picnicking outdoors.
</P>
<P>
The festival of Lynkau, which means "garden" in the Tibetan
language, begins on May 1 every year and runs all the way through
October 31.
</P>
<P>
During these six months, Tibetan families will invite their
friends to picnic in parks and forests on the weekends, where they
enjoy each other's company with chatting, drinking, singing and
dancing.
</P>
<P>
Today, most families chose forests on the banks of the Lhasa
River as their picnic sites. People set up colorful tents and
everybody, young and old alike, enjoyed a good time.
</P>
<P>
Pubu Cering, a 36-year-old driver, said that although weekends
are a good time to make money, he decided to take his family for a
picnic. "It's more important to enjoy nature with the family than
to make money," he said.
</P>
<P>
The picnic festival is popular among common people now, said
Cering's mother, who was busily setting food and drinks on a
carpet, but in the old Tibet, only the nobility had the right to
enjoy the festival.
</P>
<P>
At famous Potala Square, the autonomous regional government has
provided a series of holiday activities for the local people,
including art performances and commodity fairs.
</P>
<P>
To attract more tourists from May through October, the best
season to travel to this mysterious land, Tibet has developed a
series tourism programs such as grassland explorations to northern
Tibet and ecological tours to the world's highest peak, Mount
Qomolangma.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects U.S.-Azeri Oil Accords as Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran has turned down the oil
contracts signed between American oil companies and the Republic
of Azerbaijan on utilization of the Caspian Sea oil reserves as
"devoid of legal grounds."
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said on
Friday evening that mechanisms for exploitation of the Caspian
Sea reserves is a topic of discussion among the littoral
states, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Azeri government on Tuesday signed oil agreements valued at
10 billion U.S. dollars with three American energy companies to
develop oil fields in the republic.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian spokesman said that in case of the
division of the sea, some of the oil fields in areas specified in
the contract will belong to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said any move taken in the region is a violation
of the rights of the Islamic Republic of Iran, adding oil
companies have already been cautioned and given warnings on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic of Iran, while opposing to the signing of such
accords, considers them as devoid of legal credibility and
grounds, he added.
</P>
<P>
The five Caspian littoral states of Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia,
Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan hold different views on the way to
explore natural resources in the world's largest inland lake.
</P>
<P>
Iran has called for a fast determination of the sea's legal
regime and stressed the need of joint ownership of its natural
resources while some other Caspian states insisted on a division of
the sea among the five countries.

<P>
MAPUTO, May 1 (XInhua) -- A visiting U.S. official has said
that his country will grant Mozambique 1.5 million U.S. dollars
for assisting de- mining in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1.5 million dollars, 350,000 dollars will be used for
dog- training for land mine probing, and the rest will go to the
engineer battalion of the Mozambican armed forces for the purchase
of equipment and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed here Friday by Donald Steinberg, special
envoy of U.S. President and Secretary of State on global
humanitarian de-mining, who is here to attend an international
conference on land mine prohibition scheduled on the coming
Monday.

According to Steinberg, the United States has already given
Mozambique 27 million dollars in the past six years to assist
de-mining in the country which has suffered 16 years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that with the U.S. assistance, a total of
2,400-kilometer- long highway in central Mozambique's Safala,
Manica and Zambezia provinces has been cleared of land mines.

in the year 2006. He explained that due to security reasons, his
country cannot signed that agreement at the moment.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav FM Condemns NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanovic reiterated Saturday that NATO airstrikes against his
country is a criminal act against peace, humanity that provoked
destabilization in the region.
</P>
<P>
"There is indeed nothing possible to be achieved through the
use of force, especially the use of force of the strongest
military organization in the history of civilization," the
minister said at the beginning of his meeting with a U.S.
religious delegation headed by civil rights leader Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that your mission here can bring positive
contribution" to reestablish peace and stability, said Jovanovic
at a conference room inside the building of the Yugoslav Foreign
Ministry, which was damaged when NATO bombed the buildings of the
Yugoslav General Staff across the street.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister's office, located on the second floor and
facing the street, was heavily devastated, with broken window
glass and chunks of plaster fallen from the ceiling all over the
floor.
</P>
<P>
Nobody was injured inside the Foreign Ministry building, but
two police officers patrolling outside were killed.
</P>
<P>
Jackson arrived here Wednesday in a trip intended to seek the
release of three U.S. soldiers captured by Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Jovanovic for allowing him to visit the three POWs,
noting that they were in good health and they had balanced meals
and could exercise. The soldiers were given messages from their
parents and spouses, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Jackson toured the heavily damaged building of Radio-
TV Serbia, which was bombed seven days ago. 13 staff members of
the TV station were killed.
</P>
<P>
He said the bombing of Serbian TV is the same as a bombing of
NBC or CNN while people are working, the Tanjug news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he could not close his eyes to civilian casualties
or to the fact that the war in Yugoslavia had brought suffering
and instigated violence that must be halted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation included representatives from the country's
Christian, Muslim and Jewish communities as well as Rod Blagojevic
of Chicago, the only Serbian-born congressman.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Jackson met with U.S. President Bill
Clinton's national security advisor Samuel Berger, who said the
delegation's visit is private and not tasked by the White House,
Tanjug reported.

<HEADLINE> Death Penalty Failed to Stop Rape Epidemic in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Rape cases of the Philippines surged
by five percent in the first quarter of this year, thus bolstering
the argument that the death penalty offers no real deterrence to
heinous crimes, a pro-life lawmaker said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Representative Roan Libarios said a total of 792 rape incidents
were reported to the Philippine National Police from January to
March this year, 40 cases more than the 752 rape cases documented
from October to December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Libarios, who is opposed to capital punishment, said the
figures indicate that the February 5 execution of convicted child
rapist Leo Echegaray had failed to put in check the uptrend in
rape cases.
</P>
<P>
If the first quarter figures are "annualized," Libarios said
the number of rape incidents would likely hit a new record of
3,168 cases this year, up 137 cases over the 3,031 cases reported
in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Develop Huge Gas Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique kicked off the development
of a gas field with a total cost of 2.5 billion U.S. dollars, to
offer gas to Maputo Steel Plant, the biggest industrial project in
the country.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the survey, development and use of the gas
field in southern Mozambique's Inhambane Province was signed here
Friday between the U.S. Enron company and the Mozambican
government.
</P>
<P>
John Kachamila, Mozambican Mines and Energy Minister, said at
the signing ceremony of the agreement that the laying of gas pipe
between the gas field and Maputo, the capital city of the country,
will cost about 900 million dollars, while the construction of
Maputo Steel Plant will take another 160 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the gas supply system and the steel plant
will add up to 2.5 billion dollars, the biggest project in the
history of Mozambique, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Enron company will conduct the gas survey on 8,000 to
9,000 square kilometers of land in Inhambane Province's Pande
areas, where preliminary survey was done by Mozambicans in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
The Maputo Steel Plant, for which the gas will be offered, is
planned to be put into operation in two years.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Chronic Problem Afflicting Kenyans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- As Kenyans celebrate the Labor Day,
 unemployment still remains a thorny issue, the official Kenyan
Times observed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary marking the Labor Day, it said that the
population growth rate was around three percent last year while
the economic growth rate stood at 1.6 percent, which resulted in
a deteriorating unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The article holds that the big population growth provides a
market for goods and services and what Kenya should do is to
encourage economic growth as they already have the market but
lack purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
It noted that poor infrastructure has hindered investment and
economic operations, which generate jobs.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that the private sector of the economy has continued
to receive immense help from the donor community and the Kenyan
government sees this as a stepping stone to the year 2002
industrialization program.
</P>
<P>
The government should provide designated places for the
traders, which absorbed over two hundred thousand people last
year, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The attitudes of college graduates towards the private sector
should be changed since many graduates prefer to work with
governmental organizations but most of them can not find a job
immediately after graduation, it observes.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the article also condemns corruption which denies
people job opportunities .

<HEADLINE> Bomb Warning Causes Panic in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The employees of the New Vision
daily, the leading paper in Uganda, were thrown into confusion
Friday following an anonymous call warning of a bomb planted in
the corporation premises.
</P>
<P>
The company immediately hired two sniffer dogs to comb the area
for possible clues, but no bomb was detected, the paper reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted receptionist Lillian Mugisha as saying that
the caller was a woman with an Indian accent.
</P>

Bomb experts were also called in after the employees were
evacuated from their offices.
</P>
<P>
There has been an increase in bomb threats in the capital city
recently. Police authorities said that they receive this kind of
calls almost every day.
</P>
<P>
The three bomb blasts, which occurred near a stadium in
downtown area in April and killed about 10 people, sent waves of
panic among the general public.

<HEADLINE> British Police Arrest 4 Bombing Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Police said on Saturday they had
arrested four people in connection with three nail bomb attacks in
London in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
One man was arrested in Hampshire in south England in the
early hours of Saturday morning and will be questioned by
detectives later.
</P>
<P>
Scotland Yard said he was being held in connection with the
attacks in Brixton, Brick Lane and Soho.
</P>
<P>
Another man in his early 20s was arrested on Friday evening in
east London over the recent Brixton and Brick Lane bombs. He is
being held in custody at a central London police station.
</P>
<P>
A third man was arrested in Surrey, a suburban city of London,
by the National Crime Squad on Friday, police said.
</P>
<P>
One man was arrested on Thursday night in connection with the
blasts. He has been bailed by police, to return at the end of May.
</P>
<P>
The first blast shook a busy Brixton market in south London
nearly two weeks ago, injuring 39 people.
</P>
<P>
It was followed a week later with a second nail bomb in Brick
Lane, east London, injuring seven people.
</P>
<P>
Then, on Friday a blast exploded at a gay pub in Soho, central
London, killing two people and injuring more than 70.
</P>
<P>
Scotland Yard Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon told a news
conference Friday evening that a far right wing group had claimed
responsibility for the latest outrage and he believed the three
nail bombings in London over the past two weeks were all linked to
far right wing groups.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Stable Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan shilling held steady
Friday against the dollar and expected to recover on sluggish
demand for dollars,
</P>
<P>
By mid-day, the shilling was quoted at 67.80 buying and 68.00
selling against the dollar, unchanged from Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
A surge in dollar buying by off-shore accounts and local
importers covering forwards has sent the dollar higher by about
two shilling recently.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that foreign investors had been liquidating
their portfolio investments after a drastic fall in interest
rates, reinforcing increased dollar demand by importers.
</P>
<P>
But dealers said sentiment had reversed in favor of the local
units after a senior official of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
suggested the bank would not allow a further shilling slide.
</P>
<P>
Local currency experts had predicted a fall to the 70 shillings
but the official ruled out such a drop, saying the Central Bank
was convinced such a decline was not warranted given current
economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
The official suggested the Central Bank would intervene if the
shilling continued to weaken.
</P>
<P>
The CBK posted a shilling mean commercial rate of 67.72 against
the dollar from 67.73 at the day's open. Against the pound and
euro, the bank posted a shilling mean of 109.20 shillings and
72.01 shillings respectively from 109.36 shillings and 71.96
shilling Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Broaden Tax Base for Equitable Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 1 (Xinhua) (C The Tanzanian government plans
to broaden the tax base, reduce reliance on foreign trade taxes
and improve the transparency and efficiency of the tax system in
the 1999/2000 financial year.
</P>
<P>
The Business Times said Saturday that further tax reform will
focus on continuing to reduce the number of taxes and their
complexity and reducing statutory exemptions to a minimum
throughout the tax system.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a top government official as saying that
major steps will be taken for the 1999/2000 financial year.
</P>
<P>
Since Tanzania replaced its sales tax by a value-added tax
(VAT) at the beginning of 1998/99 financial year last July, tariff
exemptions for imported capital goods were streamlined through
adopting a tariff classification based on the Harmonized Tariff
System.
</P>
<P>
!0The gradual increase in the revenue-to-GDP ratio, together
with declining government debt service, will permit decisions to
be taken over the medium term on how to use the growing pool of
resources to best promote equitable growth,!1 the official said.
</P>
<P>
He expected a tax harmonization between the mainland and
Zanzibar will continue with the latter implementing VAT and
pre-shipment inspection of imports.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a government report said that the revenue collection
from July to November 1998 reached 294.4 billion Tanzanian
shillings, compared with a collection target for the whole of
1998/99 financial year of 699.5 billion Tanzanian shillings.

KUNMING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin cut
the red ribbon for the garden show of the '99 International
Horticultural Exposition, the first world exposition ever hosted
by a developing nation, this morning in the northeastern suburbs
of Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Joining him in cutting the ribbon were Cambodian King Norodom
Sihanouk, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, Djibouti Primer
Minister Barkat Gourad Hamadou, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai,
Chinese Vice-Premier and Chairman of the Expo '99 Organizing
Committee Li Lanqing, President Ole Philipson of the Bureau of
International Expositions, President Otto Koch of the
International Association of Horticultural Producers and Yunnan
Governor Li Jiating.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee-hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region and representatives from Macao and Taiwan
were also present.
</P>
<P>
With balloons rising into the sky and birds swooping overhead,
the Chinese President and the distinguished guests planted trees
in memory of the event.
</P>
<P>
Then, President Jiang, together with heads of states and
government leaders of four other developing countries, toured the
218-hectare gardens which boasts the world's prettiest and most
special plants and horticultural masterpieces.
</P>
<P>

President Jiang and other guests were given an enthusiastic
welcome by local ethnic minority people dancing in colorful
costumes and children dressed up like little monkeys, dragonflies,
bees and butterflies.
</P>
<P>
Standing aloft among flowers and trees near the main entrance
was a giant billboard inscribed with the expo theme: Man and
Nature, Marching Into the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
The garden show has five indoor exhibition halls, six special
exhibition areas and three outdoor exhibition areas. On display
are some one million plants of more than 2,000 species. Some of
the plants have multiplied on earth for more than 300 million
years, 50 to 60 times the length of human history.
</P>
<P>
The main source of food for mankind comes from plants. Yet,
plants are vanishing from the earth at a rate of one species a day,
according Chinese botanists.
</P>
<P>
Initiated in Britain on May 1,1851, the world horticultural
show has always served as an international arena for
industrialized countries to display their economic, cultural and
scientific power.
</P>
<P>
But today the China Garden in the expo venue, which features
traditional and modern gardening art and achievements of the host
country, has become the focus of attention.
</P>
<P>
"China is reputed as 'mother of all world gardens'," a guide
told the visitors. "Chinese philosopher Lao Zi stressed the
importance of harmonious co-existence between man and nature some
2,000 years ago."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Abul Quasem, a horticultural expert from Bangladesh,
praised China for its "admirable achievements" in protecting the
environment while boosting its economic development.
</P>
<P>
"The Kunming Expo has shown to the world a true new China,
which represents the hope of our planet," added Calisto
Karimanzira from Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
China has spent more than 20 billion yuan (about 2.5 billion US
dollars) preparing for the garden show, and the construction of
the expo venue alone cost some 1.6 billion yuan (about 200 million
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
With a perfect blend of all styles of gardens across the world,
the garden show is called by some Chinese gardeners "garden of
all gardens", a title that was once attached to the famous
Yuanmingyuan in Beijing, an magnificent Chinese imperial garden
that was robbed and burnt down by the allied invading army of
Britain and France 140 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Turkey to Conduct Joint War Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Turkey will hold joint
military exercises this week as part of the military cooperation
between the two countries, the Jordan Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A Jordanian company of soldiers were dispatched to Turkey on
Friday and a similar number of Turkish troops had arrived in
Jordan to conduct ground exercises, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The exercises were aimed at upgrading the experience of
Jordanian troops and getting acquainted with weapons of foreign
armies, the Jordanian news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Ambassador to Amman Tuncer Topur described the war
games as "simple and routine training" between troops of the two
countries, while officials from both sides refused to disclose the
duration of the manoeuvres.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the ambassador was apparently trying to defuse
fears on the part of other Arab countries that Jordan might intend
to enter into military alliances with Turkey and Israel.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Jordan sent an observer to attend a naval training
that grouped Turkey, Israel and the United States in the
Mediterranean, a move that angered Syria, Iraq, Iran and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
However, the Jordanian government has reiterated on many
occasions that it would keep friendly ties with all countries,
particularly its neighbors and would not improve ties with one
country at the cost of another.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has not ruled out the possibilities of joint air force
exercises with Turkey this year, and is seeking Turkish help to
maintain its F-16 fighter planes it obtained from the U.S. in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Crisis-Hit Asian Economies Report Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- East Asian and Southeast Asian
economies, which have been hit severely by a financial crisis,
reported here Saturday remarkable improvements and painted a
better picture for this year.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches at the 32nd annual meeting of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), representatives of East Asian and
Southeast Asian economies said that their economic situation has
been stabilized in recent months and a recovery is in sight.
</P>
<P>
Syahril Sabirin, representative of Indonesia, said that at the
end of the third quarter of last year, signs of stability emerged
in his country, and since then the exchange rate has remained
within a narrow band of between 7,300 and 9,000 rupiah per U.S.
dollar, and inflation rate remained consistently low.
</P>
<P>
"In fact," he said, "the rates were negative in the months of
October last year and March this year."
</P>
<P>
Such stability has made it possible for Indonesia to let
interest rates decline from more than 70 percent last September to
only 33 percent this week for a one-month Bank Indonesia
Certificate, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pisit Leeahtam, representative of Thailand, said that with the
implementation of reform programs, macro-economic stability was
achieved in his country with a stable exchange rate for the baht
in the last 13 months.
</P>
<P>
"This has allowed a notable fall in inflation and interest
rates which are now at their historically lows. Moreover, external
stability has also been restored," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that his country's foreign reserves that were
virtually depleted in the middle of 1997 have increased to about
30 billion U.S. dollars with the outstanding swap obligation
declining to 4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"In the first quarter of this year, there are indications that
the Thai economy is bottoming out and begins to recover," he said.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Finance Minister Kyu-Sung Lee said that his
country has restored its currency stability with a record level of
foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
"Our external debt profile has dramatically improved, with
short-term debt now accounting for only about 20 of the total," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the improved financial stability, notably the
decline in interest rates and rebounded stock market, has
translated into recovery in the real sector.
</P>
<P>
"Such visible recovery, however, could not have been realized
without the progress made in economic reform. To be sure, we are
already seeing a transformation of South Korea's economic
landscape," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Malaysian Finance Minister Dato Mustapa Mohamed
said that Malaysia was forced to adopt last September what was
then considered as unorthodox measures after the failure of
conventional IMF (International Monetary Fund) type approaches
that required maintaining tight fiscal and monetary policies
introduced at the outset of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The selective capital controls have provided Malaysia with the
much needed breathing space to strengthen its bank institutions
and the corporate sector, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Our financial institutions are being strengthened through
recapitalization and the removal of non-performing loans from
their balance sheets. Banking sector restructuring is in fact
progressing ahead of schedule," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that investor sentiments on the local bourse
have improved markedly.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign exchange reserves have increased to 28.1 billion
dollars as at April 15, 1999, sufficient to finance more than six
months of imports," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official predicted that his country's economy will turn
around this year with a growth of 1 percent, compared with a
contraction of 6.7 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier ADB outlook, the Southeast Asian
economies, which contracted by 6.9 percent last year, could grow
0.8 percent this year with the improvement of economic situation
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ADB meeting opened here Friday and will end Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin today
planted a tree in the venue of the '99 International Horticultural
Exposition in commemoration of the event following the opening of
the Expo venue in Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Other distinguished Chinese and foreign guests invited to be
the first visitors to the Expo venue in the northeastern suburbs
of Kunming also planted trees. Among them were Cambodian King
Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Monineath Sihanouk, Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe, Djibouti Prime Minister Barkat Gourad
Hamadou, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, Chinese Vice-Premier
Li Lanqing, who is also Chairman of the '99 Expo Organizing
Committee, President Ole Philipson of the Bureau of International
Expositions and President Otto Koch of the International
Association of Horticultural Producers.
</P>
<P>
Assisted by Zhang Chengyan, an 11-year-old girl from a Kunming
primary school, Jiang placed his tree in the pit prepared in
advance, shoveled earth to fill in the pit and watered the tree
with a bucket.
</P>
<P>
"Grandpa Jiang is very amiable, and I can feel that he loves
this small tree very much," said Zhang, who was dressed up like a
lovely peacock.
</P>
<P>
He Jingyu, another primary school student who helped Chuan
Leekpai plant his tree, said that the Thai Prime Minister is very
good at tree planting and he knows how to spread earth around the
tree's roots evenly.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man-kei, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference who is from
Macao, had a picture taken with a kid of Naxi nationality, one of
Yunnan's 25 minority nationalities, after they planted a tree
together.
</P>
<P>
According to Duan Leilei, a little girl at the tree planting
site, primary schools in Kunming often encourage and organize
their students to plant trees in and around the city.
</P>
<P>
"My father often takes me out to the suburbs to plant trees,"
said Duan. "He often tells me how important to cover our land with
green."
</P>
<P>
According to a gardener at the expo venue, the trees President
Jiang and others planted today are orange osmanthus, a species of
distinction, very famous in Chinese gardens, and the saplings come
from a Shanghai nursery. There is a Chinese saying that men of
distinction plant famous trees.

<HEADLINE> Representatives on ADB's Role in New Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Representatives at the 32nd Annual
Meeting of the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) Saturday stressed the bank's role in development in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
"The bank should refocus and concentrate on its role as a
long-term development institution," said Gino Alzetta,
representative of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Given the constraints on the bank's soft loan window, Alzetta
said the members need to plan for the replenishment of the Asian
Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Klaus Oehler, representative of Austria, said that
there is consensus among the bank's members that the overarching
objective of the bank is poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, a well designed poverty reduction strategy should be
at the outset of replenishment negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He also appreciated the confirmation on poverty reduction made
by ADB President Tadao Chino in his statement.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the meeting on Friday, Chino vowed to
help address challenges in the Asian Pacific region to achieve the
maximum development.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the bank's role in the new century, Chino said the
bank will continue to help the region's development in a
sustainable manner.
</P>
<P>
Dato Mustapa Mohamed, representative of Malaysia, expressed his
hope that the ADB will continue to play an important role in
rebuilding the crisis affected economies and promote growth.
</P>
<P>
"We trust that the ADB will review its programs and activities
so that it can plan a more meaningful role in raising the
socio-economic well-being of developing economies in the Asia and
Pacific region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Syahril Sabirin, representative of Indonesia, said that the ADB
has played, and should continue to play, a key role in building a
better and stable world economy.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore support the initiative now being formulated to
underpin the bank's long-term financial viability," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Shuttlers Confident of Doubles Success in Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's men's doubles shuttler
Candra Wijaya expressed optimism he would retain his World
Championship title in Copenhagen this month with new partner Tony
Gunawan.
</P>
<P>
He said Tony had gained more confidence since the duo won the
men's doubles title at the 1999 All England in Birmingham in March.
</P>
<P>
"Tony has been performing differently since we won the All
England. He has more motivation and more of a fighting spirit. He
is more confident now," Candra was quoted by The Jakarta Post
Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Candra won the men's doubles at the 1997 World Championships
with Sigit Budiarto. Sigit was suspended by the International
Badminton Federation for using nandrolone, a banned substance. His
suspension will end on November 15.
</P>
<P>
Candra said he was better prepared this year compared to two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Our preparation is much better and I have more confidence. Me
and Tony are not burdened with our ambition to win the men's
doubles," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tony said: " I have no problem preparing myself for the World
Championships. My speed, power and stamina is good."
</P>
<P>
He said he managed to overcome a mental barrier by winning the
All England.
</P>
<P>
"I feel different since the All England. I feel I can play
without any burden and I can really play hard," Tony added.
</P>
<P>
Both Candra and Tony mentioned Indonesian and South Korean
doubles teams as their toughest rivals.
</P>
<P>
"South Korean pairs are really dangerous. But we also face a
difficult challenge from our teammates," Candra said.
</P>
<P>
Tony said although he and Candra lost to Kim Dong-moon and Hae
Tae-kwon in the Japan Open last month, he was optimistic they
could overcome the South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
Tony and Candra are the world's number three doubles pairing,
after Antonius and Denny Kantono and Flandy Limpele and Eng Hian,
all from Indonesia. The 1996 Olympic gold medal pairing of Ricky
Subagja and Rexy Mainaky is ranked fourth in the world.
</P>
<P>
The World Championships will take place from May 16 to May 23.
They will follow the Sudirman Cup, which will be held from May 10
to May 15.
</P>
<P>
The Badminton Association of Indonesia is placing its medal
hopes on the men's doubles in the biennial World Championships.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Survey Its Business Establishments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide survey of Philippines'
single proprietorships, partnerships, corporations and
cooperatives, known as the List of Establishments (LE), will start
next Monday, according to the National Statistics Office (NSO).
</P>
<P>
NSO Director Margarita Guerrero said Saturday the 74-day
activity will end on July 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
He noted LE will contain the names and addresses of
establishments, their legal and economic set up, number of workers
and other relevant information.
</P>
<P>
LE will form the basis for generating the sampling frame of
census and surveys of establishments, and will be the main source
of information for the NSO-based Databank on Small and Medium
Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The information that LE 1999 will generate is also expected to
serve as guide to the government in the geographical allocation of
resources on the basis of the number of establishments in a
specific area.
</P>
<P>
Baseline data for policy and program formulation and monitoring
of trade and industry development can also be obtained from the
list.
</P>
<P>
NSO Administrator Tomas Africa said that ideally, the LE is
conducted every year since it records the "births" and "deaths" of
new establishments. But budgetary constraints prevent it from
being accomplished, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Half of Kenyan Capital Residents Living in Slums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cyrus Maina, Provincial Commissioner of Nairobi, said that over
one million people are crammed in the slums, which lack vital
basic services such as water, health care, education and other
infrastructure facilities, leading to high morbidity and
mortality rates.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Times newspaper Saturday quoted Maina as saying that
the situation in the slums was worsening.
</P>
<P>
Maina warned Thursday that overcrowding and poverty would
result in social instability and a rise in crime if a clear
policy for the future is not developed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the conditions of housing were deplorable as they
were temporarily constructed and relatively haphazard, making it
difficult to introduce pathways, drainage systems and water.
</P>
<P>
He added that the residents in these areas are essential
workers who contribute to the city's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Maina said that solutions to the slum crisis lay in the
establishment of a policy framework that should be based on a
positive approach to their future.
</P>
<P>
From May 5 to 14, the U.N. Center for Human Settlements will
hold a conference in Nairobi with the focus on "security of
tenure", aimed at securing the slum residents freed of evictions.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. estimates, 16 out of 20 mega-cities with
a population of over 10 million will emerge in the developing
world at the beginning of next century. The pressure of the
urbanizing process is easily perceived in most developing
countries due to shortage of basic services for urban residents.

Iranian First Vice President Hassan Habibi, Vice President for
Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Mohammad Ali Sadouqi as well as
six cabinet ministers attended the Majlis session broadcast live
by Tehran Radio.
</P>
<P>
A group of 31 conservative Majlis deputies on April 21 tabled
a motion against Mohajerani, accusing him of failure to uphold
Islamic values by adopting a liberal policy on the press, book
publishing and the arts, and misappropriating public funds for
minor Hajj rituals.
</P>
<P>
According to the Majlis regulations, the lawmakers who asked
for the impeachment have two hours to deliver speeches against
Mohajerani and the minister have three hours to outline the
performance of his ministry and give response to the questions
raised by the representatives.
</P>
<P>
Iran's political analysts have expressed different views on
Mohajerani's fate. Some believe the minister will be able to gain
a vote of confidence from the Majlis with support of independent
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The conservative faction occupy about 100 seats from the
270-seat Majlis while the moderates enjoy some 90, they said,
adding Mohajerani might convince the independent deputies with his
eloquent speeches.
</P>
<P>
However, others believe the powerful conservatives are
determined to remove the open-minded minister and the impeachment
motion is a pre-planned political move to elbow the moderates,
the main supporters of President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani is the second minister of Khatami's cabinet
targeted by the powerful conservatives, who still dominate the
country's most important organs, such as the judiciary, the
Majlis and the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
After his close friend and former Interior Minister Abdollah
Nouri was impeached by the Majlis last June, Mohajerani became
the main target of the Iranian conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani has claimed the impeachment motion against him
is politically motivated, but it will backfire.
</P>
<P>
"I consider the motion to impeach me to be a totally
political move," he said, "experience has shown that such moves
will backfire and only add to the popularity of the person
put under pressure."
</P>
<P>
President Khatami has called on Majlis deputies to throw their
support behind his government and Mohajerani, his close ally and
a strong supporter of his open-minded policies.
</P>
<P>
He praised Mohajerani as "a man of culture, wisdom and
potentiality in the area," and termed the achievements of the
culture ministry in the area of literature, art, culture and
information dissemination as "valuable and extensive."

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Tea Production Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's tea production declined in
March to 13,974,815 kilograms from 28,425,493 kgs in same month
last year, according to the Tea Board of Kenya (TBK).
</P>
<P>
TBK said in a statement made public Friday that the decline in
March represented a drop of 14,450,678 kgs or 50.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's tea production for the first three months of this
year stood at 50,252.932 kgs, down from 86,497,570 kgs in the
same period last year, representing a drop of 41.9 percent, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The board attributed the tea production decline to the drought
in most tea-growing areas from January to March this year and the
situation is expected to reverse with the start of the rain season
from April, the TBK said.
</P>
<P>
Tea is Kenya's major foreign exchange earner. In 1998, the
country produced 294,000 tons of tea and tea export earned the
country 34.8 billion shillings (about 580 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Research Institute: Asian Recovery in Sight, Obstacles Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The sharp downturn in the Asian
economies is over, but the recession has been deep and the social
consequences have been severe, said the head of the Institute of
International Finance (IIF) here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen outstanding government leadership in the region
that has secured important financial recovery, and laid the basis
for economic recovery," IIF Chairman John Bond said when he
presented the IIF's Asia Regional Overview and Outlook to
reporters covering the on-going Asian Development Bank annual
meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The global financial markets are increasingly recognizing this,
he added.
</P>
<P>
As net flows from the crisis-hit economies ease, Bond said,
private capital flows to Asia are projected to increase to 290
billion U.S. dollars this year from last year's 7.8 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
But Bond said that the social cost of the crisis highlights the
need for governments to be persistent in pressing further ahead
with important economic policy reforms.
</P>
<P>
The IIF's outlook also said that economic recovery for the
region is in sight, but it is likely to be gradual and moderate.
</P>
<P>
The report said that this year's upturn in world oil prices,
weak growth in Japan and a softening in global demand also
threaten to make adjustment and recovery for the region more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
The large current account surplus in many economies are likely
to erode as a recovery in growth overwhelms lackluster export
growth, but still remain sizable over the near term, it said.
</P>
<P>
The IIF is a global association of financial institutions with
over 300 members. One of its goals is to assist its members in
their risk management through sound economic analysis.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Developing Economies Urge ADB to Ease Loan Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Asia's developing economies Saturday
urged the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to ease terms for Asian
Development Fund (ADF) loans to support their economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the annual ADB meeting here, Bangladesh
Finance Minister Shan Kibria said: "We noted with concern that
lending from both ORC (Ordinary Capital Resources) and ADF has
declined, and unfortunately at a time when developing members
needed larger sums for supporting their investment and
development."
</P>
<P>
The terms for ADF loan have hardened which will impose heavier
burden on the low-income borrowers, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We would urge that the flow of replenishment funds, within the
amount pledged, be more orderly and predictable, which will better
meet the needs of the borrowers," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We would also urge that transfer of profits from OCR
operations to ADF resources be resumed at the earliest," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his earlier speech, Chinese Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng
said that the ADB's OCR comes mainly from its equity income rather
than income from OCR loans.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the level of interest rate of OCR loans is not the
cause of the bank's financial difficulties, nor is the increase of
rate of OCR loans a fundamental approach to solve the bank's
problems," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision to increase the rate is in effect to
shift the burden of solving the financial inadequacies onto the
borrowers, which is a wrong and unfair idea.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the meeting, Ouk Rabun, representative of
Cambodia, said that his country is concerned about the
cross-the-board reduction in ADF which negatively affects project
financing in poor developing economies like Cambodia, while a
substantial amount of funds goes to financial stabilization of a
number of crisis economies.
</P>
<P>
"We must also express our concern over the approved hardening
of ADF Loan Terms, by reducing the grace period and increasing the
interest charge," he said.

<HEADLINE> Swazi Premier Calls for Regional Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Southern African Development
Community (SADC) countries should foster regional economic
cooperation to perform competitively against the rest of the
world, Prime Minister of Swaziland Barnabas Sibusiso Dlamini said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair in
Bulawayo, the country's second largest city, he said there was
need for regional states to develop a competitive smart
partnership environment to boost trade and investment, the daily
Herald reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said the cooperation displayed by regional leaders last
December when they boarded the inaugural Blue Train from
Johannesburg to Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe showed that cooperation
was as important as competition.
</P>
<P>
He called on Zimbabwean and international firms to invest and
trade with Swaziland, saying his country offered "outstanding"
trade and investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The six-day fair, which set aside the first three days for
traders and business executives, opened on Tuesday with business
and trade transactions worth almost 600 million Zimbabwean dollars
(15.7 million U.S. dollars) expected to be made between local and
foreign exhibitors.

<HEADLINE> africa records 3.3 percent gdp growth in 1998: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
addis ababa, may 1 (xinhua) -- the u.n. economic commission for
africa (eca) said friday that in 1998 africa enjoyed its fourth
consecutive year of positive gross domestic product (gdp) growth
at 3.3 percent, despite global financial and currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
eca executive secretary k.y. amoako told the 19th meeting of
the technical preparatory committee of the whole and 7th
intergovernmental group of experts here that the growth rate is
not high enough, nor sufficiently broad-based, or sustained long
enough, to make a real dent in poverty.
</P>
<P>
""this favorable outcome cannot be assumed to mean that the
average african economy has crossed the critical threshold to a
self-sustainable, poverty-reducing growth path," he noted.
</P>
<P>
amoako said that on the eve of a new millennium, africa faces
several challenges, key among which are poverty reduction and
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
he recalled that african heads of state and government have
endorsed the u.n. target of reducing poverty by half by the year
2015, saying that "this implies a reduction of poverty by four
percent per annum."
</P>
<P>
"in order to meet these targets, africa would need to raise its
gdp growth rates to an average of seven percent per annum for the
region as a whole, compared to an average of 4.5 percent annually
during 1995-98," he said.
</P>
<P>
the u.n. official urged african countries to step up their
effort to mobilize domestic resources for sustainable development
and poverty reduction, through policies to raise savings,
including tax reforms, financial and capital market reforms, and
sound interest rate policy management.
</P>
<P>
in his statement at the opening of the meeting, mekonnen
manyazewal, ethiopian vice-minister of economic development and
cooperation, said that in contrast to the 1980s and early 1990s
africa has seen an improvement in a number of indicators.
</P>
<P>
"since 1995, gdp in real terms grew by 4.5 percent between 1995
and 1997 -- registering positive per capita gdp growth," mekonnen
said. "export growth doubled, from an annual average of about four
percent between 1990- 1994 to about eight percent between 1995 and
1997."
</P>
<P>
referring to africa's financing problem, the ethiopian
vice-minister said that african countries have lower savings, 17.6
percent of gdp in 1997, compared to 24 percent for all developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
the five-day preparatory meeting will prepare an agenda for
action for the forthcoming joint conference of african ministers
of finance and ministers of economic development and planning to
be convened in addis ababa on may 6-8, 1999.
</P>
<P>
the theme of the conference is "the challenge of financing
development in africa". enditem

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Environmental Protection in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In August, 1973, the State Council called the first national
environmental protection conference, which laid down the
principles of "overall planning, rational distribution,
comprehensive utilization, turning what is harmful into things
beneficial, relying on the masses and everybody putting in a hand
to protect the environment for the benefit of the people."
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1983, the second national environmental
protection conference made environment protection a basic state
policy. In April, 1984, the third national environment protection
conference formulated an eight-point environment management system
in line with China's actual conditions. An effective environmental
protection management mechanism was thus knocked into shape.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, China has formulated a whole set of laws and
regulations on environmental protection, supported by
corresponding rules, and put forward such control means as making
environmental impact assessment for construction projects,
imposing fees on waste discharge, waste discharge after meeting
prescribed standards and issuing license for waste discharge. All
these helped reduce industrial pollution.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the State Environmental Protection Bureau and the
State Planning Commission jointly formulated a "Program of Action
for Environmental Protection (1991-2000)". The State
Environmental Protection Bureau formulated more detailed "China's
Environmental Protection Program (1993-1998)".
</P>

In March 1996, China set clear objectives for environmental
protection in the following 15 years in its "Program of National
Social and Economic Development for the 9th Five-Year Plan Period
(1996-2000) and an Outlined Program for Long-Term Objectives for
Years up to 2010". The programs were adopted by the Fourth Session
of the Eighth National People's Congress. The objectives include:
to basically arrest the momentum of deterioration of the
environment and ecology and improve the environment quality in
part of the cities and regions by 2000; to put an end to the
deterioration of the environment and improve markedly the urban
and rural environment by 2010.
</P>
<P>
China planned 500 water pollution control projects for a number
of major coastal cities and lakes, including the seven major
waterway systems, during the "Ninth Five-Year Plan" period, which
required a total investment of 56 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In June 1996, the Chinese government published a White Paper,
outlining China's achievements and problems in environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
In July 1996, at the fourth national environmental protection
conference, Premier Li Peng called for efforts to ensure the
realization of China's environmental protection objectives for the
end of this century and the beginning of the next century. Chinese
President Jiang Zemin stressed the necessity of making sustainable
development a matter of major importance, saying that economic
development must go side by side with the development of
population, environment and resources and it is not only necessary
to do well in the current development but also create more
favorable conditions for future development for the benefit of
future generations.
</P>
<P>
The conference worked out a "Plan for the Control of Total
Discharge of Wastes" and "Turn-of-the-Century Green Engineering
Program" and other important documents to mobilize the whole
society to tackle environmental pollution.

<HEADLINE> s. africa condemns coup in comoros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
johannesburg, May 1 (xinhua) -- the south african government
friday condemned the overnight coup in the comoros and expressed
the hope that it would not undermine recent progress made in
seeking national unity in that country.
</P>
<P>
south african press association quoted foreign ministry
spokesman marco boni as saying that it was regrettable the coup
took place merely a week after talks were held to address the
problem of secessionist island anjouan.
</P>
<P>
"we hope this is not a retrogressive step and that it will not
affect the progress made," he said.
</P>
<P>
boni said he was informed by the embassy of the comoros in
pretoria that the situation in that country was calm, and south
african tourists did not appear to be in any danger.
</P>
<P>
the embassy said no fighting had been reported and that
citizens were going about freely.
</P>
<P>
it is reported that the coup was headed by army chief of staff,
colonel azali hassounani.
</P>
<P>
troops were reportedly patrolling the streets of the capital
moroni, on the main island of grand comoro.
</P>
<P>
the coup followed unsuccessful attempts to reconcile anjouan
with the two other islands of the comoros.
</P>
<P>
anjouan unilaterally declared independence from the federal
islamic republic of the comoros in august 1997.
</P>
<P>
talks were held in madagascar last week and a preliminary
agreement was reached that each island would receive broad
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
anjouan did not sign the agreement, resulting in two days of
protests in moroni this week.
</P>
<P>
this was reportedly the 18th coup or attempted coup since the
comoros gained independence from france in 1975. enditem

<HEADLINE> sadc projects 1.92m tons maize shortfall this </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
the sadc regional early warning unit said in its monthly update
that harvests for the staple crop in 1999 were forecast to decline
by 13 percent to 14.75 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"incessant rains in southern sadc dampen production prospects
while prolonged dry spells depress yields in some parts," the unit
said.
</P>
<P>
the national crop estimates committee of south africa has
estimated that the harvest for south africa would be reduced by 15
percent to 6.39 million tons although their would still be a 1.28
million exportable surplus.
</P>
<P>
swaziland, forecasted to produce 108,000 tons of maize, would
have a surplus of 18,000 tons while mozambique, where production
increased by six percent this year, might have a domestic maize
surplus of up to 217,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
malawi is also expected to have a maize surplus of 361,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
among the countries projected to have shortages during
1999/2000 marketing season were botswana, lesotho, namibia,
tanzania, zambia and zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
zambia had forecasted a one million ton maize harvest this
year, which was 55 percent higher than last year, but a deficit of
216,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
zimbabwe has already estimated a maize output of 1.54 million
tons which suggest a projected domestic maize deficit of 1.05
million tons for the 1999/2000 marketing year to be covered by
imports.
</P>
<P>
in angola, cereal harvest declined by 30 percent as a result of
the intensification of the civil war between government forces and
unita rebels since december, last year. enditem

<P>
mogadishu, May 1 (xinhua) -- an unofficial cease-fire has been
reached by members representing three islamic courts of south
mogadishu and the militiamen loyal to faction leader mohamed
qanyareh afrah.
</P>
<P>
the development was made thursday night when serious talks took
place between the two sides and a 13-member committee was
established for the implementation of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
although sporadic gunfire was heard early friday morning in
parts of the capital city, the people who worried that the two-day
fighting could degenerate into a clannish one have somehow felt a
bit relieved.
</P>
<P>
the cease-fire committee persuaded the two sides to stop the
fighting near the largest business center of bakara market, which
had killed at least 22 people and wounded 40 others, so as to give
a chance to the mediation role.
</P>
<P>
the mediation is still going on with both the islamic courts
and the joint businessmen on the modalities and ways of ending the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
the hot issues include the future control of the bakara
junction which the three islamic courts have seized thursday
afternoon after afrah's militiamen were pushed back.
</P>
<P>
should the discussions friday afternoon succeed, the current
temporary cease-fire will be officiated and the islamic courts
will be licensed in handling the overall security responsibility
in bakara market area.
</P>
<P>
osman ali atto, another faction leader who is now in mogadishu,
has called upon the warring parties to discuss how to stop their
hostility.
</P>
<P>
atto, a hard-line opposition leader to the banadir
administration of afrah and the islamic courts as well, said that

off early Friday afternoon, delayed one hour by minor technical
problems and overnight thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
But seven hours later at a hastily convened news conference,
Air Force officials said the U.S. Defense Department's newest
Milstar satellite was stranded in a lopsided orbit thousands of
kilometers too low.
</P>
<P>
Air Force controllers will try to boost the satellite using on-
board fuel and thrusters. Starbuck said it was too soon to
speculate what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
The first hint of trouble came in half an hour after the rocket
lifted off.
</P>
<P>
An upper-stage Centaur rocket was supposed to boost the
satellite into a 36,000-kilometer-high orbit. But it did not fire
properly, Starbuck said. There also may have been other problems
earlier in the flight, he said.
</P>
<P>
A different type of upper-stage motor malfunctioned three weeks
ago, leaving a missile-warning satellite in a useless orbit. In
August last year, one of the rockets and a spy satellite were
destroyed in an explosion shortly after liftoff.
</P>
<P>
Starbuck said there appears to be no similarities among the
three failures. It's been decades since the same kind of rocket
failed three times in a row.
</P>
<P>
The satellite was to have joined two less sophisticated
Milstars already in orbit. In all, the Air Force planned six such
satellites to provide secure, jam-proof communication between U.S.
military commanders and troops in the field.
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials stressed that Friday's mishap will not
hamper the military's communications or the nation's security.
</P>
<P>
The Milstar program was criticized by the General Accounting
Office last fall as outdated and inefficient. The satellites were
conceived during the Cold War and designed to withstand the
radiation from a nuclear blast.
</P>
<P>
The three strikes have cost American taxpayers three billion U.
S. dollars

COLOMBO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika

economic development is industrial peace resulting from good
employer-employee relations.

<P>
In her May Day message, President Kumaratunga said, "Among the
challenges that I have mentioned before are to ensure sovereignty

development."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the government needs your cooperation to provide a
solution to the ethnic crisis and to accelerate economic
development through enhanced productivity," she said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year civil war between the
government and the separatist Tamil rebels who are fighting for a

The president has also drawn attention on the need for
employees to be conscious of their obligations while they fight
for their rights.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that we should have a marked change in
attitudes to meet the challenges successfully and also to step

<HEADLINE> Thai Retail Sales to Bottom Out in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's retail industry is
expected to bottom out with a forecast of 10 percent growth in
total sales for the second quarter, The Nation reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Thai Retailers' Association as saying that
despite the zero growth of the retail sector in the first quarter
of 1999, there are many positive signs of recovery in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
It referred to the stimulus package the Thai government
announced at the end of March of reducing the value-added tax,
personal income tax and gas prices, which will have a good
psychological effect on consumers and encourage them to start
spending.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the liquidity situation in the country is improving
with non-performing loans in commercial banks being reduced.
</P>
<P>
The 54-billion-baht (1.45-billion-U.S. dollar) Miyazawa Fund,
which was extended by the Japanese government, also helped
contribute to the cash flow in the rural market.
</P>
<P>
The association predicted that this year's total retail
industry will be worth about 500 billion baht (13.5 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Central Retail Corp, the country's largest retail company
recorded a three percent growth in sales for the first quarter of
this year compared to that of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Sales growth of big retail players has been encouraged by a
declining number of local rivals in the market place, especially
small- and medium-sized retailers, the association said.

<HEADLINE> Kunming Anti-Pollution Campaign Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A month-long Dianchi Lake Cleanup
Campaign, dubbed as "Zero-Hour Action", ended at zero hours today,
with 249 polluting enterprises declared to have met the waste
discharge standards set by the state and four others that have
failed to meet the standards shut down, a Kunming city official
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
"Now the total amount of pollutants discharged by industrial
enterprises into the Dianchi Lake has been reduced by some 85
percent as compared with 1995," said the official in charge of the
"Zero-Hour Action".
</P>
<P>
China's sixth largest fresh water lake, the Dianchi Lake in the
southern suburbs of Kunming has been the city's major water
supplier and "natural air-conditioner" for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, however, it has become one of the
country's most seriously polluted lakes due to rapid urbanization
and industrialization. The city and the local government felt all
the more uneasy after Kunming was chosen to be the host of the '99
International Horticultural Exposition featuring the theme of
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Launched at Zero hours, April 1, the "Zero-Hour Action" aimed
at pressing the 253 enterprises around the Dianchi Lake to clean
up their daily discharges by zero hours of May 1, the date for
the opening of the horticultural show.
</P>
<P>
"Now 249 of these enterprises have managed to meet the state
standards and four others, including the Kunming City Paper Mill,
that failed to do so have been ordered to stop production
immediately or move to other places," said the official.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Yunnan Province to order the shut of
heavily polluting enterprises, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Strictly implementing the "zero hour action", government
officials have carried out random checks at any time of the day of
all enterprises on the "blacklist", while local citizens have been
encouraged to report to the media any major pollutant discharges
into the lake by these enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Under such great pressure, these enterprises had to take steps
to adopt control measures or turn to clean production," said the
official. "Our initial statistics show that this has cost them
some 200 million yuan (about 25 million US dollars)."
</P>
<P>
While pressing the enterprises into action, Kunming has over
the past month launched a fierce battle against major outbreaks of
blue-green algae in the Dianchi Lake, which has been caused by the
rich content of nitrogen and phosphor in the water and the
persisting hot weather in the Kunming area.
</P>
<P>
"Every day we sent out boats to clear the algae, and we also
used some biological drugs to kill it by large quantities," said
the official.

<HEADLINE> China's Xiang Calls For ADB Policies on Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Finance Minister Xiang
Huaicheng said here Saturday that the ADB's policies should
foremost conform to the needs of the developing countries for
economic development.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the 32nd Annual Meeting of the Board of
Governors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Xiang said that the
purpose of fostering economic growth and cooperation shall be the
foundation for the ADB's existence and development.
</P>
<P>
"Only by adhering to this fundamental purpose can the bank move
on the right track, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Helping the poor countries to develop their economy not only
serves the interests of these countries but also contributes to
the economic stability and growth of the developed countries, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Xiang urged the bank to initiate as soon as possible
negotiations on the next replenishment of the Asian Development
Fund.
</P>
<P>
"We noticed that the bank's present financial situation leaves
no room for optimism as it provided necessary support for
countries affected by financial crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that the only fair and effective way to
solve the difficulties is to realize as soon as possible the
general capital increase," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope to see increased transparency at
the ADB's management over financial issues.
</P>
<P>
On setting up a new international financial framework, Xiang
said that nations should join hands in improving regional and
global mechanism for supervising and monitoring risks.
</P>
<P>
"When designing a new financial architecture, it is important
to give full expression to the views and suggestions of the
developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Xiang also briefed the meeting about China's economy and its
pro-active fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
"In 1999, China's economy will grow at a relatively fast rate
on the basis of improved economic structure, better quality and
more efficiency," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To this end, China will continue to expand domestic demand
and consumption by implementing pro-active fiscal policy," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Has 246 Centenarians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- As many as 246 centenarians are
living in this largest metropolis of China, three times the 1990
figure, according to the Shanghai Municipal Committee on Aging.
</P>
<P>
Of them, 188 are females and the eldest is 109 years old.
</P>
<P>
The number of local centenarians soared from the only one in
1953 to 170 in 1996 and it is estimated the figure will top 300 by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The average lifespan for local males climbed from 42 years in
1951 to 75 years in 1998, with the average for local females
rising from 45 to 79 years.
</P>
<P>
The longevity is attributed to the availability of colorful
cultural activities and the improvement of living standards in the
city, along with the establishment of regulations to protect the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1997, Shanghai provided local centenarians with
preferential policies, including free physical examinations and a
subsidy for nutritious food.
</P>
<P>
Hereditary characteristics, hard work, eating more vegetables
and low-fat and non-spicy food create good foundation for
longevity, according to research by the Shanghai No. 2 Medical
Sciences University.

<HEADLINE> Largest Sugar Producer Cuts Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
China's largest sugar producer, has decided to cut its sugar cane-
growing areas by 75,300 ha this year as supply has exceeded demand
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Its sugar output is expected to be cut by 400,000 tons in the
second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has reduced the purchasing price for
sugar cane and encouraged farmers to plant other cash crops to
increase income.
</P>
<P>
Since the State Council, China's cabinet, decided to build
Guangxi into a sugar production base in 1988, the industry has
achieved rapid development.
</P>
<P>
During the 1997-1998 pressing season, Guangxi produced 3.25
million tons of sugar, accounting for 40 percent of the country's
total, fulfiling the target set for the ninth five-year (1996-2000)
plan ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The sugar industry, which has played an important role in
promoting local economic development and increasing local
financial revenues, has become a pillar industry for Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country's annual demand for sugar stands at 7.6
million tons, but output is estimated to reach 8.2 million tons
during the 1998-1999 pressing season.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Rehab Plan Suffers Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL), Philippine
government regulators and major creditors failed to reach
consensus in discussions Friday on the ailing carrier's
rehabilitation plan, Manila Bulletin said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the creditors will meet again on May 15
to formally vote on whether to accept the plan, officials said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday's meeting, PAL's main creditors said they would be
forced to turn down the rehabilitation plan if their conditions
are not met.
</P>
<P>
One creditor, the U.S. Export-Import Bank, rejected the plan
after regulators said PAL cannot be forced to remove its recently
reappointed chief executive, majority shareholder Lucio Tan.
</P>
<P>
In Mid-April, Tan pledged to organize an investor group to pump
200 million U.S. dollars in new equity into the carrier, and
promised to provide at least 100 million U.S. dollars of the total
himself.
</P>
<P>
Among the conditions set by Tan in exchange for the capital
infusion were his return as chief executive and a renegotiation of
some of the terms of the rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
The major creditors, which also include European export credit
agencies, said Tan's conditions will delay the airline's
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Perfecto Yasay, chairman of the country's Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC), told the creditors that once the plan
is approved, the SEC will ensure its terms are strictly followed
by the airline.
</P>
<P>
"Philippine Airlines will be liquidated if it defaults on its
loan payments," he said.
</P>
<P>
PAL is mired in debts totaling 2.2 billion U.S. dollars, of
which more than two-thirds are owed to the U.S. and European
credit agencies which helped finance the airline's ambitious but
ill-timed fleet modernization program.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has repeatedly said it will not use
public funds to bail out the airline.
</P>
<P>
But Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said Friday the
government will not stand in the way if a group of state financial
institutions plows 40 million U.S. dollars into the ailing flag
carrier.

<HEADLINE> Japan Urges ADB to Promote Economic Restructuring in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa urged Saturday the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to
promote financial sector restructuring and corporate debt
restructuring in Asia so as to pave the way for a quick regional
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 32nd annual meeting of the ADB, the Japanese
minister said that in the crisis-affected countries in Asia, there
are some positive signs of recovery: foreign exchange seems more
or less stabilized, the volume of exports is up and stock values
are rising.
</P>
<P>
"The most urgent task in these countries is to put the economy
on a steady track of recovery," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Miyazawa said that massive non-performing loans is causing
a delay in the restoration of soundness in the financial sector in
these countries while corporate debt restructuring has only made
slow progress.
</P>
<P>
The two issues are major impediments to attaining sustained
growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the ADB should use its guarantee
function more actively to help mobilize the capital needed to
restore soundness in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The government and the public sector in each Asian country have
already taken the initiative in re-capitalizing financial
institutions and in acquiring of their non-performing loans, he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Miyazawa said, the amount of capital needed is so
enormous that it must be raised in the international market as
well as in the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The ADB can be of great help to Asian economies by designing a
program to support their financial sector reform and providing
guarantees for external financing, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the corporate debt restructuring, Miyazawa said
that to develop a sound financial sector, corporate debt
restructuring is also indispensable.
</P>
<P>
It is essential for the ADB to provide technical assistance to
support each country's efforts to strengthening its implementation
capacity.

<HEADLINE> Developing Country Capable of Hosting High-Standard Expo, BIE President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The '99 International Horticultural
Exposition is truly first rate and it indicates that developing
countries are capable of hosting high-standard world exposition
just as developed countries are, said Ole Philipson, president of
the International Expositions Bureau (BIE) here.
</P>
<P>
This is the first international horticultural exposition ever
held in a developing country, and it is a result of "enormous work
" by the Chinese government and the local governments of Yunnan
and Kunming, said the BIE president in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese organizers are good at taking advice from
specialists," Mr. Philipson said, adding that the Expo site is
unimaginably beautiful and uniquely colorful.
</P>
<P>
"China is a big country, and you have a lot of talents and
different climates." he said.
</P>
<P>
The BIE president pointed out that the exposition has presented
good opportunities for both the host country and the participating
countries. "In the short run, China can take advantage of the
event to publicize itself while in the long run, every
participating country has its opportunity. It all depends how far
they are willing to go and how they exploit the opportunities," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Describing Yunnan as an "ideal location" for a horticultural
show, the BIE president said the show has also provided an
overwhelming chance for Yunnan, which is already famous for its
climates, for its diversified plant resources and ethnic culture
and for its people.
</P>
<P>
The harmonious coexistence of man and nature is an eternal
theme, Philipson said, and the horticulture show is a mirror
reflecting what is happening in this world.
</P>
<P>
"We have made enormous progress in creating concepts about
environment and human nature, and in working in coordinated steps
to protect the environment," he said. "An exposition like this one
could not solve all the environmental problems, but it at least
points to a path toward coordinated development of man and nature.
"
</P>
<P>
The BIE president expressed the hope that China would have a
chance to host another big and general international exposition in
the future.

<HEADLINE> Italian Pacifists to Stop Jets Flying to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pacifist organization, which calls itself "Blessed Are the
Creators of Peace", said in a statement that it was planning to
fly hundreds of small hot-air balloons and kites and release huge
numbers of children's balloons Saturday afternoon in front of the
gates of the Aviano air base in northeastern Italy.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that this "direct non-violent action" was
aimed at stopping the conflict in Kosovo by hopefully preventing
warplanes based at Aviano from carrying out their strikes against
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"This is a serious proposal which will last the longest time
possible and will be carried out in a non-violent manner," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that non-violent action and civil disobedience are
needed to stop the war. We want to break the speech which has made
people believe that the war is inevitable," it said.
</P>
<P>
"We will probably be stopped but if all pacifists unite and
take part in Saturday's action, there won't be enough prison cells
to take all of us," the statement concluded.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Air Transport, Electricity Sectors Prepared For Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Two of Indonesia's vital sectors
with high-tech equipment have stated their readiness to address
the millennium bug or Y2K issues.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia's air traffic control system has been Y2K compliant
while the entire air transportation system will be compliant by
September," Transportation Minister Giri Suseno was quoted by The
Indonesian Observer Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said there are three systems that must be free from the Y2K
in the air transportation sector.
</P>
<P>
"First is the air traffic control system, which we have already
handled. The second one is all computer-based facilities inside
aircraft and the third is all other air transport computer-based
equipment such as the ticketing and reservation system", Suseno
said.
</P>
<P>
Funds for the Y2K clearance program come from flight operators
and the state airport management body.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sea transportation sector's computerized
financial system used for Customs and Excise handling remains
prone to the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
In the electricity sector, head of state utility PLN's
(electricity company) millennium bug task force Sunggu Aritonang
said that 94 percent of its operating systems are Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the biggest potential Y2K problem areas is
billing for PLN's 26 million consumers. The billing systems are
expected to be fully compliant by September.
</P>
<P>
The other two critical areas are generation and
telecommunications, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said several other countries will hit January 1 earlier than
Indonesia because of international time differences. This will
give PLN a brief window of time to observe how other countries
cope with Y2K problems -- if they arise.
</P>
<P>
The company also said it is confident that it would safely pass
through the critical millennium transition moment.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Attracts More Foreign Funds in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua)-- Tianjin, the largest port city in
northern China, attracted 308 million U.S. dollars in contracted
foreign funds in March, up 1.6 percent over the same month last
year.
</P>
<P>
The city actually used 158 million U.S. dollars in March, up 11
percent on a yearly basis, according to a report by the city's
foreign economic relations and trade commission.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin saw a dicline of its foreign funds in the first two
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter, Tianjin approved the establishment of
127 foreign-funded enterprises, attracted 740 million U.S. dollars
in contracted foreign investment, and actually used 260 million U.
S. dollars of foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Japan, Singapore and the United States led the growth of
foreign investments in Tianjin. Their investments were 255 percent,
106 percent, and 20.8 percent up from the same quarter last year,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, which had no investment in Tianjin in the first
quarter last year, invested nearly 30 million U.S. there in this
year's first quarter.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter, 30 foreign firms increased their
investment by a total of 130 million U.S. dollars, up 32.9 percent
on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Also in the first quarter, statistics on 3,833 foreign-funded
enterprises show that their sales revenues rose 6.1 percent to 20.
8 billion yuan, while their profits rose 6.8 percent to 1.58
billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Bank Says Indonesian Economy to Bottom out in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian economy will bottom
out by the third quarter of 1999 and rebound to a small positive
growth in the fourth quarter, Bank Indonesia said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a report released at an Asian Development Bank (ADB) seminar
here, the bank said that macro-economic stabilization, though
slow, is on track in Indonesia and the economy is "moving toward
gradual improvement."
</P>
<P>
"The economy will bottom out by the third quarter of 1999, and
rebound to a small positive growth in the fourth quarter of 1999
onwards," it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank predicted a growth in the range of minus 1 percent to
minus 3 percent for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The contraction will be precipitated by weak domestic demand,
most notably the private investment, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to an ADB report, Indonesia's gross domestic product
contracted 13.7 percent in 1998 due to the financial crisis, and
may register a zero growth this year.
</P>
<P>
On the external front, the Indonesian bank said, the current
account is predicted to maintain a surplus mainly as a result of
increasing non-oil/gas exports though the growth is still low.
</P>
<P>
Imports are projected to expand after a sharp drop last year,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the financial sector this year will remain
sluggish, as banks are expected to consolidate their capital
structures according to the restructure and re-capitalization
agenda.
</P>
<P>
"Combining all the above factors, the Indonesian economic
recovery is expected to begin during 1999, with renewed growth
finally taking place during the second semester," it said.

<HEADLINE> EU Oil Embargo Against Yugoslavia Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia said on Friday that it is
illegal for the European Union (EU) to impose an oil and petroleum
product embargo on Yugoslavia and Russia preserved the rights to
provide oil and oil products to the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign ministry said in a statement that the EU's
decision of oil embargo and NATO's plan to blockade Yugoslavia are
both against the United Nations' charter.
</P>
<P>
Under the charter, only the UN Security Council has the right
to decide to impose economic sanctions or blockade against a
country, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
NATO's plan to blockade Yugoslavia and prevent ships from going
to Yugoslav ports has no legal basis, the foreign ministry
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided on April 23 to impose an oil and petroleum
product embargo on Yugoslavia. NATO defense ministers who agreed
to the embargo have then authorized the organization's navy to
inspect ships going to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
But Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov has said that NATO's
decision is invalid for Russia.

<TEXT>
<P>
Nepal was founded in the 6th century B.C. The Newars and other
tribes lived in Nepal before the 12th century. Several small
kingdoms were established between the 13th and 17th centuries.
Prithvi Narayan Shah, a king of Gurkha, united Nepal in 1768.
Since then, Nepal has remained an independent state.
</P>
<P>
In 1846, Jung Bahadur Rana carried out a bloody coup and
established a hereditary and all-powerful Rana regime until 1951
when an armed revolution toppled the Ranas and restored King
Tribhuvan to power. King Tribhuvan promulgated an interim
constitution on February 18, 1951 and formed a cabinet consisting
of members of various political groups.
</P>
<P>
After Tribhuvan died in 1955, his son Mahendra succeeded him.
Mahendra approved the first constitution of Nepal in February 1959
and the general election was held. The Nepali Congress won the
election and B.P. Koirala formed the government.
</P>
<P>
But a royal coup took place in December 1960. King Mahendra
dismissed the cabinet and dissolved the parliament. One month
later, he banned all political parties. In December 1962, he
introduced a new constitution, reasserting absolute royal power
and providing for a partyless Panchayat system in the country.
</P>
<P>
In January 1972 King Mahendra died and was succeeded by his
son, Birendra. After students demonstrated nationwide for reforms
in 1979, King Birendra announced a national referendum on whether
to restore multi-party democracy. In the referendum held in May
1980, 54.79 percent of the voters supported the Panchayat system
with reforms.
</P>
<P>
In early 1990, the Nepali Congress and the communists launched
a people's movement in the country, which turned to violent
demonstrations, strikes and mass arrests.
</P>
<P>
Later on, King Birendra agreed to lift the 30-year-old ban on
political parties and abolish the Panchayat system. On November 9,
1990, he officially promulgated a new constitution, introducing a
constitutional monarchy and restoring the multi-party
parliamentary system. General elections were held on May 12, 1991.

<P>
The 1990 constitution replaced the unicameral Rashtriya
Panchayat (National Assembly) with a bicameral legislature
consisting of a 205-member Pratinidi Sabha (House of
Representatives) and a 60-member Rashtriya Sabha (National
Assembly).
</P>
<P>
Election to the House of Representatives is conducted on the
basis of universal adult franchise. For the purpose, the country
is divided into 205 single-member constituencies. The term of the
house is five years but can be extended by one year during an
emergency. It can be dissolved as per provisions of the
constitution before its term expires.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly is a permanent body with a six-year term
of office. Of its 60 members, 10 are nominated by the king, 35 are
elected from the House of Representatives and 15 are elected by an
electoral college. One third of the 60 members retire every two
years.

<HEADLINE> Facts and Figures About Nepal (7) - Key Political Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following is a brief introduction about major political
parties in Nepal and their main candidates contesting the
parliamentary election scheduled for May 3 and May 17.
</P>
<P>
Although a royal decree banned political parties in 1960, they
continued to exist informally. In 1990, a multi-party system was
legalized following three months of unrest and the development of
a new constitution. Under the new electoral laws, parties must
register with the Election Commission. In order to gain
recognition, 5 percent of a party's candidates must be women and a
party must gain at least 3 percent of the total votes cast in the
election to the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Nepali Congress, the Communist Party of Nepal
(Unified Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML) and the Nepal Sadbhavana Party
govern the country.
</P>
<P>
1. The Nepali Congress:
</P>
<P>
The party was formally founded in Calcutta, India on April 9,
1950 as a result of the merger of the Nepali National Congress and
the Nepal Democratic Party. It was the dominant party in the House
of Representatives until late 1994. With the communists, the party
instigated the campaign of civil disobedience that led to the
political reforms in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Main candidates:
</P>
<P>
Girija Prasad Koirala: Prime minister, president and
parliamentary leader of the party, 74. In 1976, he was elected the
party's general secretary. He became the second elected prime
minister in Nepal in May 1991 after his party won a clear majority
in the general elections that month.
</P>
<P>
Krishna Prasad Bhattarai: Prime ministerial candidate, 75. He
was unanimously elected speaker of the first elected parliament in
the country in 1959-60. He was appointed to head an interim
government in April 1990 to draft a new constitution and hold
general elections. He was defeated in the 1991 general elections
and the by-election to the House of Representatives in February
1994.
</P>
<P>
2. The CPN-UML:
</P>
<P>
The party was established in January 1991 as a result of the
merger of the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist) and the
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist). In February 1993, the party
committed itself to working within the democratic multi-party
system. It emerged the single largest party in the mid-term polls
in November 1994 and formed its own minority government which
lasted 9 months. It was split in March 1998 with a group forming
the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist, CPN-ML).
</P>
<P>
Main Candidates:
</P>
<P>
Man Mohan Adhikari: Late party chairman and prime ministerial
candidate. He died on April 26, 1999 at the age of 79. He fell ill
all of a sudden on April 19 when he was on an election campaign in
Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
Madhav Kumar Nepal: Party general secretary, 46. He was deputy
prime minister and minister for defense and foreign affairs from
November 30, 1994 to September 11, 1995.
</P>
<P>
3. Nepal Sadbhavana Party:
</P>
<P>
The party was founded in 1990 as an advocate for the interests
of the nation's Madhesiya community, who are of Indian origin and
reside in the Terai plain in southern Nepal. The party demands
that the government recognize Hindi as an official language, that
constituencies in the Terai be allocated on the basis of
population and that the government grant citizenship to those who
settled in Nepal before April 1990.
</P>
<P>
Main Candidate:
</P>
<P>
Gajendra Narayan Singh: Party president and minister for
industry, 69. He was a one-time member of the Nepali Congress and
former member of the dissolved Rashtriya Panchayat (National
Assembly). He was founder and convenor of the central working
committee of the Nepal Sadbhavana Parishad, which was changed into
Nepal Sadbhavana Party in April 1990.
</P>
<P>
4. The National Democratic Party (RPP):
</P>
<P>
The center-right party was founded in January 1992 following a
merger of RPP (Chand) and RPP (Thapa) which were both founded in
May 1990. The RPP mainly comprised monarchists and former
Panchayat supporters. It split again into two factions in January
1998.
</P>
<P>
Main Candidate:
</P>

</P>
<P>
5. The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist, CPN-ML):
</P>
<P>
The party was formed in March 1998 after 40 members of
parliament led by Sahana Pradhan and Bam Dev Gautam broke away
from the CPN-UML. It was recognized that month as a parliamentary
party. It joined the Nepali Congress minority government on August
25, 1998 and quit on December 10, 1998, forcing Prime Minister
Girija Prasad Koirala to recommend fresh elections.
</P>
<P>
Main Candidates:
</P>
<P>
Sahana Pradhan: Party president, 67. She was widow of late
Pushpa Lal Shrestha, founder of the Communist Party of Nepal. She
led the United Left Front in the 1990 people's movement against
the Panchayat system. She was minister for industry in 1991 and
minister for women and social welfare in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Bam Dev Gautam: Party general secretary, 51. He was deputy
prime minister and home minister for 7 months from January 1996.
He was main opposition leader since December 1998.
</P>
<P>
6. The National Democratic Party (RPP, Chand):
</P>
<P>
The party was formally recognized in parliament on January 16,
1998 after 10 MPs led by former prime minister Lokendra Bahadur
Chand broke away from the RPP.
</P>
<P>
Main Candidate:
</P>
<P>
Lokendra Bahadur Chand: Party's parliamentary leader, 60. He
entered the Panchayat politics in 1968. He was prime minister
during July 1983 and March 1986. He was appointed prime minister
on April 6, 1990 to hold talks with party leaders for stopping the
mass movement throughout the country, but resigned on April 17,
1990 following the people's movement against the Panchayat system.
He was prime minister from March 12, 1997 to October 4, 1997.

<HEADLINE> World's Biggest Polyethylene Plant Opens in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The joint venture of Thailand's Siam
Cement and U.S.-based Dow Chemical has opened what is said to be
the world's largest polyethylene plant in terms of capacity in
Rayong province, eastern Thailand, the Bangkok Post reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 100 million U.S. dollars facility of Siam Polyethylene Co
is capable of producing 300,000 tons of polyethylene a year,
further augmenting the joint venture's production to 400,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The new plant would supply polyethylene to the growing
thermoplastics market in Southeast Asia, a manager of the joint
venture was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the new plant would focus on linear low-density
polyethylene, a raw material for the packaging industry.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 12 years, Dow and Siam Cement have invested about
500 million U.S. dollars in joint ventures in petrochemical
industries in Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government to Punish Bad Bankers, Debtors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government would take
legal action against bad bankers and debtors, responsible for at
least 150 trillion rupiah (16 billion U.S. dollars) of bad debts
in the country's ailing banking industry.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Bambang Subianto said efforts to settle the
massive amount of nonperforming loans would not only involve debt
restructuring measures, but also include a probe into violations
of bank prudential regulations.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the nonperforming loans are linked to bad lending
practices. That's why efforts to resolve the bad debt problem
won't be achieved only through restructuring measures," he was
quoted by The Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bambang said legal action as well as transparency in the debt
restructuring measures were necessary to prevent moral
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
In March, the government banned 172 bankers of the 38 closed
banks from traveling out of the country, but is yet to take a
similar measure against bad debtors.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) has taken on
over 100 trillion rupiah in bad debts from the country's seven
state banks.
</P>
<P>
The agency has also taken over more than 120 trillion rupiah in
bad debts of 40 closed private banks, nine recapitalized banks and
11 banks which were taken over.
</P>
<P>
The government failed to meet the April 30 deadline -- promised
in a recent letter of intent to the International Monetary Fund --
to reach a loan workout agreement with 20 of the largest state
bank debtors.
</P>
<P>
The government said it would take bankruptcy or liquidation
measures against debtors who failed to agree to the restructuring
plans.
</P>
<P>
The paper said it is no longer a secret that the 20 largest
debtors -- which according to IBRA owed more than half of the
nonperforming loans of state banks -- are companies controlled by
politically well-connected businessmen, including the siblings of
former president Soeharto and their associates.

<HEADLINE> Grottoes Found in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have found 34
grottoes while carrying out a recent maintenance scheme at the
Grottoes of A Thousand Buddhas in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Most of them are dilapidated with no murals. Nearly 90 percent
of the caves were lived in by monks, and were used as storehouses,
said Chen Shiliang, Head of the Research Institute of the Guizi
Grottoes.
</P>
<P>
The Grottoes of A Thousand Buddhas, located in Kizir, is the
largest group of grottoes in the Western Regions -- an ancient
term for the area west of Yumenguan -- which includes what is now
Xinjiang and parts of Central Asia. It is composed of 236 caves in
which 10,000 square meters of murals were painted. It is regarded
as one of the four leading grottoes in China together with the
grottoes at Dunhuang, Longmen and Yungang, which are under top
state protection.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have unearthed large amounts of wooden/parchment
strips used for writing on during ancient times, coins, remnants
of Buddhist sutras as well as pottery, wood, stone and iron wares
used in Guizi State of Western Regions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, over 400 murals depicting stories of Buddha's previous
incarnation and 1,000 murals recording stories on the primary and
secondary causes of Buddhism were found painted on walls in the
Grottoes of A Thousand Buddhas.
</P>
<P>
"This was the largest number of murals ever found in either
China or world," Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Cuts Overnight Rates for 12th Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Being confident that the April
inflation rate will decelerate further from 8.7 percent in March,
the Philippine Central Bank announce Friday a 12.5-basis-point cut
in its overnight policy rates effective next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Today newspaper said Saturday the move will bring the Central
Bank's overnight borrowing rate to 10.25 percent and overnight
lending rate to 12.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is the 12th cut in the Central Bank's overnight rates this
year, aimed at further reducing the cost of borrowed funds to
stimulate economic activities.
</P>
<P>
The rate cut is expected to induce a further reduction in
Treasury bill (T-bill) rates and commercial banks' lending rates
next week, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson was quoted by the
paper as saying early this week that there was still room for the
central bank's policy interest rates to go down--even to a
single-digit level.
</P>
<P>
There were earlier speculations that the Central Bank might
wait first for the announcement of the April inflation rate before
bringing down further its overnight interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Singson, however, pointed out that inflation is just one of the
factors that the monetary authorities consider in making a
decision on changes in the Central Bank's policy rates.
</P>
<P>
"We also consider the movement of the exchange rate and T-bill
rates," he said.
</P>
<P>
The peso-dollar rate has been relatively stable this week
despite a liquidity boost in the financial system, while T-bill
rates fell during last Monday's auction.

<HEADLINE> China's Color TV Market Still Has Potential: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- China's color TV market still has
much potential to be tapped, though a recent across the board
price cut has made market competition red hot, according to
experts attending a national electronics product fair here.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the color TVs in urban families were bought
ten years ago, and the general life of a color TV is around that
time, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, nearly 70 million color TVs in urban areas will be
replaced by new and more advanced models in the coming years,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that China's color TV ownership has been
growing at a rate of 2.5 million sets in the urban areas and eight
million units in the rural areas annually.

Color TV is a must for the urban newly-wed while 25 percent of
the new couples in the countryside buy this item when they tie the
knot, according to official estimates.
</P>
<P>
Calculated on this basis, the demand for color TVs by the newly-
married alone reaches five million sets each year, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, some 200 million of China's 1.2 billion population,
mainly in the poverty-stricken and ethnic minority areas, do not
have access to TV, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese authorities are set to raise the TV coverage rate
to 90 percent of the population by the year 2000, which means much
market potential for TV manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
To obtain and maintain a market share, China's leading color TV
producers waged a price war early this month, with the price
reduction rate ranging as high as 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Following the latest price cut, a 21-inch color TV now sells
for as low as 1,300 yuan (about 150 US dollars).

<HEADLINE> New Airport Opened in Southern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- With the opening of a new airport
at the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture prior to the opening
of the Expo '99 here, southwest China's Yunnan province has thus
had air services to all its hot tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
The air service network is expected to ease the communications
bottleneck that has held back the development of tourism and
economy as a whole in the province and may well cope with the
anticipated tourism boom during the six-month run of the China '99
International Horticultural Exposition.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is a province renowned for its picturesque scenery and
ethnic customs and conventions. Some 94 percent of the land in the
province are mountainous.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has invested more than two billion yuan in airport
construction over the past decade. It has built five new airports
in Xishuangbanna, Mangshi, Lijiang, Dali and Diqing, and renovated
four others. Now Yunnan has the largest number of second- and
first-class civil airports in the nation's province-level regions.
</P>
<P>
The China '99 Kunming International Horticulture Exposition,
which was launched on April 30 and will last 184 days, is expected
to attract more than ten million visitors, with about a quarter of
them expected to travel by air.
</P>
<P>
To cope with anticipated tourist influx, Yunnan has invested
nearly one billion yuan since 1998 in expanding and renovating the
existing airports.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Yunnan Airlines show that Yunnan has so far
opened air routes to 96 cities outside the province and foreign
cities, with the number of daily flights exceeding 100. The number
of flights from Kunming to places of interest inside the province
has also increased to more than 330.

<HEADLINE> Rising Temperature Changes Tibetans' Lifestyle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sixtyseven-year-old Dawa, a resident in Lhasa, the capital of
Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest China, says that his family
had to buy a refrigerator recently to keep meat and other food
from spoiling.
</P>
<P>
The warm weather has also brought good opportunities for
businessmen. Coca-Cola, beer, refrigerators and air conditioners
enjoy good sales in Lhasa. In shopping malls, winter clothes have
been replaced by summer ones.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the regional meteorological bureau predict that
Tibet's temperature will continue to rise this year. They say that
the region's average temperature reached a record 9 degrees
Centigrade in 1998 compared with 6.4 degrees in 1963.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jiang, a cadre from Hainan Province in south China, finds
that the various kinds of winter clothes he brought with him when
he came to work in Tibet are useless. Chen used to think that the
Tibet was covered by ice and snow even in spring.
</P>
<P>
Tibet, also dubbed the "roof of the world", used to be
considered a very cold place due to its high altitude and the big
difference in temperature between day and night.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three decades, Tibet's temperature has risen an
average of 0.053 degrees each year, according to the regional
meteorological bureau.
</P>
<P>
Warm weather also helps spur the local tourism industry. In
March, a 300-member U.S. delegation visited Tibet, the largest
tourism delegation ever received.
</P>
<P>
Rising temperatures on the plateau provide favorable conditions
for the growth of vegetation. It is reported that the mountains
around Lhasa which used to be covered by snow all year round have
been covered by green plants in summer.
</P>
<P>
But the water levels of lakes in Tibet have dropped due to the
lack of rainfall and the rising temperature.
</P>
<P>
Dawa doubts that the warm weather would melt the snow on the
mountains. But experts say that Tibet will keep its original
features as there is no abrupt change in temperature in the near
future.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Glacier Findings in South China River Canyon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A large area of mortar shaped
rocks created by melting ice that was formed in the Glacial Epoch
some 2-3 million years ago has been found in Longjing River Canyon
in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Glacier mortars are valued by scientists as strong proof of the
existence of the Ice Age and provide important evidence for the
climatic changes of the prehistoric age.
</P>
<P>
Han Tonglin, a scientist from the China Academy of Geography,
and Guo Keyi from the China Geographic Museum discovered the
glacier site 45 km to the west of Fengshun County. There are more
than 1,000 rocks, the largest one over 10 meters in diameter and 6
meters deep.
</P>
<P>
The scientists believe that the Longjing River was formed by a
ravine glacier in the Glacier Epoch and carries the same features
as other similar sites found in Guangdong and Hainan provinces
which belong to the subtropical and tropical region. It is
believed to be the largest site of such rocks found in China.
</P>
<P>
The find has further proved that the eastern part of China was
afflicted by glaciers in the Quaterary Period several million
years ago.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges "Creative" Approach in Solving Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Diplomatic initiatives to solve the
Kosovo stalemate, such as Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin's
return trip to Belgrade, should lay the accent on "activism and
creativity", Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Reporting to the cabinet on his talks with Chernomyrdin and a
long phone conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton Thursday
evening, D'Alema said the main issue was "the nature and structure
of the international military force that is to be deployed in
Kosovo under the aegis of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
He explained that the Italian strategy in solving the Kosovo
crisis is firmness on the military level and a parallel search for
a diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema stressed that two diplomatic moves should be adopted to
realize the strategy: NATO stops its air raids once Yugoslavia
pulls out its forces from Kosovo and accepts NATO's terms; and the
UN Security Council approves a force to help displaced Kosovars
return home and sets up a sort of protectorate for an autonomous
Kosovo within Serbia.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent NATO summit in Washington had shown the
Alliance's ambition to evolve towards a security structure
stretching "from Albania to the states of Central Asia".

PRAGUE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Ministry of Finance
Thursday issued 29.33 billion korun's (about 862.6 million U.S.
dollars) worth of national bonds to make up for the huge deficits
in its national finance in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Czech government spokesman Libor Roucek said the national
bonds, the largest issuance in recent years, had a 15-year
maturity. By the end of 1998, the national debts of the Czech
Republic amounted to 194.7 billion korun (5.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Economists here noticed that the bonds were issued at a time
when the Czech economy was in continued recession and its
financial conditions were getting worse.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Czech gross domestic product (GDP) slumped by 2.7
percent and financial deficits hit 26.3 korun (185 million dollars)
.

Economists have also made a gloomy forecast for the economic
prospects this year. Its GDP is expected to drop by 0.8 percent

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Sir Alf Ramsey, who led England to
win the World Cup in 1966, has died at the age of 79.
</P>
<P>
His former club Ipswich Town said that Ramsey died on Wednesday
at a nursing home in Ipswich in eastern England.
</P>
<P>
Ramsey played 32 times for England before going on to manage
the national team from 1963 to 1974.
</P>
<P>
Ramsey, who was knighted by Britain's Queen Elizabeth in 1967
after the World Cup triumph, had suffered a mild stroke last June.
</P>
<P>
In his playing career he was regarded as one of the most
cultured defenders to wear an England shirt. But he will be best

<HEADLINE> Robson Denies Gascoigne Drinking Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League football
club Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson has strongly denied claims
that his controversial midfielder Paul Gascoigne is back on the
bottle.
</P>
<P>
The former England international has missed his side's last
three games, sparking rumors that he had returned his heavy
drinking ways of last summer.
</P>
<P>
"Let's make this nice and clear. Gazza hasn't been drunk at all.
He is still getting treatment from the clinic or a bit of
counseling from it, and they are quite happy with the way Paul is
going," said Robson.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy with Paul at the club as far as he is going about
things - and that's the end of the story."
</P>
<P>
The player suffered a dead leg during the 2-1 victory at
Coventry a fortnight ago and was due to make his return to action
for the reserves in midweek.
</P>
<P>
But after aggravating the injury in training, he was ruled out
of the derby game at Newcastle on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Manager: We Play for Pride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League soccer club
Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli has defended his club's spiraling
wage bill and insisted: "My players don't play for money - they
play for their pride."
</P>
<P>
Chelsea came out top of the pay league when it was revealed
yesterday that the Stamford Bridge wage bill had jumped this year
by a staggering 81 per cent.
</P>
<P>
But player-manager Vialli refuted claims that his squad were
over-paid superstars, and insisted they cared passionately about
their football.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody here plays for money," said Vialli. "I know what I earn
but I don't think about it when I go out and play.
</P>
<P>
"You can have plenty of money in the bank but it doesn't matter
when all you want to do is play football.
</P>
<P>
"Only have to look at my players and see how unhappy they are
when they are left on the bench. They just want to play and money
doesn't come into it - they don't play for money they play for
their own pride.
</P>
<P>
"That is the attitude a true professional has and that is the
kind of player I have here."
</P>
<P>
Vialli also insisted that Chelsea's wage structure was not that
different from most other clubs. The reason some of his players
were on high salaries, he said, was that they did not cost world
record transfer fees.
