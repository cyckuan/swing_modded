<HEADLINE> 76ers Trade Grant for Billy Owens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia 76ers re-signed forward  
Harvey Grant on Friday, then traded him and guard Anthony Parker to 
the Orlando Magic for forward Billy Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, an eight-year veteran who was traded from the Seattle  
SuperSonics to Orlando on June 30, averaged 7.8 points, 3.8 
rebounds and 21.5 minutes last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Billy's versatility on the court will allow us to utilize our  
personnel more to our advantage,'' Sixers general manager Billy 
King said. ``For his size, Billy is a great ballhandler, rebounder, 
and has great knowledge of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens was signed as a free agent by the Sonics on Jan. 22 after  
playing three seasons with the Sacramento Kings. Because of 
injuries, he played in only 21 of Seattle's 50 games, starting 19. 
He missed the final 19 games because of a strained left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, an 11-year veteran, appeared in 47 games for the Sixers  
last year, averaging 3.1 points, 2.3 rebounds and 17 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker was placed on the injured list Feb. 16 with a fractured  
left foot and played in only two games. He averaged 1.9 points in 
37 games in 1997-98.

<HEADLINE> TBS Pulls Plug on Women's Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Facing high costs and stiff competition, Time  
Warner's Turner Broadcasting System has suspended development of a 
new cable network aimed at women. 
</P>
<P>
	TBS will devote the resources instead to two other networks in  
development, a new cartoon channel and a regional Southeastern 
channel, as well as promoting its younger networks like Turner 
Classic Movies and CNN Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
	TBS, in a statement released Friday, said it was ``not in the  
company's best interest or in the best interests of our affiliates 
to actively pursue the creation of the Women's Network at this 
time.'' The story was first reported in The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The project, which had been in development for a year but  
announced just two months ago, would have faced stiff competition 
for female TV audiences from the already successful Liftetime 
channel and a new channel from Oxygen Media being developed by 
veteran TV producer Geraldine Laybourne and talk show host Oprah 
Winfrey. Oxygen has won backing from several major investors, 
including Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	TBS did not say how much money it had earmarked for the new  
women's channel, which would have also included the participation 
of two magazine publishers, Time Inc., which is also part of Time 
Warner, and Conde Nast, publisher of Mademoiselle, Vogue and 
Glamour. 
</P>
<P>
	Katherine Styponias, a media analyst at Prudential Securities,  
called Time Warner's move to put the women's network on hold ``a 
smart financial decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're starting a third women's channel, you would have to  
spend significantly on promotion in addition to all the programming 
costs,'' she said. ``I applaud Time Warner for taking a critical 
view from a financial perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TBS already had two other new cable channels in the works:  
Turner South, due to launch in October, will focus on the Southeast 
region; and Boomerang, scheduled to start next April, will offer 
classic cartoon shows from the company's Hanna-Barbera library like 
the Flintstones and the Jetsons. 
</P>
<P>
	TBS' Cartoon Network started out as a showcase for Hanna-Barbera  
cartoons but has recently been airing more original programming and 
contemporary cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
	TBS had planned to put Pat Mitchell, an award-winning producer  
at CNN, in charge of the new channel.

<HEADLINE> Sox Call Up Wells Just for Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago White Sox recalled Kip Wells to pitch  
Friday's first game of a doubleheader and then sent him back to the 
minors after he beat the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells improved to 2-0 in two starts with Chicago with a 4-2 over  
Texas, but will most likely finish the minor league season with the 
Double-A Birmingham Barons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's part of the game,'' Wells said. ``I didn't expect  
to walk in here and take over. They've got five guys in the 
rotation. Six won't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells allowed one run on three hits and three walks in five  
innings. The right-hander has struck out 10 batters in 10 1-3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielder Darrin Jackson, who had been sidelined with a sore  
back, was activated from the disabled list to take Wells' spot on 
the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Infielder Liu Rodriguez was optioned to Brimingham prior to the  
doubleheader to make room for Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, the No. 1 selection in the June 1998 draft, won his major  
league debut Aug. 2 at Detroit. He gave up two runs on six hits in 
5 1-3 innings before being optioned back to Birmingham.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Holds Cards in Budget Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Another autumn, another budget showdown  
between President Clinton and the Republican Congress. And once 
again, Clinton seems to be in a commanding position. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton can -- and will -- veto the GOP's tax cuts, the crown  
jewel of the party's legislative agenda, apparently without paying 
much of a price. The healthy economy has bred ambivalence toward 
tax reductions, and the consequence of a veto is a politically 
harmless continuation of current tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republicans will be pressured to cede Clinton at  
least some of the extra billions for education and other domestic 
programs that he and many from both parties want. Without at least 
a temporary agreement on spending, federal agencies would shut down 
when fiscal 2000 begins Oct. 1, a scenario Republicans are 
determined to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's leverage may be so great that a grand deal involving  
tax cuts, higher spending and Medicare changes, like creating a 
prescription drugs benefit, may hinge on one question: Does he 
think an agreement would enhance his impeachment-tarred legacy? 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton has always wanted some policy achievement ... and he's  
got the cards,'' said Dan Palazzolo, a University of Richmond 
political scientist who has written about Washington's budget wars. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Clinton must decide whether a budget compromise would  
be legacy material. After the projected $1 trillion surplus is 
divided among tax cuts and a host of programs, it may not produce 
much for the history books. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see these as major policy accomplishments for the  
ages,'' said Mark Rozell, political science professor at Catholic 
University in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving for their August recess, Republicans sent Clinton  
a 10-year, $792 billion bill showering tax cuts on families, 
businesses and investors. Clinton will welcome lawmakers back to 
the capital next month by vetoing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration advisers said Friday that Clinton will ask  
Republicans to take the first step toward compromise by coming up 
with their own plan for Medicare prescription drug coverage and 
long-term stability for the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would provide the basis for the president, the Democrats  
and the Republicans to work together,'' said White House economic 
adviser Gene Sperling. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress will also try finishing the 13 annual spending bills  
financing federal agencies. Due to disputes over money, 
environmental provisions and other issues, some will probably fall 
short of congressional approval or be vetoed. By then, Republicans 
hope to have shored up their position. 
</P>
<P>
	They are spending August staging town-hall meetings aimed at  
pumping up tax cut enthusiasm. And by Oct. 1, they plan to pass 
legislation temporarily keeping agencies open at last year's 
spending levels -- hoping to prevent Clinton from accusing them of 
slashing popular programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have restrained spending and tried to cut taxes,'' said  
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, describing the GOP message 
at that point. ``This is who we are. Now we can come together and 
try to find a solution'' with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The public has an interest in tax cuts, according to recent  
polls, but that interest diminishes when they are asked whether 
they would rather have a tax cut or funding for specific programs 
like Social Security, education or health care. 
</P>
<P>
	The soft support for tax cuts could be explained in an ABC News  
poll taken at the end of July that showed about half think tax cuts 
are most beneficial to the wealthy -- three times the number who 
think middle-income people benefit the most. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, each side is divided over whether to compromise or take  
the budget issue to the election, and leaders are talking tough. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay says Republicans will force Clinton ``on his knees'' by  
maneuvering him into demanding to spend Social Security surpluses, 
which both parties have declared off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has told congressional  
Democrats that the White House prefers a deal, but would be content 
to simply win some spending fights, participants say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Much better that we pay down debt substantially this year and  
prove unable to establish a framework for the future than that we 
take commitments this year that mortgage the future in a major way. 
That's a place the president's not going to be willing to go,'' 
Summers told reporters Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Further clouding GOP prospects is history. Clinton has won every  
major budget clash with his Republican rivals.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Defector Works Out for Nets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Lazaro Borrell, one of four Cuban  
basketball players who defected at the Olympic qualifying 
tournament in Puerto Rico last month, could have a shot at playing 
for the New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	Borrell worked out at the Nets' practice facility for the second  
straight day Friday, and general manager John Nash said the team is 
considering inviting him to training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's likely,'' Nash said. ``He makes shots, he's athletic  
enough to play small forward and I like the fact that he's had 
success in international competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Borrell, 26, defected along with teammates Roberto Herrera,  
Angel Cabellero and Hector Pino prior to Cuba's game against the 
United States on July 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Borrell, who has been staying in Puerto Rico ever since, caught  
a flight to Newark, N.J. to work out for the Nets. The team put him 
through numerous shooting drills Friday, using a translator to help 
provide instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	Borrell, who stands 6-foot-8, made 13 of 25 shots from NBA  
3-point range at the conclusion of his one-hour workout, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
	He played professionally in Argentina the past two seasons under  
an agreement with the Cuban basketball federation, averaging 29.8 
points per game in 1997-98 and 20.8 points last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's intriguing at this point,'' Nash said. ``We'll monitor  
his situation and decide if we want to take him on.''

<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia's key stock index surged  
up 6 percent Friday on news that Morgan Stanley Capital 
International will reinstate Malaysia in its international stock 
indexes in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip stocks on the  
Kuala Lumpur stock exchange, closed at 772.88 points, up 43.92 
points.

	An initial buying frenzy sent the index up 10 percent to top 800

<P>
	Morgan Stanley's decision Thursday to reinstate Malaysia to its  
indexes, widely used by global fund managers to allocate 
investments, comes 11 months after Kuala Lumpur was expelled 
following the imposition of sweeping capital controls on Sept. 1. 
Those controls were relaxed in February, and taxes on investment 
gains are being lowered.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Cops Indicted on Drug Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Six police officers were indicted Friday on  
charges of robbing and beating people on the streets of their 
precinct and hoarding money, guns and drugs from illegal searches 
of suspected drug houses. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers were charged with federal civil rights conspiracy,  
which carries a maximum sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a 
$250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the officers, Rodney Rice, 40, Irvin Lamont Upshaw, 41,  
and Larone Cook, 31, are also charged with taking bribes for 
protecting drug traffickers and possessing drugs and the equipment 
used to distribute them, such as scales for weighing. 
</P>
<P>
	Conspiracy to distribute controlled substances carries a maximum  
sentence of 20 years in prison and a $1 million fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The six worked in the 5th Precinct, a hotbed of police  
corruption in a force rocked by scandal. The latest indictments are 
the result of a joint investigation between police and the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, a former officer was sentenced to 10 years in prison for  
conspiracy to rob a numbers operator. Two other former officers 
from the precinct also were convicted in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten former officers from a different precinct were indicted in  
1997 on charges of conspiring to steal money, drugs and guns from 
drug dealers and others while on duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lose credibility as an organization,'' Police Chief Charles  
Wilson said. The public needs ``to have full confidence that we are 
law-abiding as much as law-upholding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Accused officer Mark Heath told television station WDIV that  
he's innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thirteen years of hard work, it's all down the drain,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other officers charged are Antonio Carlisi, 26 and  
Christopher Cole, 37.

<HEADLINE> Stakes Are High at Iowa Straw Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) -- Belying the carnival-like atmosphere of  
the Iowa straw poll, presidential campaigns could rise or fall on 
the Saturday night vote. Front-runner George W. Bush's campaign was 
particularly confident and the other candidates acknowledged he was 
the man to beat. 
</P>
<P>
	With free food and free music, the straw poll had the appearance  
of a political free-for-all. But it is much more than that to nine 
Republican presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only thing shaping the race for a while,'' said  
Rich Galen, a GOP political operative who flew from Washington to 
witness the spectacle. ``We'll have no way to measure what's going 
on other than polls and money for months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``straw poll'' is an unscientific beauty contest, eerily  
unpredictable. Not once has the straw poll winner gone on to win 
the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Any Iowa resident with a ticket ($25 each, purchased by  
campaigns for anybody who asks) can cast a vote after a day of free 
food, live music and curious sideshows -- such as the sight of 
Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson riding his Harley Davidson in support 
of Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush aides said Friday they expected to far exceed their goal of  
5,000 votes in the straw poll, and were looking for a big win. A 
convincing victory would suggest that he can organize at local 
levels. A weak showing would tarnish the aura of inevitability Bush 
has so carefully crafted since his landslide re-election in Texas 
in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He has spent at least $750,000 on the straw poll, but the figure  
does not include priceless aid provided by trade associations and 
state politicians who know how to organize in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	His campaign will dispatch 100 buses across the state to haul  
voters to the Ames, Iowa, site. Aides estimate that 300 to 400 of 
the supporters will be Hispanic, newcomers to Iowa GOP politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of you may have never participated'' in Republican events  
like Saturday's straw poll, Bush told Hispanic leaders here Friday. 
``It's important that you participate, important that you come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes, a millionaire conservative seeking his first  
elective office, is expected to be competitive with Bush. He must 
do well to show that his money and message can convert to votes; a 
poor showing, even in a straw poll, could raise questions about his 
electability. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making no predictions on win, place or show,'' Forbes  
said Friday after his bus rolled into the fairground blaring 
``Stars and Stripes Forever'' from a loudspeaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has easily topped the $1 million mark to rent buses,  
throw parties for supporters, staff phone banks, mail recruitment 
letters and air television advertisements. He bought a half-hour of 
time Friday night for a televised town hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Little-known Washington activist Gary Bauer could make a name  
for himself with a top-tier finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, a former domestic policy adviser in the Reagan White  
House, has quietly canvassed Iowa churches and plumbed his contacts 
with the home-schooling community. He hopes to replicate the work 
of religious broadcaster Pat Robertson, who won the 1987 straw poll 
in a shocker that demonstrated the below-the-radar power of social 
conservative voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a chance for a shocker,'' Bauer said Friday.  
``There may be a few surprises like a significant number of 
minorities supporting me. I think it would be a shock if I finished 
in the top half considering I don't have the money like Bush or 
Forbes, and I'm not a celebrity like Elizabeth Dole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole is the other big question mark. The former president of the  
American Red Cross is drawing huge crowds of young and professional 
women, who may or may not turn out Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The straw poll likely is Lamar Alexander's last stand. The  
former Tennessee governor, who has focused all his energies on 
Iowa, needs to show his political organization is worth keeping 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
	He must finish third, maybe fourth, to remain viable,  
Alexander's supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Quayle has not made Saturday do-or-die, but his campaign  
needs a boost. 
</P>
<P>
	He likes to say that, as a former vice president, nobody doubts  
he is ready to be president but they wonder if he could get 
elected. The straw poll may be Quayle's best and last chance to 
show that he is a serious vote-getter. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan is competing against Quayle and Bauer to carry the  
mantle for social conservatives. He was the top conservative 
candidate in 1992 and 1996, and could show Saturday that he is 
still a force. ``Do not let anyone buy your straw poll,'' he said 
Friday during a local radio interview. ``Do not let anyone buy your 
caucuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Keyes is a marginal threat to win the nomination, but drew  
several hundred staunch conservatives to the 1996 Iowa poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch is a late-comer to the race. He is trying  
to build his base, beginning with fellow Mormons. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona has nothing to win or lose Saturday.  
He called the poll a ``sham'' and refused to participate. 
</P>
<P>
	The straw poll is strictly a GOP event, despite the presence in  
the state of the two Democrats vying for their party's nomination. 
Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley were taking 
advantage of the concentration of media in Iowa for the straw poll.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared today as a new government report  
suggested inflation remains in check, raising hopes that the 
Federal Reserve need not be aggressive in raising interest rates to 
cool off the economy. At the close of trading on Wall Street, the 
Dow Jones industrial average was up 184.26 at 10,973.65, a gain of 
1.7 percent. For the week, the blue-chip index gained 259.62 
points. Broader stock indicators were also sharply higher and the 
Nasdaq composite index gained 85.67 points to 2,635.16. Leading the 
Dow industrials were American Express and J.P. Morgan. On the

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Iridium LLC slid into Chapter 11 today, unable  
to pay its debts on a satellite-based mobile phone network that 
cost billions to build but attracted only thousands of users. The 
international consortium, led by Motorola, said it is filing for 
protection from its creditors in a Delaware court under Chapter 11 
of the federal bankruptcy code. Iridium, the first of four 
satellite phone networks to offer service, stumbled out of the 
starting gate last November. Iridium shares closed down 1 3/16 at 3

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Continuing problems with data transmission  
technology provided by MCI WorldCom Inc. caused the Chicago Board 
of Trade to halt electronic trading today and disrupted high-speed 
service for nearly 30 percent of MCI's global data network 
customers. The problems at MCI WorldCom, the No. 2 U.S. 
long-distance carrier, began late last week during a system 
upgrade, when a glitch in its network kept customers from 
transferring information and partially disabled thousands of 
automated teller machines across the country. MCI stock rose 2 9/16

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pfizer Inc. has stopped development of an  
experimental drug to treat nerve damage from diabetes, joining 
other big drug companies that have failed to find a cure for the 
often-debilitating condition. About half of the 16 million 
diabetics in the United States eventually will suffer from diabetic 
neuropathy, a complication characterized by extreme pain or loss of 
feeling in the hands and feet. Pfizer was in late-stage human 
testing of its drug Alond when the company realized it found no 
improvement in patients taking the pill. Pfizer stock closed up

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Falling prices for beef, vegetables and fruit  
partially offset a July increase in the cost of gasoline to nudge 
up wholesale prices by a modest 0.2 percent, the Labor Department 
reported today. Last month's increase in the Producer Price Index, 
which measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, 
followed a 0.1 percent drop in wholesale prices in June, the second 
decline this year. And excluding the volatile energy and food 
categories, wholesale prices were unchanged in July, after a 0.2 
percent decline in June.

	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- South Africa's third-largest  
airline, which was mostly black-owned, closed down today because of 
undisclosed financial losses. The government board that rules on 
major acquisitions said Sun Air was ``a failing company'' and it 
was in the public interest to ensure an orderly shutdown. The board 
signed off yesterday on a plan to sell Sun Air's black-owned shares 
to South African Airlines, the country's largest carrier. It also 
approved the subsequent liquidation.

because angry residents in the area blocked supplies from reaching 
the company's platforms. Texaco Overseas Petroleum Co. of Nigeria

said today that it lost 147 billion rubles, or $5.9 billion, last 
year as a result of Russia's financial crisis and a global slump in 
energy prices. The loss compared to a net profit of 20 billion 
rubles in 1997, the company's Web site said. That would be worth 
$800 million at current conversion rates, but about $3 billion at 
the conversion rate in effect in 1997.

	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Days after aluminum giant Alcoa Inc. made  
an unsolicited offer for Reynolds Metals Co., a small Chicago 
company has reportedly upped the bid. On Wednesday, Alcoa, the 
world's largest aluminum company, offered $65 a share in cash and 
stock for the nation's third-largest aluminum maker. Alcoa valued 
the deal at $5.6 billion. At $65 a share, the deal would be worth 
$4.2 billion based on the number of Reynolds shares outstanding. 
Dow Jones Newswires reported today that Michigan Avenue Partners, a 
privately held investment firm, has also made a cash offer for 
Reynolds. Alcoa shares closed down 1 1/4 at 66 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Life on Earth Traced Earlier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some oily material extracted from 2.7  
billion-year-old Australian rocks is providing the oldest known 
biological evidence of life on Earth -- a billion years earlier than 
had previously been found. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery, reported in today's edition of the journal  
Science, pushes back evidence of life to the Archean era, the 
period from the beginning of Earth to about 2.5 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unknown that complex molecules can survive such a long  
period of time on Earth,'' said lead researcher Jochen J. Brocks of 
the University of Sydney and the Australian Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The molecular fossils we report are the oldest preserved  
biological molecules in the world,'' Brocks said in response to 
questions via e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``We opened up a window into a time when almost nothing was  
known about life on Earth and provide a tool that will multiply our 
knowledge about this shadow land,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This age should provide a new calibration point for molecular  
clocks and the universal tree of life,'' Brocks and his fellow 
Australian researchers said in their paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Their findings were greeted with enthusiasm by other scientists.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think they've done a spectacular job,'' said John Hayes of  
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, who did 
research into evidence of early life in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``They perform analyses of such quality and diversity that they  
assemble of body of evidence that, when you put it all together, is 
compelling,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	And Andrew H. Knoll of the Botanical Museum at Harvard  
University called the report ``a pretty exciting paper. It really 
opens doors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What I really admire about these guys is they heard the  
conventional wisdom that said this couldn't be done, and they 
searched for and found'' the evidence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most rocks as old as the ones studied have undergone a process  
called metamorphism, an intense geological heating that changes 
them and which scientists believed would destroy any organic 
compounds they contained. But the shales studied by this team were 
well-preserved and still contained the biological chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found evidence of organic compounds called  
lipids in the sedimentary rocks located more than 2,100 feet deep 
in northwestern Australia's Roy Hill Shale and Marra Mamba 
Formations. The rocks formed a seabed 2.6 billion to 2.7 billion 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipids are produced by living organisms and finding them  
indicates the presence of eukaryotes -- life forms with cells that 
have a distinct nucleus. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of their complexity, eukaryotes were thought to have  
developed relatively late in Earth's history. This discovery pushes 
the date for their appearance back to the earliest part of 
geological time. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers noted that a similar report several years ago  
had been discounted by scientists who assumed the rocks had been 
contaminated with more recent chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure that wasn't the case this time, they put their rock  
samples through several rinses in solvents to remove any possible 
contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
	The rocks were then ground and chemicals, including sterane, a  
hydrocarbon of biological origin, were extracted. Steranes derive 
from sterols, a component of certain living tissues, the best known 
of which is cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biomarkers we report are the oldest known that'' can be  
shown to have originated in the areas where they were found and 
were formed at the same time as the rocks in that area, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are more than a billion years older than those from the  
... Barney Creek Formation, previously the oldest 
well-characterized molecular fossils,'' they reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Brocks said the finding will help scientists who are trying to  
calculate back to the common ancestor of all living things. 
</P>
<P>
	In this effort scientists came up with widely different values,  
he noted, with some calculating the origin of eukaryotes to 1.7 
billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we found that eukaryotes already lived 2.7 billion years  
ago, hence proving many molecular clocks wrong,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is some evidence for the existence of what may have  
``possibly'' been bacteria even earlier, Brocks added.

<HEADLINE> Nudists Gather for Convenion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARCOLA, Ore. (AP) -- At the national convention for American  
nudists, carefree rounds of naked volleyball and topless horseshoes 
were played this week despite the brisk air and an even more 
chilling reality: laws nipping at their lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly 1,000 nudists who shivered this week in the 65-degree  
Cascade foothills spent much of their time developing strategies 
against such legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every do-gooder wants to jump on us,'' 75-year-old Bill Haller  
said as he floated naked in the crystal-blue waters of the nudist 
resort pool. ``Back in the old days, no one seemed to care about 
us. Now we're having to go to court to protect ourselves a lot more 
than we used to. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50,000-member American Association for Nude Recreation,  
based in Kissimmee, Fla., now has a government affairs division and 
a legal defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Schuttauf, coordinator of the government affairs division,  
said some laws, such as those that regulate the consumption of 
alcohol at strip clubs or keep teens out of adult businesses, are 
so broadly written that they leave nudist groups exposed to a whole 
range of possible legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't play very well when the family sits down on the  
deck here for a tuna fish sandwich and dad wants to have a light 
beer,'' Schuttauf said, pointing to the lounge furniture where a 
buck-naked woman was stretched out with a book. 
</P>
<P>
	Cities such as San Diego are also beginning to crack down on  
nudity in areas where it was once tolerated, such as the popular 
strip called Black's Beach. After years of tolerating sunbathers in 
the buff, the city announced in June it would start enforcing a 
decades-old prohibition against nudity. 
</P>
<P>
	The AANR even hired a Washington lobbyist after Rep. Dave  
Weldon, R-Fla., sought to ban nude swimming and sunbathing at a 
remote beach along the Canaveral National Seashore. That effort 
last year failed. 
</P>
<P>
	At this year's convention, which ends Monday, Schuttauf hopes to  
replenish the group's legal fund through an auction of vacation 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, not all law changes aim to throw a cloak over nudism.  
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, the Berkeley, Calif., City Council voted to ease  
the town's anti-nudity law by giving police the option of just 
issuing a $100 ticket on first offense. Under the original law, 
officers had no choice but to arrest offenders, who faced a year in 
jail if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Top of the business agenda at this year's convention was the  
approval of three new nudist chapters, bringing the total number to 
238 in the United States and Canada. The only state that doesn't 
have one is Alaska. Florida has the most with 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last 10 years, membership in AANR has increased by 76  
percent. Nearly 92 percent are 35 or older. 
</P>
<P>
	Members say the group focuses on wholesome fun for the whole  
family -- contrary to the stereotype that nudists are nature freaks 
or free-styling swingers. 
</P>
<P>
	To Linda Pace, the AANR's membership director, nudism is all  
about feeling comfortable with one's body and learning to judge 
people differently. Those values appeal to everyone from factory 
workers to corporate lawyers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter whether the color of your collar is blue or  
white, when you're not wearing one,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But even die-hard nudists have their limit. As the unseasonably  
cold temperatures moved in and the skies turned slate-gray, most of 
the delegates chose to shed their birthday suits in favor of 
sweatsuits and pants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shed our clothes, not our common sense,'' Ms. Pace said.  
``Even nudists get cold.''

<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida Marlins pitcher Alex Fernandez is expected  
to miss one start after receiving a cortisone shot to treat 
inflammation in his right rotator cuff. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, who pitched six innings in Wednesday's 6-5 victory

<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A federal appeals court has upheld a  
Wisconsin law that requires women to wait 24 hours before having an 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen other states have similar laws, including Pennsylvania,  
where the law was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb cited that decision when she  
ruled most of the Wisconsin law constitutional. Planned Parenthood 
of Wisconsin appealed the 1997 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals sided with  
the state, saying it found nothing impermissible in the stated 
purposes of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	State lawmakers said it was intended to provide women with  
information about alternatives to abortion and ensure they give 
voluntary consent for the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which took effect last year, requires women to meet  
with a physician at least 24 hours before getting an abortion, 
except in certain cases of rape and incest. 
</P>
<P>
	It also requires doctors to tell patients about the procedure,  
its risks, alternatives to abortion and fetal development, and to 
give them state-published information. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors who violate the law could be fined $1,000 to $10,000 and  
could lose their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The law provides an exception if a doctor determines that the  
24-hour wait could threaten the woman's health. The appeals court 
said that exception was adequate to protect doctors against the 
risk of indiscriminate prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also upheld two parts of the law that Crabb rejected --  
requiring doctors to inform women about technology that allows them 
to hear a fetal heartbeat and requiring doctors to tell victims of 
rape and incest that the father is obligated to pay child support. 
</P>
<P>
	Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin spokeswoman Shelly Liebetreu  
said the waiting period is hard on poor women, particularly those 
from rural areas, because it requires an additional trip. Only 
three Wisconsin cities have clinics that perform abortions; all are 
in the southeast half of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Armacost, a spokeswoman for Wisconsin Right to Life, said  
the law protects the rights of women. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wisconsin's abortion clinics were doing a grave disservice to  
women when they routinely failed to provide them with crucial 
information,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>  Jumper Sotomayor To Miss Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- High-jumper Javier Sotomayor, the world  
record-holder and 1992 Olympic champion who tested positive for 
cocaine at the Pan American Games, has withdrawn from the World 
Championships because of a herniated disc. 
</P>
<P>
	His withdrawal means the International Amateur Athletic  
Federation won't have to decide whether to suspend him from the 
championships at Seville, Spain, Aug. 21-29. 
</P>
<P>
	IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said Friday that the federation  
had not yet received official notification of Sotomayor's 
withdrawal but would welcome it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Sotomayor doesn't compete in Seville because he's injured,  
many problems are solved,'' he said. ``The case will follow normal 
procedure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor tested positive for cocaine after winning his fourth  
consecutive title at the Pan Am Games in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on 
July 30. He was stripped of his gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, 31, the two-time world outdoor champion and world  
indoor and outdoor record-holder, and Cuban officials have 
proclaimed his innocence and contend that his drug test was 
manipulated as part of a conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF has received a report on Sotomayor's case from the  
Cuban federation, which has refused to suspend him. Reineri said 
the report would be examined by the IAAF's drug commission. If the 
Cuban federation doesn't suspend Sotomayor, the IAAF can. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban sports officials announced Sotomayor's injury Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban Sports Institute said Sotomayor would need an  
operation to repair the injured disc in his lower back. No date has 
been set for surgery, the institute said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodrigo Alvarez Cambra, chief doctor to the Cuban delegation at  
Winnipeg, has called the injury ``a grave and serious problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor was seen grimacing and reaching for his lower back  
after one of his jumps at the Pan Am games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very, very bad,'' Sotomayor was quoted as saying. ``I  
didn't think the injury was that serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor is the only high jumper to clear 8 feet, first  
accomplishing the feat in 1989. He improved his record to 8-0 1/2 in 
1993.

<HEADLINE> Jerry Springer Rules Out Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He might have looked forward to six years as  
``the gentleman from Ohio.'' But television's Jerry Springer 
decided to follow the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer's office in Chicago issued a statement on Friday  
popping a political trial balloon that might have lured him back to 
Ohio, saying a return to the campaign trail was out of the question 
because of contractual obligations and a new talk-and-variety show 
about to debut in England. 
</P>
<P>
	It's ``impractical if not impossible for me to make a run for  
the Senate at this time,'' he said in the written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer, who in a former life was a Cincinnati politician, had  
been courted by some of his old pals to run for the U.S. Senate 
after the usual suspects -- current members of Congress and former 
candidates -- decided 2000 wouldn't be their year. 
</P>
<P>
	With him out of the mix, Democrats presumably will find a  
nominee their party's presidential candidate won't mind being seen 
with in public. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Democrats ought to be relieved,'' said political  
analyst Stuart Rothenberg. ``It would have been an embarrassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The freshman Republican who might have had Springer for an  
opponent, Sen. Mike DeWine, had no comment, according to a 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio's Republican Party chief, though, rejoiced in the  
opposition party's difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP Chairman Robert Bennett said entertaining the idea of a  
Springer candidacy demonstrated that ``Name recognition and deep 
pockets are their only criteria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio newspapers had huffed their outrage at the prospect of a  
Springer Senate race, and some Democrats who had been longing for a 
deep-pockets candidate said they couldn't accept Springer. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ted Strickland, for instance, said Springer's television  
program was damaging and exploitive and he could have nothing to do 
with the man. 
</P>
<P>
	Organized labor leaders had encouraged a Springer candidacy,  
reasoning that his fame and wealth could offset the advantages of 
incumbency and maybe attract adults who usually don't bother to 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland said he was still hoping to see his party's  
unsuccessful 1998 candidate, Mary Boyle, change her mind about 
running. Actively exploring the race was Columbus attorney Richard 
Cordray, a little-known former state representative who was shaping 
up to be the likely nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	Holly Armstrong of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee  
said ``Clearly DeWine is vulnerable and Richard Cordray represents 
an exciting opportunity to pick up that seat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springer, 55, was mayor of Cincinnati for two terms and ran for  
governor in 1982 before starting a TV career. The spiciest episode 
of his political career came when he paid a prostitute with a 
check.

<HEADLINE> Victory Gallop's Career Cut Short </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Victory Gallop, who had a stirring  
victory over Behrens in the Whitney Handicap just 12 days ago, has 
been retired from racing because of an injury to his left leg, 
trainer Elliott Walden announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old son of Cryptoclearance tore a ligament in his  
left leg, an injury Walden suspects happened in the $600,000 Grade 
I Whitney at Saratoga. His next scheduled start was to be the $1 
million Pacific Classic at Del Mar on Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Walden said Victory Gallop, who finished his career with nine  
wins in 17 starts and earnings of $3,605,885, will be retired and 
stand at stud at Prestonwood Farm in Versailles, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Walden said a horse of lesser quality might have been given six  
months to rehabilitate the injured area. Even then, Walden said, 
the success rate of such treatment is usually minimal. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he is not certain, Walden suspects the suspensory  
injury occurred nearing the finish line in the Whitney, which 
Victory Gallop won by a nose. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way Behrens came back to him at the wire was a possible  
indication that something was wrong,'' Walden said. ``It certainly 
didn't happen while he was just galloping in the morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his obvious disappointment, Walden said, ``He was at the  
top of the heap. It's nice to know that he went out on a winning 
note. He has nothing to prove having won Grade Is at 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll have a great career at stud because of his distance  
capability and his great turn of foot.''

<HEADLINE> Polo Magazine Allowed To Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Polo Magazine won another round Friday in its  
match against New York fashion house Polo Ralph Lauren. 
</P>
<P>
	Though a federal magistrate in Dallas ruled against the magazine  
on Aug. 3 and ordered it to stop using the Polo name, the 5th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals stayed that order, allowing the magazine 
to stay in print. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Magistrate Judge Mary Milloy ruled that the magazine's use  
of the name, published by Westchester Media Co., caused consumer 
confusion with the fashion house. 
</P>
<P>
	Polo Ralph Lauren asked Westchester to give up the name after  
its overhaul from a small specialty publication into a slick, 
broader-focused magazine that launched with about 1 million issues. 
Westchester responded by suing to protect the name secured by 
founder and former publisher Ami Shinitski in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the magazine had argued that it is the official  
publication of the U.S. Polo Association despite its transformation 
into a glossy lifestyles journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguments in the appeal are set for the week of Oct. 4.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Gains Sparked by Stocks Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar made broad gains Friday against both  
the euro and yen, as currency traders drew confidence from a strong 
recovery in the U.S. stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0564, down  
from $1.0669 late Wednesday. The dollar also was quoted at 115.74 
Japanese yen, up from 115.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the dollar continued a recent trend of following  
the direction of U.S. stocks, which jumped sharply Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock market is being used as a tool to assess what will  
happen in the currency market,'' said Kevin Harris, an 
international economist at MCM Currencywatch in New York. ``When 
you get that kind of rise in stocks, currency traders want to buy 
dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5159 Swiss francs, up from  
1.5012, and 1.4764 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4862. The British 
pound fell to $1.6057 from $1.6119. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8515 German 
marks, up from 1.8332; and 6.2112 French francs, up from 6.1501.

<HEADLINE> Catfish Hunter Improves Slowly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter was slowly  
improving Friday, although his condition still was listed as 
critical five days after he hit his head on concrete steps at his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old Hunter remained in the intensive care unit,  
officials at Pitt County Memorial Hospital said. The Hall of Fame 
pitcher was conscious and responding to doctors and relatives, his 
family said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to be quite hopeful and optimistic that Jimmy will  
recover and be back home in Hertford very soon,'' the family 
minister, the Rev. Keith Vaughan, said in the statement. ``We thank 
God for the progress that Jimmy has made thus far, and we are 
encouraged by the news coming from Greenville today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, who retired in 1979 to his Hertford farm after 15 years  
in the majors and five World Series rings, was diagnosed last year 
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -- Lou Gehrig's disease, a 
gradual, irreversible deterioration of the muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter's wife, Helen, expressed gratitude Friday for the support  
from friends and fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cards and phone calls continue to pour in from  
everywhere,'' she said in a statement. ``We are saving every one, 
and when Jimmy is better, we will make sure that he sees them. It 
is such an encouragement to us that people care so much. We are 
truly grateful.''

<HEADLINE> Appalachia Anti-Poverty Work Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) -- While much of the nation thrives amid a  
booming economy, officials gathered in impoverished Appalachia say 
now is the time to complete anti-poverty efforts begun in the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Appalachian states need to do more to develop their  
transportation systems and take advantage of economic opportunities 
federal programs have created, West Virginia Gov. Cecil Underwood 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was the opening speaker at the second day of a two-day  
Appalachian Summit, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development. The summit is intended to foster the exchange of 
ideas among government officials, businesses and nonprofit groups 
in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater was scheduled to  
address the conference later today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transportation Department and the Appalachian Regional  
Commission have invested billions of dollars to develop 
infrastructure in the region, and the Appalachian corridor highway 
system has created new economic opportunities, Underwood told the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the region still needs to develop other types of  
transportation. States needs to make greater use of their 
waterways, railroads and airports, such the regional airport 
proposed for southwest West Virginia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such an airport could bring new jobs, new products more  
developable land in that area,'' Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, U.S. Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo told the group  
that low unemployment in the rest of the country can translate into 
economic opportunity for jobless workers in Appalachia, 
</P>
<P>
	``Appalachia needs business, but business needs Appalachia,'' he  
said. ``The economic equivalent of air and water for business is 
new workers and new markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton said the region must emphasize the  
development of small start-up businesses as well as try to draw 
established businesses.

	``We have to find activities that can use the workforce we have  
and accept the limitations that we have,'' Patton said. ``There is 
no silver bullet; it is not going to be fast and it is not going to 
be easy. ... But this conference can help turn the corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conference grew out of President Clinton's July tour of poor  
communities from Appalachia to Los Angeles, in which he highlighted 
what he touted as the ``untapped markets'' in America's inner 
cities and rural areas.

	The summit, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Housing and  
Urban Development, is the first to bring together state governments 
in the 13-state Appalachian region with business, the Appalachian 
Regional Commission and four federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo encouraged the groups to work on solutions to regional  
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apathy here is the enemy,'' he said. ``Disbelief ... lack of  
energy and commitment and passion is the enemy. The American 
economy ... needs you in a way they have never needed Appalachia 
before. They need your workers.''

<HEADLINE> Disabled Man Requests Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Prosecutors won't oppose a severely  
disabled man's request to unplug the hospital ventilator that has 
kept him alive since 1967, when he broke his neck in a high school 
gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
	Under New York law, patients can opt to discontinue lifesaving  
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes Bill White's circumstances uncommon is that he is  
believed to be one of America's longest surviving quadriplegics on 
a ventilator and, because he needs 24-hour care, has rarely left 
his hospital bed in 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
	After a weeklong review, Monroe County District Attorney Howard  
Relin's office concluded that White ``has the right to refuse 
treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, Bill has indicated he wants to go through with  
it,'' Strong Memorial Hospital spokeswoman Teri D'Agostino said 
Thursday. ``We're still leaving the door open for him to change his 
mind.'' The hospital said this morning that there was no change in 
his status. 
</P>
<P>
	White, 50, has asked that no details be released, the hospital  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked hospital staff a few months ago to discontinue his  
ventilator treatment, which in all likelihood would end his life 
within minutes. The hospital eventually promised to honor his 
request a week ago but held off when Relin asked to review the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Motivated by ``concerns about his deteriorating health,'' White  
convinced a team of doctors, psychiatrists, social workers and 
patient advocates that he is mentally competent and not motivated 
by depression. 
</P>
<P>
	He was paralyzed from the neck down in March 1967 when, at age  
18, he bounced on a springboard and flew over the parallel bars. A 
student who was supposed to help him land was not ready. White 
knocked into him, veered off the mat and crashed headfirst on the 
wooden floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew instantly what happened -- I felt all the sensation go  
out of my hands,'' White said in a 1997 interview with the 
Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	His hospital bill, which exceeds $200,000 a year, is paid by  
Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for the disabled 
and the indigent.

<HEADLINE> Players React to Graf Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In the Year of Retirement, add Steffi Graf.  
</P>
<P>
	``The mental toughness puts her right up there with the Michael  
Jordans, the Wayne Gretzkys and the John Elways,'' two-time U.S. 
Open champion Tracy Austin said of Graf. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all retired at the same time. What are they doing to  
us?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf announced Friday that she was calling it quits after  
dominating women's tennis and earning a women's record $21,839,777 
along with 22 Grand Slam tournament singles titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have done everything I wanted to do in tennis,'' the  
30-year-old Graf said during a news conference in Heidelberg, 
Germany. ``It is time to stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can kind of sympathize with what she's going through because  
when you're at the top, it is not easy to maintain it,'' Pete 
Sampras, the top-ranked men's player, said. ``She had an 
unbelievable career, did it with a lot of class. 
</P>
<P>
	``She went out and got the job done and made the racket do the  
talking. I have always looked up to her the way she approached the 
game. She worked very hard and is a great athlete. But she has 
nothing to be ashamed of after winning 22 Grand Slams. That is not 
easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Agassi, the third-ranked man, said Graf's retirement ``is  
certainly a loss for tennis because in my opinion she is the best 
lady that has ever played, dominated on every surface. And on the 
other side of it, there is a sense of happiness for the next 
chapter of her life, which I am sure she is looking forward to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really expecting her to kind of end her career at the  
U.S. Open,'' said Lindsay Davenport, the Wimbledon champion and the 
defending U.S. Open champion, ``so it is a little bit of a 
surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What I thought was really great was the older she got and the  
more she was winning, probably in the mid-'90s, the happier it 
seemed to make her. When she was playing in the '80s and just 
dominating, she never looked that happy and I think she really 
learned to appreciate the game the older she got and more she 
played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, Graf played her first WTA Tour match in Filderstadt,  
Germany. The 13-year-old participated in the draw and pulled 
Austin's name as her first-round opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was this ... kid who hit the ball so hard I couldn't  
believe it,'' Austin remembered Friday. ``It was 4-all in the first 
set and she was painting the lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austin won the next 10 games, but knew she had seen the future  
of women's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew she was going to be a very, very good player,'' Austin  
said. ``She had a huge, huge forehand and she moved like a deer out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nimble footwork and big forehand changed women's tennis,  
although Graf, unlike many other young players, was not an 
overnight success. She didn't win her first Grand Slam tournament 
title until 1987, when she surprised Martina Navratilova in the 
final of the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was so disciplined. She was always focused, always trying  
100 percent,'' Austin said. ``Just very professional about her job 
and her work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bart McGuire, the WTA Tour's chief executive officer, said, Graf  
``has been a role model for women athletes in all sports. She has 
been a catalyst for the resurgence of women's tennis, especially in 
Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Steffi is a class act,'' McGuire said.  
</P>
<P>
	Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario played Graf in seven Grand Slam  
tournament finals, winning the 1989 French Open and the 1994 U.S. 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been a great player, a great champion, a good person and  
a friend,'' Sanchez-Vicario said in Manhattan Beach, Calif., where 
she is playing in the Acura Classic. ``No one can replace Steffi. 
It's kind of hard to think she isn't going to be there anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billie Jean King called Graf ``the all-time great singles player  
in women's tennis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad that she is able to retire on her own terms and hope  
that she will keep some involvement and commitment to our sport the 
rest of her life,'' King said. ``We will miss her great athletic 
ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austin, who's career was shortened by a back injury, said she  
wasn't surprised by Graf retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great loss for women's tennis, but I love the fact that  
she's doing it on her terms because after all of these injuries 
she's had, it's great that she's not going out because of an 
injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Pierce, whose lone Grand Slam tournament title came at the  
1995 Australian Open, was surprised at the retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm happy for her that she feels at peace,'' Pierce said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon semifinalist Alexandra Stevenson said Graf's  
retirement ``gives me goose bumps. Also knowing I will never have 
the privilege of playing against her makes me sad. But I will 
memorize her graceful and courageous run at the 1999 French Open. 
Steffi Graf was always my measure of greatness.''

<HEADLINE> PGA Championship Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Finally. Something good happened to Steve  
Elkington. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the 1995 PGA Championship thought he'd lost his  
wedding band and some medication when he gave a little boy his golf 
bag Thursday. That was the same day he withdrew from the 81st PGA 
Championship after his caddie, Joe Grillo, was taken to a hospital 
complaining of chest pains. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ring and the medication were back in Elkington's hands  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Kent took his 4 1/2-year-old son, Ryan, to the tournament  
Thursday. But Ryan got bored pretty quickly, so his father decided 
to take him home. 
</P>
<P>
	As they walked through the players' parking lot, they saw  
Elkington, who had just withdrawn and was on his way to the 
hospital to be with Grillo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Elkington saw Ryan and I and he called Ryan over,'' Scott  
Kent said. ``I thought, `Oh, cool. He's going to give Ryan a ball 
or something.' He said, `I've had this bag for awhile and I'm going 
to get a new one so I want you to have this bag.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Elkington cleaned his clubs and what he thought was everything  
else out of the bag and gave it to Ryan. When he woke up Friday 
morning, though, Elkington realized his wedding ring and some 
medicine were missing. 
</P>
<P>
	They were in a pouch in his golf bag.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had checked the bag, but I hadn't looked in that particular  
zipper,'' Scott Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elkington called tournament organizers, who contacted local  
radio and television stations for help. A co-worker heard the story 
and told Scott Kent, who immediately called tournament officials 
and asked how to get the items back to Elkington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kents came back to Medinah Country Club on Friday afternoon  
and returned the belongings, and someone from the tournament took 
them to Elkington at O'Hare Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Elkington got more good news Friday when Grillo was released  
from Glen Oaks Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OUTTA HERE:* Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw missed the cut for  
his 13th straight tournament -- or every one he has entered this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Other notables not making the weekend were Tom Watson, Greg  
Norman, Ernie Els, Justin Leonard and and Masters champion Jose 
Maria Olazabal. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson was playing in his final major before joining the senior  
tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed and embarrassed the way I played this week,''  
said Watson, who had a two-day total of 5-over 149. ``It was not 
very pretty. But I had weeks like this, even when I played my best 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last two days it was not the best way to finish.''  
</P>
<P>
	Watson won the first of his 34 PGA Tour victories at the 1974  
Western Open in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RYDER OUT:* Tom Lehman survived the cut Friday, greatly  
improving his chances of making the Ryder Cup without taking up one 
of the two captain's picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman was 11th on the points list, behind Jeff Maggert, who  
shot a 76 Friday and did not make the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing the cut were Steve Stricker and John Huston, who  
were 12th and 13th in the standings, meaning their chances of 
making the team on points are gone. They still have hopes of 
getting picked by captain Ben Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
	But two others who missed the cut -- Lee Janzen and Tim Herron --  
will likely not make the team at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 10 in the standings -- based on points from top 10  
finishes -- qualify. Crenshaw will announce his two wild-card 
selections Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ryder Cup matches will be held Sept. 24-26 at The Country  
Club in Brookline, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MORE RYDER CUP:* Jesper Parnevik is playing for more than the  
Wanamaker Trophy this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Parnevik, who is 11th on the European money list, is trying to  
play his way on to the European Ryder Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was my goal coming into the week,'' he said. ``I'm not  
thinking about it when I'm playing, but I would like to qualify on 
my own. Definitely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parnevik, whose best finish on the PGA Tour this season is a tie  
for 10th at the British Open, started the week in 18th place in the 
European Ryder Cup standings. The top 10 players make it, and 
captain Mark James gets two additional picks. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON:* Leader Jay Haas doesn't have far to  
turn when he needs advice in the PGA Championship. He just asks his 
son, who happens to be his caddie. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Haas Jr., 18, is carrying his dad's bag before heading off  
next week to college at Augusta State. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what makes this special,'' said the senior Haas, who at  
age 45, has put together rounds of 68 and 67. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jay (Jr.) has a 1-handicap at home and has caddied for me in  
the past. Jay has a very good demeanor on the golf course and it 
rubs off on me. ... This could be a magical week.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CHEESEHEADS:* The winters are long in Wisconsin, but that  
hasn't stopped the state from producing some top golfers. 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Kendall, who shot a course record 65 Friday, Steve  
Stricker, J.P. Hayes and Jerry Kelly are natives of the Dairyland 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's a little motivator,'' Kendall said. ``We all grew  
up playing together. Wisconsin is not that far away. And we're used 
to these kind of conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall said Stricker is ``Mr. Wisconsin'' in golf.  
</P>
<P>
	``We all had our share of state titles up there, but I would say  
Steve had the most,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stricker was the only one of the four to miss the cut.  
</P>
<P>
	Kelly is the only member of the foursome still living in  
Wisconsin. The other three live in warmer climates in Florida and 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOCKER ON LOAN:* Mark Brooks is using the locker of a Medinah  
Country Club member by the name of Michael Jordan. Yes, that 
Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is that what I'm in?'' Brooks asked.  
</P>
<P>
	There was nothing in the locker from the retired basketball  
superstar wishing Brooks good luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``And nothing signed, either,'' Brooks said. ``I'll probably  
leave him some balls. With this rough, he'll need them.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Bill Glasson withdrew Friday morning because of  
tightness in his back. Glasson didn't complete his first round 
which had been suspended by darkness Thursday. He shot a 37 on the 
front side Thursday and a 30 through the first six holes of the 
backside.

<HEADLINE> Auburn's Robinson Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Auburn wide receiver Clifton Robinson  
pleaded guilty to a lesser, misdemeanor charge in a case where he 
was accused of having sex with an underage girl, authorities said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson had been charged with second-degree rape, but pleaded  
guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor, Lee County 
District Attorney Nick Abbott said. He was given a one-year, 
suspended sentence Friday and also ordered to perform 200 hours of 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott said the plea agreement came at the request of the girl,  
who was visiting relatives in Auburn in March, and her mother. He 
said they wished to avoid a trial, which was scheduled to start 
Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was expected to be back at practice with the Tigers on  
Monday. He led the Tigers in receiving yards and all-purpose yards 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded innocent in late July to charges of having sex with a  
15-year-old girl. Coach Tommy Tuberville had suspended him from the 
team until the case was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuberville said Friday Robinson maintained his innocence of the  
original charge, but decided along with the other parties involved 
that the misdemeanor plea was the best option. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clifton has just gotten through with a very difficult  
situation,'' Tuberville said in a statement. ``It is time to move 
on and let Clifton get back to concentrating on school and his 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson has a probation hearing Jan. 27.

<HEADLINE> Car Dealer Sued Over Payment Timer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Auto dealer Mel Farr thought he'd found a way to  
offer cars to people with bad credit, and protect his profits -- a 
high-tech dashboard gizmo that prevents cars from starting if the 
customer is delinquent on payments. 
</P>
<P>
	But now Farr, one of the nation's biggest car dealers, is facing  
a lawsuit from two women who contend the On-Time Device shut their 
cars down while they were driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandi Bergeron, 21, of Wixom, and Chavela Jones, 21, of Detroit  
sued Farr on Thursday. Their lawyer contends the device relegates 
people to second-class status. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I imagine that he believes he's doing the right thing, I  
think I am as equally concerned about those who are less fortunate 
and therefore most susceptible to this kind of abuse,'' said 
attorney Kenneth Hylton Jr. ``For him to cast this as a means of 
helping people move up and out of poverty is just absurd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hylton's lawsuit contends the leases on the two vehicles should  
be voided, and it seeks damages of more than $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But Farr's company, which finances cars in urban areas where  
many people have credit problems, says the device helps it do 
business in a tough market. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got consumers who are schemers, liars, people who've  
never paid anyone,'' said Farr spokeswoman Charlene M. Mitchell. 
``It's a hard market to deal with. But most people are honest. It's 
the small percent that doesn't stay up-to-date that adds up to lot 
of dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mitchell also contended the device could not possibly have  
caused the cars to stall. 
</P>
<P>
	Farr, a former Detroit Lions running back, has 12 dealership  
franchises in Michigan and Ohio. With sales of $596.6 million last 
year, his company became the nation's largest black-owned business, 
according to Black Enterprise magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The On-Time Device is made by a small California company called  
Payment Protection Systems, which says about 1,000 are in use 
around the country. Farr has put the device in about 200 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	It consists of a keypad and a tiny light.  
</P>
<P>
	Customers who come to a payment center once a week get a  
six-digit code when they pay their bills. They punch in the code on 
the keypad and if it matches the proper code, the light turns green 
and the car can be started. 
</P>
<P>
	If more than a week passes without a new code, the light stays  
red, a buzzer sounds and the car won't start. 
</P>
<P>
	Hylton said the cars of both of his clients stalled while they  
were driving on a freeway. Both drivers managed to coast to a stop. 
One had to punch in an ``emergency code'' that gives owners a 
24-hour reprieve. The other waited a few minutes, then restarted 
her car. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they malfunction in two cars, they're likely to malfunction  
in others,'' said Hylton. They are accidents waiting to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mitchell denied the charge and said Farr tested the device  
in his own Lincoln Navigator for two months before deciding to use 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The car would keep going even if you haven't paid your bill,''  
she said. ``Theoretically you could keep it idling in the driveway 
all night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farr, whose dealerships operate mostly in the suburbs, has said  
he wants to expand his sales in large cities. With the help of the 
Rev. Jesse Jackson, Farr got backing from several Wall Street banks 
to fund his car financing unit, Triple M Financing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mitchell said most car dealers don't want to work in urban  
areas, creating a pent-up demand for vehicles. Such problems are 
more acute in Detroit, where poverty and a lack of public transit 
hinder the job prospects for many residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Farr could just keep doing business in the suburbs and not  
have these headaches, but he feels this is a market he want to do 
business in,'' Ms. Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, no customer with the device has fallen behind in  
payments, she said.

<HEADLINE> Wis. Abortion Wait Law Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A federal appeals court has upheld a  
Wisconsin law that requires women to wait 24 hours before having an 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen other states have similar laws, including Pennsylvania,  
where the law was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb cited that decision when she  
ruled most of the Wisconsin law constitutional. Planned Parenthood 
of Wisconsin appealed the 1997 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals sided with  
the state, saying it found nothing impermissible in the stated 
purposes of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	State lawmakers said it was intended to provide women with  
information about alternatives to abortion and ensure they give 
voluntary consent for the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which took effect last year, requires women to meet  
with a physician at least 24 hours before getting an abortion, 
except in certain cases of rape and incest. 
</P>
<P>
	It also requires doctors to tell patients about the procedure,  
its risks, alternatives to abortion and fetal development, and to 
give them state-published information. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors who violate the law could be fined $1,000 to $10,000 and  
could lose their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The law provides an exception if a doctor determines that the  
24-hour wait could threaten the woman's health. The appeals court 
said that exception was adequate to protect doctors against the 
risk of indiscriminate prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also upheld two parts of the law that Crabb rejected --  
requiring doctors to inform women about technology that allows them 
to hear a fetal heartbeat and requiring doctors to tell victims of 
rape and incest that the father is obligated to pay child support. 
</P>
<P>
	Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin spokeswoman Shelly Liebetreu  
said the waiting period is hard on poor women, particularly those 
from rural areas, because it requires an additional trip. Only 
three Wisconsin cities have clinics that perform abortions; all are 
in the southeast half of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Armacost, a spokeswoman for Wisconsin Right to Life, said  
the law protects the rights of women. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wisconsin's abortion clinics were doing a grave disservice to  
women when they routinely failed to provide them with crucial 
information,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Clean House With Firings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Manager Phil Garner and general manager Sal  
Bando did their best to make winners out of the small-market, 
small-wallet Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	They failed, and both were removed from their jobs Thursday  
during their seventh straight losing season. The Brewers fired 
Garner and reassigned Bando within the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting coach Jim Lefebvre was appointed interim manager and  
will be on the bench when Milwaukee begins a seven-game road trip 
at Arizona tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	If the frustrations of playing the game at a financial  
disadvantage had begun to wear on them, neither Garner nor Bando 
showed it when they left their jobs. Garner called the firing 
``justified,'' and Bando said he asked team president Wendy 
Selig-Prieb to make both changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers are 52-60 and appear headed to another losing  
season. Bando, who has a close working and personal relationship 
with Selig-Prieb, was named special assistant to the team 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't play up to my expectations or their expectations,''  
Garner said. ``In this situation, I think it's deserved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garner wore a Harley-Davidson T-shirt and was typically upbeat  
when he met the media in the Brewers' clubhouse Thursday. He was 
reluctant to criticize the Brewers' penny-pinching ways and 
depleted farm system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those things are frustrating, but those aren't my jobs,  
either,'' Garner said. ``That's a problem that baseball has, not 
only for us, but for a lot of other teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lefebvre, the 10th manager in team history, was the only member  
of Garner's coaching staff with previous managerial experience. 
Lefebvre has spent ample time with mediocre clubs, compiling a 
395-414 record as manager of the Seattle Mariners from 1989-91 and 
the Chicago Cubs the following two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very sad day for me,'' Lefebvre said. ``Hopefully,  
somehow, some way, we can get this team to perform up to 
expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lefebvre, hired as the Brewers' batting coach last August during  
a shakeup of the coaching staff, was signed as manager only through 
the rest of the season and doesn't consider himself a candidate for 
the fulltime job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be here for seven weeks, and I'm going to do  
everything that I possibly can,'' he said. ``You all know the 
interim manager is usually the first one to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers, who went 4-8 on a 12-game homestand that ended  
Wednesday, reached .500 five times this season, but failed each 
time to get above the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three managers have longer tenures with their current clubs  
than Garner, who is both the winningest and losingest manager in 
team history. Only Connie Mack of the Philadelphia Athletics had 
survived with a team through more consecutive losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig-Prieb said she was confident about her overhaul of the  
team she took over last year from her father, baseball commissioner 
Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a results business, make no mistake about it,''  
Selig-Prieb said. ``This is not a complacent organization. We will 
not accept mediocrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bando and Garner, teammates with the Oakland Athletics, joined  
the Brewers together in October 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Bando, who played 16 seasons with the Athletics and the Brewers  
as a third baseman, co-owns a successful venture capital company in 
Milwaukee. He said he had no interest in pursuing other baseball 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no desire to be a general manager in the first place,''  
Bando said. ``It was something that just happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig-Prieb said she will hire a general manager and the GM will  
hire the next manager. She did not set any timetables. 
</P>
<P>
	Until a new GM is found, Selig-Prieb and assistant GM Fred  
Stanley will be responsible for the Brewers' baseball decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig-Prieb said rumors that former Brewers stars Paul Molitor  
and Robin Yount would be considered for the positions are 
premature. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's so far ahead of where I am in the process,'' she said.  
``I will move as quickly as I can, but speed is not my primary 
concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garner leaves with a 563-617 record. He was hired in October  
1991 with no previous managing experience, and was runner-up for 
the AL Manager of the Year award in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a 15-year playing career as an infielder for Oakland,  
Pittsburgh, Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. He retired in 
1988 and spent three years on Houston manager Art Howe's coaching 
staff before succeeding Tom Trebelhorn in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	With his outgoing personality and soft Texas drawl, Garner was a  
favorite among Brewers' fans, and he was active in charity concerns 
off the field. Garner had no sooner been let go than his name began 
to surface as a potential candidate for several new positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a job, people are very kind to you,'' Garner  
said when asked about his future. ``When you don't have a job, you 
call and nobody's in town.''

<HEADLINE> Top Acts Commit to NetAid Concerts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- George Michael, Celine Dion and Bono are among the  
top performers who are turning to the Internet for a massive 
concert to highlight world poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	NetAid will link overlapping shows in London, New Jersey and  
Geneva on Oct. 9 -- and broadcast the concerts worldwide over the 
Internet. Organizers are hoping to attract the largest audience 
ever for a live musical event. 
</P>
<P>
	The concerts are being organized by the United Nations  
Development Program and Cisco Systems Inc., an Internet network 
company based in San Jose, Calif.; proceeds will be used to help 
Kosovo refugees and African countries. A special charity, called 
NetAid Foundation, is being set up to handle the funds, organizers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other artists scheduled to appear include Jewel, The Corrs,  
Robbie Williams, Jimmy Page, Counting Crows, Eurythmics and Pete 
Townshend. The final lineup at each of the venues has yet to be 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a fantastic lineup of artists and all of them are  
committed to our cause of eradicating poverty,'' said promoter 
Harvey Goldsmith, who helped organize the Live Aid concerts to 
benefit Ethiopia in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 110,000 tickets will be available for both the London  
concert at Wembley Stadium and the concert at Giants Stadium in 
East Ruthersford, N.J. The Geneva event will be smaller and by 
invitation only. 
</P>
<P>
	The concerts will also be broadcast later on TV worldwide.  
</P>
<P>
	People will be able to donate money via the Internet at the  
NetAid site due to be set up next month. But the organizers said 
their main intention is to highlight extreme poverty and encourage 
people to join together to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
	They want their Internet site, which will be an ongoing site, to  
reach 1 billion people. The concerts are being used to launch the 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``The potential of NetAid is to harness the resources of the  
Internet to help impoverished people to set up an infrastructure so 
that it is easier for the developed world to help,'' said Chris 
Dedicot, managing director of Cisco.

<HEADLINE> Gas Producer Gazprom Loses $5.9B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Gazprom, the world's largest natural gas producer,  
said Friday that it lost 147 billion rubles, or $5.9 billion, last 
year as a result of Russia's financial crisis and a global slump in 
energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss compared to a net profit of 20 billion rubles in 1997,  
the company's Web site said. That would be worth $800 million at 
current conversion rates, but about $3 billion at the conversion 
rate in effect in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Gazprom said the figures were calculated using international  
accounting standards 
</P>
<P>
	The company posted a loss because of last summer's financial  
crisis, triggered by the government's default on Treasury debt and 
devaluation of the ruble, according to the auditor's report posted 
on the Gazprom site. 
</P>
<P>
	``The operations of the group have been significantly affected  
by instability in the Russian Federation's economy, caused in part 
by its currency volatility, and may continue to be so for the 
foreseeable future,'' the statement said. Last year's tumble in 
energy prices also dragged down financial results. 
</P>
<P>
	The company holds about a third of the world's known gas  
reserves. Its press office didn't return phone calls seeking 
comment.

<HEADLINE> Iridium Consortium Files Chapter 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Iridium LLC slid into bankruptcy on Friday,  
unable to pay its debts on a satellite-based mobile phone network 
that cost billions to build, but attracted only thousands of users. 
</P>
<P>
	The international consortium, led by Motorola, said it is filing  
for protection from its creditors in a Delaware court under Chapter 
11 of the federal bankruptcy code. 
</P>
<P>
	Iridium, the first of four satellite phone networks to offer  
service, stumbled out of the starting gate last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Users complained about complex calling plans with rates of up to  
$9 a minute, as well as big clunky phones that were in short 
supply, cost $3,500 and confusing to operate. 
</P>
<P>
	At last count, Iridium had only about 15,000 customers, well  
short of the subscriber projections used to secure many of its 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the company introduced a simplified rate structure,  
slashing charges as much as 65 percent. It unveiled sleeker phones 
costing about $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Friday, Washington-based Iridium said its banks,  
bondholders and strategic partners have voiced support for the 
decision to restructure its finances under court protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola, Iridium's largest investor and operator of Iridium's  
66-satellite system, expressed support for the business, saying it 
will continue to invest in the technology and develop the next 
generation of Iridium products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the progress being made to date to restructure Iridium's  
capital structure, we are optimistic that a restructuring plan can 
be accomplished within 30 days,'' Motorola said in Iridium's 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Iridium's stock plunged $1.18 3/4 to $3.06 1/4 on Friday before the  
Nasdaq Stock Market halted trading in the shares, weighed down by 
news that Iridium bondholders were trying to force the company into 
backruptcy. The stock is now worth less than 5 percent of what it 
sold for slightly more than a a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Clarifying Gay Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon updated its ``don't ask, don't  
tell'' policy for gays in the military on Friday, requiring 
mandatory training on anti-harassment guidelines for all troops, 
beginning with boot camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've made it clear there is no room for harassment or threats  
in the military,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said in issuing 
the revised guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	While the directives make no basic changes in the practices and  
protections in place since the policy was instituted in 1994, Cohen 
said he wanted to make sure they were ``clearly understood and 
fairly enforced'' throughout the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Benecke, co-director of the Servicemembers Legal  
Defense Network, the leading advocacy group on the issue of gays in 
the military, praised Cohen's statements but with reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real issue is whether leaders will be committed at every  
level to stop anti-gay harassment,'' said Benecke, a former Army 
officer. She also complained that the updated guidelines say 
nothing about limits on investigations or how commanders in the 
field should proceed. She noted that the directives essentially 
restate 1997 guidelines and recommendations a Pentagon working 
group made last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The new guidelines come just weeks after the bludgeoning death  
of a soldier in his barracks at Fort Campbell, Ky., renewed focus 
on gay harassment. Pfc. Barry L. Winchell, 21, had been rumored to 
be gay although neither the Army nor his family would comment on 
his sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't ask, don't tell'' allows gays to serve in the military  
as long as their sexual orientation is not discovered. It took 
effect in February 1994 after Congress balked at President 
Clinton's efforts to end the military's ban on homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The law was supposed to help gays in the military. But  
gay-rights and civil-rights groups say hostilities have risen since 
its adoption, and that soldiers who complain about being harassed 
are often subjected to questions about their own sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv said the policy has worked  
overall, but ``improvements were needed'' in some areas and the new 
guidelines ``are intended to address those issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The updated guidelines continue a prohibition against inquiries  
into a service member's sexual orientation while allowing discharge 
for homosexual conduct or for a ``propensity'' to engage in 
homosexual conduct. A service member's statement that he or she is 
gay is considered evidence of a propensity to engage in such acts. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the 5-year-old policy, the military isn't supposed to  
investigate sexual orientation unless ``credible information'' 
surfaces about a person's homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines also prohibit investigators from soliciting  
information on sexual orientation from those who report that they 
have been harassed or threatened. Such complaints must result in 
``the prompt investigation of the threat or harassment itself,'' 
the guidelines say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Service members should be able to report crimes and harassment  
free from fear of harm, reprisal or inappropriate or inadequate 
governmental response,'' Rudy de Leon, undersecretary of defense 
for personnel and readiness, said Friday in a memo to military 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	A new provision requires that the anti-harassment guidelines be  
``made part of training programs for law enforcement personnel, 
commanders and supervisors.'' And the guidelines are to be 
``incorporated into the required training that members of the armed 
forces receive upon entry into the armed forces and periodically 
thereafter,'' said a Pentagon statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Another new provision requires that investigations be conducted  
at higher levels in the military justice system, with input from 
``senior legal officers,'' a response to criticism that entry-level 
investigators or those lacking proper training had conducted many 
of the investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, any ``substantial investigation'' into whether a  
service member ``made a statement regarding his or her 
homosexuality for the purpose of seeking separation'' must be 
approved by the secretary of the relevant service, under a new 
guideline. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 1,145 people were discharged from the armed forces  
for homosexuality, a Pentagon report says. In 1997, the total was 
997, the highest number since 1987. The number of discharges hit a 
low of 617 in 1994, the year the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy 
took effect.

<HEADLINE> Club Pros Get a Taste of PGA Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Mike Baker had never even been to a major  
championship, let alone played in one. His tournament winnings last 
year were about $25,000, pocket change for Tiger Woods. As for 
signing autographs, hah! 
</P>
<P>
	Baker is a club professional, a guy who usually ekes out a  
living teaching other people how to play golf and competing in the 
occasional tournament. This week, however, he and 24 other club 
pros are living large, playing in the 81st PGA Championship and 
getting a taste of what life is like on tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could get used to this,'' Baker said Friday. ``People look  
at you like, `Wow, you're something else.' You go home and they 
probably don't think like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the Masters and the British Open, regular golfers have a  
chance to play in the PGA Championship. OK, maybe not regular 
golfers, exactly. But the top 25 finishers in the Club Professional 
Championship qualify for the major, getting a spot just like Woods 
or David Duval or Mark O'Meara. 
</P>
<P>
	The only trouble with the fantasy is that it doesn't last very  
long. Five days usually, counting practice rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	No club professional made the cut last year, and only one, Bruce  
Zabriski by one stroke with a 145, made it this year. While Sergio 
Garcia and Skip Kendall were posting record rounds in the mid-60s, 
most of the club pros shot in the high 70s or low 80s. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't get to play in situations like this,'' said Baker,  
who missed the cut with an 11-over 155 for two rounds. ``They do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the experience was incredible, the parting gifts unreal.  
</P>
<P>
	In real life, the 37-year-old Baker is the pro at the municipal  
course in Bangor, Maine. Like the rest of the club pros, he gives 
thousands of lessons a year and travels the East Coast playing in 
smaller tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	While they might be big shots at their local courses, club pros  
aren't rich. Heck, most of them still lend a hand in the pro shop, 
hawking shirts and golf bags. So no wonder Baker thought it was 
``kind of neat'' to run into Nick Faldo. He got captain Ben 
Crenshaw to sign a Ryder Cup cap he brought along. When he played 
his practice rounds Tuesday and Wednesday, people wanted his 
autograph. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the neat part,'' he said. ``People were hounding me  
for autographs. They probably didn't know who I was!'' 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was the scene at the practice range.  
</P>
<P>
	Baker was hitting balls with a wedge the other day when some guy  
came over and asked how he liked the club. The ``guy'' then 
introduced himself. It was Bob Vokey, designer of Titleist's 
wedges. 
</P>
<P>
	Equipment representatives were everywhere, offering players  
clubs, balls, gloves -- anything they needed, Baker said. Titleist 
said it would give him $500 just for using its putter for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a candy store,'' he said, shaking his head.  
``There are so many perks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's everyday life for a PGA Tour player. It's an existence  
the club pros can only imagine. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're talking about houses. They've all got cell phones,''  
Baker said. ``Not a whole lot of worries other than keeping their 
cards. But it's got to be hard to make sure you keep your card and 
stay out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even pros have bad rounds sometimes. After playing 2-under golf  
through the first seven holes Thursday, Baker bogeyed the next five 
holes. He finished out that round with a double bogey and three 
more bogeys for an 8-over 80. He shot a 3-over 75 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to have some bad shots and bad holes. I happened  
to have them all in a row,'' he said. ``I don't mind not making the 
cut. That was my goal coming in, to make the cut. But to have a bad 
round, I'd rather miss by one or two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, just to be part of the PGA club, even if it was only for  
a few days, was something else. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an ego boost,'' Baker said. ``Being here is pretty  
special.''

	Irvine's performance increased the pressure on defending  
champion Mika Hakkinen, who spun off the track in both of the two 
practice sessions for Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen, who trails Irvine by eight points in the drivers'  
standings, needs to come out of a slump to stay in the championship 
race.

	Irvine, seeking to become the first Ferrari driver to win the  
title in 20 years, reached the fastest lap of one minute, 19.476 
seconds late in the rainy afternoon session that saw many drivers 
struggling to stay on track.

<P>
	``The car was good right from the start and we made at least two  
major steps forward,'' Irvine said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it allows us to look forward to the rest of the  
weekend with optimism.'' Irvine said.

<HEADLINE> Tariff Complaints in Steel Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The steel industry, unwilling to declare  
victory despite recent reductions in imports, continues to press 
for additional punitive tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry won a preliminary ruling Friday on foreign steel  
pipes used by oil and natural gas producers and has cases pending 
on several other product lines. U.S. producers already won tariffs 
on Japanese shipments of a core product: hot-rolled carbon steel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ongoing protectionist campaign to disrupt the steel market  
is continuing,'' said Brink Lindsey, director of the Center for 
Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, which generally opposes 
trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have seen over the past several months is a rampage by  
the U.S. steel industry in filing unfair trade cases,'' he said. 
``The results are an ongoing disruption of U.S. steel trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The domestic steel industry contends tariffs and other sanctions  
are needed to combat low-priced imports, which it blames for 
company bankruptcies and thousands of layoffs. It argues that 
foreign governments and their producers illegally engage in 
practices that artificially lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The case acted on Friday affects seamless pipes. The U.S.  
International Trade Commission found evidence that shipments from 
Japan, the Czech Republic, Romania, South Africa and Mexico have or 
could hurt the U.S. industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Tariffs under consideration could lead to higher prices for  
pipes bought by oil and natural gas producers, which are struggling 
themselves because of dwindling prices. 
</P>
<P>
	With a few exceptions, the U.S. government has generally sided  
with the domestic industry in the cases it has filed since the 
Asian economic crisis caused import levels to surge. 
</P>
<P>
	The rulings in the main hot-rolled steel case have contributed  
to a 27 percent reduction in imports since November. U.S. steel 
prices have risen somewhat this year, and companies have brought 
back some workers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the industry is not backing down from its complaints.  
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a while before the steel industry recovers even if  
things continue on a positive direction,'' said Greg Mastel, 
program director for international trade studies at the Center for 
National Policy, a Washington think tank. ``Even though imports are 
coming down from a peak, it's still at a high level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, said the sanctions would help avert a  
rebound in foreign shipments. Industry officials worry that as soon 
as tariffs are imposed against a particular country on a particular 
product, that country would produce other products and other 
countries would fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to lock this thing down so this hemorrhaging of jobs  
will not occur again,'' he said. ``If the message is not made clear 
enough, this could happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to requests for tariffs, the industry has turned to  
Congress and the Clinton administration for additional help. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill that would create a $1.5 billion loan program for  
struggling steel, oil and gas producers awaits President Clinton's 
signature to become law. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, meanwhile, recently announced a 12-point action plan  
that included a pledge to oppose international loans that would 
further subsidize imports.

<HEADLINE> Bucks Name Grunfeld As New GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. FRANCIS, Wis. (AP) -- Ernie Grunfeld, fired as the New York  
Knicks' general manager just before they went on a roll that took 
them to the NBA Finals, is taking over in the Milwaukee Bucks' 
front office. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld replaces Bob Weinhauer, who was let go by the Bucks  
earlier this week after two years as general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks decided not to renew Weinhauer's contract shortly  
after free agents Michael Curry and Dell Curry said they would 
leave the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld, 44, spent nine years as the Knicks' general manager  
before he was fired in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Herb Kohl, owner and president of the Bucks, said Grunfeld  
was the only person he approached for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look for a winner, you look for someone who's done  
it. Ernie Grunfeld has done it,'' Kohl said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	New York canned Grunfeld when the Knicks slumped to 21-21 and  
were in danger of not making the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	New York then became the first No. 8 playoff seed to advance to  
the NBA Finals. The Knicks knocked off Miami, Atlanta and Indiana 
before losing the finals in five games to the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld took heat for trading four players, including the  
popular Charles Oakley, for Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby, who 
initially had difficulty fitting into the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Sprewell and Camby played key roles in lifting the Knicks  
into the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld attributed the Knicks' early losses to ``an awkward  
time of year'' caused by the players' lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``New York is a town of instant gratification,'' Grunfeld said.  
``I've been in the game all my life -- for over 20, 25 years -- and 
you can't just put a group of players together and expect them to 
be a cohesive unit right away, especially without practice time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld was drafted by the Bucks and played the first two of  
his nine NBA seasons in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he took his family on vacations to Milwaukee each summer  
while he was with the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great basketball town,'' Grunfeld said.  
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld likely will not have the final say on personnel matters  
with the Bucks. Coach George Karl is expected to make the team's 
final decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The new general manager said he would spend the next few days  
talking with Karl and the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to sit with them and we want to see what direction we  
really want to go in and what things are possible to get done,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Sign Center Straka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins avoided contract  
arbitration Friday by signing center Martin Straka to a $3.4 
million, two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	By reaching terms, Straka avoided an arbitration hearing  
scheduled Saturday in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Straka, 26, was 11th in the NHL with a career-high 83 points  
last season and played in his first all-star game. He also led the 
Penguins with 11 points, including six goals, in their first-round 
playoff upset of the New Jersey Devils and 15 points in their two 
playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	Straka has 125 points (54 goals, 71 assists) in two seasons  
since rejoining the Penguins in 1997. He first played for 
Pittsburgh from 1992-95, then was traded to Ottawa and later played 
for the New York Islanders and Florida Panthers before re-signing 
with Pittsburgh as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of the Czech Republic, he was the Penguins' first-round  
draft choice in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Darius Kasparaitis, forward Kip Miller and center Jan  
Hrdina remain unsigned.

<HEADLINE> Wages Key in UAW Contract Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. has signaled to Wall Street  
that it expects the United Auto Workers to make a stronger push for 
wage increases in this year's contract talks with Detroit's 
automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	That would mark a shift from previous negotiations in the 1990s,  
when the union sought relatively benign wage hikes in exchange for 
job security. It means automakers may have to give workers more of 
their growing revenues to ensure labor peace, a change that has 
some on Wall Street fearing a possible inflationary effect on the 
U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	At a recent meeting with about 40 major investors and analysts,  
GM chairman Jack Smith said the UAW felt it missed out on this 
decade's real wage growth and would likely place a higher priority 
on wage increases this year, according to investor sources who 
attended the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	GM declined to comment. ``It's our policy to negotiate with the  
union behind closed doors, which means we don't intend to begin 
negotiating in the public, with the media or analysts,'' spokesman 
Tony Cervone said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW did not return phone calls for comment. But the strategy  
expected by GM is in line with the collective bargaining resolution 
the union approved last May, arguing that its members deserve a 
larger share of the profits that GM, Ford Motor Co. and the 
Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG are making on U.S. sales. The 
automakers are on track to set an annual record for earnings in 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``These staggering profits and the market inroads the Big Three  
have made justify our demand for real wage gains over the course of 
the next agreement,'' the resolution said. 
</P>
<P>
	The current three-year contracts expire Sept. 14.  
</P>
<P>
	Analyst John Casesa of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., who did not attend  
the Smith meeting, said there is some concern on Wall Street that 
automakers will be so fearful of a strike in a booming market they 
will give too big a wage increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest concern is that they're going to sign a contract  
that's going to not just spook the auto industry, but spook 
everybody to say, `Geez, it's inflationary,''' Casesa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor professor Harley Shaiken of the University of California  
at Berkeley said auto contracts historically have set wage trends 
for the nation because of the industry's size and the attention the 
deals receive. He said he wouldn't be surprised to see a larger 
wage hike this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations began in June and will intensify around Labor Day,  
when the UAW is expected to target one company to negotiate an 
economic package that will set the pattern for all three. Before 
the unexpected death last week of the UAW's chief negotiator with 
DaimlerChrysler, Jack Laskowski, conventional wisdom was that the 
UAW would select DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	Now analysts suggest Ford might be the lead company. Ford's good  
relations with the union are being tested by its talk of spinning 
off its big parts unit, Visteon Automotive Systems Corp. The union 
opposes a spinoff and has set a national strike-authorization vote 
for Tuesday to drive that message home.

<HEADLINE> Forest Service Halts Timber Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) -- The U.S. Forest Service has put more  
than 400 million board feet of proposed timber sales on hold as a 
result of a federal court ruling that the agency failed to survey 
for rare plants, fungi and wildlife across the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier injunction had already blocked nine timber sales  
totaling 100 million board feet -- enough to build 7,000 homes -- in 
national forests in Washington, Oregon and Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, U.S. District Judge William Dwyer ruled in Seattle  
that the Forest Service had violated the Northwest Forest Plan by 
failing to carry out the plant and wildlife surveys prior to 
putting timber up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The landmark plan was adopted in 1994 to balance demand for  
timber from public lands against the need for habitat for dwindling 
populations of fish and wildlife. It reduced logging by 80 percent 
from levels during the 1980s, resulting in the loss of more than 
10,000 jobs in Oregon and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwyer also required the Forest Service and U.S. Bureau of Land  
Management to give at least 10 days notice of any sale that might 
violate the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was widely viewed as a setback for the Northwest  
Forest Plan, forged by the Clinton administration to lift 
injunctions against logging on millions of acres of spotted owl 
habitat in Northwest national forests. 
</P>
<P>
	The new sales put on hold are in Oregon and Northern California.  
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service plans to keep the hold in place until the  
legal issues can be clarified, said Rex Holloway, spokesman for the 
Forest Service's regional office in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to put ourselves in the position of awarding a  
contract and then having to turn around and modify it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The action was frustrating for the timber industry, which has  
seen logging on federal lands steadily decrease over the past 
decade as steps to protect fish and wildlife habitat increase. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the Forest Service was supposed to offer for sale 566  
million board feet of timber from national forests governed by the 
Northwest Forest Plan, but so far has offered only 100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``On a case by case basis, there will be tremendous difficulty  
brought on by this problem, particularly for smaller independently 
owned mills that don't have a private land base to rely on,'' said 
Jim Geisinger, president of the industry's Northwest Forestry 
Association. ``The Forest Service is finding they've created an 
impossible situation for themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dwyer has scheduled a hearing for later this month on a motion  
by environmentalists to expand the logging injunction to include 
sales awarded prior to October 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service estimates expanding the injunction would  
include 33 more timber sales amounting to 130 million board feet, 
Holloway said.

<HEADLINE> Neo-Nazis Plan Labor Day March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A white-supremacist group that nurtured  
Buford O. Furrow Jr.'s anti-Semitism before he attacked a Jewish 
community center plans to march Sept. 4 in nearby Coeur d'Alene, 
Idaho, despite security concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Coeur d'Alene cannot forbid the parade, but ``I am personally  
hoping no one comes and watches the march,'' City Council President 
Nancy Sue Wallace said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Aryan Nations founder Richard Butler applied for a city permit  
in July and got approval last week for a march on Sept. 4 with ``50 
to 80 followers, plus one automobile and one dog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow, 37, a former member of the Aryan Nation's security  
guards, was charged with murder in the shooting death of a postal 
worker and with the attempted murder of five at a Jewish community 
center in Los Angeles on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Law-enforcement agencies met Thursday to discuss security at the  
parade in light of the shootings, said Capt. Ben Wolfinger of the 
Kootenai County (Idaho) Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, this is going to become a cause for more  
demonstrators and it will rally the Aryans,'' Wolfinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Butler's compound near Hayden Lake, Idaho, on Friday  
got only busy signals. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who plan a counterdemonstration during the Sept. 4  
march is Irv Rubin of the Jewish Defense League. He and 200 others 
scuffled with about 80 Aryan Nations members and supporters in a 
Coeur d'Alene park on July 3, when a planned march was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	A July 10 march by the neo-Nazi group was cut short by local  
human-rights activists who blocked the parade route.

<HEADLINE> 94 Killed in Indonesian Rioting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMBON, Indonesia (AP) -- Government security forces overwhelmed  
by recent east Indonesian religious rioting that has left at least 
94 people dead denied today that troops gunned down rioters inside 
a church. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, unrelated violence continued in Indonesia's  
northwestern Aceh province. Four police officers died after a group 
of civilians opened fire on their jeep. 
</P>
<P>
	In the eastern Maluku province, witnesses said the death toll  
from clashes between Muslims and Christians included 24 people shot 
by troops in and around a Protestant church in Galala, a suburb of 
the provincial capital of Ambon. Those shootings were Tuesday and 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Church secretary Benny Tamaela said he saw security forces  
shooting at battling mobs armed with homemade spears, bows and 
arrows and gasoline bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all were shot to death, and it was very much regretted  
that some were shot inside the church,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the dead were Christians, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman Jekriel Philip denied that anyone was shot at  
the church, and said the rioters were killed in neighborhoods 
nearby. The bodies of several dead Christians were later brought to 
the church, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital officials reported five Muslims killed today as  
security personnel broke up riots south of Ambon. Prior to that, 
Philip said at least 89 people had been killed and another 455 
wounded since rioting erupted July 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions eased considerably today, Philip said, with troops  
patrolling the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have been reinforced in recent days by a battalion of  
Indonesia's toughest soldiers. The unit was one of two deployed 
after local security forces proved incapable of quelling the 
running battles. Media reports said an additional 600-man marine 
battalion was on its way to boost the security forces. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 people have died this year in a series of clashes  
and riots between Christians and Muslims in Maluku, 1,450 miles 
northeast of Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	In Aceh, the four police officers died today after five  
unidentified civilians on motorcycles opened fire on a jeep 
carrying six officers, North Aceh police chief Lt. Col. Syafei 
Aksal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Muslim separatists want the oil-rich region, about 1,100 miles  
northwest of Jakarta, to break away from Indonesia. More than 250 
people have been killed in clashes between government forces and 
the Aceh rebels since May. More than 100,000 civilians have been 
displaced.

<HEADLINE> Rockets' Owner: Barkley Deal Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Charles Barkley will return to the Houston  
Rockets and is almost ready to sign a deal, the team's owner said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Les Alexander told Houston radio station KTRH-AM and television  
station KRIV that the sides are close to a signing a one-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in our organization have spoken to Charles, and Charles  
is definitely coming back,'' Alexander said, adding that 
negotiations have taken place over the last 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny Thomas, the Rockets' top draft pick who has said he wanted  
to be tutored by Barkley at the power forward position, signed a 
contract with the Rockets on Friday. Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley initially said he was leaning toward retirement after  
the Los Angeles Lakers ousted the aging Rockets in the first round 
of the playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he said the Lakers, Seattle Supersonics and Utah Jazz  
were interested in his services. He reversed his stance last week, 
saying he hoped to have a deal with the Rockets done by mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley, a 14-year veteran, has spent the last three seasons in  
Houston. His agent, Glenn Guthrie, did not immediately return a 
call from The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander also said he was hopeful Scottie Pippen would remain  
with the team as well, but would not rule out a trade, which the 
forward reportedly has requested. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't especially pleased,'' Alexander said of the trade  
demand. ``He's the first person since I've owned the team who has 
really asked not to play in Houston.''

	Walid Alomar, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., has formed a

bankruptcy when creditors agreed in June to delay its debt 
repayment for six months.

<HEADLINE> Indians Activate Kenny Lofton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Indians' impressive injured list was  
reduced by one Friday night as the team activated center fielder 
Kenny Lofton from the 15-day DL. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton, sidelined since Aug. 7 with a strained right hamstring,  
is expected to be in the starting lineup for Saturday's game 
against the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Lofton, the Indians optioned third baseman  
Russell Branyan to Triple-A Buffalo. Branyan was hitting .211 with 
one homer and six RBIs, but had struck out 19 times in 38 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton could have played Friday night, but Indians manager Mike  
Hargrove decided to give him another day. Lofton is batting .305 
with six homers and 29 RBIs in 98 games. He has 24 stolen bases and 
entered Friday fifth in the AL with 89 runs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians have been banged up all year, and despite Lofton's  
activation, the club still has three regulars -- Sandy Alomar, 
Travis Fryman and Wil Cordero -- as well as two pitchers -- Jaret 
Wright and Dwight Gooden -- on the DL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're starting to get healthy, and that's good,''  
Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, out since May 17 after undergoing surgery on his left  
knee, began a 20-day rehab assignment last Tuesday with Buffalo. 
Hargrove said the All-Star catcher could be back with Cleveland by 
the end of the team's seven-game homestand.

<HEADLINE> College Football Hall Enshrines 22 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- As a child, Don Coryell stuttered, spoke  
with a lisp, couldn't spell and couldn't read. Football changed all 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	Coryell talked openly about his dyslexia Friday night during the  
enshrinement ceremony for the College Football Hall of Fame, 
publicly addressing a topic he said he'd never talked about openly 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	He often broke down during his speech as he described how  
playing high school football finally gave him the confidence to 
overcome his learning disability and paved the way for him to enter 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the best thing that ever happened to me,'' said  
Coryell, who received a standing ovation from the crowd. ``I wasn't 
the dumb kid in school who talked funny. It gave me confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coryell, who revolutionized the college passing game with his  
``Air Coryell'' attack, was one of 22 former players and coaches 
enshrined in the hall Friday night, including Bo Jackson, Jim 
McMahon and Tom Osborne. 
</P>
<P>
	Coryell's San Diego State teams ran off unbeaten streaks of 25  
and 31 games, and he had three seasons without a loss -- 1966, 1968 
and 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other than my family ... football is my entire life and has  
been my entire life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hall waived its normal three-year waiting period for only  
the second time in electing Osborne, who retired as coach at 
Nebraska in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the winningest coaches in Division I-A history, he led  
the Cornhuskers to national titles in 1994 and 1995, and his 1997 
squad shared the crown with Michigan. He was 255-49-3 in his 25 
years as the Cornhuskers' coach and reached the 250-win mark in his 
302nd game, faster than anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said he's had an even better coaching record since he  
retired in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't lost a game. I haven't made any bad calls,'' he  
said. ``It's amazing how nice people have been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McMahon, sporting his trademark sunglasses, said his father  
taught him growing up to be the best at whatever he chose to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took that to mean don't lose,'' he said. ``I hate to lose. I  
still do. I'm playing with my kids, it doesn't matter. I hate to 
lose. That's how I played the game. Never thought I was out of the 
game. I always thought we had a chance as long as there was time on 
the clock, and that's Jim McMahon in a nutshell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McMahon even tried to jokingly dispel his bad-boy reputation at  
BYU, where he threw for 9,536 yards and 84 touchdowns, but never 
seemed to fit in with the school's Mormon image. He remembered his 
coaches getting phone calls every Monday morning to report on what 
new stunt he had pulled. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny because I never spent a weekend in Provo,'' he  
said. ``I was always at these crazy, wild parties all over town, 
and I couldn't figure out who had it out for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, the lone Heisman Trophy winner in this year's class,  
couldn't address the crowd because he had laryngitis. He was a 
consensus All-American at Auburn in 1983 and an unanimous selection 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Other enshrinees included Division I players Al Brosky, Brad  
Budde, Bill Fralic, Randy Gradishar, Mel Long, Jerry Rhome, Jim 
Ritcher, Johnny Roland, Alex Sarkisian and Bill Stanfill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Divisional Class included players George Bork, Teel Bruner,  
George Floyd, Willie Galimore, Jim LeClair and Randy Trautman, 
along with coaches Billy Nicks and Jim Sochor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Division I-A players and coaches were elected last year and  
inducted during a ceremony in New York. The Divisional class was 
elected this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Football means a lot obviously, because it will bring men to  
tears up here, and I don't know many things other than death that 
will do that,'' said Fralic, an offensive lineman at Pitt who twice 
finished in the top 10 in the Heisman balloting.

<HEADLINE> Bucks Name Grunfeld As New GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. FRANCIS, Wis. (AP) -- Ernie Grunfeld, who began his NBA  
career with the Milwaukee Bucks, was hired as the team's general 
manager Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to be coming back home,'' Grunfeld said.  
</P>
<P>
	The former New York Knicks president and GM replaces Bob  
Weinhauer, who was fired this week after two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Herb Kohl, owner and president of the Bucks, said he knew  
it was time for a change in leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld was the only person approached for the job, Kohl said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've known Ernie for a long time, and we're satisfied he'll be  
a good fit,'' Kohl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld likely won't have the final say on personnel matters.  
Coach George Karl is expected to make the team's final decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we see the players the same way,'' Karl said. ``He  
likes athletes, he likes speed, he likes defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld, 44, spent nine years in the Knicks front office before  
he was fired in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts replaced Grunfeld  
when the team slumped to 21-21 and was in danger of failing to make 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	New York then became the first No. 8 playoff seed to advance to  
the NBA Finals. The Knicks knocked off Miami, Atlanta and Indiana 
before losing the finals in five games to the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld took heat for trading four players, including the  
popular Charles Oakley, for Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby, who 
initially had difficulty fitting into the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, however, Sprewell and Camby played key roles in lifting  
the Knicks into the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld attributed the Knicks' early losses to ``an awkward  
time of year'' caused by the players' lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``New York is a town of instant gratification,'' Grunfeld said.  
``I've been in the game all my life -- for over 20, 25 years -- and 
you can't just put a group of players together and expect them to 
be a cohesive unit right away, especially without practice time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld, who had been with the Knicks since signing as a  
free-agent player in 1982, acknowledged he was out of touch with 
the current team in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would spend the next few days talking with Karl and  
the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to sit with them and we want to see what direction we  
really want to go in and what things are possible to get done,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	During Weinhauer's two seasons as general manager, the Bucks  
were a combined 64-68. The Bucks decided not to renew his contract 
Tuesday, shortly after free agents Michael Curry and Dell Curry 
spurned the Bucks to sign with the Detroit Pistons and Toronto 
Raptors, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld was drafted by the Bucks and played the first two of  
his nine NBA seasons in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he took his family on vacations to Milwaukee each summer  
while he was with the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great basketball town,'' Grunfeld said.

<HEADLINE> Romero Ready To Fight Gutierrez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Former world champion Danny Romero  
learned four years ago that even the most obscure opponent has the 
potential to turn from prey to predator. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1995, Romero was the unbeaten IBF flyweight  
champion and an overwhelming favorite to beat Willy Salazar, a 
journeyman boxer from Guadalajara, Mexico. What was supposed to be 
little more than a workout for Romero turned into a nightmare. 
Salazar fractured Romero's left eye socket early in the fight and 
with Romero bleeding profusely most of the night, Salazar scored a 
convincing victory. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, Romero faces Leonardo ``Chucky'' Gutierrez,  
another less-than-marquee boxing name. He was a last-minute 
replacement for two other boxers that Romero's camp tried to sign. 
And no one seems to know what Gutierrez's record is. Fight Facts 
says he's 17-10 with 8 knockouts, but his trainer contends 
Gutierrez had three other victories in fights in Mexico that 
weren't registered. 
</P>
<P>
	To Romero, Gutierrez might as well be Salazar.  
</P>
<P>
	``There ain't no set up fights,'' Romero, who lives in  
Albuquerque, said this week. ``I've been in that situation -- 
everybody knows all about that. It (the Salazar fight) was 
supposedly all set up and he came out and whupped my butt, 
basically. We all know these types of guys are the most 
dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romero (34-3-1, 29 KOs) is trying to rebuild his career, and  
knows he can't afford another loss if he hopes to get another shot 
at a world title. 
</P>
<P>
	``My career started on a rocket and then it got stuck,'' Romero  
said. ``It got into a little valley. This is a stepping stone for 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That stone, Romero hopes, will lead to Paulie Ayala, the current  
WBA bantamweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Romero won five straight fights after losing to Salazar, and  
took the IBF junior bantamweight title from Colombia's Harold Grey 
with a second-round knockout in August 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But Romero's career started to slide when he lost the IBF title  
to longtime rival Johnny Tapia in July 1997. He also lost a 
controversial decision to junior featherweight champ Vuyani Bungu 
10 months ago and struggled in settling for a draw against Enrique 
Jupiter of Mexico City two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The fights against Bungu and Jupiter were at the 122-pound  
weight class and Romero looked sluggish. The punching power and 
quickness that were his forte when he held the 112-pound and 
115-pound IBF titles disappeared. Now he's dropped down to 118 
pounds (bantamweight). 
</P>
<P>
	``When I moved up, my punches weren't as snappy,'' Romero said.  
``I lost that and I tried changing style. I wanted to box, punch, 
then box some more. I screwed up. I've got to go back to where I 
was. All knockouts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A win by Romero should get him closer to a title shot against  
Ayala, who took the WBA title from Tapia earlier this year and 
handed Tapia the first loss of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Romero said he knows little about Gutierrez.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's supposed to be a very durable, tough guy,'' Romero said.  
``Guys like this, they've got nothing to lose and they know it. 
They know winning can mean a title shot. Look at what happened to 
Willy, he went on to fight Johnny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez, who spent this week working out in Romero's gym,  
oozed confidence, saying he has held his own against other world 
class fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a tough fight, as much for him as for  
me,'' Gutierrez said in Spanish. ``I'm not going to let up on him 
and I'm going to seize this opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romero hasn't fought in his hometown for 2 1/2 years. That, he  
said, provides him with some incentive to score a lopsided win. 
Gutierrez said it does the same thing for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will give me great pride to come in and beat him in his  
house,'' Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Gutierrez's trainer, Jimmy Montoya, said Romero can't afford  
to have another Willy Salazar on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he loses to Chucky, it means he's still going backwards,''  
Montoya said.

<HEADLINE> Some Lawn Lovers Battle Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTERVILLE, Ohio (AP) -- Severe drought isn't stopping Melissa  
and Tim Briggs from maintaining the lush lawn that surrounds their 
home in a new, largely treeless subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
	At the back of the house, four neighboring yards meet in a  
patchwork of colors. The Briggs' lawn, kept healthy by constant 
watering this summer, is the greenest of the lot -- a goal of Mrs. 
Briggs'. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Joneses,'' she says, gesturing toward neighbors.  
</P>
<P>
	Residents in this Columbus suburb are just inside the eastern  
swath of Ohio where Gov. Bob Taft last week asked people to 
voluntarily conserve water because of the worsening Eastern 
drought. But driven by a fear of an inferior lawn, some desperate 
homeowners and gardeners have continued pampering their grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the street from the Briggses, Al Wooten's lawn has only a  
couple of isolated yellow patches. The 58-year-old retired 
firefighter isn't ready to turn off his $1,500 computerized lawn 
irrigation system just yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pride,'' he says over and over when asked why he stays devoted  
to green grass. ``People come by, they see automatically that you 
really have a nice lawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wooten keeps a calendar in his garage and meticulously records  
each appointment with his Lawn Boy mower. ``I just mowed, ah, the 
30th time this summer,'' he reports after checking the calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass is considered ugly in India and a haven for unwanted bugs  
in China, but Americans love their lawns. More than 21 million 
households spent $16.8 billion on professional lawn care and 
landscape services alone last year, according to the Professional 
Lawn Care Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there are some who are remaining practical during the  
drought. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what you do, you lose ground,'' said Bruce Koonts,  
39, as he headed into a hardware store that sells garden supplies 
in this Columbus suburb. Koonts usually spends at least five hours 
a week tending a half-acre lawn and a large vegetable garden. He's 
not watering his lawn much now, although he doesn't miss a day with 
his garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Across town, in an older subdivision of small ranch houses, most  
people say they've given up watering their yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Champlin, 53, says he wants a green lawn but doesn't want to  
waste water -- and money -- wetting the grass. His lawn has seen 
better days but is still mostly green. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want it to look halfway decent,'' says Champlin, a  
product safety manager. ``If it's going to die, let it die.''

<HEADLINE> Cool Heads Following Mondesi Tirade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Raul Mondesi and Gary Sheffield, two Los  
Angeles Dodgers who had difficulty keeping their opinions to 
themselves in Montreal, predictably clammed up once they returned 
to Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Both declined interview requests before Friday night's game  
against Atlanta. Most of the damage control was handled by general 
manager Kevin Malone and manager Davey Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going through growing pains,'' Malone said. ``We're  
trying to build something here and we're going to continue to work 
hard to make this a championship organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That will require a happy Mondesi, who demanded a trade  
Wednesday. He punctuated those remarks with profanity-laced darts 
directed at Johnson and Malone. 
</P>
<P>
	Mondesi spent one recent game in the bullpen instead of the  
dugout and was benched by Johnson on Tuesday after arriving at the 
ballpark just 10 minutes before the team's scheduled pregame 
stretching. That was what provoked Mondesi's latest tantrum. 
</P>
<P>
	But Malone defended his decision not to suspend the two-time  
Gold Glove right fielder. And he sidestepped suggestions that 
Mondesi's incendiary remarks would have been tantamount to 
insubordination in any other workplace -- and dealt with more 
severely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying it's different. I'm just saying the way we're  
handling it is different,'' said Malone, who is paying Mondesi $8.5 
million this season and a guaranteed $20.5 million over the final 
two years of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, I don't read about insubordination being handled by  
other businesses in the papers,'' he said. ``I think Davey has 
handled it appropriately and he did the right thing. We're not 
going to deal with the issue publicly. We're going to continue to 
deal with it internally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield also vented his frustration in Montreal, saying that  
was tired of all the negativity engulfing the Dodgers and also 
articulated a wish to be traded if significant changes aren't made 
during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he meant well,'' Malone said in Sheffield's defense.  
``Maybe it didn't come out quite as he expected, but Gary Sheffield 
has been a model citizen and he's done a great job for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gary's just frustrated. He wants to win and he doesn't feel  
like everybody's on the same page, as far as the players are 
concerned. He's just trying to help the process along as far as 
being the leader of the team. He's a guy who knows how to win and 
he just expects everybody to have the same attitude, desire and 
preparation that he has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mondesi's flammable personality isn't anything new for Johnson,  
who has dealt with Darryl Strawberry in New York, Bobby Bonilla in 
Baltimore and Marge Schott in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been certain comments about players and whatever.  
But, by and large, it's probably one of my better clubhouses,'' 
Johnson said. ``You have to have emotion, but it's unfortunate when 
emotion overrules reason. And that's what happened with Mondesi. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't a team in turmoil,'' Johnson said in reference to a  
banner headline in one of the local papers. ``We're basically 
together every day for eight months, and emotions can run high and 
low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mondesi has yet to offer any apology directly to Malone, who has  
yet to say a negative word about the temperamental outfielder 
despite his expletive-laced diatribe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was somewhat surprised and confused by it,'' said Malone,  
who was not in Montreal with the team. ``But he's an emotional 
player, he cares and he's sensitive. And I think he'll apologize in 
due time.''

<HEADLINE>  Russia: Caucasus War May Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russia sent reinforcements today to  
bolster an offensive against Islamic militants in the Caucasus 
region, and acting Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said the campaign 
might be carried into neighboring Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat to strike Chechnya, which fought a war of secession  
against Russia from 1994-96, was the strongest indication yet that 
the uprising in the Russian republic of Dagestan could lead to a 
wider war. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin has promised to end the uprising quickly, although  
President Boris Yeltsin has said there is no hurry. The militants 
seized the villages in the Botlikh district of Dagestan, close to 
the border with Chechnya, last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Siberia for meetings with regional officials, Putin said the  
situation in Dagestan ``is developing positively for us.'' He later 
said Russia would strike at the militants wherever necessary -- 
including bases inside Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chechnya -- this is the territory of Russia, and we will strike  
at militants wherever they are located,'' Putin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen soldiers guarding the republic's border with a section  
of Russia to the northwest claimed that a column of armored 
vehicles belonging to Russia crossed into Chechnya early today to 
provoke an attack and find the location of Chechen posts, the 
Interfax news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	No skirmishes were reported, and the column of vehicles left an  
hour after entering Chechnya, Interfax said without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Interior Ministry denied that the incursion took place.  
</P>
<P>
	Many of the rebels infiltrated from inside Chechnya, which has  
had effective independence since the end of its war against Russia. 
The Dagestan fighting is the biggest challenge to Russian authority 
since that war. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin claimed that a major offensive to drive out the rebels had  
begun. A spokesman with Russia's Interior Ministry backed that 
claim, announcing today that Defense and Interior Ministry troops 
were in the second stage of an operation to oust the rebels from 
Botlikh. 
</P>
<P>
	Five airplanes arrived in the Dagestani capital of Makhachkala  
today carrying troops, weapons and medical equipment. Russian 
defense officials gave no further details about the shipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Ministry did say that it was working to fortify  
strategic facilities in the region, including a mountain tunnel 
that was seized Thursday night, according to ITAR-Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the uprising began, Russia has primarily conducted an air  
campaign against the rebels, flying more than 200 sorties in the 
first six days, according to the Defense Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	In that time, the Interior Ministry claims, at least 150 rebels  
have been killed and 300 wounded. It also claimed that Russian 
forces had destroyed two rebel bases, four anti-aircraft guns and 
two trucks with militants inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels acknowledged losses for the first time Thursday, but  
said only five of their fighters had been killed and 15 wounded, 
Interfax said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has admitted to losing three helicopters. It has said 10  
soldiers have been killed and 27 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Ministry claimed to have driven out all militants  
from another district of Dagestan, Tsumada. It said that Russian 
intelligence services had determined that the rebels occupied seven 
out of 35 settlements in Botlikh. 
</P>
<P>
	Many rebels belong to the fundamentalist Wahhabi sect and are  
seeking an independent Islamic republic in the mostly Muslim 
regions of the Caucasus Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev ordered a pay raise to Russian  
fighters in Dagestan, ranging from 70 percent to 170 percent 
depending on the nature of their mission.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Acts Quickly After Tornado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Fire Chief Tom Tallon had seen it before --  
human chains relaying materials and volunteers streaming to command 
posts, asking how they could help. 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't referring just to the deadly tornado that struck Salt  
Lake City on Wednesday. He had seen the response in 1983, when 
floods turned sandbag-lined streets into rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both events really brought out the humanity of this town,''  
said Tallon, a 27-year fire department veteran. ``They are a robust 
group of citizens, and their spirits are high in times like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado struck quickly, killing one person and injuring  
dozens of others. The National Weather Service had issued a severe 
thunderstorm warning, but forecasters said they couldn't 
immediately tell a tornado was roaring through downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters normally rely on computers to interpret radar images  
and give an early indication that a tornado is likely. In this 
case, forecaster Mike Conger said, the system didn't pick up the 
telltale signature of a twister until it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't a lot of hard evidence prior to its development  
that would have given us a reason to go with a tornado warning,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	City and state officials said there was no indication the  
weather service made mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado came in too low for the weather service's radar on  
Promontory Point, meteorologist Bill Alder said. The radar cannot 
detect anything in the Salt Lake Valley -- including tornadoes -- 
below 9,000 to 10,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Aiming the radar lower would allow hills to block some waves and  
make other waves bounce off the ground, ruining data used for 
forecasting, said Jim Belville of the NEXRAD Operational Support 
Facility in Norman, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem with the radar system -- part of a $4.5 billion  
weather service modernization -- is that software so good at using 
radar data to spot Midwest tornadoes cannot yet recognize the 
telltale signature in the mountainous West, Belville told The Salt 
Lake Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado damaged 127 homes, including 34 that are now  
uninhabitable. Mayor Deedee Corradini on Thursday placed 
preliminary damage estimates from the surprise twister at $150 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Outdoor Retailers Market, held twice a year in Salt Lake  
City for the past four years, was to open today after a one-day 
delay. It allows manufacturers of everything from fishing poles to 
kayaks to peddle their goods to stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to hurt, but we're not going to let this keep us  
down,'' said Rich DiLeo, a California businessman who makes hot dog 
holders and fly swatters. ``We didn't come this far to have a 
tornado take us out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as quickly as the twister came and went, volunteers were  
directing traffic and striding through neighborhoods, equipped with 
chain saws and hard hats. 
</P>
<P>
	For Tallon, who has served as chief four years, the response was  
reminiscent of 16 years ago. After heavy rain, residents stuffed 
sandbags and placed them along State Street, turning one of Salt 
Lake's major arteries into a wide river of muddy water. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as comparing a natural catastrophe, this event is  
larger than the flood of 1983,'' Tallon said. ``It required more 
resources over a much shorter period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But one thing remained the same. Mormon church members quickly  
hit the streets with a 50-page disaster booklet and a 
military-style plan for handling emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, Mormon leaders have urged members, who make up some  
70 percent of Utah's population, to stockpile a year's supply of 
food as a hedge against the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
	Before survivalism was popular, Utah companies sold food in  
40-pound bags, 100-hour candles and water storage barrels. The 
church has a silo filled with 19 million pounds of wheat in case 
normal distribution systems break down. 
</P>
<P>
	Those policies, which date to the state's pioneer history have  
helped when Utah is hit by natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had dozens of people turn out just to help clean up,'' said  
Ronald Coleman, bishop of the First Capitol Hill Ward, the first 
residential area hit by the storm after it hit downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that the church is known for helping out  
in emergency situations,'' said Corradini, who is not Mormon.

<HEADLINE> Sanders Tells Reporter He's Done </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Barry Sanders said it again. He is done as an NFL  
player. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Detroit Lions running back spoke briefly Friday night  
with a reporter from The Oakland Press of Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is it. I am done,'' Sanders said in the driveway of his  
home in Rochester Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived at his home in a sports utility vehicle at about  
halftime of his former team's first exhibition game against 
Atlanta. Sanders said he had nothing to say to his fans, his team 
or the Detroit Lions organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sorry, but I just can't talk about this,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, Sanders told a team official he won't reconsider  
his decision to retire, the Detroit Free Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he gave it a lot of thought and he wants to go out on  
top,'' Lions security director Allen ``Jocko'' Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes is also a family friend who has been staying with  
Sanders' father, William, in Wichita, Kan., while the team has been 
trying to contact the running back. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `I've got my health and I've got my strength. If I  
want to do something else, I can. I didn't get injured and I've 
been playing football for 22 years,''' Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, 31, had announced his retirement through a statement  
late last month and had not talked to any team official before 
speaking with Hughes on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no answer late Friday at William Sanders' home and a  
telephone message left earlier in the night was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes relayed the message to Lions vice chairman William Clay  
Ford Jr. and chief operating officer Chuck Schmidt, according to 
the Free Press. Lions officials were in Atlanta at the team's 35-31 
loss to the Falcons and could not be reached immediately for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes said Sanders ``was honest and straight with me, and you  
have to respect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, 31, indicated he will talk to Ford within the next few  
days as a courtesy, but Schmidt said the Lions will respect his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not mad at the organization or anybody in it,'' Schmidt  
said. ``He's basically restating what he said, he's retiring. He's 
been playing football for a long time and now is the time to go. 
And you have to respect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing his retirement, Sanders said his desire to quit  
football outweighed his desire to play -- even to get the 1,458 
yards he needs to break Walter Payton's career rushing record. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes said Sanders told him the record doesn't mean anything to  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `If I'm considered one of the top 10 football players  
ever to play this game, that's an honor in itself,''' Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes also said Sanders has a lot of respect for Payton, 45,  
who announced in February he has a rare liver disease and is 
awaiting a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Walter is sick and Barry wanted him to know the record is  
still his,'' Hughes said. ``He knew he could come back and probably 
get the record, but it's not about that.''

<HEADLINE> Warren Beatty in Presidential Run? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ronald Reagan became president, so why not  
fellow actor Warren Beatty, who played a brutally honest politician 
in the 1998 movie ``Bulworth''? 
</P>
<P>
	Beatty, 62, has reportedly been considering a run for the 2000  
presidential bid as a Democrat or perhaps an independent. While 
party insiders say he would have a ``slim-to-none'' chance of 
winning, the lure of celebrity politics is strong this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony to a celebrity's instant access to headlines, the  
ripples of a possible Beatty campaign quickly grew to a swell. 
Ditto with recruiters boosting TV slugfest host Jerry Springer for 
a U.S. Senate seat from Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	In Memphis, wrestler Jerry ``The King'' Lawler, whose claim to  
national fame is slapping comedian Andy Kaufman on ``Late Night 
With David Letterman,'' wants to be mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mickey Mouse and Howdy Doody must not be available,'' sniffed  
Cleveland's Plain Dealer at the thought of a Springer candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard political analyst Laura Liswood chalked it up to  
Capitol-sized Hollywood egos. ``They do start believing their own 
press releases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear Thursday whether Beatty, the actor who created  
the dangerously honest senator in ``Bulworth,'' was for real about 
joining Campaign 2000 -- or just stirring publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	After the morning newspaper made him a potential candidate,  
Beatty sounded apologetic on the phone to progressive Washington 
activist Robert Borosage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll bet you're surprised to hear you're an adviser to me  
since we've never talked,'' Beatty told Borosage, co-director of 
the progressive Campaign for America's Future and a veteran of 
Jesse Jackson's 1988 presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the headline ``Actor hinting that he'll run for  
president,'' in Thursday's New York Times, Beatty had falsely named 
Borosage one of his political consultants and railed on about money 
corrupting politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Beatty did not return press calls on Thursday, apparently  
content to watch the buzz he created gather momentum -- or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's anxious to use it to start raising some of these issues''  
such as campaign finance reform, Borosage said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he's in the process of seriously putting  
together a presidential campaign. He's not a fool, so he knows he 
has lots of difficulties in being taken seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beatty's talk of the need for a liberal alternative to Democrats  
Al Gore and Bill Bradley -- someone fresh, different -- echoes in 
some of the talk surrounding Springer, the controversial talk-show 
host, and his possible candidacy in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this guy would spice things up to the point that  
people would use it as an opportunity to express their dismay at 
the mainstream politicians,'' said Dan Martin, head of the state 
AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
	The attraction between celebrity and politician is magnetic,  
said Janet Staihar, a PR agent whose portfolio includes Cafe 
Milano, Washington's only real celeb hangout. 
</P>
<P>
	But giving in to the hunger carries risk, said Washington  
pollster Mark Mellman. And celebrities may be misreading Gov. Jesse 
``The Body'' Ventura's election. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, the pro wrestler costumed in feathers and Lycra shorts,  
sparked such voter interest that his gubernatorial election last 
year witnessed a record 60.4 percent turnout in Minnesota compared 
to a national turnout of 37 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	He benefited from same-day voter registration, which is not  
available nationwide. In the same year's congressional races, 
voters rejected millionaire candidates with flash but no public 
record. ``That sent the message that experience counts,'' said 
Mellman. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he added, ``There is a portion of the populace that will  
be turned on by something new, different and mischievous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California's Democratic Party Chairman Art Torres said the  
party's presidential race between Gore and Bradley already has 
``two candidates who bring qualifications and seasoning to the 
ticket. I don't think we need any more candidates.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Suspect Charged With Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEREY PARK, Calif. (AP) -- Ismael Ileto quietly listened to  
the details of his brother's death -- of how the postman filling in 
for a colleague agreed to mail a letter and was shot nine times, 
police say, simply for being a federal employee of Filipino 
descent. 
</P>
<P>
	The randomness and violence of Joseph Ileto's murder, an hour  
after a shooting rampage at a Jewish community center, left his 
brother speechless. He looked down, shook his head once and bit his 
lip. 
</P>
<P>
	``This family has been shocked and grieving through this whole  
thing,'' Ismael's wife, Deena, said, squeezing her husband's hand. 
``We can't imagine anyone who would want to hurt another person 
like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles County prosecutors on Thursday charged white  
supremacist Buford O. Furrow Jr. with murder in the death of the 
39-year-old Ileto, a shooting U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas said 
was carried out ``deliberately, maliciously and with 
premeditation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors had already charged Furrow in the shooting  
on Wednesday; it is a federal crime because Ileto was a government 
worker on duty when he was killed. A federal-local task force will 
decide whether he will be tried jointly by state and federal 
authorities or face separate trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Either murder charge could lead to a death sentence.  
</P>
<P>
	The county also charged Furrow with five counts of attempted  
murder in Tuesday's attack at the community center that woundded 
five people. Two remain hospitalized, including 5-year-old Benjamin 
Kadish, who was in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow, 37, told investigators he had no intention of shooting  
small children and that they ``got in the way'' as he shot at a 
teen-age counselor and the center's receptionist, the Los Angeles 
Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the newspaper, Furrow said he scouted three  
prominent Jewish institutions -- the Museum of Tolerance, the 
Skirball Cultural Center and the University of Judaism -- while 
shopping for places to kill Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	He found security too tight at the facilities and stumbled upon  
the North Valley Jewish Community Center in suburban Granada Hills 
after pulling off a freeway to get gas, the newspaper quoted an 
unidentified source as saying. It was unclear when Furrow made his 
scouting trip, though museum staff recalled seeing someone who 
resembled Furrow two or three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	After the charges were announced, Furrow was led into a federal  
courtroom for arraignment. Looking around at the crowd of mostly 
reporters, he smiled and said to his public defender, ``They all 
like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Magistrate Judge Carolyn Turchin refused bail for Furrow,  
who has had mental problems as well as ties to hate groups in the 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney's complaint alleged that Ileto ``was  
intentionally killed because of his race or nationality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow allegedly confessed that he stopped the postal worker on  
a quiet suburban street and asked him to send a letter. When Ileto 
agreed, Furrow pulled out a gun and shot him as he tried to run 
away, Mayorkas said. Ileto was filling in for another carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow told investigators Ileto was a good ``target of  
opportunity'' because he was nonwhite -- he thought the postman was 
Hispanic or Asian -- and because he worked for the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow had stayed in a hotel near Los Angeles for two nights  
before the crimes, the Times reported. After abandoning a stolen 
car following the shootings, he reportedly got a haircut, bought a 
shirt and took a taxi to Hollywood where he searched unsuccessfully 
for a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow then had several beers before flagging down a taxi  
driver, the newspaper reported. Hovik Garibyan, 31, said Furrow 
paid him $800 in large bills for a ride to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just paid me and he fell asleep,'' Garibyan told The  
Associated Press. ``He laid down in the back seat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was brought back to Los Angeles late Wednesday aboard a  
U.S. Customs helicopter after waiving extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	As relatives arrived from Chicago and New York for a funeral  
Saturday, the family of the slain postman tried to come to terms 
with the pain of their loss and a fear that speaking out might lead 
to more violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that we have a son, I'm kind of looking behind my back,''  
Ismael Ileto said. ``It could happen to you, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few miles away, the community center remained closed and under  
guard. A half-dozen flowers lay by the fence. A handwritten poster 
hung nearby read: ``Our prayers with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The center was expected to reopen Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're all looking forward to being in our own place again and  
continuing with our lives,'' said preschool teacher Ruby Diamond.

<HEADLINE> Town Gears Up for Only V-J Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOOSUP, Conn. (AP) -- Bill Poprosky and the boys at American  
Legion Post 91 are getting ready for the town's biggest annual 
event -- one of the nation's only V-J Day parades. They're expecting 
at least 10,000 uniformed marchers Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Although World War II ended more than 50 years ago, Japan's  
surrender is still cause for celebration in this tiny village near 
the Rhode Island border. No matter that Japan is now an important 
ally and trading partner of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just doing our part to remember history and the  
sacrifices that were made,'' said Poprosky, a past president of the 
Moosup American Legion and the parade chairman for the past 11 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hostilities between the United States and Japan ended Aug. 14,  
1945, five days after the second of two atomic bombs was dropped on 
the island nation. The formal surrender was signed Sept. 2, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	V-J Day generally comes and goes with little fanfare -- although  
the small mining town of Arma, Kan., also traditionally has a 
celebration and parade to commemorate the day. Rhode Island 
recognizes the second Monday of August as a state holiday called 
Victory Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Poprosky, a Vietnam veteran who spends his weekends working  
behind the bar in the Post 91 clubhouse, said there's strong 
support for the parade in Moosup. The former textile mill town has 
hundreds of military veterans among its 4,704 residents, Poprosky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no Japanese people in Moosup, said town Clerk Helen  
Coombs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a few Vietnamese, but I don't know of anybody who's  
Japanese,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, census figures for 1990 showed that only about 3,800 of  
Connecticut's 3.3 million residents are of Japanese ancestry. Only 
57 were listed in Windham County, where Moosup is located. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Coombs, who has marched in several parades, says the event  
can draw ``as many as 25,000 visitors, including observers and 
marchers, if the weather is good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's marchers will include members of the American Legion,  
AmVets, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Vets, and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	But Moosup resident Anne Radei doesn't expect many locals will  
be curbside on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've all seen it many times before,'' she said. ``I don't  
plan to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Japanese consulate in Boston, which handles the  
New England region, said they take no position on the parade, a 
Moosup tradition since 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, some people at the parade wore T-shirts bearing  
nuclear mushroom clouds and the message: ``Made in America. Tested 
in Japan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The T-shirts were made by Ed Mennuti, commander of American  
Legion Post 19 in Willimantic. His wife, Mary, president of the 
Post 19 Ladies Auxiliary, said the shirts will be back this year by 
popular demand, for $13 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got 150 printed up and I've sold half of them already,''  
she said last weekend. ``I've no doubt I'll sell them all.''

<HEADLINE> 4 Taiwan students Killed in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. ANTHONY, Idaho (AP) -- A rental van carrying Taiwanese  
exchange students towards Yellowstone National Park overturned in 
rural eastern Idaho, killing four passengers and injuring six 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	All but one of the van's occupants were ejected from the vehicle  
after it rolled over on Highway 20 early Thursday. Three women were 
dead at the scene and another died at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight women and two men were about 40 miles southwest of  
Yellowstone when the driver lost control and the van flipped once. 
</P>
<P>
	``The driver said she didn't know what happened,'' said Deputy  
Brian Loseke of the Fremont County Sheriff's Office. ``It appears 
she fell asleep at the wheel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vacationers, all exchange students in their 20s and 30s from  
New York City, were traveling toward Yellowstone's west entrance in 
Wyoming, Loseke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Articles recovered from the van indicated that the tourists  
landed at Salt Lake International Airport on Wednesday night and 
rented a 15-passenger van. Loseke said the group drove through the 
night to get as far north as St. Anthony, about 220 miles from 
where they began. 
</P>
<P>
	The identities of the dead and injured were withheld pending  
notification of family members, Loseke said. At least two people 
were in critical condition.

<HEADLINE> Miss America Performances Cut Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Unhappy with the caliber of its  
contestants' talent routines, the Miss America Pageant is cutting 
back on the number of performances included on the television show. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, all 10 semifinalists have performed solo talent  
segments as part of the contest. This year, only five will, and 
they will be backed by professional dancers and musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is to improve the telecast and boost its ratings, which  
have plummeted in recent years, pageant CEO Robert Beck told The 
Press of Atlantic City in a story published Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers get bored watching the amateur talent routines, Beck  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thirty or 40 years ago, there was no other choice. You watched  
us or flipped to one or two other stations. Today, you can flip to 
20 or 30 stations and find great entertainment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 79th annual Miss America Pageant is Sept. 18.

<HEADLINE> Police: Some Immune to Pepper Spray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Police here are being taught that pepper  
spray is less effective against Mexican-Americans and other ethnic 
groups because of their long exposure to spicy foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Cambridge officers are told that people who are exposed to hot  
peppers at an early age develop a tolerance to the spray. The 
Cambridge Police Department offers no supporting scientific data. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people will laugh when they hear this -- it's so  
ridiculous,'' said Manuel Macias, a lawyer who assists Central 
American refugees in Cambridge. ``But it's a laugh with irony and 
an edge because of the knowledge that these officers think you are 
physically different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spray, a mixture of cayenne pepper and natural oils commonly  
called ``O.C.'' by police, is used to incapacitate belligerents. 
When it's sprayed directly into the eyes or face, it causes a 
severe burning sensation that lasts up to an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people it doesn't affect are people who have consumed  
cayenne pepper from the time they are small children, and this 
generally breaks into ethnic categories,'' said Frank Gutoski, the 
officer who teaches the programs. 
</P>
<P>
	He said people who handled cayenne pepper in produce  
departments, processing plants or fields also were less 
susceptible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mexican-Americans tend to be pickers,'' he said. ``So with  
Cajuns, Mexican-Americans, Pakistani, Indian ... what happens is 
that O.C. is effective for a much shorter time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gutoski said he received his information from the Massachusetts  
Criminal Justice Training Council. But council director Kevin 
Harrington denied the information was part of his program's 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not something that's condoned by our agency at all,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman Frank Pasquarello said the information was  
presented to officers in a professional manner and no ethnic groups 
were being ridiculed. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said officers have never been instructed to give a  
longer spray to members of certain ethnic groups.

<HEADLINE> Steffi Graf's Career Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- It is one of the most enduring images in tennis:  
Steffi Graf, both feet off the ground, pounding a forehand winner. 
</P>
<P>
	As predictable as it was devastating, Graf's signature shot  
ruled the sport for nearly two decades. From the time she turned 
pro in 1982 at the age of 13 until her retirement Friday at the age 
of 30, Graf played the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	Others may have hit the ball harder, served faster or volleyed  
better, but Graf didn't need to change. 
</P>
<P>
	She was simply a better athlete than everyone else.  
</P>
<P>
	Graf bridged three generations of women's tennis, eclipsing  
Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert in the 1980s, battling for 
supremacy with Monica Seles and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the 
early and mid-1990s, and fighting off the teen vanguard of Martina 
Hingis and Co. in the late '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf's handicap was her health. Sinus problems, allergies, foot,  
leg, wrist and back injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	It was almost fitting that the final match of her career ended  
with an injury. She was forced to retire from a second-round match 
against Amy Frazier at the TIG Classic in Carlsbad, Calif., after 
straining her left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	If it hadn't been for her perpetual ailments, who knows how many  
more titles Graf would have won? With 22 Grand Slam victories, she 
was only two shy of Margaret Court's career record. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf excelled on all surfaces -- clay, hard courts, grass and  
indoor carpet. Even though she was not a natural grass-court 
player, she won Wimbledon seven times thanks to her court speed, 
strong serve, trademark forehand and even an occasional volley. 
</P>
<P>
	On any surface, Graf preferred to play from the baseline. She  
could control a match with one shot, dictating rallies with her 
whippet forehand. Hopping at the baseline, slightly pigeon-toed, 
she would lift off the ground, lean into the shot and slam the ball 
past her opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	If Graf had a weakness, it was her backhand. She preferred to  
slice the ball, a defensive shot to keep the ball in play, rather 
than use the more offensive topspin. But her backhand was still 
consistent and effective enough to help her beat most players. 
</P>
<P>
	What set Graf apart was her athleticism. At 5-foot-9 and 132  
pounds, she was sleek and built like a sprinter. She ran like one, 
too, and Navratilova was among those who said Graf could have been 
an Olympic 400-meter champion had she not chosen to play tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf rarely showed emotion on or off the court. In recent years,  
when she hit a big shot, she'd pump her fist and shout like other 
players. But mostly, she stayed within herself. 
</P>
<P>
	In interviews and news conferences, Graf rarely opened up. But  
when she let her blond hair spill down over her shoulders, and 
smiled or laughed, she could light up a room. 
</P>
<P>
	Reserved and sometimes aloof, she shunned the trappings of fame  
and resented media interest in her private life and that of her 
father, Peter, who was jailed for evading taxes on her income. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf once spoke of how she loved playing in a minor tournament  
in Brighton, England, because she could stroll along the seaside by 
herself and pop into shops without anyone noticing her. 
</P>
<P>
	In typical fashion, after her loss to Lindsay Davenport in the  
Wimbledon final last month, knowing she would not be back again, 
Graf walked off Center Court without so much as a wave to the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's why the public never warmed to Graf the way they  
did to other champions. At Wimbledon, Graf never enjoyed the 
popularity of fellow German Boris Becker, who loved to show his 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Graf wasn't the most charismatic personality in the  
game, she was certainly the best player of her era and, many would 
say, the greatest of all time.

<HEADLINE> MCI Network Problems Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Continuing problems with data transmission  
technology provided by MCI WorldCom Inc. caused the Chicago Board 
of Trade to halt electronic trading Friday and disrupted high-speed 
service for nearly 30 percent of MCI's global data network 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest disruption had angry Board of Trade officials hinting  
they make look elsewhere for help with the exchange's Project A 
electronic trading platform. 
</P>
<P>
	``This recurring MCI WorldCom failure is unacceptable,'' Board  
of Trade president Thomas Donovan said in a letter to MCI WorldCom 
president and CEO Bernard Ebbers. ``... Market users worldwide 
depend on Project A around the clock, and MCI WorldCom has let them 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom spokeswoman Linda Laughlin said teams of  
technicians were trying to pinpoint the problem. She couldn't say 
when the system might be back on line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time we can't provide 100 percent of the service it's  
frustrating to the customers and it's frustrating to us,'' Laughlin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems at MCI WorldCom, the No. 2 U.S. long-distance  
carrier, began late last week during a system upgrade, when a 
glitch in its network kept customers from transferring information 
and partially disabled thousands of automated teller machines 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on CBOT's Project A was sporadic for several days this  
week before resuming normal functions early Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Power outages in downtown Chicago Thursday caused the CBOT to  
close its doors early as well as shut down electronic trading. 
However, while it resumed trading Friday, Project A remained quiet 
because of the MCI network problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Board of Trade officials said Project A, which allows members to  
trade futures contracts linked to U.S. Treasuries, the Dow Jones 
industrial average, grains and other commodities, would resume at 6 
p.m. Sunday regardless of MCI WorldCom's status. The CBOT will go 
to a backup trading plan if the system is still down, officials 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Laughlin said most of the affected customers were in large  
cities such as New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI's problems come at a time the company is launching a $100  
million program to build data centers and expand its existing 
facilities in an attempt to lure more customers to its burgeoning 
data and Internet businesses.

<HEADLINE> Wholesale Prices Rise in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Falling prices for beef, vegetables and fruit  
partly offset an increase for gasoline to hold wholesale costs in 
general to a modest 0.2 percent increase for July, the Labor 
Department reported Friday. Financial markets were buoyed by the 
news and ended the week on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month's increase in the Producer Price Index, which  
measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, 
followed a 0.1 percent drop in wholesale prices in June, the second 
decline this year. 
</P>
<P>
	And excluding the volatile energy and food categories, wholesale  
prices were unchanged in July, after a 0.2 percent decline in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets welcomed the better-than-expected figures. The  
bond market rallied, pushing the yield down on Treasury's 30-year 
bonds, and the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 184.26 points 
at 10,973.65. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, many economists held to their belief that the  
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a second time this 
year on Aug. 24. Their worry: The economy still is growing too 
strongly, and inflation dangers may be lurking. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's report ``doesn't eliminate the high probability of a  
quarter-point interest rate increase for this reason: Because it 
appears that inflation pressures are building beneath the 
surface,'' said Paul Kasriel, chief economist for Northern Trust 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, Kasriel and other economists pointed to a 0.6  
percent increase in the price of intermediate goods, which include 
materials used in an early phase of the production process. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Zandi, an economist with Regional Financial Associates,  
agreed that an August rate increase is probable. But he said the 
financial markets' found comfort in the July wholesale report 
``because it may reduce the chances that the Fed would have to 
tighten aggressively later in the year or even early next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, wholesale prices have risen at an annual rate  
of 1.7 percent, compared to no change for all of 1998. The pickup 
in this year's wholesale prices comes from big increases in energy 
costs, which had been falling for much of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	For July, energy costs rose 3.4 percent, led by a hefty 12.7  
percent increase in gasoline prices, an advance that motorists felt 
at the pumps last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The July gain in gasoline prices was the largest since a 26  
percent surge in April, which helped push overall wholesale prices 
up by 0.5 percent that month, the biggest increase this year. That 
gain plus an even sharper April rise in consumer prices put the Fed 
on inflation alert and led to a June 30 increase in a key Fed 
interest rate, the first hike in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Ratajczak, director of Georgia State University's  
economic forecasting project, attributed the July spike in energy 
prices, including gasoline, to a variety of factors that include 
production cuts by members of the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries, a pickup in demand from recovering economies 
in Asia and Latin America and increased energy demands caused by 
unusually hot weather in many parts of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	While gasoline pump prices reached their highest point in more  
than 18 months in July, a nationwide check of gasoline stations by 
the Lundberg Survey has shown in the last two weeks a slowing in 
the rate of increases. 
</P>
<P>
	July's 3.4 percent rise in energy costs was offset partially by  
a 0.9 percent drop in food prices, the biggest decline since April. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef prices, which had risen sharply in June, fell 3.4 percent  
in July, their biggest drop since February 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower costs for raising livestock because of cheap grain prices  
and a mild winter that resulted in fewer dead cattle helped drive 
beef prices down, Ratajczak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vegetable prices also were down a sharp 8.1 percent in July, led  
by steep declines in prices of cauliflower, broccoli, tomatoes and 
green peppers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fruit prices also were down, declining 3.2 percent as the price  
of blueberries, nectarines, melons and peaches all fell. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ratajczak said a drought that has hit parts of the country  
is driving up vegetable and fruit prices and that's likely to show 
up in next month's report. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the level of  
inventories held by businesses on shelves and back lots rose 0.3 
percent in June, but sales climbed at an even faster 0.9 percent 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
	That brought the inventory-to-sales ratio to 1.34, meaning it  
would take 1.34 months to exhaust inventories at the June sales 
pace. Analysts see the current inventory level as posing no threat 
that businesses will be forced to cut back production to work off 
unwanted supplies.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Pro Tennis Players Robbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) -- One of Canada's top pro tennis players  
and his doubles partner were robbed while looking to buy marijuana, 
according to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon Larose, who is ranked fifth in Canada, and Derek Turek  
weren't hurt in the Aug. 7 robbery in Binghamton where qualifying 
rounds of the Frito Lay/USTA Challenger tournament were being 
played. But the police report of the crime differs from the 
harrowing experience Larose described to a Montreal newspaper in 
Friday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Alex Minor, reading from a Binghamton police report, said  
the trouble started when the athletes were looking for a contact to 
obtain marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Larose stated ``we decided to try to buy some pot,'' and Turek  
stated ``we decided to look for some marijuana,'' Minor said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tennis players picked up two unidentified men who later  
robbed the athletes of $300 and jewelry. The tennis players told 
police the suspects displayed a gun, then shot it when they left 
the players' car. The players told police the shot sounded and 
smelled like it came from a toy cap gun, Minor said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the way the players describe the scene in The Journal  
de Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	The players said they pulled their car over to ask directions.  
</P>
<P>
	``There were two or more of them and one put a gun through the  
open window and pressed it to my forehead,'' Larose was quoted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sure it was the end, that I was going to die,'' said  
Larose, who said he went home to Quebec to get over the experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better now but I had nightmares all week, especially  
after I found out that the same individuals were suspected of 
killing two people in the same kind of robbery the week before,'' 
he told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Minor said there was no such killing.  
</P>
<P>
	The suspects have not been found and the tennis players face no  
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Larose and Turek couldn't be reached for comment Friday.

<HEADLINE> Bush Predicts Success in Straw Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Friday  
he has ``a good chance'' of winning the Iowa Straw Poll over his 
Republican competitors, but he aimed his sharpest comments at the 
Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said the straw poll will be a good test of his campaign  
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to look at it as an opportunity to bolster my  
organization and find out whether we need work -- if we need any 
work at all,'' the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination 
told reporters before addressing an enthusiastic crowd of about 400 
at a park in downtown Cedar Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to get the most votes, I'd like to be in first,''  
Bush said. ``I think I have a good chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in a speech in Indianola, Bush touched on the subject of  
gun control, saying there is a ``false illusion'' that new laws 
alone could prevent new outbreaks of violence in America. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has been criticized by Democrats for not supporting gun  
control measures, and he is talking about the issue more frequently 
at campaign stops. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm on the right side of the issue,'' Bush said,  
explaining that he thinks enforcement of current gun laws would 
make streets safer. ``I've been saying that all along. I may have 
raised it a decibel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The straw poll Saturday is an Iowa GOP fund-raiser traditionally  
seen as an early gauge of organizational strength, but this 
summer's event took inflated importance, partially because Bush 
declared he would go all out to win it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's inconvenient for those of you who want to go  
fishing or play golf,'' Bush said, ``but we are talking about the 
future of our country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told the crowd, which included numerous parents and their  
children, that he would be the best choice to lead the country at 
the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	He chided President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, who is  
seeking the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, for taking 
so much credit for a booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prosperity is not a given. It just doesn't happen. You listen  
to some of the folks in the executive branch, it sounds like they 
invented prosperity,'' Bush said in a line that has become a staple 
of his campaign appearances. ``I'd like to remind people, they no 
more invented prosperity than they invented the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was poking fun at Gore's assertion that he invented the  
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he would be a vastly different president than Clinton.  
</P>
<P>
	``We must elect a president who will set goals worthy of a great  
nation, a president who will stand on principles, not on polls, and 
a president who will not use his office to reflect public 
opinion,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Should I be fortunate enough to become your president, when I  
put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not only uphold the laws 
of the land, I will swear to uphold the dignity and the honor of 
the office to which I have been elected,'' Bush said, receiving 
sustained applause. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said bolstering education, putting criminals in jail,  
reducing government regulations and rebuilding the nation's 
military would be top goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who has campaigned far less in Iowa than most of the other  
GOP hopefuls, stayed for more than an hour with the crowd in Cedar 
Rapids, signing autographs, shaking hands and posing with people 
for pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday evening, Bush was standing on a porch with his wife Laura  
outside a farming community called Indianola, which less than a 
30-minute drive of south of Des Moines, addressing about 200 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope you're going to Ames. I'm counting on you,'' Bush said.  
``I hope you join Laura and me, and send a message that I'm the 
best guy for the Republican Party.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Suspect Scouted Jewish Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Authorities found a map marking the addresses  
of three Jewish organizations on the day a gunman attacked the 
North Valley Jewish Community Center, the founder of the Simon 
Wiesenthal Center said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wiesenthal center, the University of Judaism and a third  
local address related to Israel were circled on the map, Rabbi 
Marvin Hier said. He didn't know what the third address was. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were told by the FBI that we had been a prime target for  
this attack,'' Hier said. ``They had found physical evidence to 
that effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hier said that at the time he had been told to keep the  
information confidential. Hier did not know where the map was found 
or whether it allegedly belonged to the shooting suspect, Buford O. 
Furrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow, 37, the white supremacist suspected in Tuesday's  
community center attack and killing of a postal worker, surrendered 
Wednesday in Las Vegas. By then he had been identified after police 
discovered a van loaded with ammunition and a car he allegedly 
carjacked. 
</P>
<P>
	The Simon Wiesenthal Center, named after the famed Nazi hunter,  
researches the Holocaust and hate groups and operates the Museum of 
Tolerance. The University of Judaism is in the Bel Air section of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we were a prime target because of the work that we  
do combatting these haters,'' said Hier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times, citing an unidentified source, reported  
Friday that Furrow said he scouted the Museum of Tolerance, the 
University of Judaism, and a third institution, the Skirball 
Cultural Center, a museum on Jewish culture. It said he found 
security too tight and stumbled upon the North Valley center when 
he simply got off a freeway to get gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow told investigators he had no intention of shooting small  
children and that they ``got in the way'' as he shot at a teen-age 
counselor and the center's receptionist, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hier said he was skeptical that only one person was involved.  
</P>
<P>
	``Calling this man a loner is an absolute mistake,'' he said.  
``I'm very skeptical that he could be familiar with L.A. in such a 
short time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During an arraignment Thursday, Furrow looked around the court  
at the crowd of mostly reporters, smiled and said to his public 
defender, ``They all like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Magistrate Judge Carolyn Turchin refused bail for Furrow,  
who has had mental problems and ties to hate groups in the 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles County prosecutors charged Furrow with murder in the  
death of the 39-year-old postal worker Joseph Santos Ileto and five 
counts of attempted murder in the attack at the community center. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors had already charged Furrow in the Ileto  
shooting on Wednesday; it is a federal crime because Ileto was a 
government worker on duty when he was killed. A federal-local task 
force will decide whether he will be tried jointly by state and 
federal authorities or face separate trials. Either murder charge 
could lead to a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Ileto was targeted because he was a federal  
employee of Filipino descent. 
</P>
<P>
	``This family has been shocked and grieving through this whole  
thing,'' Deena Ileto, sister-in-law of the victim, said Thursday. 
``We can't imagine anyone who would want to hurt another person 
like this.''

<HEADLINE> John Hinckley Takes Hospital Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Hinckley Jr. left Saint Elizabeths  
Hospital on Thursday for a short outing. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a recent court ruling the man who shot President Reagan  
and three others in 1981 can take short, supervised outings from 
the hospital. He was found innocent by reason of insanity in the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley was aboard a van that left the hospital at about 9:45  
a.m., followed by Secret Service agents. The vehicle carrying 
Hinckley drove to Alexandria, Va., where it stopped and turned 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip was aborted before Hinckley reached his intended  
destination, Washington television station WUSA-TV reported.

<HEADLINE> Mike Weir in Contention at PGA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- A lefty is in contention in the PGA  
Championship. No, it's not Phil Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Weir's hot streak in Chicago continued with a 4-under 68  
Friday, leaving him one stroke behind leader Jay Haas. If not for 
two bogeys on the last three holes, he'd be on top of the 
leaderboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``The golf course sets up well for me,'' said Weir, who finished  
second in last month's Western Open. ``It's a beautiful golf course 
and I feel very comfortable on it, too. Both Cog Hill and here. 
</P>
<P>
	``At both golf courses, I have to drive the ball and keep it in  
the fairway because the rough was deep,'' he said. ``Luckily, I've 
been driving it well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe it's the Chicago factor. Weir has yet to win a  
tournament on the PGA Tour, and has only three top-10 finishes this 
year. But there's something about Chicago that seems to agree with 
him. He finished three strokes behind Tiger Woods in the Western 
Open, putting the pressure on the final day with three birdies on 
the first seven holes. 
</P>
<P>
	So he's staying in the same area as he did last month. He's even  
eating at the same restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever he's doing, it's working. He made a 10-foot putt to  
birdie the first hole Friday, and picked up two more strokes on the 
front nine. He had three more birdies on the back nine, but he also 
had the two bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit one bad shot on 17,'' he said. ``Besides that, I was  
really happy with the way I played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weir just might be one of the rarest players on the tour these  
days. He's a Canadian and left-handed when there aren't many of 
either roaming the golf courses. Fans serenaded him with ``O 
Canada'' on a few holes, just as they did in the Western Open, when 
he was paired with Woods for the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning a major could mean great things for golf in Canada, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be huge,'' he said. ``I don't think there's been a  
Canadian to win a major. It would be huge for junior golf in 
Canada. I hope I can do it for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would be pretty big for lefties, too. A left-handed golfer  
hasn't won a major since Bob Charles won the British Open in 1963. 
The last lefty to come close in the PGA was in 1996, when Mickelson 
led after two rounds and Russ Cochran led after three. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither won.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been awhile,'' Weir said. ``I guess it would be big.''

<HEADLINE> 27 Run To Be Mayor of Baltimore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- For the first time in 28 years, an incumbent is  
not running for mayor of Baltimore, creating a political 
free-for-all that isn't doing much for the troubled city's 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 27 candidates who entered the race to replace Mayor Kurt  
Schmoke, six have arrest records and three have filed for 
bankruptcy. Supporters of the front-runner have disrupted a rival's 
news conference, and another leading candidate falsely claimed in 
campaign literature that he had a college degree. 
</P>
<P>
	``What an embarrassment,'' wrote Barry Rascovar, deputy  
editorial page editor at The Sun. ``It could be the worst group of 
contenders in the city's long history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't long ago that a mayor of Baltimore could go on to  
become governor. But these days the job doesn't attract people with 
a national profile. A movement to draft NAACP President Kweisi 
Mfume, which even involved changing the residency requirement to 
run, failed. 
</P>
<P>
	As Baltimore's population continues to dwindle, political  
observers say, political power goes with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody seems to want the job, especially nobody who's  
well-qualified,'' said James Gimpel, a professor of government at 
the University of Maryland. ``The action in Maryland politics has 
shifted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Urban flight has transferred power from Baltimore to the suburbs  
of the nation's capital, helping Gov. Parris Glendening become the 
first governor elected from the Washington area since 1812. 
</P>
<P>
	Suburban Montgomery and Prince George's counties are among the  
fastest-growing in the state, while this decade, Baltimore has lost 
more than 90,000 residents, or 12.3 percent of its population, 
dropping to 645,593. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore's high murder rate, rampant drug abuse, financial woes  
-- and the glare of political and media attention from Washington -- 
make the job of mayor a tough one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Worthy political elites take a look at that hand of cards and  
say `I'm not playing,''' Gimpel said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the field of 27 who filed to run in the Sept. 14 Democratic  
primary -- generally the race to win in this predominantly 
Democratic city -- is Dorothy Joyner, who was jailed on burglary 
charges when a police officer recognized her during a TV 
appearance. She was later disqualified because she failed to file 
financial disclosure forms. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillip A. Brown Jr., a perennial candidate, has been convicted  
of larceny, shoplifting and impersonating a police officer. He is 
running while facing charges of harassment and reckless 
endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmoke, the city's first elected black mayor, announced in  
December he would not seek a fourth four-year term and will work 
for a high-powered Washington-based law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most critical election in at least 12 years,'' said  
State Comptroller William Donald Schaefer, a former Baltimore mayor 
who went on to serve two terms as governor. ``It's an opportunity 
to move the city forward which has so many good things going for it 
but lacks leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schaefer had been considered a possible candidate himself, but  
he and others urged Mfume to run. Mfume announced in May he felt he 
could do more good at the Baltimore-based National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
	That has left three top candidates, each of whom failed to carve  
out support of 30 percent or higher in a recent poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Stokes, a former city councilman, lost ground when he was  
forced to admit that his campaign literature falsely listed him as 
a Loyola College graduate. He attended the Baltimore school but did 
not graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	City Council President Lawrence Bell III still holds the lead in  
the polls, but The Sun has reported that a bank repossessed his 
Mustang convertible due to nonpayment and that he was sued for 
failing to pay his bills. On Aug. 5, about 50 of Bell's supporters 
crashed a rally for another candidate, City Councilman Martin 
O'Malley. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, O'Malley, who is white, has emerged as a strong contender  
to lead a city where three out of five people are black. Bell and 
Stokes are both black. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell's support measured 29 percent, O'Malley's 26 percent and  
Stokes' 20 percent in a poll conducted last weekend by a research 
firm. The margin of error was four percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	As Schaefer summed up: ``You have one fellow who's made some  
tactical errors by having his people try to destroy somebody else 
and has financial difficulties, another one who puts out literature 
that's not true, and another relatively young man who hasn't made 
any tactical errors, except that he is white.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-SLA Fugitive Seeks Name Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Former fugitive Kathleen Ann Soliah is  
seeking to have her name legally changed to Sara Jane Olson, the 
name she used to elude police for nearly a quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah adopted the alias after settling in Minnesota, where  
she fled and became a doctor's wife, local stage actress and mother 
of three girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said a name change would not affect proceedings  
against Ms. Soliah, who faces charges she planted bombs under 
police cars during the 1970s as a member of the Symbionese 
Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors allege the act was retaliation for a 1974 shootout  
with police in which six SLA members were killed. The bombs did not 
go off. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah pleaded not guilty to all charges after being  
arrested in June in her St. Paul neighborhood. She remains free on 
bail while awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah filed an application Thursday in Ramsey County  
District Court seeking the name change. 
</P>
<P>
	A motion filed earlier by Ms. Soliah's attorneys said her use of  
an alias was a ``response to fear of government reprisal for her 
association with SLA members,'' not the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	In her application, Ms. Soliah asks to correct the birth date  
listed on her Minnesota driver's license and notes she has ``no 
felony convictions.''

<HEADLINE> Jagger-Hall Marriage Annulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Mick Jagger's not-quite-marriage to Jerry Hall is  
null and void both in England and in Indonesia, where the rock star 
and the model had a 1990 wedding ceremony, a judge ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall and Jagger -- who were together more than 20 years and have  
four children -- were not in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, 43, filed for divorce in January after Brazilian model  
Luciana Morad said she was pregnant with Jagger's child. Jagger, 
the 55-year-old frontman for the Rolling Stones, acknowledged last 
month that the boy, now more than 3 months old, is his. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the two agreed that they were never validly married.  
Their lawyers said they had ``amicably and formally agreed to 
separate after more than two decades as a couple and to obtain an 
annulment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Sir Michael Connell granted the annulment decree today  
in the High Court Family Division after hearing a sworn statement 
Hall sent in. 
</P>
<P>
	Connell said the couple's Indonesian wedding was never  
registered. Registration might not have been essential if the local 
community acknowledged the marriage, he said. But, in that case, 
both the bride and groom would have had to be Balinese Hindus. 
</P>
<P>
	``In these circumstances, I am satisfied this marriage ceremony  
did not, according to local law, bring about a legal marriage,'' 
the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the hearing, the couple's lawyers issued a statement  
saying Connell also had ratified the confidential financial 
agreement Jagger and Hall reached last month. The statement said 
both Hall and Jagger ``were greatly relieved that the formal legal 
process was now at an end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the financial settlement will remain confidential.  
But there has been speculation that Hall sought a $48 million chunk 
of Jagger's $240 million fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall is in Dallas, where one of her sisters is undergoing  
chemotherapy. Jagger's whereabouts were not disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Resents Charge of Intolerance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Sen. Orrin Hatch says when he told fellow  
Republicans at their state convention two months ago that they 
should be proud of their party because ``we don't have the gays and 
lesbians with us,'' he didn't intend the comment to sound 
prejudicial. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah lawmaker was just pointing out that ``gays and  
lesbians, by and large, are very intelligent, highly educated, 
high-earning people, who support mainly Democrats,'' he told The 
Salt Lake Tribune in a story for Friday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said he resents any implication that he is intolerant.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can sum it up in one sentence: that Orrin Hatch is  
tolerant of all people and that he doesn't try to tell people how 
to live unless they ask him,'' said Hatch, who is a GOP 
presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch has drawn fire from gay rights groups in the past for what  
they considered insensitive statements. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Utah Republican State Convention in June, Hatch offered a  
David Letterman-style list of why Utah Republicans should be proud 
of their party, including: ``We don't have the gays and lesbians 
with us.'' In 1988, he called the Democratic Party ``the party of 
homosexuals; they are the party of abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Hatch said he is tolerant of all people, he does believe  
that homosexuality is contrary to the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a religious belief to me that homosexuality flies in the  
face of biblical teachings,'' he said, noting he can't determine 
``whether it's a genetic predisposition or whether it is a 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said that is different from the situation of blacks and  
other ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``People of color can't do anything about their color,'' Hatch  
said. ``But I do believe gay people have a choice to live within 
the legal rules or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why we have civil-rights laws to protect  
African-Americans from discrimination,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeanetta Williams, president of the NAACP Salt Lake branch, said  
Hatch's statements comparing gays and blacks were ``a slap in the 
face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To demonstrate his tolerance, Hatch cited his compromises with  
Democrats on federal legislation affecting AIDS and hate crimes, 
his help in fund raising to combat pediatric AIDS, and his support 
of the federal appointments of gay San Francisco philanthropist 
James Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, however, Hatch introduced a measure that would not  
include gays as a protected group under the hate crimes law. 
</P>
<P>
	David Smith, spokesman for the Washington-based Human Rights  
Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian political 
organization, said Hatch has a ``very poor voting record on issues 
that are important to us,'' but he should be applauded for being a 
champion of AIDS funding.

<HEADLINE> Canada Tries To Keep Airline Aloft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- The government has suspended parts of its  
competition laws for 90 days to give its troubled airline industry 
time to seek ways to restructure. 
</P>
<P>
	The move Friday, initiated by financially troubled Canadian  
Airlines Corp., appeared designed to try to keep the Calgary-based 
carrier aloft and maintain national competition. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's not clear how successful the strategy -- which requires  
cooperation between such competitors as Canadian and rival Air 
Canada -- will be. 
</P>
<P>
	Parts of the Competition Act were lifted to let the major  
carriers discuss things such as possible changes to pricing, routes 
and potential alliances, said Industry Minister John Manley. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the situation could become desperate for Canadian,  
added Transport Minister David Collenette. ``We believe that 
Canadian came to the view that unless some measure of this nature 
was used, then they would start to perhaps not discharge some of 
their service obligations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Competition Act prohibits industry players from getting  
together to divide up their markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Lifting those rules for a limited time, ``allows the airlines to  
be able to talk to each other, to look at sensitive information, 
without running afoul of the law,'' said Collenette. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian has lost about $124 million Canadian ($84 million U.S.)  
in the first half of this year alone and nearly went bankrupt in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	CEO Kevin Benson has suggested his airline and Air Canada look  
at sharing service on marginal routes to keep both companies alive. 
</P>
<P>
	But Montreal-based Air Canada is doing well financially and may  
not be interested in helping out its competitor, an industry 
analyst warned. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Canadian Airlines wants is to cooperate on routes to  
reduce losses, they want to stop flying on certain routes and share 
aircraft with Air Canada and things like that,'' analyst Jacques 
Kavafian of Yorkton Securities told CBC Newsworld. 
</P>
<P>
	``Canadian wants to talk, but I wonder if (Air Canada) will  
answer the phone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada has to see benefits for itself before it will talk,  
said Doug Port, a spokesman for Air Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key thing for us is if it makes good long-term business  
sense for us and makes a sustainable benefit for our shareholders, 
then we're interested.'' If Canadian is putting up a for sale sign, 
that could catch Air Canada's eye, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has made it clear previously it would like to  
maintain competition in the industry but Friday ruled out any 
financial aid for Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier has hit financial turbulence frequently in its  
12-year history and was bailed out several years ago with an 
investment infusion from American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	However, under federal foreign content rules, American only  
could take a maximum 25 percent ownership stake in the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	While there has been widespread speculation Ottawa might  
increase that maximum, Collenette said the government had no such 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian desperately needs to begin to show a profit in order to  
attract further investment, noted Kavafian.

<HEADLINE> Sun Air Being Liquidated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- South Africa's third-largest  
airline, which was mostly black-owned, closed down Friday because 
of undisclosed financial losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The government board that rules on major acquisitions said Sun  
Air was ``a failing company'' and it was in the public interest to 
ensure an orderly shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The board signed off Thursday on a plan to sell Sun Air's  
black-owned shares to South African Airlines, the country's largest 
carrier. It also approved the subsequent liquidation, said David 
Lewis, the board's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a post-apartheid program that encouraged black ownership  
of public companies that have been privatized, 75 percent of Sun 
Air was black-owned. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the South African Pilot's Association, Glen  
Watson, lamented the shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tragedy that one of the truly racially integrated  
companies, which epitomizes the spirit and hope of the new South 
Africa, had to close its doors due to profit and commercial 
considerations,'' Watson told the daily newspaper, The Star, in 
Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sun was offering a four-star service for three-star prices in  
a competitive environment,'' Kananile Makheta, president of the 
Association of Southern African Travel Agents, told The Star. 
</P>
<P>
	Comair, the country's second-largest carrier and a competitor of  
South African Airlines, owns 25 percent of Sun Air. Comair and SAA 
are expected to absorb some of Sun Air's hundreds of employees, and 
to accommodate ticket holders for Sun Air flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Department of Transport approved an application  
by South Africa's first independent black-controlled airline, 
African Star, to schedule daily passenger and cargo flights to 
Europe.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Tries Wooing All Races </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The NAACP is looking to increase its membership  
among people of all colors. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,  
the nation's oldest and largest civil rights group, has asked its 
500,000 members to go door-to-door to get at least 10 neighbors to 
join. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Knock Across America'' campaign is designed not only to  
boost membership, but to get more racial groups to join the NAACP, 
perhaps best known for championing the cause of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman John White said the organization does not maintain  
figures on the racial composition of its membership. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're selling this organization because it can be of benefit  
to everyone,'' said Sylvia Williams, who is the first national 
membership consultant hired by the NAACP. ``Every race belongs to 
this organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recruitment efforts have been ineffective because many of the  
2,200 local chapters do not accurately track their own members and 
are not connected to the Internet, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the $30 annual fee, members receive a bimonthly magazine on  
civil rights and the right to participate in local branch 
activities, including elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Virginia and Alabama chapters began the door-to-door  
canvassing this month. Maryland chapters of the Baltimore-based 
organization will begin doing so in September. Money also will be 
set aside for TV and billboard ads, Ms. Williams said.

<HEADLINE> Phillies put Curt Schilling on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Philadelphia Phillies placed Curt  
Schilling on the 15-day disabled list Friday after he again had 
problems with his shoulder when he tried to throw. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss is a major blow to the Phillies, who are third in line  
for a wild card playoff berth but will now have to make a run 
without their top starter. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was retroactive to Aug. 8, so Schilling will be  
eligible to be activated on Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad for Schill because he's finally got a club that's  
playing where it could get kind of exciting and he misses some 
time,'' manager Terry Francona said. ``He's the one guy who 
deserves to be around here and pitching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players felt the loss.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're all down about that,'' said Paul Byrd, who went six  
innings Friday night in a 5-4 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. ``For us 
to put a smile on our faces and say it doesn't matter would be 
lying. He's a huge part of this team. Somebody's got to step up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last Saturday, Schilling gave up seven earned runs and eight  
hits in 6 1-3 innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks. He has been 
hampered by biceps tendinitis, mild bursitis and muscle spasms in 
his neck and shoulder blades. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies have been reluctant to place him on the DL because  
he appeared to be close to recovery. They made the decision after 
he tried to throw before Friday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``His shoulder didn't feel very good when he threw today,''  
Francona said. ``We've tried to milk this for a month and I think 
it's time to do what we did. He was very discouraged when he came 
off the field today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move was announced during the game. Schilling wasn't  
available afterwards, but left a message on a board near the 
entrance to the clubhouse that read: ``Guys, one team, one goal, 
whatever it takes. Schill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was set to return to Philadelphia on Saturday morning to  
begin intensive therapy for his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's relieved that we've struck a new course and we're  
going to stick with it,'' trainer Jeff Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, 32, became the eighth Phillies player on the disabled  
list. He's 14-5 with a 3.49 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies plan to call up left-hander Anthony Shumaker from  
Triple-A Scranton to take Schilling's roster spot. Shumaker, 26, 
was called up between games of a doubleheader on July 23 and lost 
to Atlanta 3-1 in the nightcap. He gave up one earned run in eight 
innings of his major league debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Shumaker was then sent back to Scranton without making another  
appearance.

<HEADLINE> Travelers Warned of Hepatitis A </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SMITHFIELD, N.C. (AP) -- Hundreds of travelers may have been  
exposed to hepatitis A at a steakhouse off Interstate 95, the East 
Coast's major north-south traffic corridor, health officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus can cause nausea, diarrhea, jaundice and fatigue, but  
no lasting health problems. It is spread when an infected person 
fails to properly wash his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	A Texas Steakhouse employee was recently diagnosed with the  
virus, North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services 
spokeswoman Debbie Crane said. She said the employee had been 
filling glasses with ice, placing rolls on plates and splitting and 
buttering baked potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant is near the popular Carolina Pottery shopping  
area, about 25 miles southeast of Raleigh. The infected employee no 
longer works there. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been no reports of anyone becoming ill by this  
morning, but health officials said as many as 2,000 people, many of 
them travelers from out of state, may have been exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	They recommended anyone who ate at the steakhouse on July 31,  
Aug. 1-2 and Aug. 7-8 see a physician. An immune globulin shot 
within two weeks of exposure can protect people from the virus. 
Hepatitis A symptoms usually appear within a month of exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Crumly, a vice president at Texas Steakhouse headquarters,  
called the situation unfortunate and said the company is ``totally 
committed to absolute health and cleanliness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 350 people crowded the Johnston County Public Health  
Department for globulin shots Thursday. ``I feel better now that 
I've got the shot. I'll sleep easier,'' said Patricia Williams of 
Clayton.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested for AIDS Cure Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A convicted murderer who heads a Nevada company  
has been arrested on securities fraud charges after his company 
made several recent announcements claiming to have developed a cure 
for AIDS, prosecutors said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred Flores, 49, president of New Technologies &AMP; Concepts Inc.  
in Las Vegas, was arrested Thursday. The false claims sent the 
price of stock in New Technologies' parent company, Uniprime 
Capital Acceptance Inc., to soar from $1 a share to nearly $8 a 
share, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint, filed under seal Monday and unsealed Thursday,  
alleged that New Technologies issued three news releases on 
Uniprime's Web site describing ``Plasma Plus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On June 16, the company said Flores had ``conducted tests on  
patients in Madrid which have shown complete reversal from the 
immune system of the HIV infection, with no reintroduction of the 
virus after a period of almost 18 months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A July 19 news release said ``Plasma Plus'' had proven 100  
percent successful in eliminating the presence of HIV in patients, 
the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no answer Friday at a telephone listed in Flores'  
name. There was no phone listing for his company. A telephone 
message left at the parent company, Uniprime Capital Acceptance, 
was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Flores could face a maximum of 10 years in prison  
and a fine of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in prison in Colorado from 1983 to September 1992 after a  
murder conviction, prosecutors said.

<HEADLINE> Utah Tornado Caused $150M in Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The deadly tornado that unexpectedly tore  
through this city's downtown left behind at least $150 million in 
damage, Mayor Deedee Corradini estimated Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The twister on Wednesday killed one man, destroyed five houses  
and damaged 180 others. 
</P>
<P>
	But the damage estimate may not reflect the true bottom line,  
said Thayne Robson, director of the Bureau of Economic and Business 
Research at the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one will ever sit down and calculate the total disruptions  
and losses that are occasioned by this storm or any other storm,'' 
Robson said. ``Little short-term events like this can have 
significant impacts that are never fully identifiable or 
quantifiable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Gov. Mike Leavitt asked the president for a disaster  
declaration to cover $8.3 million -- much less than the total 
estimated damage because federal rules limit aid largely to 
uninsured property and government expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kainrad, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's response  
and recovery official for the storm, said nearly all of the damaged 
homes are insured. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $5 million of the aid could cover private property  
damage, while $3.2 million for state and local governments includes 
the cost of debris removal, damage to utilities, buildings, parks 
and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
	Kainrad said the president likely would act on Utah's request in  
the next several days. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven people still were hospitalized Friday, two in critical  
condition.

<HEADLINE> Graf Played With Rare Intensity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Steffi Graf played in the sun but loved the darkness, never  
quite comfortable with her celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	She wore white on the court and surrounded herself with soothing  
black at home. 
</P>
<P>
	From the age of 13, Graf performed as a professional in public  
while craving and savoring solitude. Even as she played in front of 
thousands of fans, she seemed the most solitary of figures, rarely 
looking at the crowds, rarely smiling, revealing her emotions only 
in economical little gestures -- the occasional pumped fist, a sharp 
nod of her head, a grimace as she stared at her racket strings. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet she burned with desire for the game she loved, and that  
shone through in nearly every match she played and the hours upon 
hours she spent practicing. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, who retired Friday, didn't just want to win, she sought  
perfection, matches without mistakes. A 6-0, 6-0 victory wouldn't 
satisfy her if she knew she had hit some sloppy shots or had a few 
lapses, and won just because her opponent was worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf set the bar so high for herself because for much of her  
17-year career that vision of perfection was her greatest 
challenge, her way of getting through the grind of weekly 
tournaments and making a sport of easy early round matches against 
inferior players. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been said of Graf that it was her athleticism that set  
her apart, the sprinter's legs that allowed her to run down balls 
that other players couldn't, the powerful forehand that froze 
opponents helplessly. All that is true but doesn't fully explain 
how she persevered through injury and illness and family trauma to 
win 22 Grand Slam titles, 107 tournaments on the WTA Tour, and 
spend 377 weeks as No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the players of her time, and perhaps of all time, no one  
could match Graf's singular ability to filter out all manner of 
distractions, to push away pain and harness all the talents she 
possessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Evert might have been steadier, Martina Navratilova might  
have been a stronger, more versatile athlete, but Graf brought to 
bear a combination of intensity and quickness even they couldn't 
match. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Seles, Graf's greatest rival at the peak of her career,  
may have been the only player who could equal her competitive zeal. 
Seles won eight Grand Slam titles in a 3 1/2-year span before she was 
stabbed at a tournament in Hamburg, Germany, by a deranged fan of 
Graf, an event that would tragically link the two players and 
ultimately separate them. With Seles sidelined or struggling for 
most of the period between 1993 and 1996, Graf racked up 10 Grand 
Slam titles while Seles won only one more. 
</P>
<P>
	The players who then came along to take Graf's spot at the top --  
Martina Hingis and Lindsay Davenport -- benefited from her 
interminable injuries, operations and rehabilitations. They didn't 
have to compete against the kind of player Graf was when she won 
the ``Golden Slam'' -- all four majors and the Olympics -- in 1988, 
nor the kind of mature, powerful force she became in the mid-'90s. 
</P>
<P>
	But for one glorious day in early June this year, Hingis saw  
more than a glimpse of what made Graf a great champion. On that 
day, the final of the French Open, Hingis felt the full force of 
Fraulein Forehand, discovered how Graf could dig her way out of 
trouble and simply overwhelm an opponent. None of Hingis' little 
tricks worked, not the stalls or taunting smiles, not the underhand 
serves or petulant slaps at the ball. Graf stared at her in 
annoyance, fed up with her childishness and gamesmanship, and 
thoroughly thrashed her in the final set. 
</P>
<P>
	On that day, finally, after hiding her emotions from public view  
for 17 years, the 30-year-old Graf showed the crowd and the world 
exactly how much tennis meant to her. It would be, she knew, her 
last French Open, and she allowed herself to relish every moment, 
smiling broadly, almost embarrassed, when the crowd chanted her 
name, breaking down in tears of joy when she won her sixth French 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf's career seemed poised for a perfect ending a month later  
at Wimbledon when she reached the final and went for her eighth 
title on Centre Court. But she never quite kicked her game into a 
high gear that day, and Davenport outplayed her. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf knew she wouldn't be back, but she didn't make a fuss about  
it. No theatrical waves to the crowd, no long speeches. She was 
upset that she hadn't even come close to the perfection she 
demanded of herself, hadn't taken a title that was within her 
grasp. 
</P>
<P>
	In the weeks that followed, she could feel her great desire to  
compete at the highest level had finally burned out. She wasn't 
hurt, she said, she simply had played enough and it was time to 
stop and retreat to the private life she always wanted.

<HEADLINE> Former Democratic Fund-Raiser Fined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former Democratic fund-raiser John Huang will  
serve a year's probation but no jail time for his admitted role in 
skirting campaign finance laws. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge warned him to continue aiding federal investigators.  
</P>
<P>
	``These matters should not be taken lightly,'' said U.S.  
District Judge Richard Paez, who also fined Huang $10,000 and 
sentenced him to 500 hours of community service. ``I expect that 
you will cooperate with everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huang pleaded guilty Thursday to conspiracy for violating  
campaign finance laws, a resolution that came in spite of a 
congressman's bid to delay the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your honor, I'm very sad and embarrassed by my mistakes that  
have brought disrepute to my family and my community,'' Huang told 
Paez. ``I'm glad the court has given me the opportunity to serve my 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huang's lawyer, Ty Cobb, said outside court that his client  
would testify before Congress if called, and would perform 
community service by educating the Asian-American community about 
participation in the political process. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang, a former executive of the Jakarta-based Lippo Group, was  
the Democrats' chief fund-raiser for the Asian-American community 
in 1996. He brought in $1.6 million in questionable donations that 
later were returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Specific charges against him involved only an illegal $2,500  
donation to the campaign committee of Los Angeles mayoral candidate 
Michael Woo in 1993, and an illegal $5,000 donation to California 
Victory Fund '94 that was shared by Sen. Dianne Feinstein's 
re-election committee, the Democratic senatorial campaign committee 
and the state Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang could have been sent to prison for five years.  
</P>
<P>
	It was clear from government documents that ``although Mr. Huang  
did not play a minor role, he was not the main leader,'' Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel O'Brien does not suspect Huang of  
involvement in espionage and said that Huang was ``candid and 
truthful'' in his 20 sessions of interviews with government 
investigators. However, the government left open the possibility 
that he could be called as a witness in espionage investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., the chairman of the House Committee on  
Government Reform, last month pressed U.S. Attorney General Janet 
Reno to seek postponement of sentencing for both Huang and 
fund-raiser Charlie Trie because they had not testified before 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The government was granted a six-week delay to assess Trie's  
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie has pleaded guilty to two counts involving campaign finance  
violations and pledged to cooperate in the investigation. 
Prosecutors have recommended three years' probation.

<HEADLINE> UCLA Bruins Open Football Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It's been a chaotic summer off the field for  
the UCLA football program. Now, because of the difficulties, the 
Bruins go to work without a depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
	There is one in the media guide, but it's not going to be worth  
much for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems surfaced in early July with the announcement that  
several players were alleged to be involved in a scam to illegally 
obtain handicapped parking permits. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is 11 players -- most of them starters -- have been  
suspended for the first two games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm anxious to get going, put all this stuff behind us,'' UCLA  
coach Bob Toledo said Friday at Media Day. ``It's been really 
difficult, probably the most difficult start to a football season 
I've ever been associated with. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some guys that have to step it up. We're going to  
stick together as a team. We've got enough guys where we can be 
very, very competitive. We're going to prepare to play to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of a depth chart entering Saturday's first formal  
practice is an unprecedented situation in the 53-year-old Toledo's 
coaching career. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to do some experimenting in the next few days,'' he  
said. ``I'm hoping no more players (involved in the scam) pop up. 
The players have apologized to our team. I hope it's over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins, 10-2 and ranked eighth in the country at the end of  
last season, open the 1999 campaign Sept. 4 against Boise State at 
the Rose Bowl -- a game they should win regardless of the 
suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	The following week, though, is a different story -- UCLA travels  
to Ohio State, ranked second nationally at the end of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first couple games, I'm going to throw out more trick  
plays than you've ever seen in your life,'' Toledo said, perhaps 
only half-kidding. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspended players are offensive linemen Oscar Cabrera and  
James Ghezzi; fullback Durell Price, UCLA's only experienced player 
at that position; tailback Keith Brown; linebackers Ali Abdul 
Azziz, Tony White, Ryan Nece and Robert Thomas; and defensive backs 
Ryan Roques, Marques Anderson and Eric Whitfield. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, defensive back Audie Attar was suspended for the  
Boise State game for his involvement in a fight last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our linebackers, it's scary,'' Toledo said. ``The defensive  
backs are a real concern. It's like getting them all hurt in 
camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the suspensions, Toledo said, players like wide  
receivers Danny Farmer and Freddie Mitchell and tailback DeShaun 
Foster might see some action on defense ``in certain situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, Toledo added, some freshmen who would have redshirted this  
season will play. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspended players will practice, Toledo said, so they can be  
ready for the season's third game, against Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
	``They won't get as many reps as they normally would have  
gotten,'' Toledo said. ``They'll be the scout team when we get 
ready for Boise State. That's a pretty good scout team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to everything else, the Bruins will have a new  
quarterback this year. Four-year starter Cade McNown is a rookie 
with the Chicago Bears, leaving junior Drew Bennett as the heir 
apparent, at least entering two-a-day practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long time since the last time I started, as a  
senior in high school,'' Bennett said. ``It's not set in stone yet, 
but it would be nice. The opportunity is there for me. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been real consistent with Cade here. I was always  
second-string, he was the leader of the team. Hopefully, I can take 
over that role. I'm anxious to prove I can do it. There's not 
doubt, it's uncertainty.''

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama Gives Lecture at Theater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Live, from the Beacon Theater, it's ... the  
Dalai Lama? 
</P>
<P>
	At a theater better known for rock n' roll and beer, the exiled  
leader of Tibetan Buddhists gave a four-hour lecture titled 
``Training the Mind/Opening the Heart.'' He started with 
traditional Tibetan chants and a humble assessment of his own role 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel that I have some higher understanding,'' the  
Nobel Peace Prize winner told a $75-a-head audience. ``I am just a 
small, ordinary Buddhist monk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama plans to teach meditation for three days at the  
Beacon and then speak Sunday in Central Park. More than 20,000 
people are expected to attend that event. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Richard Gere, a longtime follower, was at his side during  
a news conference in which the Dalai Lama spoke about the purpose 
of his visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``My main purpose for coming here is for some explanation of  
Buddha dharma (divine law), as well as to promote a general 
understanding of human values,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here to convert people,'' he said. ``I think it's  
better to keep your own tradition. ... Everybody has the potential 
to make a contribution to human development.''

<HEADLINE> CBOT Opens On Time After Outage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- If commodities trading wasn't hard enough, the  
Chicago Board of Trade also has had to contend with a power failure 
and a communications breakdown in the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest futures exchange opened on time this morning  
after being forced to close early Thursday afternoon when a power 
outage struck downtown Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	That gave traders in inflation-sensitive contracts for Treasury  
bonds a chance to react to a government report today on prices at 
the wholesale level. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second glitch this week to disrupt the Chicago Board  
of Trade, which had to shut down electronic, or Project A, trading 
on Tuesday and Thursday night because of problems with a high-speed 
data network. 
</P>
<P>
	Project A trading will remain at a standstill until 6 p.m.  
Sunday due to a recurring problem with MCI Worldcom's data 
transmission network, Board of Trade officials said. Project A 
allows members to trade futures contracts linked to U.S. 
Treasuries, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, grains and other 
commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the power outage, blamed on the failure of two  
transmission cables under a street, that darkened hundreds of 
Chicago office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul McCoy, vice president of Commonwealth Edison, said cables  
leading from two big transformers failed Wednesday night and 
Thursday morning at a substation just south of the downtown area. 
That outage put about 2,300 customers west of downtown without 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility was forced later Thursday to shut down power for  
about 90 minutes to another 670 business customers in a 30-block 
business district that includes the Board of Trade, the federal 
courthouse and many law firms after a transformer at another 
substation overheated. That transformer had been helping to keep up 
with demand at the defective station. Power to all customers was 
restored late Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of commuters left early for the day, causing rush hour  
to arrive hours early. Police struggled to keep cars moving through 
darkened intersections. Extra buses were called in to handle the 
crush, and generators were set up in Union Station, which handles 
Amtrak and suburban commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
	The outage also darkened the federal office building and  
prompted the evacuation of several high-rise office buildings, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Board of Trade officials closed the markets at 1 p.m. after they  
were warned by utility officials that power was going to be shut 
down, said board spokesman Bret Gallaway. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous disruption of trading,'' Gallaway said.  
``The last minutes of trading are often some of the busiest trading 
of the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The board's chief executive officer, Thomas R. Donovan, wanted  
to ensure an orderly shutdown, avoiding the potential chaos if 
power failed with as many as 5,000 traders on the floor, Gallaway 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Trade's agricultural markets normally close at 1:15  
p.m. and the financial markets normally close at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Mollitor, a Board of Trade commodities broker, said things  
got chaotic as traders tried to get last-second orders through and 
then rushed out the doors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels a little bit like a little kid getting out of school  
early because of a storm. I guess this is practice for Y2K,'' 
Mollitor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another financial market, the Chicago Board Options Exchange,  
halted trading temporarily, resuming around 2:15 p.m. after 
switching over to backup generators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange remained open.

<HEADLINE> 'Suicide' Horse Race Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAK, Wash. (AP) -- For decades, 20 horses and their riders have  
plunged together down a sandy cliff each August before fording the 
Okanogan River below and dashing toward the finish line in a nearby 
rodeo arena. 
</P>
<P>
	It's called the ``Suicide Race,'' a name animal-rights activists  
have long found apt: Since 1983, 13 horses have been euthanized due 
to race injuries, including one in each of the last three contests. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a 64-year history, the race has been scrubbed from this  
year's Omak Stampede, a days-long rodeo that began Thursday in this 
small north-central Washington town. Members of the Colville 
Confederated Tribes, whose members largely comprise the daredevil 
field, are boycotting the event in a dispute with rodeo and city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian leaders say that, with each passing year, Stampede  
organizers have pushed their Indian encampment -- the site of 
traditional stick games, dancing and crafts -- farther away from the 
hub of activity at the Stampede. 
</P>
<P>
	Confederation chairwoman Colleen Cawston said the tribe pulled  
out after new city parking regulations directed crowds further from 
the Indian village. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been numerous things building up,'' she said.  
``Sometimes, you have to make a hard decision to have a better 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers cited the boycott in canceling the race last week, as  
well as what they said are dangerously high waters on the Okanogan. 
</P>
<P>
	The cancellation has left a big gap in the Stampede, which  
brings in more than $2 million annually to this windblown town. 
More than 400 residents volunteer their time to paint corrals, 
stencil signs and market the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you think of the Omak Stampede, you think of the Suicide  
Race,'' said Warren Willey, a 30-year racegoer from Federal Way, 
Wash. With the race and the Indian encampment gone from this year's 
event, he and his wife Lorraine say they may go to a rodeo in a 
bigger city. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say Stampede ticket sales are still strong, but a few  
have demanded refunds in the wake of the cancellation and been 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Cawston said the Colvilles will welcome the public to their own  
nearby event this weekend, with dancing competitions, a dinner and 
horse endurance races. 
</P>
<P>
	Stampede president Fred Winningham said he's saddened by the  
tribe's absence, and says city and rodeo officials will meet with 
Confederation leaders after this year's Stampede in an effort to 
get them to return next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of hope that the three entities can get together  
and cool heads will prevail,'' Winningham said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bonds rallied on Friday after a  
government report of tame wholesale prices calmed investor fears 
that the Federal Reserve would have to raise interest rates to try 
to check inflation pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the newly auctioned 30-year Treasury bond shot up  
$11.25 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, fell to 6.10 percent from 6.14 percent from 
Thursday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported that prices at the wholesale level  
rose a modest 0.2 percent in July as a huge jump in energy prices 
overwhelmed a sharp drop in food costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in the Producer Price Index, which measures  
inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, matched the 0.2 
percent rise in May. Wholesale prices had actually fallen 0.1 
percent in June, only the second decline this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The modest increase in July eased concerns that the Fed would  
push up rates, an action that could erode the value of fixed-rate 
securities already held by investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader secondary market, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities ranged from 3/32 point to 1/4 point higher, and 
intermediate maturities ranged from 7/16 higher to 5/8 point higher, 
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.74 percent with a  
discount of 4.62 percent, down 0.02 percentage point from late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields were 5.05 percent while the discount was  
unchanged at 4.86 percent. One-year yields were 5.15 percent with a 
discount of 4.90 percent, down 0.04 percentage point from late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, slipped to 5.06 percent from 5.13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 3/32 to 113 16/32. The average yield to 
maturity was unchanged at 5.82 percent.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Sign Center Straka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins avoided contract  
arbitration Friday by signing center Martin Straka to a multi-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract is expected to more than double Straka's $500,000  
salary of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	By reaching terms, Straka avoided an arbitration hearing  
scheduled Saturday in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Straka, 26, was 11th in the NHL with a career-high 83 points  
last season and played in his first all-star game. He also led the 
Penguins with 11 points, including six goals, in their first-round 
playoff upset of the New Jersey Devils and 15 points in their two 
playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	Straka has 125 points (54 goals, 71 assists) in two seasons  
since rejoining the Penguins in 1997. He first played for 
Pittsburgh from 1992-95, then was traded to Ottawa and later played 
for the New York Islanders and Florida Panthers before re-signing 
with Pittsburgh as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of the Czech Republic, he was the Penguins' first-round  
draft choice in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Darius Kasparaitis, forward Kip Miller and center Jan  
Hrdina remain unsigned.

<HEADLINE> VP Ousted Over Chicago Power Outages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A top Commonwealth Edison official resigned  
Friday, a day after a power outage darkened hundreds of office 
buildings, created chaos in downtown streets and forced the Chicago 
Board of Trade to close early. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul McCoy, vice president in charge of the distribution system,  
resigned in the wake of Thursday's blackout and an outage that 
affected 100,000 customers during July's brutal heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, if we had been performing better, he would still be  
here,'' said Robert Manning, a vice president of Unicom, ComEd's 
parent company. ``Obviously, we're disappointed with the 
performance of our system, of our organization in that regard. And 
consequently, Paul has resigned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ComEd officials said they had restored power to all downtown  
customers by 4 a.m. Friday. However, they were struggling with more 
outages later in the day on the city's South and West sides. About 
1,400 customers were affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning, who will take over part of McCoy's duties, said ComEd  
is bringing in contractors to help find trouble spots in the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Building Owners and Managers Association of Chicago  
estimated that the outage cost businesses an estimated $100 
million. Traffic was snarled, and office workers had to make long 
and difficult walks down skyscraper stairwells. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Board of Trade, the outage was followed Friday by another  
problem, when a glitch in data transmission technology provided by 
MCI WorldCom Inc. caused a halt to electronic trading. The problem 
also occurred earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, ComEd was sued by two companies who claimed they  
lost money because of the outages and a man who says he injured his 
knee as he stumbled around in the dark. The lawsuit seeks 
class-action status. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning said the utility is not legally responsible for damages  
because of power outages.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week mixed  
Friday, with the key index surging 6 percent in Kuala Lumpur on 
news that Morgan Stanley Capital International will reinstate 
Malaysia into its emerging market indexes in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The Malaysian key Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip  
stocks, rose 43.92 points, or 6.02 percent, to close at 772.88. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said the prospects of Malaysia returning to the indexes,  
which are used by some funds to allocate assets and measure 
performance, reversed a recent trend of foreign selling. 
</P>
<P>
	The international investment bank expelled Malaysia from its  
indexes after the country imposed capital controls on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan shares also surged as investors flocked back onto the  
bourse after an announcement that Morgan Stanley will raise the 
Taiwan weighting in its indexes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei Stock Exchange's Weighted Stock Price Index rose  
295.81 points, or 4.03 percent, to 7,626.05. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased weighting to 100 percent from 50 percent in the  
closely-monitored MSCI will begin in February and should attract 
greater foreign interest in the market, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese shares closed higher for the fifth straight session.  
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 12.20  
points, or 0.07 percent, to finish the day at 17,435.17. On 
Thursday, the average closed up 211.81 points, or 1.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei slipped as low as 17,284.70 early in the morning  
session, after the yen's early surge caused concern about the 
impact of a stronger Japanese currency on corporate earnings, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and  
thus less competitive, and reduces the dollar-denominated earnings 
of exporting companies when translated into yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, news that Japan's first-quarter economic  
growth was more robust than originally thought sent the dollar 
falling against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 114.92 yen, down 0.76 yen from late  
Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 115.62 
yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Economic Planning Agency announced that Japan's economy grew  
2.0 percent during the January-March period, slightly higher than 
the 1.9 percent growth it initially reported in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange closed lower on  
profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, fell 1.3 percent, or 171.57 points, to close at 
12,608.18. On Thursday, the index surged 341.95 points, or 2.7 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading remained thin because many investors stayed on the  
sidelines to await the release of the U.S. price index later Friday 
for signs on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest 
rates later this month, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong interest rates usually follow rate movements in the  
United States because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the 
American currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed lower as market sentiment was  
damped by the announcement that Malaysia is to be reinstated in the 
Morgan Stanley Capital International indexes on concerns that fund 
managers could switch their funds to Malaysia. The Straits Times 
Index fell 43.13 points, or 2.14 percent, to 1,969.68. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed sharply lower on uncertainties over  
the impact that the Daewoo Group's financial woes may have on the 
markets. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 31.88 points, 
or 3.4 percent, to 917.47. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly higher. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 1.21 points, or 0.05 percent, 
to 2,166.01. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower as investors, still  
anxious over a possible increase in both U.S. and domestic interest 
rates, cashed in gains from Thursday's rebound. The Philippine 
Stock Exchange Index fell 16.58 points, or 0.8 percent, to 
2,170.99. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, boosted by late  
buying in main resources and financial stocks. The All Ordinaries 
Index closed at 2,958.8, up 14.8 points, or 0.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed lower. The main Composite  
Index fell 1.3 percent, or 7.509 points, to 557.709. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai stock prices closed slightly higher. The Stock  
Exchange of Thailand index rose 2.29 points, or 0.5 percent, to 
423.78.

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Astacio Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado Rockies right-hander Pedro Astacio was  
back on the field Friday, less than 24 hours after turning himself 
in to police following an alleged altercation with his estranged 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Astacio, arrested on charges of third-degree assault, a  
misdemeanor, pinch-hit for the Rockies in their 14-13 loss to 
Montreal in the first game of a Friday doubleheader. He is 
scheduled to pitch against the Expos on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than to talk about his play, the Rockies weren't saying  
much about Astacio on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since his arrival in August 1997, Pedro Astacio has been a  
solid performer and person on our club,'' the Rockies said in a 
prepared release. ``At this time, Pedro's teammates and the 
Colorado Rockies organization are in full support of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Astacio's lawyer, Dan Murphy, has told his client not to speak  
with reporters because of the pending charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The facts in this complaint are very much in dispute,'' Murphy  
said. ``I am confident that the district attorney's office is not 
going to try this case in the media, nor will Mr. Astacio and I.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Astacio, who is 12-9 with a 4.88 ERA, surrendered to authorities  
in Arapahoe County on Thursday. Police said they received a 911 
call from a woman late Wednesday night. The woman said her 
estranged husband had been arguing with her and hit her in the face 
before leaving the house. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect later was identified as Astacio.  
</P>
<P>
	Astacio, 29, leads the Rockies in victories and is fourth in the  
National League with 149 strikeouts. He was acquired from the Los 
Angeles Dodgers on Aug. 18, 1997, for infielder Eric Young. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Astacio did not miss a start and topped 200 innings  
for the third straight season. He also became one of only three 
pitchers in Rockies history to win 13 games in a season.

<HEADLINE> Rugova To Work With U.N. in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Amid a fresh round of violence  
against Serbs and peacekeepers, ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim 
Rugova assured international leaders today that his party will 
cooperate with the United Nations as well as with rival ethnic 
Albanian groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, violence against peacekeepers continued. German  
troops came under machine-gun fire Thursday afternoon during a 
mine-clearing operation near the southwestern town of Suva Reka, 
the German defense ministry said. There were no reported 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	A Russian soldier was shot in the shoulder by a sniper on  
Thursday while on guard duty near Gnjilane in southeastern Kosovo, 
officials of KFOR, the international peacekeeping force, said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with continuing law and order problems, the U.N. mission  
announced a new regulation today that allows peacekeepers and U.N. 
police to detain and even expel anyone deemed a threat to public 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	Rugova, who has twice won unofficial presidential elections,  
told reporters his Democratic League of Kosovo party, known as the 
LDK, was prepared to work with Kosovo Liberation Army leader Hashim 
Thaci, who has also claimed leadership of the province. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the elected president of Kosovo,'' Rugova said. ``And we  
will altogether closely cooperate, including Mr. Thaci and others 
and as such we will all participate in international administrative 
bodies until new elections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in a joint interview published today in France's three main  
newspapers, Rugova sounded less conciliatory. 
</P>
<P>
	``After NATO arrived in Kosovo, small groups of KLA came down  
from the mountains and went into towns and villages. It's normal 
that they put people in charge,'' Rugova said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, an agreement must be reached because running the whole  
country cannot be left to the KLA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rugova's moderate party boycotted the first meeting last month  
of a 12-member council created to promote ethnic cooperation, 
complaining that the party deserved more than two seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and other NATO countries have criticized the  
boycott and put pressure on Rugova to come back from self-imposed 
exile in Italy. He returned less than two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In a clear attempt to win favor with Western governments, many  
of whom favor Rugova over the militant KLA, Rugova praised the 
international peacekeeping mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation in Kosovo is continuing in a positive  
direction,'' Rugova said. ``All political forces should fully 
cooperate with KFOR (peacekeepers) and international 
administration, those being the guarantees for the reconstruction 
of a free and democratic Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, more than 10,000 people marched peacefully through  
Pristina, the provincial capital, to urge the international 
community to increase pressure on Serbia to release thousands of 
ethnic Albanians held there for alleged terrorist offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	International officials in the province are counting on the  
cooperation of Rugova and other leaders to help put an end to 
continuing ethnic Albanian attacks on Serbs, as well as scuffles 
with NATO-led peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's sniper attack against the Russian soldier took place  
in Robotovo, five miles north of the southeastern Kosovo town of 
Gnjilane, peacekeeping officials said. The soldier was recovering 
today in a Russian military clinic in Kosovo Polje. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, NATO said troops searched two locations Thursday,  
one in Prezovica, where several weapons were seized, including 
three submachine guns, one grenade launcher and several land mines. 
A source familiar with the operation said American troops were 
involved, and it was a Serb weapons cache. 
</P>
<P>
	In Susica, KFOR seized four rifles, 14 hand grenades, two  
anti-tank rockets and 4,000 rounds of ammunition. Another team 
seized five AK-47 rifles from a truck crossing the border from 
Albania at Morini. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cernica, three miles southwest of Gnjilane, an ethnic  
Albanian was found with a 9 mm pistol. Peacekeeping troops searched 
nearby houses, detaining 10 men and confiscating one shotgun, three 
assault rifles, several hand grenades and 600 rounds of ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, ethnic Albanians opened fire on British  
peacekeepers who were patrolling an area where Serbs had been 
threatened and told to leave. Seven ethnic Albanians were detained 
following the shootout and a car chase in a Serb area just north of 
Pristina, said British Lt. Col. Robin Hodges. Two of the seven were 
wounded by British fire.

<HEADLINE> Canoe Racers Use Wheels in Dry Creek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT HOLLY, N.J. (AP) -- With drought leaving the Rancocas Creek  
so low that algae is growing and the bottom is clearly visible, 
organizers of a canoe race decided to shift the event to land. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers of the Up the Creek Festival thought about canceling  
Saturday's Canoe Derby but decided they could pull it off without a 
paddle. Instead of paddling a quarter-mile upstream, competitors 
will push their boats on wheels for an eighth of a mile on a paved 
street. 
</P>
<P>
	The race drew about 100 people in its first year last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Jack Naughton, a local electrician, used wheels from shopping  
carts to make four gray aluminum canoes land-worthy. They're hard 
to control, he said, but the race will go on. 
</P>
<P>
	The portion of the Rancocas Creek where the race was to be held  
-- normally about waist-high at high tide -- was only ankle-deep in 
places Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the time you put two adults in there, you'd be sitting on  
the bottom,'' Naughton said.

<HEADLINE> Some Getting Sick From 'Blair Witch' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Movie theater employees are enduring something  
even more frightening than ``The Blair Witch Project'' -- having to 
clean up after fans who get sick after watching the low-budget 
horror hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the fictional documentary opened last month, workers at  
movie theaters have had to get out the gloves and mops as 
moviegoers get motion sickness from watching the film's jerky, 
first-person perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first weekend someone threw up in the women's restroom,  
the men's restroom and in the hallway,'' said Kris Monroe, manager 
at Lefont Plaza Theater in Atlanta. ``It's not pleasant to clean 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``One guy -- he was really cool -- he threw up in the restroom and  
he just came out and asked us for a mop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Kendall Square Cinema in Cambridge, Mass., assistant  
manager Nancy Campbell said she has started making announcements 
informing moviegoers to leave the cinema if they feel nauseated. 
Cinema staffers were upset about having to clean up messy seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beyond the scope of service we like to provide here,''  
Ms. Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent film, which has raked in $80 million since its  
release, follows three student filmmakers as they venture into the 
woods to track a legendary witch. The mock documentary features 
footage supposedly shot by the students and discovered in the woods 
a year after their disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Although blood and gore is virtually nonexistent, the cameras  
are in constant motion as the characters tramp through the woods. 
Throughout the one-hour, 27-minute film, the picture is often 
grainy and out of focus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've heard different analysis of why it happens,'' said  
producer Robin Cowie. ``Some simply may get a little motion 
sickness, that combined with the tension and the pace of the 
film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Someone vomits at just about every showing of the movie at AMC  
Colonial 18 in suburban Lawrenceville, said Bonnie Hunsaker, 
managing director. 
</P>
<P>
	``This past weekend we put up a sign that said the hand-held  
camera can create motion sickness and if you're susceptible to 
motion sickness you may want to rethink your viewing choice,'' she 
said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Slides, Tokyo Stocks Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- News that Japan's first-quarter economic growth was  
more robust than originally thought sent the dollar tumbling 
against the yen today. Tokyo share prices gained. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.92 yen at late afternoon, down 0.76 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 115.62 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 12.20 points,  
or 0.07 percent, to finish the day at 17,435.17. On Thursday, the 
average closed up 211.81 points, or 1.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Economic Planning Agency announced that Japan's economy grew  
2.0 percent during the January-March period, slightly higher than 
the 1.9 percent growth it initially reported in June. 
</P>
<P>
	If the growth pace set in the last quarter were to continue, GDP  
would expand 8.1 percent this year, the EPA said. That was up from 
the 7.9 percent announced in June. GDP is the measure of all goods 
and services produced in a country. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has recently strengthened against the dollar amid  
optimism that the economy is showing signs of emerging from a 
prolonged downturn. today's announcement was likely to enhance such 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 122.76 yen, down  
from 123.36 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 114.48 yen and 115.41 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices finished higher for the fifth  
straight session as the yen's readjustment from morning rallies and 
buying interest among local investors buoyed sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei initially slipped as low as 17,284.70 early in the  
morning session, after the yen's early surge caused concern about 
the impact of a stronger Japanese currency on corporate earnings, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and  
thus less competitive, and reduces the dollar-denominated earnings 
of exporting companies when translated into yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.59  
points to 10,789.39 at Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 4.05 points, or 0.03 percent, to 1,442.49. The 
TOPIX closed up 17.80 points, or 1.25 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 455.06 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 322.87 million shares 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Retreating issues outnumbered advancers 617 to 518, while 147  
issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.8500 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.8250 
percent, driving its price down to 99.57 yen from 99.78 yen.

<HEADLINE> Disney Reportedly Selling Fairchild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. is reportedly trying to sell  
off some its assets, including its Fairchild Publications magazine 
division, to concentrate on its core businesses -- its studio and 
theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Conde Nast Publications and Hearst Magazines have been involved  
in bidding on the titles, a Disney executive told the New York 
Times for a story Friday. Conde Nast has reportedly offered $650 
million for Fairchild. 
</P>
<P>
	The news follows reports in The Los Angeles Times and other  
publications that Disney is looking for buyers for its professional 
sports franchises, baseball's Anaheim Angels and hockey's Anaheim 
Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
	Fairchild includes W, Women's Wear Daily, Los Angeles and Jane  
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	The jewel of the acquisition would be W, a glossy fashion  
monthly that has become a general-interest magazine over the last 
four years. W has taken apparel advertising from magazines at both 
Hearst and Conde Nast. 
</P>
<P>
	Conde Nast, a division of Advance Publications, also publishes  
Glamour, Allure, GQ, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, among other 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Harper's Bazaar, Hearst Magazines publishes Town  
&AMP; Country and runs several newspapers and television stations. It 
recently announced it would publish Oprah, a lifestyle magazine 
with Oprah Winfrey as its brand spokeswoman. Hearst Magazines also 
joined Miramax Films, a division of Disney, in publishing Talk 
magazine, which made its debut last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fairchild group also publishes several trade magazines  
including Supermarket News, Brand Marketing, Footwear News and 
Children's Business. 
</P>
<P>
	Fairchild referred questions on the story to Disney. Disney  
spokeswoman Chris Castro declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney stock, which has languished badly this year, rose $1.06 1/4,  
or 4 percent to $27.18 3/4 in trading Friday on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Nimoy, Lancie Seek Drama Classes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Leonard Nimoy had the ears of state  
legislators and educators as he and another ``Star Trek'' series 
alumnus called for more drama classes in California's public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't need sets, costumes, or lighting, you don't need a  
lot of money,'' Nimoy, who starred as the pointy-eared Mr. Spock, 
said Thursday. ``You just need interested students and teachers to 
make drama work in California's schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State law now requires students to take a year of arts or a  
foreign language. School districts can have higher requirements, 
but only about half now require one year each of art and foreign 
language. 
</P>
<P>
	Nimoy and actor John de Lancie, known as Q on ``Star Trek: The  
Next Generation,'' suggested schools could bring drama classes back 
by ``acting out'' school subjects in short plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Nimoy and de Lancie have occasionally gotten together to narrate  
classic science fiction tales on the radio. Three years ago, the 
pair formed a production company, Alien Voices, to write 
dramatizations of classic literature, such as H.H. Wells' ``The 
Time Machine'' and Oscar Wilde's ``The Canterville Ghost.''

<HEADLINE> Western Digital Cuts Singapore Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- U.S. disk-drive maker Western Digital Corp.  
said Friday it will cut 2,500 jobs in Singapore by the end of 1999 
and move some operations to Malaysia, where labor costs are lower. 
</P>
<P>
	About 325 employees were laid off Friday, and the next cut will  
be made in early October, said John Coyne, Western Digital's vice 
president of Asian operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will move its desktop disk-drive manufacturing  
operations from Chai Chee, its only Singapore facility, to its 
plant in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, by September. The move will reduce 
staff strength in Singapore to 1,700. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kuala Lumpur plant plans to hire 1,700 people, adding to the  
existing 4,300 staff, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Western Digital, based in Irvine, Calif., is one of the largest  
independent manufacturers of PC hard disk drives. It reported sales 
of $2.7 billion last year.

<HEADLINE> College Football Hall Enshrines 22 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Jim McMahon feels honored to be elected  
to the College Football Hall of Fame, even if he doesn't really 
like watching the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a big fan (of football),'' McMahon said. ``When I was  
a little kid I used to watch a lot, but since I started playing I 
hate watching games. I'd rather play, and if I can't play I'd 
rather do something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His fellow enshrinees included Tom Osborne, Bo Jackson and Don  
Coryell. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's class of 22 players and coaches was to be enshrined  
in the hall Friday night. The Division I-A players and coaches were 
elected last year and inducted during a ceremony in New York. The 
Divisional class was elected this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Other enshrinees include Division I players Al Brosky, Brad  
Budde, Bill Fralic, Randy Gradishar, Mel Long, Jerry Rhome, Jim 
Richter, Johnny Roland, Alex Sarkisian and Bill Stanfill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Divisional Class includes players George Bork, Teel Bruner,  
George Floyd, Willie Galimore, Jim LeClair and Randy Trautman, 
along with coaches Billy Nicks and Jim Sochor. 
</P>
<P>
	The hall waived its normal three-year waiting period for only  
the second time in electing Osborne, who retired in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the winningest coaches in Division I-A history, Osborne  
led Nebraska to national titles in 1994 and 1995, and his 1997 
squad shared the crown with Michigan. He was 255-49-3 in his 25 
years as the Cornhuskers' coach and reached the 250-win mark in his 
302nd game, faster than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson is the lone Heisman winner in this year's class, taking  
home the trophy in 1985 during his senior year at Auburn. Jackson 
was a consensus All-American in 1983 and an unanimous selection in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
	McMahon, the ``punky QB,'' never seemed to fit in with BYU's  
Mormon image, but he threw for 9,536 yards and 84 touchdowns while 
completing 61 percent of his 1,060 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the other offenses I played in were boring compared to  
college,'' said McMahon, who doubts the pro Hall of Fame will come 
calling next. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt that'll happen. If you boys in the media are voting  
for me, I don't have a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coryell, who revolutionized the college passing game with his  
``Air Coryell'' attack, was to be enshrined in the divisional class 
for his coaching days at Whittier College and San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
	His San Diego State teams ran off a 25-game winning streak that  
was soon followed by a 31-game unbeaten streak. His teams had three 
unbeaten seasons in 1966, 1968 and 1969, and his 1966 team was 
picked by the Associated Press as the top college team.

<HEADLINE> Pardon for Black Sailors Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of black World War II veterans on  
Friday remembered colleagues lost in an ammunition explosion 55 
years ago and urged President Clinton to clear the names of 50 
black sailors court-martialed after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to give those men and their survivors the due that  
they deserve,'' said John Lawrence, an aide to Rep. George Miller, 
D-Calif. Miller is one of the lawmakers leading the pardon effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. President, please hear us,'' said veteran Yale Lewis of  
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The black sailors were court-martialed for mutiny for refusing  
to return to the loading docks after the July 1944 blast at the 
Port Chicago Naval Magazine near San Francisco that killed 320 men. 
</P>
<P>
	The World War II Black Navy Veterans of Great Lakes, which held  
a wreath-laying ceremony for the sailors Friday, is the latest 
group to call for the men's pardons. Last month, the NAACP passed a 
resolution asking Clinton to pardon the sailors. 
</P>
<P>
	There are two known surviving members of the sailors who were  
convicted and imprisoned. Supporters have asked for a speedy review 
because one of the sailors, Freddie Meeks of California, is in 
failing health. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said Friday the matter was under review.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's being considered under the usual process at the Justice  
Department, and obviously the president will give careful 
consideration to that,'' said White House spokesman Barry Toiv. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of those killed were members of the all-black loading  
crews that stacked bombs and other explosives aboard Navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion was the worst domestic loss of life in World War  
II. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1994 Navy legal review concluded that the black seamen faced  
racial prejudice but found no grounds to overturn their 
courts-martial.

<HEADLINE> Teenagers Charged in Crime Spree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Four teen-age girls who police say hatched a  
crime spree when they found themselves without pocket money were 
charged Friday with five armed robberies. 
</P>
<P>
	All four girls are middle-class high school students or recent  
graduates in suburban Kingwood. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not the typical profile of an aggravated robbery  
suspect,'' said Capt. Steve Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities charged Katie Marie Dunn, Malissa Chalerm Warzeka,  
both 17, and Michelle Renee Morneau, 18, with one count each of 
aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. A 16-year-old female, 
whose identity was not released because of her age, was charged 
with two counts of aggravated robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were sitting at a Sonic restaurant, and ran out of money  
and said `Let's do a robbery,''' said Billy Stephens, a police 
spokesman. ``One of them said `I've got a gun' and another said 
`I've got a mask.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Armed with a shotgun, a .22 rifle and semiautomatic pistol, the  
hooded and sunglass-wearing robbers struck a bakery, a grocery 
store and convenience stores from May 30 to July 10, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two would enter a store, with one acting as lookout and the  
other handling the cashier, Stephens said. A third was the getaway 
driver, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one that was in front me kept telling me I had two minutes  
to hand over the cash or she was going to shoot me,'' said Cynthia 
Woodard, a clerk at a convenience store. ``I was so nervous I threw 
the money over the bag they held out in front of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police were tipped off when the girls began bragging, Stephens  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was brought to our attention that they were going to  
parties, really bragging up a storm,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls are free on bond and face a hearing Sept. 2.

<HEADLINE> Trade Talks Expected To Succeed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite some intense bickering now, the  
Clinton administration says the 134-nation World Trade Organization 
will be able to arrive at a common negotiating agenda in time to 
launch a new round of global trade talks in December. 
</P>
<P>
	But some trade analysts are not so certain, given the recent  
performance of the Geneva-based trade group, which was embroiled 
for months in a nasty fight over who would lead the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	That dispute was finally resolved with an awkward job sharing  
arrangement in which former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore, the 
U.S.-preferred candidate, will hold the WTO's top job for three 
years and then be succeeded by Thailand Vice Prime Minister 
Supachai Panitchpakdi, who was backed by Japan and other Asian 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Susan Esserman, who is in  
charge of the administration's preparations for the upcoming round 
of trade negotiations, to begin in Seattle, said the leadership 
fight ``will have no impact'' on the Seattle talks. ``There is a 
desire to move ahead and an enthusiasm in moving forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Esserman conceded that serious differences remain to be  
resolved among the United States, Europe, Japan and developing 
nations over negotiating goals for the new round of talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is pushing for a limited agenda focusing on  
tariff cuts on manufactured goods, removal of a variety of 
agricultural trade barriers and greater opening of competition in 
service industries such as telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe, by contrast, wants far more measures to be considered in  
the talks. U.S. officials have complained that is because they are 
seeking to shield European farmers from further trade 
liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
	Many developing countries are complaining that even the more  
limited U.S. agenda is too large. They are still straining to meet 
the requirements of the last global trade talks, known as the 
Uruguay Round, which were begun in that country in 1986 and dragged 
on until 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	While Esserman told reporters Thursday that all these disputes  
will be resolved in time for a successful launch of the talks in 
Seattle in early December, some private trade analysts were not as 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is deep disagreement between the United States, the  
European Union, Japan and the developing nations over what ought to 
be included in the next round,'' said Gary Hufbauer, a trade expert 
at the Institute of International Economics, a Washington think 
tank. ``I don't see a smooth road ahead at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hufbauer said there was growing foreign unhappiness with the  
administration's objections to including U.S. trade barriers in the 
upcoming talks, for fear of upsetting such American industries as 
steel and textiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration, in an effort to pre-empt U.S. opponents,  
has been taking things off the table that other countries want,'' 
Hufbauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Esserman said the administration would continue to object to any  
effort to include anti-dumping regulations as part of the upcoming 
discussions. The administration has used these regulations, which 
allow higher tariffs for U.S. industries threatened by imports, as 
the primary mechanism to provide relief for U.S. steelmakers in the 
wake of the Asian currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Esserman said consensus was forming around certain U.S.  
positions, including the administration's insistence that the next 
talks should be concluded in just three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Two areas of negotiations -- agriculture and services -- are part  
of the so-called built-in agenda, meaning that countries agreed as 
part of the Uruguay package to reopen talks in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Esserman also noted that a meeting of trade ministers from  
Pacific Rim countries earlier this year, the group, known as the 
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, agreed to include further 
tariff cuts on manufactured goods as a negotiating goal, starting 
with accelerated cuts in eight specific sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	More progress could come in outlining the goals for the talks  
when President Clinton meets with other APEC leaders in New Zealand 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also is expected to have discussions with Chinese  
President Jiang Zemin while at APEC. Esserman refused to speculate 
on whether the two leaders would be able to strike a final 
market-opening trade agreement that would clear the way for China's 
membership in the WTO.

<HEADLINE> TBS Pulls Plug on Women's Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Facing high costs and stiff competition, Time  
Warner's Turner Broadcasting System has suspended development of a 
new cable network aimed at women. 
</P>
<P>
	TBS will devote the resources instead to two other networks in  
development, a new cartoon channel and a regional Southeastern 
channel, as well as promoting its younger networks like Turner 
Classic Movies and CNN Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
	TBS, in a statement released Friday, said it was ``not in the  
company's best interest or in the best interests of our affiliates 
to actively pursue the creation of the Women's Network at this 
time.'' The story was first reported in The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The project, which had been in development for a year but  
announced just two months ago, would have faced stiff competition 
for female TV audiences from the already successful Liftetime 
channel and a new channel from Oxygen Media being developed by 
veteran TV producer Geraldine Laybourne and talk show host Oprah 
Winfrey. Oxygen has won backing from several major investors, 
including Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	TBS did not say how much money it had earmarked for the new  
women's channel, which would have also included the participation 
of two magazine publishers, Time Inc., which is also part of Time 
Warner, and Conde Nast, publisher of Mademoiselle, Vogue and 
Glamour. 
</P>
<P>
	Katherine Styponias, a media analyst at Prudential Securities,  
called Time Warner's move to put the women's network on hold ``a 
smart financial decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're starting a third women's channel, you would have to  
spend significantly on promotion in addition to all the programming 
costs,'' she said. ``I applaud Time Warner for taking a critical 
view from a financial perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TBS already had two other new cable channels in the works:  
Turner South, due to launch in October, will focus on the Southeast 
region; and Boomerang, scheduled to start next April, will offer 
classic cartoon shows from the company's Hanna-Barbera library like 
the Flintstones and the Jetsons. 
</P>
<P>
	TBS' Cartoon Network started out as a showcase for Hanna-Barbera  
cartoons but has recently been airing more original programming and 
contemporary cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
	TBS had planned to put Pat Mitchell, an award-winning producer  
at CNN, in charge of the new channel.

<HEADLINE> Italy Accuses Coke in Antitrust Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italian authorities have accused Coca-Cola Co. of  
abusing its dominant market position through questionable trade 
practices, according to a preliminary report released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The report alleges Coke offered discounts to retailers who  
displayed its products more prominently than those of competitors. 
It also says the company allegedly discriminated against 
wholesalers who refused to displace competitor's products. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke's marketing practices have come under scrutiny of  
regulators in several countries in recent months. In July, European 
Union officials raided Coke's offices in Austria, Denmark, Germany 
and Great Britain as part of an inquiry into the company's 
marketing practices. Authorities in Chile and the United States are 
also looking into allegations of unfair practices by Coke. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's antitrust authorities have been investigating Coca-Cola  
Co. for unfair business practices for more than a year, Italian 
officials said today. The investigation was spurred by a complaint 
from rival PepsiCo. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has until Oct. 29 to answer the accusations in the report  
it received from Italian regulators. The authority said it would 
issue a final ruling in the case by mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
	If Coca-Cola is found to have violated fair business practices  
it could be fined up to 10 percent of its annual sales in Italy, or 
$83 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Alessandro Magnoni, spokesman for Coca-Cola Italia in Milan,  
said the company is aware of the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola's products account for about 46 percent of Italy's  
soft drink market, Italian news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi complained to Italian authorities in November 1997 that  
Coke was unfairly and systematically trying to exclude it from that 
market. The antitrust inquiry started in June 1998.

<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Colorado midfielder Ross Paule was injured in  
an airborne collision Friday night in the Rapids' 1-0 victory over 
the Tampa Bay Mutiny and was taken off the field on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Paule, 23, was taken to an area hospital for X-rays.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's my understanding he has a cut under his eye, a possible  
fractured, depressed cheekbone and a concussion,'' Rapids coach 
Glenn Myernick said of Paule's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Paule, who missed the previous three games with a strained knee  
ligament, was hurt in a collision with Tampa Bay's Ritche Kotschau 
in the 41st minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Kotschau had entered the match in the 28th minute after Tampa  
Bay captain Dominic Kinnear hurt his neck after making head-to-head 
contact with Colorado's Jorge Dely Valdes. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Frankel May Not Have Invested Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Fugitive financier Martin R. Frankel,  
accused of embezzling billions of dollars from insurance companies 
in five states, may have fled with as little as $50 million, a 
newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest estimate, though still a significant amount, is a  
fraction of the $3 billion he originally is accused of stealing. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing a source close to the federal investigation, the  
Greenwich Time reported Thursday that Frankel may not have invested 
any of the insurance company money he was paid to manage. 
</P>
<P>
	The source told the newspaper that Frankel may have suffered  
from ``trader's block'' -- a psychological inability to complete a 
financial transaction -- and sought help from a hypnotist and at 
least one psychiatrist to deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, who remains at large, apparently had a computer program  
which would comb through actual transactions to create the 
appearance of huge returns on investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The program ``monitored actual market trades, so when the client  
got the statement and checked on a particular security -- by looking 
in The Wall Street Journal, for example -- the computer-generated 
earning would match exactly with what it would have actually 
earned,'' the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Say he wanted to show an insurance company their investments  
earned $20 million. The program would come up with the trades to 
match that amount,'' the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statements Frankel sent to investors apparently led to the  
early estimates of losses, which ranged from more than $200 million 
to as much as $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	When insurance regulators in April began questioning the  
legitimacy of Frankel's Liberty National Securities, the brokerage 
he allegedly ran from a fortified mansion in Greenwich, regulators 
apparently believed the insurance investments had grown to as much 
as $950 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it appears that all Marty took was whatever the insurance  
companies first gave him to invest,'' the source said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. ``So we're not looking at billions of 
dollars, or even hundreds of millions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As much as $2 billion more was supposedly missing from a  
charitable foundation Frankel had created; that money, too, may 
have existed only on paper, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury has been investigating Frankel since  
mid-May. He disappeared in early May and remains on the loose. A 
warrant has been issued for his arrest on fraud charges.

<HEADLINE> Big Oil Cos. Stop Nigerian Pumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A joint venture between Texaco Inc. and Chevron  
Corp. was forced to stop pumping oil off the coast of Nigeria on 
Friday because angry residents in the area blocked supplies from 
reaching the company's platforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco Overseas Petroleum Co. of Nigeria Unlimited, or Topcon,  
declared force majeure and ceased production at its five oil rigs 
near the Niger River delta, said Rachel Moore, a London-based 
Texaco spokeswoman. Companies declare force majeure when an 
unpredictable, external event prevents them from meeting 
contractual obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	Topcon typically pumps about 50,000 barrels of crude oil a day  
at its platforms near the city of Warri in southern Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	``Production won't be resumed until we consider it safe and  
secure to do so,'' Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company evacuated all employees from its rigs after the  
latest in a series of disruptions of its crude production. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters recently commandeered a helicopter subcontracted to  
Topcon and kidnapped its six passengers and crew members. All 
hostages were later released, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in the southern Niger Delta, site of most of the  
country's drilling, have grown increasingly bitter over 
exploitation of the oil resources. They accuse the central 
government of greed, while their region is plagued by lack of 
development and abject living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests -- including sabotage of pipeline installations --  
have cost Nigeria about $1 billion in oil revenue so far this year, 
industry leaders said after a meeting Thursday with the state-owned 
Nigeria National Petroleum Corp. to discuss ways to create a 
peaceful environment for oil operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Also at the meeting were senior officials of Shell Petroleum  
Development Corp., Chevron, Elf Aquitaine SA, Mobil, Texaco, 
Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd., Addax Petroleum Development 
Co., Pan Ocean and Agip. 
</P>
<P>
	The managing director of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corp.,  
Jackson Gauis-Obaseki, said Thursday that the violence had gone 
beyond normal communal unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people start hijacking helicopters, kidnapping people and  
asking for ransom, it is no longer a protest,'' he said. ``What 
we're dealing with now is the perpetration of crime and banditry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gauis-Obaseki also said oil companies bore some  
responsibility for degrading the environment and not helping to 
alleviate unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	He also blamed community leaders, who he said received large  
sums of money from the oil companies without passing them on to 
their people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nigerian National Oil Co. owns 60 percent of Topcon. Texaco  
and Chevron each has a 20 percent stake.

<HEADLINE> Rapids 1, Mutiny 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Jorge Dely Valdes scored with 29 seconds to  
play Friday night and give the Colorado Rapids a 1-0 victory over 
the Tampa Bay Mutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Dely Valdes put home a header following a pass from Kevin  
Anderson. It was his ninth goal of the season and snapped the 
Rapids' 301-minute goal-scoring drought in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mutiny played shorthanded over the final 55 minutes after  
Manny Lagos received a red card for a hand ball. On the ensuing 
penalty kick, Tampa Bay goalkeeper Scott Garlick made a lunging 
save of a shot by Wolde Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	The match was delayed twice in the first half because of injured  
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado midfielder Ross Paule was taken from the field on a  
stretcher in the 42nd minute with a concussion and eye injury after 
an airborne collision with Tampa Bay's Ritchie Kotschau. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my understanding he has a cut under his eye, a possible  
fractured, depressed cheekbone and a concussion,'' Rapids coach 
Glenn Myernick said of Paule's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay captain Dominic Kinnear hurt his neck in the 28th  
minute. The injury, which a team spokesman said is not considered 
serious, occurred when Kinnear made head-to-head contact with Dely 
Valdes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctor felt like he's going to be OK,'' Mutiny coach Tim  
Hankinson said of Kinnear. ``Whether that means by Wednesday (next 
game at New England) or OK in general, we'll have to see. Dom has a 
big heart and a hard head and I'm sure he'll be fighting to line up 
next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kinnear and Paule were taken to Tampa's Memorial Hospital for  
X-rays.

<HEADLINE>  Rockets Mum on Pippen Trade Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A report that Scottie Pippen wants to be traded  
to Phil Jackson's Los Angeles Lakers is just another bump in 
Houston Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich's rebuilding job. 
</P>
<P>
	``This job, I've found, has a lot of obstacles in it, and this  
is just another one,'' Tomjanovich said Thursday. ``We deal with 
them the best way we can. I just try to stay positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich would not, however, answer questions about whether  
Pippen wants to stay in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys would have to ask him that,'' he said. ``I do my  
things privately with my players, and these things basically stay 
private.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen's agent, Jimmy Sexton, told the Houston Chronicle that  
the Rockets and Lakers discussed a trade and that Pippen hopes to 
be reunited with Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Chicago Bulls star, acquired by Houston in a  
sign-and-trade agreement last January, has complained about his 
role in the Rockets' offense. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first season of a five-year contract, Pippen averaged  
14.5 points, the lowest since his rookie year. He hit a career-low 
43.2 percent of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sexton told the newspaper that Pippen has nothing against  
the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and Phil Jackson have an extremely close relationship from  
11 years working together day in and day out,'' he said. ``Scottie 
is an attractive piece of the puzzle for a lot of teams, but it 
probably would not be an issue if Phil Jackson was not there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich said he plans to tailor the Rockets' game plan to  
Pippen next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Scottie Pippen, (we) probably did more than any other  
player we've acquired ... to accommodate,'' he said. ``You know, 
there are going to be plays where you have to throw the ball to the 
other guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sexton did not return a call Thursday from The Associated Press,  
and Lakers officials refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading Pippen wouldn't be easy. Any deal would require  
adjustments to offset the $14.8 million he counts against the 
salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen reportedly told Robert Barr, the Rockets' senior  
executive vice president for basketball affairs, to seek a trade 
with the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources have told the Houston Chronicle that the Lakers offered  
Glen Rice and former Houston forward Robert Horry, a deal the 
Rockets repeatedly have turned down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is difficult now,'' Rockets vice president Carroll  
Dawson told the newspaper. ``It's all harder than it used to be. It 
used to be if somebody had a bad practice, you could trade him that 
night. The bigger the salary, the more involved it gets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barr, who had been with the team for 16 years, resigned  
Wednesday, saying he needs a break from basketball and wants to 
spend more time with his family. Barr also has refused comment on 
Pippen's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite disappointing offensive numbers for 1999, Pippen  
averaged 6.5 rebounds and was named to the NBA All-Defensive first 
team.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Sues Intel Over Phone Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Ma Bell gets tough with deadbeat customers,  
she's not kidding around. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's largest telecommunications company,  
sued Intel Corp., the world's largest computer chip maker, for 
allegedly stiffing it on a $5,164.07 long-distance phone bill. 
</P>
<P>
	That might seem like pocket change for AT&AMP;T, a $64 billion  
company that is spending more than $100 billion to provide phone 
service through cable TV lines, or for Intel, with $27 billion in 
annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T initially refused Friday to explain why it went to court  
earlier this week to resolve such a seemingly trivial matter 
between corporate giants. But later in the day the company withdrew 
the suit, saying it was a foul-up that occurred because Intel's 
phone bill was inadvertently sent to a collection agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In the suit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San Jose,  
Calif., AT&AMP;T alleged Intel refused to pay a bill for the seven 
months ended June 27. It also sought attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to find out what happened and try to resolve  
it with the customer,'' AT&AMP;T spokesman Randy Shields said after the 
lawsuit was withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like an unfortunate mistake, and we'll move on from  
here,'' said Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for the Santa Clara, 
Calif.-based computer chip giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Kagan, an independent industry analyst based in Atlanta,  
speculated that AT&AMP;T may have wanted to make an example out of 
Intel so other corporate customers pay up. ``This may wind up 
costing them more than they'll pay for it, but they can't afford to 
have a precedent set,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T probably isn't going to cut off Intel's service, but it has  
been getting tougher with customers. Last year, for instance, the 
company began charging residential customers a minimum of $3 a 
month even if they don't make any long-distance phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, the company needs to cut costs amid a torrid  
acquisition spree, including its purchases of the TCI and MediaOne 
cable TV networks, which vaults it into the position of No. 1 cable 
TV company in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	But next to those moves, a lawsuit seemed a bit out of  
proportion, said Kagan. ``What are they going to be complaining 
about next?'' he asked. ``They have bigger fish to fry.''

<HEADLINE>  Forbes Gains With Pricey Organizing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Pat Buchanan was just settling into the  
booth for his radio interview, but blanched a bit at the lead-in 
item the station broadcast -- a voter turnout commercial for Steve 
Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forbes has moved up,'' sighed Buchanan, referring to the  
progress the wealthy publisher has made in the race for the 
Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Using many of the tools from the business world, Forbes has  
built an expensive and high-tech campaign organization that's 
getting increasing respect in political circles, and making his 
campaign for the GOP presidential nomination a serious one. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes insists the issue is one of a message that's beginning to  
resonate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are getting our message out and, ultimately, that  
is how you win,'' Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	While virtually every campaign has a Web site and uses computers  
heavily, Forbes takes high-tech to a higher level, and aides said 
it's central to his campaign strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to push that envelope,'' said political director  
Bill Dal Col. ``We're using the Internet for the 2000 election like 
they did TV for the '60 election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Forbes pulled into the Iowa State Fair on Friday with all  
the garish splash of campaigns past, his bus was draped with 
banners and had loudspeakers blaring ``Stars and Stripes Forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But inside, there was a world-class communication effort using  
satellite phone technology which allows him to stay constantly in 
contact with Internet even when his bus is rolling through remote 
parts of the state. That allowed sophisticated marketing techniques 
like updating the campaign's database in real time as new backers 
are garnered. 
</P>
<P>
	It also allows an unfiltered vehicle for the campaign's message  
to find its way to backers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dal Col said the Internet has proven to be a useful tool for  
interactive work with potential backers, communicating with them 
but also luring them in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used our Web site to get 25,000 volunteers,'' said Dal Col.  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes made a splash in the last election cycle with a  
relentless television assault on then-front-runner Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Forbes is spending heavily on advertising, but it's a  
far more sophisticated campaign. He's running traditional 30-second 
spots where he talks about his ideas, but also featuring warm and 
fuzzy spots where his daughters talk about their father, and also 
using the often overlooked medium of radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes also aired a live, 30-minute ``town hall'' meeting Friday  
featuring some of the state's leading social conservatives in a 
call-in format on the eve of a big GOP straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	That was designed ``to get to know Steve Forbes up close and  
personal,'' the spot said. He pushed hard on economic issues, but 
also made it clear he was a staunch abortion opponent and spoke 
fondly of his weeks of intense grassroots campaigning in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want real change,'' said Forbes. ``You go out on a trip  
like this and you know that people know a lot more than we give 
them credit for.''

<HEADLINE> FAA Unveils Plans To Reduce Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration hopes a  
new plan will end this summer's spate of air traffic delays, which 
have left airline executives and some passengers fuming. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, in a letter to the nation's major carriers, said one  
element of the plan will be to have its command center in Herndon, 
Va., start coordinating traffic flows in bad weather. That should 
eliminate conflicts between local centers spread across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the FAA will let the center minimize the use of  
extra buffers that are otherwise routinely established between 
planes in bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has also pledged to develop a policy in which  
airplanes held on the ground because of bad weather will be given a 
specific projected departure time. Such information can then be 
relayed to passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline passengers, who have suffered through hundreds of delays  
this summer, should start seeing the effect of the changes within 
the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the FAA said a long-term improvement hinges on the  
continuation of the agency's $13 billion modernization program, as 
well as congressional approval of a plan to renew the agency for 
another five years. Included in that ``reauthorization'' bill, now 
stalled in the Senate, is language that would let the FAA start 
charging fees for some of its services. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we and the airlines developed is a short-term program  
that we believe will have the effect of reducing the delays,'' 
Eliot Brenner, the agency's chief spokesman, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all agree that what's needed over the longer term is the  
FAA's steady program modernizing the system, which is why the 
long-term reauthorization is so important to us,'' Brenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, airlines have united in protest about air  
traffic delays, saying they are costing them money and contributing 
to rising passenger discontent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Transport Association, the airlines' trade group,  
estimates the more than 308,000 air traffic control delays last 
year cost the industry $4.1 billion -- up from $3.9 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will never have the on-time record we want unless the (FAA)  
can ensure that their system keeps up with growth,'' Jim Goodwin, 
chairman of United Airlines' parent, UAL Corp., said in Chicago 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA, which runs the air traffic control system and is  
responsible for ensuring passenger safety, contends that only 3 
percent of air traffic problems are attributed to equipment 
troubles. It says three-quarters of all delays are caused by bad 
weather, especially in the summer, when thunderstorms are common. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the agency is in the midst of a long-awaited  
program to upgrade its computers and displays in en route centers 
and facilities controlling traffic near airports. The FAA is also 
studying technology that would free pilots from the limits of the 
existing system of aerial highways and let planes fly routes picked 
by the pilots, a concept called ``free flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to American Airlines President Donald Carty, which  
mirrored letters sent to other airline executives, FAA 
Administrator Jane Garvey said the agency benefited from the 
carriers' suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FAA is committed to do its part to follow through on the  
action items on which the airlines and we have agreed,'' Garvey 
wrote. ``Those actions, along with individual airline efforts to 
review and amend internal policies and procedures as appropriate, 
will lead us toward the improvements we are both seeking.''

<HEADLINE> Phillies Put Curt Schilling on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Philadelphia Phillies placed Curt  
Schilling on the 15-day disabled list Friday, retroactive to Aug. 
8, because of recurring shoulder problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Saturday, Schilling gave up seven earned runs and eight  
hits in 6 1-3 innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks. He has been 
hampered by biceps tendinitis, mild bursitis and muscle spasms in 
his neck and shoulder blades. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, who will be eligible to be activated on Aug. 23, is  
now the eighth Phillies player on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old right-hander is 14-5 with a 3.49 ERA and his  
health will be a key factor as to whether Philadelphia can remain 
in the battle for a playoff spot. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jerry Springer Rules Out Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Talk show host Jerry Springer said Friday  
he won't run for the U.S. Senate next year because of other 
obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer, often criticized for his show's brawling guests and  
trashy topics, had been considering running against Republican 
Senator Mike DeWine. 
</P>
<P>
	``My current contractual obligations and commitments ... make it  
impractical if not impossible for me to make a run for the Senate 
at this time,'' Springer said in a statement issued by his office 
in Chicago, where he tapes his show. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer, 55, is a former two-term mayor of Cincinnati who ran  
for governor in 1982 as a liberal Democrat before embarking on a TV 
career. He worked as an anchor and commentator before discovering 
that foul-mouthed, chair-throwing guests could make him the 
nation's No. 2-rated daytime talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of a Senate run surfaced in late July, when Hamilton  
County Democratic Party Chairman Tim Burke, and old friend of 
Springer, told The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer that he would be a 
``viable, fascinating, interesting candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of his candidacy was condemned by many  
officeholders and editorial writers. 
</P>
<P>
	``My only reaction is pure joy,'' said U.S. Rep. Ted Strickland,  
D-Ohio, who had vowed never to share a stage with Springer if he 
was the party's nominee. Strickland had been recruited to run for 
the Senate but decided to remain in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want him to run. I think he is a joke,'' Senate  
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., had said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	But Springer had received support from organized labor in Ohio.  
He had said earlier that he was ``obviously flattered and honored 
by the interest'' even though he wasn't sure it was a practical 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
	DeWine, a former prosecutor and congressman, is in his first  
term in the Senate. He won the 1994 race to succeed the retiring 
Democratic Sen. Howard Metzenbaum. 
</P>
<P>
	The most experienced Democrats in Ohio have taken a pass on the  
chance to run against DeWine. Only Richard Cordray, a former state 
representative with little statewide name recognition, is exploring 
a candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer's friend Burke expressed disapointment. ``I believed  
and I still believe that Jerry would have been a great candidate,'' 
he said Friday. ``He would have defeated Mike DeWine and most 
importantly, he would have been a great United States senator.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Dissolves KKK Rally Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A federal judge who voided a settlement between  
the city and its largest police union on plans to handle a Ku Klux 
Klan rally on Friday must now decide whether the rally can go 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Patricia Gaughan must also decide where Klan  
members can change into their robes at the scheduled Aug. 21 rally 
-- something that has been an issue between Mayor Michael R. White 
and the 1,700-member Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The KKK wants to rally downtown a few hours before the Cleveland  
Browns play their first home game in nearly four years and at the 
same time as a convention for black families. 
</P>
<P>
	The union asked Gaughan to block the rally, saying it would be  
too hard to provide security for all the events that day. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor said he is constitutionally obligated to let the KKK  
hold its rally. He also said it's necessary to provide a safe place 
for the group to change into its robes.

<HEADLINE> Talks With Union Begin at Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Job security, control of pension funds and work  
schedules are at the top of the slate as Boeing Co. and its largest 
union head into round-the-clock negotiations Monday on a new 
three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks come at a crucial time for Boeing, which is facing  
tough competition from Airbus Industrie to build planes for the 
world's airlines. If a strike occurs, it could cut short Boeing's 
financial recovery following two troubled years. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans call for a final company offer by Aug. 27 and a union vote  
Sept. 1, when ``it's either settled or it's strike,'' said Dick 
Schneider, head negotiator for the International Association of 
Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union represents 44,000 of 
Boeing's 210,000 workers worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both parties are there to negotiate a contract, not a  
strike,'' Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
	The current contract expires Sept. 2. The Machinists have gone  
on strike in two of the past three contract talks, most recently 
for 69 days in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing is having a banner year, with plans to deliver a record  
620 planes in 1999. But the company, under pressure from rival 
European consortium Airbus, also has been working for over a year 
to streamline its operation. 
</P>
<P>
	For the union, Schneider said Friday, ``the key issue is job  
security for our members.'' Thousands of jobs were eliminated 
already this year, and 1,334 additional workers in the Puget Sound 
area got notices last week that they will be laid off in 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said the work force ebb and flow is  
based on production rates that are keyed to market forces. Conte 
said there was an unusual surge in hiring in 1996 and 1997 ``as 
shops were ramping up production'' and trying to resolve production 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Schneider said that while the union understands Boeing must  
remain competitive with Airbus, the Machinists want reductions in 
the practice of farming out work to subcontractors not covered by 
the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The average machinist at Boeing earns $40,000 a year, not  
counting benefits or overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The company views outsourcing as critical to remaining  
competitive, ``which enhances job security for thousands of Boeing 
employees,'' Conte said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memo to managers, however, company negotiator Jerry Calhoun  
said Boeing is willing to work with the union on the subcontracting 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun said one way to provide greater job security is to go to  
a seven-day, 24-hour-a-day work schedule, something the union 
opposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Since World War II, Boeing has basically run a five-day  
operation. Those working weekend shifts are paid overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is the company would save $400 million over  
the three-year agreement in overtime costs'' with a seven-day 
schedule, Schneider said, noting that ``candidly, we have workers 
who like to work a lot of overtime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conte said the details of ``alternative work schedules'' remain  
to be worked out at the table. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been characterized as a company desire to no longer pay  
overtime,'' he said. ``It would perhaps reduce some levels of 
overtime but would by no means eliminate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than 30 percent of U.S. employees work the so-called  
standard Monday-to-Friday daytime schedule, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union contends that evenly dividing the workforce among  
three shifts going five days a week -- rather than the current 
practice of having the majority on days -- would produce the same 
results as a seven-day week. 
</P>
<P>
	The pension fund issue is one of control: Boeing has it, the  
union wants it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing pension plan contains $15 billion for both the  
Machinists and about 1,400 salaried employees. Its liabilities -- 
funds needed to cover current and future retirees -- are about $11 
billion, Conte said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union wants future pension contributions to go to its own  
National Pension Plan. Schneider cited concerns over a possible 
Boeing buyout by corporate raiders who could liquidate the pension 
fund, as well as possible misuse of fund proceeds by the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing says such a switch would cost $45 million to $50 million  
a year -- and leave extremely vulnerable the 1,400 salaried 
employees covered by the plan. And while a robust stock market has 
kept the fund healthy without recent company contributions, 
``Boeing does not violate those funds,'' Conte said.

<HEADLINE> Evolution Vote May Have Small Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Some local Kansas officials are not planning  
to change what their schools teach about evolution, even though the 
State Board of Education's new testing standards de-emphasize its 
importance, especially the theory that men descended from apes. 
</P>
<P>
	Local school districts will continue to decide what subjects are  
taught in their classrooms. Both critics and supporters of the 
standards approved Wednesday said they could influence some lesson 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	But some schools and teachers said they don't plan to make any  
changes in how they deal with evolution. And Gov. Bill Graves 
scoffed at the idea of kicking evolution out of schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this decision is so out of sync with reality that in  
some ways it minimizes, sort of, the credibility and the oversight 
that the state board is supposed to have on schools,'' said Kansas 
Gov. Bill Graves, who opposed the new standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The state board won't be able to stop the teaching of evolution,  
he said. ``What are they going to do, hire the evolution police?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marjorie Kaplan, superintendent of the big Shawnee Mission  
district in the Kansas City suburban area, said: ``We're going to 
cover the same material as we have in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Education Commissioner Andy Tompkins -- who as the state's top  
education administrator works for the state board -- said Thursday 
the standards won't remove evolution from Kansas classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think nearly every biology book in the world has that  
covered,'' Tompkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's old science standards did not say what topics should  
be included on statewide tests administered to public school 
students, but they did say that evolution was something students 
should learn before they graduate from high school. 
</P>
<P>
	The new standards are far more specific. The include references  
to ``microevolution,'' or changes within species. They also mention 
natural selection, the idea that advantageous traits increase in a 
population over time. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the standards do not include language recommended by a  
committee of 27 science educators describing evolution as a 
fundamental scientific tenet. Nor do they include a section on 
``macroevolution,'' the process of change from one species to 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes mean the state is not planning to include questions  
about macroevolution, or dealing with theories of the origin of the 
universe, on its statewide tests, used to evaluate how well schools 
are teaching. The new science tests are supposed to be administered 
starting in spring 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Evolution is the theory that all life evolved from common  
ancestors. Those opposed to it say it contradicts the biblical 
account of the creation of life, and they object to the idea that 
human life resulted from a lower life form. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a decade ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that public  
schools can't teach creationism, the theory that a divine being 
created the universe. Opponents of the new standards say 
conservatives are trying their only remaining tactic -- to limit the 
teaching of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas is one of a number of states, including Arizona, Alabama,  
Illinois, New Mexico, Texas and Nebraska, where school boards 
recently have attempted to take evolution out of state science 
standards or de-emphasize evolutionary concepts. 
</P>
<P>
	Some educators see the debate over evolution shifting to local  
school boards. 
</P>
<P>
	In Colby, about 55 miles from the Colorado border, School  
Superintendent Kirk Nielsen said residents are conservative and 
``other theories like creationism come up in class and we discuss 
them.''

<HEADLINE> US: China Hasn't Threatened Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chinese officials have been sounding out  
U.S.-China specialists for their opinion on possible Chinese 
military action against Taiwan following Taiwanese assertions that 
Beijing and Taipei should be treated as equals. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Paal, president of the Washington-based Asia Pacific  
Policy Center, said he had been visited separately by Chinese 
military, government and academic representatives. He described the 
meetings as ``much more intense'' than interviews that he regularly 
has with them. 
</P>
<P>
	He said China regards the current difficulties with Taiwan as  
being much more serious than the situation in 1996 when Taiwanese 
President Lee Teng-hui engaged in a campaign to gain greater 
international recognition for Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Paal said he was asked by the Chinese how he believed the  
administration would respond to the various scenarios they 
outlined. 
</P>
<P>
	He said they talked about the possibility of capturing small,  
outlying Taiwanese islands, then appeared to back away from that 
option as too ambitious. They also raised the possibility of 
attacking ships. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be part of psychological warfare or just saber  
rattling, or an attempt to keep us busy while they attack Taiwan,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Mulvenon, a Chinese army expert at the Rand research  
organization, said he also was approached by Chinese emissaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``They walk in with the same message,'' Mulvenon told the  
Washington Post. ``We're going to do something. We can't tell you 
what, but we're going to do something. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal for China would be to cause maximum impact in Taiwan  
without bringing in the United States,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	William Triplett, a China expert and former chief Republican  
counsel on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said China has 
been dropping hints in Far East newspapers for the past month that 
some form of military action against Taiwan may occur. Such 
articles have been seen in Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Japan 
and Hong Kong, Triplett said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said any military action against Taiwan would have a ruinous  
impact on China's efforts to build relations with the outside 
world, including the United States and European countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would all go down the tubes,'' Triplett said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an administration spokesman denied news accounts that  
China warned the Clinton administration about possible military 
action against Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not received any threats or ultimatums from the  
Chinese,'' National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said at 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Unidentified administration officials told the New York Times  
that Washington has warned Beijing that any military action would 
force the United States to retaliate. Leavy declined to speculate 
on what he called a ``hypothetical military operation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese Embassy spokesman Yu Shuning said he was unaware of any  
contacts by embassy officials with China experts on the Taiwan 
issue. He repeated China's long-standing policy that it seeks 
peaceful reunification with Taiwan but does not rule out the use of 
force. To do so, he said, would make peaceful reunification 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post said the White House believes it's unlikely that  
Beijing would launch any military action before October to avoid 
spoiling a meeting next month between Clinton and Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they'll do it soon, but I can't say they won't  
do it at all,'' a senior administration said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said military action could range from  
striking Taiwan to seizing an unpopulated island belonging to 
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspapers said the warnings have come from lower-ranking  
Chinese officials and not from China's top leaders. The lower-level 
officials may have been gauging how the United States might 
respond, or may have hoped the Clinton administration would urge 
Taiwan to back down, the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we're watching the situation closely, and we have  
been in touch with both sides on a number of occasions over the 
last several weeks,'' Leavy said. ``Both sides recognize the danger 
in the situation. Our policy is the same -- it's one China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For more than a week, military aircraft from China and Taiwan  
have been flying over the 100-mile-wide straits separating Taiwan 
and the mainland. The opposing planes have not tangled, but Leavy 
said the United States is urging both sides to back off. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are how accidents happen, and we've made that clear,''  
Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	China has considered Taiwan a rogue province for 50 years, since  
Nationalist forces retreated to the island in defeat after battling 
Communist forces on the mainland. China has refused to renounce 
violence to force Taiwan back under full mainland control. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation has grown more tense since Taiwan's recent  
assertions that it should be treated as China's equal. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States favors eventual reunification so long as it is  
carried out by peaceful means.

<HEADLINE> Tiffany Expert Guilty in Grave Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A leading expert on Tiffany windows has been  
convicted of teaming with a graveyard bandit to sell valuable 
stained-glass stolen from cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury found Alastair J. Duncan guilty on Thursday of all six  
counts against him, including conspiracy. He faces up to 10 years 
in prison on each count when he is sentenced Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-day trial in U.S. District Court pitted the reputation  
of the 57-year-old Duncan, a respected art expert, against the word 
of a high school dropout who claimed to have stolen more than 80 
graveyard pieces over 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, the jury learned that mausoleums and  
cemeteries are inviting targets for the theft of glass created by 
Louis Comfort Tiffany because they often have little or no 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Casamassina testified that he broke into cemeteries and  
mausoleums, snatching 20 to 30 stained glass windows and several 
vases, statues and pedestals since the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Casamassina said he had once worked as a caretaker at a cemetery  
until he was fired after stealing a marble pedestal. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he was a high school dropout, Casamassina was  
well-schooled in the artistry of graveyards, having used one of 
Duncan's books to learn about Tiffany glass and which cemeteries 
held some of the better works. 
</P>
<P>
	At the center of the case was a 9-foot-tall, 5-foot-wide Tiffany  
window Casamassina had stolen in 1993 from a New York cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Brafman, Duncan's lawyer, was unimpressed by the  
government's case, which included conversations secretly taped by 
Casamassina, saying his client had no idea he had purchased a 
stolen Tiffany window. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what's pathetic about the government's case?'' he  
said during his closing argument. ``Eighty percent of the 
documentation that they showed you as evidence came from my client. 
Mr. Duncan calls the FBI. He learns that the window he has dealt 
with is stolen. He doesn't run to destroy the window. He doesn't go 
burn all of the documentation that a guilty person would do. He 
calls the FBI.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephanos Bibas told the jury that  
when Duncan learned the FBI was investigating its disappearance, he 
``rushes into the FBI spinning a story, telling part truth, part 
lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan was no stranger to the FBI, but the last time he was  
helping agents, not being investigated by them. He aided federal 
investigators probing the theft of a Tiffany landscape ``River of 
Life'' window from an Indianapolis mausoleum in the mid-'90s.

<HEADLINE> Slain Postman in Calif. To Be Buried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEREY PARK, Calif. (AP) -- Ismael Ileto clutched his wife's  
hand as he listened to the details of his brother's murder -- how 
the postal worker was chosen at random by a white supremacist and 
gunned down, police say, because he was of Filipino descent. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to speak, he looked down, shook his head and bit his lip.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no sense in it. We wouldn't want anyone to go through  
what we've been going through,'' said Ismael's wife, Deena Ileto. 
</P>
<P>
	As more relatives arrived from Chicago and New York for the  
funeral, planned for Saturday, the family of 39-year-old Joseph 
Santos Ileto tried to come to terms with the agonizing pain of 
their loss -- and a fear that speaking out might lead to more 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want any threats after this from the group this  
person's from,'' said Ismael Ileto, sitting with his family at 
their mother's house in this suburb east of Los Angeles. ``Now that 
we have a son, I'm kind of looking behind my back. It could happen 
to you, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family had purposely avoided watching a televised news  
conference Thursday where a charge of murder and five counts of 
attempted murder were announced against Buford O. Furrow Jr., who 
has a history of mental problems and ties to hate groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Furrow shot five people at a Jewish community  
center Tuesday, then an hour later killed Ileto as he delivered 
mail in a San Fernando Valley neighborhood. Ismael and Deena Ileto 
had to tell Joseph's mother, Lilian, of her son's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow is accused of shooting Ileto nine times, several to the  
back of his head. He allegedly confessed that the postal worker was 
a good ``target of opportunity'' to kill because he was non-white 
and worked for the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want these people not to hurt people anymore, no  
matter what race or color,'' Deena Ileto said.

<HEADLINE> Jerry Springer Rules Out Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Television talk show host Jerry Springer has  
decided that he won't give up his world of drag queens, cheating 
lesbians and bisexual love triangles for a chance to become Senator 
Springer. 
</P>
<P>
	His office in Chicago issued a statement Friday popping that  
political trial balloon because of contractual obligations and his 
new talk-and-variety show about to debut in England. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer issued a statement that it was ``impractical if not  
impossible for me to make a run for the Senate at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springer, who once was a Cincinnati politician, had been courted  
by some of his associates in Ohio to run for the U.S. Senate after 
several current members of Congress and former candidates decided 
not to run in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	With Springer out of the mix, Democrats may find a more  
traditional candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Democrats ought to be relieved,'' said political  
analyst Stuart Rothenberg. ``It would have been an embarrassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The freshman Republican who might have faced Springer in the  
next election, Sen. Mike DeWine, had no comment, according to a 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio GOP Chairman Robert Bennett said for Democrats to even  
consider the idea of a Springer candidacy demonstrated: ``Name 
recognition and deep pockets are their only criteria.''

<P>
	Ohio newspapers had huffed their outrage at the prospect of a  
Springer Senate race, and some Ohio Democrats who had been longing 
for a deep-pockets candidate said they couldn't accept Springer. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ted Strickland, of Ohio's 6th District, said Springer's  
television program was damaging and exploitative, and he could have 
nothing to do with the man. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer's spokeswoman, Linda Shafran, said the man who was host  
of that is arguably America's most controversial talk show was 
working on a late-night show tentatively set to debut in England on 
the ITV network, in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``Springer at 10 p.m.'' will be like ``The Tonight Show,'' with  
a combination of talk segments and comedy sketches, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 55-year-old Springer was mayor of Cincinnati for two terms  
and ran for governor in 1982 before starting a TV career.

<HEADLINE>  Newport Hopes To Host America's Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) -- The sailors are confident, hungry and a bit  
nervous, too. And why not? It's been 16 years since the New York 
Yacht Club and this city lost the America's Cup, yacht racing's 
holy grail. 
</P>
<P>
	Once proud defenders, they are now challengers for a prize the  
yacht club owned for 132 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Young America, the yacht club's racing team, has spent more than  
three years testing and tweaking boat designs and strategies to 
reclaim the Cup. On Friday, a model of a new narrower hull was 
unveiled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have what it takes to win, the desire and the commitment,''  
said John K. Marshall, president of Young America. But even more 
than that, he admits winning takes a fast boat. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall and the rest of Young America must wait until they test  
their two boats in October's challenge races in New Zealand to know 
for sure if they have that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we see (results from) that first race, we won't know,''  
he said. ``That's what makes it such a great race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next race for the Cup is in New Zealand in February 2000. A  
sailing team from that country won the Cup at San Diego in 1995 in 
dominating fashion. San Diego's loss may be Newport's gain, since 
the winning team gets to take the Cup home. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yacht Club has said Newport would again play host  
to the races if Young America wins. 
</P>
<P>
	First, however, Young America must beat racing teams from 10  
countries, along with entries from San Diego and San Francisco, in 
the challenge races. The winner takes on New Zealand next year. 
</P>
<P>
	David Gordon, Newport's mayor, made sure he was on hand Friday  
for the crew's official sendoff. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Cup returns to Newport, the boost in tourism and spending  
by racing teams and their suppliers could pump up to $50 million 
into the local economy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But more than the economic impact is the pride and tradition  
associated with having it here,'' he said. ``We are the home of the 
America's Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall said the Young America boats will have a narrow, carbon  
fiber hull and a steel keel made of a special alloy. The sides of 
the hulls will be marked by shark images. 
</P>
<P>
	The boats are designed to be versatile in difficult and  
constantly changing racing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall said defending the Cup had became sort of ``routine''  
for New York Yacht Club teams before they lost it in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes that kind of letdown will be felt by New Zealand, which  
has never had to defend the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're out to reclaim a national prize,'' he said. ``That's  
very energizing.''

<HEADLINE> Iridium Consortium Files Chapter 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Iridium LLC, the ambitious satellite-based  
mobile phone network, is finally relenting to the call of 
bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	With a shove from its creditors and a reassuring nod from  
parental guardian Motorola, the consortium announced Friday that it 
would restructure a crushing $3 billion debt load under Chapter 11 
of the federal bankruptcy code. 
</P>
<P>
	The move hardly came as a surprise, since there was no chance  
the venture would meet the subscriber targets stipulated by its 
loan agreements. Many observers were expecting that Iridium would 
miss a $90 million interest payment due on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it was a disappointment after weeks of talks designed to  
avoid the blemish of bankruptcy, which could further discourage 
investors and customers -- especially with a rival satellite venture 
named Globalstar due to introduce service in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only reason they were trying to avoid bankruptcy was the  
stigma associated with it,'' said Phelps Hoyt, a corporate bond 
analyst for KDP Investment Advisors in Montpelier, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The parties actually weren't that far from coming to an  
agreement,'' said Hoyt, adding that the bankruptcy reorganization 
will give Iridium some breathing room. ``Everybody loses if they 
call it a day and liquidate this company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iridium's stock plunged $1.18 3/4 to $3.06 1/4 on Friday before the  
Nasdaq Stock Market halted trading. Shares are now worth less than 
5 percent of what they sold for slightly more than a year ago, when 
Iridium's prospects seemed so bright. 
</P>
<P>
	The first hint of trouble came four months ago when Iridium, the  
first of four satellite-based telephone networks to introduce 
service, reported that it had signed up only 10,000 subscribers 
since its November launch -- a fraction of the subscriber forecasts 
used to secure Iridium's loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Iridium customers complained about complex calling plans  
with rates of up to $9 a minute, as well as big clunky phones that 
were in short supply, cost $3,500 and were confusing to operate. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the company introduced a simplified rate structure,  
slashing charges as much as 65 percent. Motorola and the Japanese 
company Kyocera cut the prices on their Iridium phones by more than 
half. New, sleeker models are expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear how well the new marketing plan has worked, but the  
change in strategy clearly came too late to persuade Iridium's 
lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, two days after the company announced that it had  
again violated the terms of its loan agreements, a group of Iridium 
bondholders filed a petition to force a bankruptcy reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, Iridium announced that it would go voluntarily.  
</P>
<P>
	Motorola, Iridium's largest investor and operator of Iridium's  
66-satellite system, said in a statement Friday that it would 
continue to provide its full operational support for Iridium and 
all current and future subscribers during the reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the progress being made to date to restructure Iridium's  
capital structure, we are optimistic that a restructuring plan can 
be accomplished within 30 days,'' Motorola said in Iridium's 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the mobile phone maker also warned that its willingness  
to provide additional financial support to Iridium ``continues to 
depend on a substantial degree of participation in a financial 
restructuring by all other relevant parties with a significant 
financial interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the 30-day forecast may prove too optimistic with so many  
investors and so many creditors to satisfy, experts said the case 
needn't drag on for months and months. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have that much money and that much brain power at  
work, chances are you will find a solution,'' said Steve Towbin, a 
bankruptcy attorney at D'Ancona and Pflaum in Chicago. ``Nobody in 
a situation like this would want a liquidation,''

<HEADLINE> Group Raps Smithsonian Gourmet Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Humane Society of the United States has  
asked the Smithsonian Institution to cancel a program on foie gras, 
noting that production of the French delicacy requires forced 
feeding of ducks and geese. 
</P>
<P>
	``These animals are tortured to produce the abnormally large and  
fatty livers, and no reasonable institution should abet this 
unmistakable inhumane treatment of animals,'' David Kuemmerle, the 
society's manager for farm animals, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its museums, the Smithsonian operates Smithsonian  
Associates, which organizes lectures and other functions for paying 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The program ``Foie Gras: A Gourmet's Passion'' is scheduled for  
Sept. 21., priced at $25 for members and $30 for non-members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Following the talk, sample several small specially prepared  
foie gras hors d'oeuvres along with a glass of wine,'' the 
announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mara Mayor, director of the associates' programs, told the  
Humane Society that the programs try to reach the broadest possible 
number of people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are constantly searching for subjects that are new to our  
members,'' she wrote to Paul G. Irwin, president of the Humane 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor added that she was also interested in opinions of other  
groups, but she said nothing about canceling the program in 
response to the complaint.

<HEADLINE> Kia Motors Recalls U.S. Sedans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Kia Motors is recalling more than 32,000 sedans  
because of a flaw in fuel system hoses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea-based company has been notifying consumers since  
mid-July that the fuel vapor hoses in its 1996 and 1997 Sephias 
could leak and must be replaced, said Tim McCurdy, manager of 
quality assurance for the company's U.S. division. 
</P>
<P>
	The flaw will be repaired at no cost to consumers. It will cost  
the company an estimated $75 per each vehicle to correct the 
problem through its network of 530 dealers nationwide, McCurdy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kia was notified of the problem last month by the California Air  
Resources Board, which found problems with the hose during a 
routine test.

<HEADLINE> Marine Jailed for Refusing Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. (AP) -- A Marine helicopter crew chief has  
been sentenced to 30 days in confinement and issued a bad conduct 
discharge for refusing to take the anthrax vaccination required for 
all military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pvt. Eric Myers, 20, of Elbert, Colo., also was ordered to  
forfeit $400 in pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stood up for myself and my health,'' Myers said after  
Thursday's hearing. ``I think that's a right people have regardless 
if they are in the military.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All 2.4 million active duty and reserve troops are required to  
get the anthrax vaccine as protection against biological warfare. 
The Pentagon says more than 40 people have reported adverse effects 
to the vaccine, but all have recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	During the hearing, Myers took the unusual move and entered a  
conditional guilty plea, allowing his attorneys to appeal a 
pretrial decision by a military judge who rejected Myers' efforts 
to argue that the vaccine was unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	If Myers wins the appeal, he can withdraw his guilty plea and be  
granted a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers' lawyer, Maj. Jeff Nagel, said the pretrial ruling last  
month gutted the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no defense,'' Nagel said. ``It became a case of  
explaining that it was a moral conviction (by Myers).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor called Myers' refusal insubordination.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of discipline,'' Capt. Breven Parsons. ``We  
don't get to pick and choose our orders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a related case, the trial of Cpl. Abel Wenning, 22, of Cobb  
County, Ga., was scheduled to begin today. He also refused to be 
inoculated. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers and Wenning, who is a helicopter airframes mechanic, are  
both assigned to the 3rd Marine Air Wing.

<HEADLINE> Board of Ed Chided on Evolution Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Gov. Bill Graves and some legislators are  
talking about abolishing the State Board of Education or stripping 
it of authority because of its vote to de-emphasize the teaching of 
evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be an issue in the legislative session,''  
Graves, a moderate Republican, said Friday of the board's 6-4 vote 
earlier this week. On Thursday, Graves said the decision was ``so 
out of sync with reality'' that it minimized the board's 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislators say the controversy over evolution could create  
support for changes that have been sought for years by lawmakers in 
both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably, the right wing did us a favor,'' said Senate  
President Dick Bond, also a moderate Republican. ``We ought to send 
them a thank-you note. Maybe we can get change now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The board adopted new testing standards Wednesday that play down  
the scientific importance of evolution, particularly the theory 
that humans descended from apes and other lower species. 
</P>
<P>
	Local school districts will continue to decide what subjects are  
taught in their classrooms, but critics and supporters of the new 
standards think they could influence some districts' lesson plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas Constitution gives the 10-member board the power to  
set education policy without legislative approval. The board, whose 
members are elected from districts, is so independent that it 
sometimes is called the state's fourth branch of government. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking power from the board, abolishing it or replacing it with  
a board appointed by the governor would require an amendment to the 
Kansas Constitution and approval of voters. Only the Legislature 
can submit proposed amendments to a vote, and it convenes in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussions about the Board of Education's power are not new in  
Kansas. Legislators have grumbled for years about its independence 
and submitted proposed amendments to the voters in 1974, 1986 and 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Each proposed amendment failed. Supporters of change argued the  
governor and Legislature should have more control over public 
schools, which account for half of the state's spending, but 
opponents prevailed by saying Kansans shouldn't give up their right 
to select board members. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the governor's comments, even some critics of the  
board's actions weren't sure they would advocate a change. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be too easy for me to be vindictive,'' said Harry  
McDonald, a science teacher at Blue Valley High School in the 
Kansas City suburbs. ``I'm not sure a political patronage position 
is the best way, either.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Head Plans To Restructure Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chief of the commission that shapes how  
Americans get telephone and TV services laid out a five-year 
restructuring plan for the agency Thursday so that it can better 
meet the fast-changing needs of the communications business. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft plan for reorganizing the Federal Communications  
Commission by Chairman Bill Kennard seeks to eliminate unnecessary 
rules in areas where competition has emerged and reorganize the FCC 
along functional rather than technological lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan comes at a time when some top GOP lawmakers who oversee  
the agency have sought to revamp its structure and mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard's proposal hinges on thriving competition in five years,  
enough to reduce the need for the FCC to regulate directly. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan ``will allow the FCC to enter the next century able to  
respond fully and quickly to emerging technologies and the 
inexorable movement from regulation to competition,'' Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is subject to revision and parts of it will require  
congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Several initiatives address the disintegration of boundaries  
between wire, wireless, satellite, broadcast and cable 
communications -- categories around which the FCC is currently 
grouped. 
</P>
<P>
	The new plan would reorganize the agency so that internal  
bureaus are grouped around functions such as licensing and 
competition, rather than by technology. Kennard's plan would 
consolidate enforcement and consumer information into two separate 
bureaus of the FCC, rather than having those functions spread 
across the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal also aims to streamline and speed up the FCC's  
services, for example by instituting agency-wide electronic filing 
and automated licensing systems. Reducing backlog and making 
greater use of alternative dispute resolution are other goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency would keep many of its existing priorities, such as  
protecting consumers from fraud and keeping phone rates affordable 
for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC officials said the plan would also make it faster and easier  
for consumers to interact with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Commerce  
Committee's telecommunications panel that has jurisdiction over the 
FCC, said the plan was good start. But he wants additional measures 
to refocus the 65-year-old agency on enforcement rather than 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is certainly a step in the right direction,'' he said.  
``It's also a growing recognition that the FCC, as presently 
structured, simply isn't working anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But reorganizing the agency isn't enough,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said his subcommittee will introduce legislation this fall to  
``rein in'' the FCC's authority in areas such as conditioning 
telecommunications mergers, mandating free air time for political 
candidates and establishing microradio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin argues that Congress should have a voice in such matters.  
</P>
<P>
	Public interest groups said the proposal is evidence the FCC can  
retain its core functions while transforming itself into a more 
efficient agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``This strikes me as a thoughtful and remarkably foresighted  
evaluation of how to usher America into the information age,'' said 
Andrew Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a public 
interest law firm.

<HEADLINE> Statoil Weighs Partial Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The board chairman of Norway's state-owned  
oil company on Friday recommended the operation be partly 
privatized and that it take over all or most of the agency that 
controls 40 percent of Norway's natural gas and oil reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendation was made by Ole Lund in a report to the  
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The reserves, controlled by an agency known by the initials  
SDOE, are estimated to be worth three to four times as much as 
Statoil itself. Putting the two operations together would create 
one of the world's largest oil groups behind the planned Exxon 
Mobil grouping, BP Amoco PLC and Royal Dutch Shell AG. 
</P>
<P>
	The company would control some 17 billion barrels of oil and  
gas, as compared to the top three, which each control about 20 
billion barrels of oil and gas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state would grow richer, and Statoil would become a more  
powerful and competitive company in the international oil market,'' 
Lund said at a news conference in Oslo where the recommendations 
were presented. 
</P>
<P>
	SDOE was created by the government in 1984 to fend off a  
potentially overwhelming Statoil dominance in the Norwegian 
economy. It is managed by Statoil on behalf of the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Lund recommended selling up to two-thirds of Statoil to private  
interests, but said the state should maintain a significant role in 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Lund would not specify how much of SDOE the board thinks should  
be transferred to Statoil, but the other Norwegian oil company, 
Norsk Hydro, is likely to recommend taking over parts of SDOE when 
it presents its report to the government in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The parliament is expected to make a decision on Statoil and  
SDOE in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway is the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi  
Arabia. Statoil currently produces 450,000 barrels of oil a day.

<HEADLINE> Inflation in Portugal Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Portugal's consumer price index was  
unchanged in July, the National Statistics Institute reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That left inflation at the consumer level rising at an  
annualized average rate of 2.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures were in line with analysts' forecast and reflect a  
general lack of inflationary pressures, with significant easing of 
prices since the start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said increases in the prices of transport and hotels,  
and dining out in July were offset by a drop in the prices of food 
products and nonalcoholic beverages, clothing and footwear, and 
telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal's CPI had increased 0.2 percent in June and 0.1 percent  
in May.

<HEADLINE> Oil Drilling Plans Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Interior Department on Friday suspended a  
deadline for approving or denying 36 of the 40 undeveloped oil 
drilling sites off the California coast to more closely study their 
impact on the environment and announced that the other four leases 
are ``basically dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the California Coastal Commission, Secretary  
Bruce Babbitt said his agency plans to take 90 days to more closely 
scrutinize the proposals. He said he shares the commission's 
concerns about the impact of drilling on marine life and marine 
sanctuaries, and how they address changes air and water quality 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're asking them to provide information on a lot of  
specifics, which are many of the same points the state raised in a 
letter sent to the secretary on Aug. 5,'' said Tim Ahern, 
department spokesman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerning the four leases not suspended, Ahern said:  
``Basically, they're dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal Commission Chairwoman Sara Wan said the Interior  
Department's decision indicates it is moving in the direction of 
granting the state the right to have more say in reviewing these 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the terminated sites are in the Santa Maria Basin near  
Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara County and are held by 
Bakersfield-based Aera Energy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've not had a chance to review the information from the  
department and we're not in a position to comment,'' said Susan 
Hersberger, Aera Energy spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth site, in the Gato Canyon area near El Capitan State  
Beach north of Santa Barbara and are owned by Samedan Oil Corp. of 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	``We received the letter and we're disappointed that they would  
terminate one of our leases,'' said Ron Heck, Samedan spokesman. 
``It's hard for us to understand the suspension. But we're going to 
comply with the request.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed Friday at a three-week  
high, after United States inflation data calmed fears of a sharp 
interest rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government said producer prices for July rose 0.2  
percent, sparking a surge in New York bond and equity markets. That 
prompted a rally in stock markets across Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	London's FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares closed up 1.5  
percent at 6245.1. Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index rose 1.8 percent to 
5,219.43 and the Paris CAC-40 index climbed 1.6 percent to 
4,434.28. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies rose 4.91  
points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 304.60, the highest since July 
22, when it closed at 306.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks were the best performers Friday, with  
a gain of 3.6 percent in the index. Pharmaceuticals followed gains 
in New York Thursday, sending the index up 2.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 297 companies in  
countries that joined the single currency, closed up 5.21 points at 
317.75. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index rose 70.13 points to 3,710.57,  
while the Dow Jones Stoxx 50 Index closed up 67.00 points at 
3,656.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Amsterdam was among the best performing markets, with a gain of  
2.0 percent in the AEX index to 564.44, with blue-chip banking 
shares leading the gains. ING shares closed at 50.40 euros, up 2.75 
euros, after the banking and insurance giant said it will buy the 
58.2 percent stake in Germany's BHF bank it doesn't already own. 
</P>
<P>
	German banks also rose with Commerzbank stealing the limelight  
as takeover fever gripped the sector. Shares of Commerzbank, which 
has recently been linked with BFG bank as a merger candidate, rose 
2.50 euros to 33.11 euros. BHF shares were nearly 30 percent higher 
by the market's close, up 10.05 euros to end the day at 44.25 
euros.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Clarifying Gay Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is seeking to bolster its ``don't  
ask, don't tell'' policy on gays in the military by requiring all 
troops to undergo periodic anti-harassment training and assigning 
investigations of homosexual activity to more senior leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcing the adjustments Friday, Defense Secretary William  
Cohen said the aim was to ensure that the practices and protections 
under the 5-year-old policy are ``clearly understood and fairly 
enforced'' throughout the ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Measured praise for the changes came from Michelle Benecke,  
co-director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, the 
leading advocacy group involving gays in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real issue is whether leaders will be committed at every  
level to stop anti-gay harassment,'' said Benecke, a former Army 
officer. She said the updated guidelines say nothing about limits 
on investigations or how commanders in the field should proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	The new guidelines come just weeks after the bludgeoning death  
of a soldier in his barracks at Fort Campbell, Ky., renewed focus 
on gay harassment. Pfc. Barry L. Winchell, 21, had been rumored to 
be gay, although neither the Army nor his family would comment on 
his sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't ask, don't tell'' allows gays to serve in the military  
as long as their sexual orientation is not revealed. It took effect 
in February 1994 after Congress balked at President Clinton's 
efforts to end the military's ban on homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Gay rights and civil rights groups say hostilities have risen  
since its adoption, and that soldiers who complain about being 
harassed are often subjected to questions about their sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv said the policy has worked  
overall, but ``improvements were needed'' in some areas and the new 
guidelines ``are intended to address those issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The updated guidelines continue a prohibition against inquiries  
into a service member's sexual orientation, while allowing 
discharge for homosexual conduct or for a ``propensity'' to engage 
in homosexual conduct. A service member's statement that he or she 
is gay is considered evidence of that propensity. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the policy, the military isn't supposed to investigate  
sexual orientation unless ``credible information'' surfaces about a 
person's homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines also prohibit investigators from soliciting  
information on sexual orientation from those who report they have 
been harassed or threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Service members should be able to report crimes and harassment  
free from fear of harm, reprisal or inappropriate or inadequate 
governmental response,'' Rudy de Leon, undersecretary of defense 
for personnel and readiness, said Friday in a memo to military 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	A new provision requires that the anti-harassment guidelines be  
``made part of training programs for law enforcement personnel, 
commanders and supervisors.'' And the guidelines are to be 
``incorporated into the required training that members of the armed 
forces receive upon entry into the armed forces and periodically 
thereafter,'' said a Pentagon statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Another change requires that investigations be conducted at  
higher levels in the military justice system, with input from 
``senior legal officers.'' That is a response to criticism that 
entry-level investigators or those lacking proper training had 
conducted many of the investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, any ``substantial investigation'' into whether a  
service member ``made a statement regarding his or her 
homosexuality for the purpose of seeking separation'' must be 
approved by the secretary of the relevant service. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 1,145 people were discharged from the armed forces  
for homosexuality, up from 997 in 1997, the Pentagon said. The 
number of discharges hit a low of 617 in 1994, the year the ``don't 
ask, don't tell'' policy took effect.

<HEADLINE> Power Outage Hits Downtown Chicago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Jim Kallas could probably smell the cost of the  
power outage that struck Chicago: freezers at the Roditys 
restaurant he manages were full of worthless lamb, cheese and other 
food. 
</P>
<P>
	Kallas figures he lost $10,000 during Wednesday's outage that  
cut short trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, shut down more 
than 2,900 businesses and sent thousands of office workers home 
early. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to send all our employees home without a day's work,''  
said Kallas, whose electricity was out for about 10 hours. ``What 
are you going to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Building Owners and Managers Association of Chicago said the  
outage resulted in an estimated $100 million in lost business. 
</P>
<P>
	Kallas said he hoped Commonwealth Edison would reimburse  
customers, as it did residents affected by blackouts during the 
grueling heat wave in July. 
</P>
<P>
	But Heather Fabain, a utility spokeswoman, reimbursements were  
unlikely. ``We don't feel that this is a comparable situation,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	ComEd officials blamed the problems on equipment failures  
Wednesday night and Thursday morning. Vice President Paul McCoy 
said cables leading from two big transformers failed at a 
substation, leaving 2,300 customers without electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility was later forced to shut down power for about 90  
minutes to another 670 business customers in a 30-block business 
district that includes the Board of Trade, the federal courthouse 
and many law firms after a transformer at another substation 
overheated. That transformer had been helping to keep up with 
demand at the defective station. 
</P>
<P>
	Power to all customers was restored by late Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Brian Kelly, a worker in a temp agency, was in his 13th-floor  
office across from the courthouse when the building went dark, 
forcing workers to feel their way down a stairwell. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of scary,'' Kelly said. ``It was so dark and it  
was chaotic trying to get our stuff before we had to get out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Trade suffered a ``tremendous disruption of  
trading.'' Officials closed the markets at 1 p.m., said board 
spokesman Bret Gallaway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last minutes of trading are often some of the busiest  
trading of the day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	ComEd provides power to more than 3.4 million customers across  
northern Illinois. The utility already is under fire for the July 
outage that affected about 100,000 customers. In 1995, outages 
contributed to the deaths of hundreds of people. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Richard M. Daley threatened a lawsuit against the utility,  
saying it has problems in its infrastructure and needs to start at 
``ground zero'' to fix itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like everybody, I'm upset and we expect the answers directly  
from ComEd,'' he said. ``We deserve answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Rowe, chief executive of ComEd's parent company, Unicom,  
called the utility's performance ``absolutely, totally 
unacceptable.'' He said a committee has been appointed to study the 
problems and recommend how to restructure the company.

<HEADLINE> Town Fined After Simon, Dylan Show </HEADLINE>

<P>
	MANSFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- The town has fined the Tweeter Center  
for the first time for shows going past the amphitheater's curfew. 
</P>
<P>
	The town fined the center about $5,300 because shows by Bob  
Dylan and Paul Simon ran up to 15 minutes beyond the 11 p.m. 
curfew. The July 22 and 23 concerts featured back-to-back 
performances by Simon and Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1998 agreement, the town can levy fines against the  
center if performances go past curfew. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Montgomery, the center's general manager, sent a letter of  
apology to Mansfield town selectmen on Wednesday, The Sun Chronicle 
of Attleboro reported Thursday.

<HEADLINE> India Urges Restraint From Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India says its military held back after  
Pakistani troops fired a missile at Indian aircraft flying near the 
border, and urged Pakistan to show similar restraint in the latest 
confrontation between the nuclear-armed rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions rose between the neighbors after Indian fighter jets  
shot down a Pakistani military aircraft Tuesday, killing all 16 
crew members. On Wednesday, Pakistan fired a surface-to-air missile 
that sailed short of Indian military helicopters flying journalists 
to the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
	India lodged a protest against the missile firing late Thursday.  
Responding to fears that tit-for-tat attacks could escalate out of 
control, it pressed Pakistan to ``exercise due restraint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	India insists that it shot down the plane Tuesday because it  
veered inside Indian territory, violating a 1991 agreement that 
requires combat aircraft to stay six miles away from the border. 
Pakistan said the plane was one mile inside Pakistan when it was 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want a dialogue with Pakistan, but these kinds of  
provocations are not conducive to the normalization of relations,'' 
Foreign Office spokesman Raminder Jassal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States urged both sides ``to avoid further loss of  
life and further escalation and heightening of tensions,'' State 
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Security Council also called on India and Pakistan ``to  
settle the problem through bilateral consultations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press in Islamabad, Foreign  
Minister Sartaj Aziz criticized India for violating the agreement 
as well -- but did not say that Pakistani aircraft had abided by it. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Pakistani aircraft violated Indian airspace, Aziz  
said, ``Suppose it did. ... How can a propeller plane like this 
threaten a jet?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan ``would certainly not like to initiate any (incidents)  
and we hope India won't,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	India's air force and western defenses were on high alert  
Thursday. In Islamabad, Aziz said his country had increased air 
patrols near the border and had put its army on alert. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, separatist militants attacked an army camp in India's  
northern Kashmir state before dawn today, killing two soldiers and 
losing two of their own men, the military said. Six Indian soldiers 
were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerrillas from the Lashkar-e-Taiba rebel group fired rockets at  
the camp in Berwa, 25 miles northwest of the state capital, 
Srinagar, and then led an assault with automatic weapons and hand 
grenades, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A man identifying himself as a spokesman for the Lashkar-e-Taiba  
rebels called The Associated Press in New Delhi from Pakistan and 
said his group had carried out the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	He claimed 18 Indian soldiers had been killed, and said the  
assault was in retaliation for Tuesday's downing of the Pakistani 
plane. His claim and his identity could not be independently 
verified. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of Islamic separatist groups are fighting in Kashmir, the  
only state in Hindu-majority India that is mostly Muslim. India 
accuses neighboring rival Pakistan of arming and financing the 
insurgency, a charge Pakistan denies. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan have fought three wars during the last 50  
years and came close to a fourth during an 11-week-long conflict in 
Kashmir earlier this year. The fighting began after hundreds of 
Pakistan-based Islamic guerrillas occupied Himalayan peaks along 
the frontier.

<HEADLINE> Spiderman Sentenced to 30 More Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The burglar known as Spiderman, who  
was sentenced to 20 years in prison this week in Miami, received 
another 30 years Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Derrick James, 34, was sentenced in Circuit Court for the  
burglary of a Hallandale condominium. The 30-year sentence will run 
consecutively to the Miami term. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty years here, 30 years there -- the sentence doesn't reach  
the crime,'' the bearded, balding James, shackled and wearing a red 
prison jumpsuit, told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe the former Army paratrooper stole $6 million in  
cash, jewelry and credit cards in more than 130 high-rise 
burglaries in South Florida. Police called him Spiderman because he 
used his agility and upper-body strength to climb quickly from one 
balcony to the next without ropes or hooks. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sentenced Monday in Miami to 20 years in prison for  
stealing $5,000 in cash and property from a seventh-floor bayside 
condominium. 
</P>
<P>
	James' attorney said she would appeal his convictions.

<HEADLINE> Reds' Avery Played With Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Now that he's on the mend, Cincinnati Reds  
starter Steve Avery admits that there's been something wrong with 
him all season. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery had surgery Aug. 5 to repair a tear in the underside of  
his rotator cuff, remove a bone spur and repair his labrum. The 
left-hander won't be able to throw a ball again for three to four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't surprised by what doctors found in the shoulder.  
</P>
<P>
	``I knew something was (wrong) in there, but I've just been  
throwing with it for a while,'' Avery said Friday. ``This year it 
just got a little worse and harder to deal with, so it was time to 
do something. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I started pitching the way I did my last two starts, you  
realize you're not doing the team any good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avery, 29, signed with the Reds as a free agent last Dec. 11  
after two seasons with Boston. He was the Reds' most consistent 
pitcher early in the season, even though he was giving up a lot of 
walks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of surprised by it,'' Avery said. ``I didn't really  
feel 100 percent. I think maybe it was the first time around the 
league and they didn't know what to expect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 19 starts overall, Avery went 6-7 with a 5.16 ERA, walking 78  
in 96 innings. The sore shoulder prevented him from having good 
workouts between starts, something that took a toll as the season 
went along. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, the game wasn't the problem. It was the four days  
in-between,'' he said. ``I had a hard time preparing for my starts 
and that's where you get your strength and build your confidence 
with your location.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He expects to be fully recovered next season. The question is  
where he'll wind up. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery had a $500,000 salary this season. There's a mutual option  
for another year at $3 million, but the Reds can buy it out for $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery wouldn't be surprised if the Reds decided to buy out the  
final year of his contract, making him a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd hope to come back,'' Avery said. ``I like it here. They've  
treated me well. But if they choose not to bring me back, that's 
fine, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'll have any trouble finding a place to pitch,  
especially if I feel better.''

<P>
	The performance of General Re, the nation's largest reinsurer  
acquired by Berkshire in December 1998, and a lower underwriting 
profit from car insurer GEICO, were primary factors in the holding 
company's quarterly decline. 
</P>
<P>
	General Re's first-half earnings from operations, before  
accounting adjustments, were $293 million this year, compared to 
$517 million in 1998. General Re's decline in earnings was 
primarily due to significant underwriting losses this year compared 
to near-breakeven underwriting results in the same period last 
year, Berkshire said. 
</P>
<P>
	GEICO generated a pre-tax underwriting profit of $20 million in  
the first half of 1999, compared to $154 million in 1998. That 
result was expected because of rate reductions taken in the past 
two years and increased marketing expenditures. GEICO's business 
continues to accelerate in all categories of auto insurance, 
Berkshire said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Berkshire's earnings come from insurance, though the  
company also holds stock in companies including Coca-Cola and the 
Washington Post. Berkshire cautions that investment gains or losses 
for any given period have no predictive value. 
</P>
<P>
	Berkshire's first half earnings were $1.1 billion, or $733  
million per class-A share, compared to $1.8 billion, or $1,529 per 
share in the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Berkshire announced its earnings after financial markets had  
closed Friday. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares 
fell $505 to $66,100.

<HEADLINE> Fast End to Indonesia Probe Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund urged a quick  
resolution Friday of an Indonesian investigation of a banking 
scandal to avoid a loss of investor confidence at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also said an international auditing firm should be  
brought in to confirm the investigation's findings. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal involves an alleged $70 million payment from  
recently nationalized PT Bank Bali to a private company controlled 
by Setya Novanto, deputy treasurer of President B.J. Habibie's 
ruling Golkar party. 
</P>
<P>
	Novanto says he did nothing illegal. Both Indonesia's finance  
minister and the chairman of the country's bank restructuring 
agency said the transaction was inappropriate and are 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	This scandal and another involving the country's largest and  
third-largest private banks have dampened hopes for economy 
recovery. The country's currency the rupiah has fallen 10 percent 
this week, and share prices have fallen on the Jakarta stock 
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IMF is extremely concerned about recent reports alleging  
irregularities in a transaction involving the IBRA, Bank Indonesia 
and a private bank,'' an IMF spokesman said, reading an IMF 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBRA is the bank restructuring agency, Bank Indonesia the  
central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect the investigation to be concluded in a matter of  
days. We also fully support the appointment of an international 
auditing firm to validate the findings of the investigation,'' the 
statement said. ``Anything short of this will further damage 
domestic and international investor confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An IMF mission is due to return to Indonesia in September for a  
regular review of the country's economy and government policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The lending agency paid Indonesia $460 million at the beginning  
of August as part of $43 billion international rescue package 
promised in November 1997 when the country's economy collapsed. The 
next installment is due to be paid in October.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Clean House With Firings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Manager Phil Garner and general manager Sal  
Bando did their best to make winners out of the small-market, 
small-wallet Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	They failed, and both were removed from their jobs Thursday  
during their seventh straight losing season. The Brewers fired 
Garner and reassigned Bando within the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting coach Jim Lefebvre was appointed interim manager and  
will be on the bench when Milwaukee begins a seven-game road trip 
at Arizona tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	If the frustrations of playing the game at a financial  
disadvantage had begun to wear on them, neither Garner nor Bando 
showed it when they left their jobs. Garner called the firing 
``justified,'' and Bando said he asked team president Wendy 
Selig-Prieb to make both changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers are 52-60 and appear headed to another losing  
season. Bando, who has a close working and personal relationship 
with Selig-Prieb, was named special assistant to the team 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't play up to my expectations or their expectations,''  
Garner said. ``In this situation, I think it's deserved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garner wore a Harley-Davidson T-shirt and was typically upbeat  
when he met the media in the Brewers' clubhouse Thursday. He was 
reluctant to criticize the Brewers' penny-pinching ways and 
depleted farm system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those things are frustrating, but those aren't my jobs,  
either,'' Garner said. ``That's a problem that baseball has, not 
only for us, but for a lot of other teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lefebvre, the 10th manager in team history, was the only member  
of Garner's coaching staff with previous managerial experience. 
Lefebvre has spent ample time with mediocre clubs, compiling a 
395-414 record as manager of the Seattle Mariners from 1989-91 and 
the Chicago Cubs the following two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very sad day for me,'' Lefebvre said. ``Hopefully,  
somehow, some way, we can get this team to perform up to 
expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lefebvre, hired as the Brewers' batting coach last August during  
a shakeup of the coaching staff, was signed as manager only through 
the rest of the season and doesn't consider himself a candidate for 
the fulltime job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be here for seven weeks, and I'm going to do  
everything that I possibly can,'' he said. ``You all know the 
interim manager is usually the first one to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers, who went 4-8 on a 12-game homestand that ended  
Wednesday, reached .500 five times this season, but failed each 
time to get above the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three managers have longer tenures with their current clubs  
than Garner, who is both the winningest and losingest manager in 
team history. Only Connie Mack of the Philadelphia Athletics had 
survived with a team through more consecutive losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig-Prieb said she was confident about her overhaul of the  
team she took over last year from her father, baseball commissioner 
Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a results business, make no mistake about it,''  
Selig-Prieb said. ``This is not a complacent organization. We will 
not accept mediocrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bando and Garner, teammates with the Oakland Athletics, joined  
the Brewers together in October 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Bando, who played 16 seasons with the Athletics and the Brewers  
as a third baseman, co-owns a successful venture capital company in 
Milwaukee. He said he had no interest in pursuing other baseball 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no desire to be a general manager in the first place,''  
Bando said. ``It was something that just happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig-Prieb said she will hire a general manager and the GM will  
hire the next manager. She did not set any timetables. 
</P>
<P>
	Until a new GM is found, Selig-Prieb and assistant GM Fred  
Stanley will be responsible for the Brewers' baseball decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig-Prieb said rumors that former Brewers stars Paul Molitor  
and Robin Yount would be considered for the positions are 
premature. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's so far ahead of where I am in the process,'' she said.  
``I will move as quickly as I can, but speed is not my primary 
concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garner leaves with a 563-617 record. He was hired in October  
1991 with no previous managing experience, and was runner-up for 
the AL Manager of the Year award in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a 15-year playing career as an infielder for Oakland,  
Pittsburgh, Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. He retired in 
1988 and spent three years on Houston manager Art Howe's coaching 
staff before succeeding Tom Trebelhorn in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	With his outgoing personality and soft Texas drawl, Garner was a  
favorite among Brewers' fans, and he was active in charity concerns 
off the field. Garner had no sooner been let go than his name began 
to surface as a potential candidate for several new positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a job, people are very kind to you,'' Garner  
said when asked about his future. ``When you don't have a job, you 
call and nobody's in town.''

<HEADLINE> NAACP Tries Wooing All Races </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The NAACP is asking every member to go  
door-to-door and promote the civil rights group to at least 10 
neighbors as part of a nationwide effort to boost stagnant 
membership levels by enticing people of all races to join. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  
is calling it the ``Knock Across America'' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're selling this organization because it can be of benefit  
to everyone,'' said Sylvia Williams, who is the first national 
membership consultant hired by the NAACP. ``Every race belongs to 
this organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Membership of the nation's oldest and largest civil rights group  
has remained at about 500,000 in the last two years. Spokesman John 
White said the organization does not maintain figures on the racial 
composition of its membership. 
</P>
<P>
	Recruitment efforts have been ineffective because many of the  
2,200 local chapters do not accurately track their own members and 
are not connected to the Internet, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the $30 annual fee, members receive a bimonthly magazine on  
civil rights and the right to participate in local branch 
activities, including elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Virginia and Alabama chapters began the door-to-door  
canvassing this month. Maryland chapters of the Baltimore-based 
organization will begin doing so in September. Money also will be 
set aside for TV and billboard ads, Ms. Williams said.

<HEADLINE> Chargers' Jones Sidelined 8 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego Chargers wide receiver Charlie Jones  
will likely be sidelined at least eight weeks after dislocating his 
left hip in Thursday's exhibition loss to the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial prognosis during the game called for Jones to miss  
six weeks, but a small fracture in the hip joint was discovered in 
an MRI on Friday, adding another two weeks to the recovery time, 
according to trainer James Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones may need to have a screw placed in the joint to stabilize  
it, depending on the outcome of more testing, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury occurred in the second quarter of the 31-24 loss.  
Jones, who was returning a punt, had one knee on the ground when he 
was hit from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a major force to get that joint out of the socket,''  
said Collins, calling it a freak injury. ``That's the strongest 
joint in the body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who had a team-high 699 yards on 46 catches last season,  
was making his only scheduled punt return of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very disappointing as far as helping Charlie come  
alive in the offense,'' Chargers coach Mike Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He missed some time in (offseason) mini-camp due to injury,''  
Riley said. ``We have an idea what (others) can do. But we're 
finding that out about Charlie. We know he's a playmaker who has a 
lot of ability. It sets up back in that process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley noted that Jones still fits in San Diego's plans as a punt  
returner, despite his injury. It's a role that the fourth-year pro 
has hoped to add this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our plan for him is that he can make that big play for us as a  
returner, but we still will not use him as a full-time returner,'' 
Riley said. ``If it's a good return situation, we'll stick him in 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers, who returned from Australia on Sunday following a  
loss to Denver in their exhibition opener, endured a series of 
injuries against the 49ers but only Jones is expected to miss an 
extended number of games. 
</P>
<P>
	Also injured were running back Natrone Means (right shoulder  
contusion), defensive tackle Jamal Williams (strained right 
hamstring), linebacker Lew Bush (right hip contusion), cornerback 
Terrance Shaw (sprained left wrist), linebacker Tracy Simien 
(strained right pectoral muscle) and quarterback Jim Harbaugh 
(bruised thigh). 
</P>
<P>
	``The next couple of days should help us out quite a bit,''  
Collins said of the team not having any practices. ``We've been 
going at it pretty good for the last two weeks. Hopefully, by the 
first part of next week, we should have most of those guys back out 
there.''

<HEADLINE>  Tennis Star Steffi Graf Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEIDELBERG, Germany (AP) -- When the fun stopped, Steffi Graf did  
what so many superstars have done in recent months. She said 
goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	After 22 Grand Slam singles titles, 107 tournament wins on the  
WTA Tour and a record 377 weeks as the No. 1 player in the world, 
Graf retired Friday from the sport she dominated for nearly two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	One of just five players to sweep the Grand Slam in a single  
year, she said she had ``nothing left to accomplish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not having fun anymore,'' Graf, fighting back tears, said  
at a news conference near her hometown of Bruehl. 
</P>
<P>
	Her announcement, foreshadowed by statements that she would not  
return to play Wimbledon or the French Open anymore, was the latest 
retirement this year by one of sports' dominant players. Graf 
followed the path taken by Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, John 
Elway, Barry Sanders and Boris Becker, another German whose rise to 
the top of men's tennis in the mid-1980s paralleled her own leap to 
stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	She had fought through numerous injuries in recent years and  
throughout her 17-year career, a tenure that also was plagued by 
off-court distractions. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't that the 30-year-old found it hard to keep up with  
today's generation of teen-age stars: Graf proved she still was a 
contender by beating Martina Hingis in this year's French Open and 
reaching the final at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was almost too easy to catch up to the top players again,''  
Graf said. ``I have nothing left to prove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the wins have been fewer and farther between in recent  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning three Grand Slam tournaments in 1996, Graf won  
only one tournament in 1997 and four more in 1998. The French Open 
was her only title this year and her first Grand Slam in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf said the decision to quit came two weeks ago as she was  
flying to a tournament in San Diego, where a thigh injury later 
caused her to pull out of her first-round match against American 
Amy Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out to be her last official appearance on tour.  
</P>
<P>
	``The weeks following Wimbledon weren't easy for me,'' Graf  
said. ``I was pulled back and forth, but when I made my decision I 
didn't think about it one minute afterward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also said her decision had nothing to do with injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm perfectly fit,'' Graf said.  
</P>
<P>
	Graf turned pro in 1982 at the age of 13, and even as a  
pigtailed teen-ager presented a stern and determined figure on the 
court -- a contrast to her modest, almost shy demeanor off-court. 
</P>
<P>
	She won her first tournament in April 1986, beating Chris Evert  
in Hilton Head. Graf beat Evert again 11 months later in Key 
Biscayne, becoming the youngest player to pass $1 million in 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf won her first Grand Slam title in June 1987, beating  
Martina Navratilova at the French Open, and in August of that year 
earned the No. 1 world ranking for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed ``Fraulein Forehand'' for her devastating trademark  
shot, Graf won more than $20 million during her career. In 1988, 
she won all four majors -- the Australian, French and U.S. opens, 
and Wimbledon -- and completed a ``Golden Slam'' with the women's 
singles title at the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, Margaret Court and Maureen Connolly are the only women to  
complete the slam. Rod Laver twice swept all four majors and Don 
Budge did it once. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf won Wimbledon seven times, the French Open six times, the  
U.S. Open five times and the Australian Open four times. 
</P>
<P>
	Her growing popularity was accompanied by personal setbacks,  
including her father spending 15 months in jail in 1997 and 1998 
for tax evasion on her tennis winnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early '90s, Graf met her match in the young Monica Seles.  
But Seles was stabbed by a deranged Graf fan during a tournament in 
1993 in Hamburg, interrupting her career for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf's injuries -- over 50 in all -- peaked in June 1997. She  
underwent knee surgery, and her career appeared to be over. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the 8 1/2-month layoff, Graf fought through several other  
injuries to reach the top again -- winning this year's French Open 
in a dramatic, emotional final against Hingis. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf said she plans a farewell tour of exhibition matches later  
this year, and will concentrate on her marketing company and 
developing young German talent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the first thing Graf plans to do is travel -- without a  
tennis racket. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the plane coming back from San Diego, I just started poring  
through these magazines and thinking of all the places I could 
go,'' Graf said, laughing.

<HEADLINE> Ind. Underreported Gun Expulsions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A federal survey of gun-related expulsions  
in the nation's schools understated Indiana's total by more than 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal report, released this week, recorded 62 expulsions  
in the state during the 1997-98 school year. But an analysis of 
Indiana Department of Education records by The Associated Press 
found the state's schools actually expelled 129 students for 
bringing guns, rifles and other firearms to school that year. 
</P>
<P>
	State education officials acknowledged they underreported the  
total because the information was due before they could finish 
reviewing data from all Indiana schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Education, however, defended the accuracy  
of its report, which indicated the number of students kicked out of 
schools for bringing weapons had dropped from 5,724 to 3,930 -- 
nearly a third less. There are about 52 million students in U.S. 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana was given two chances to confirm or change their figures  
in the spring and summer, but did not, said Department of Education 
spokeswoman Melinda Malico. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the federal agency has two signed confirmations from  
Indiana education officials, confirming that the state had 62 
gun-related expulsions in 1997-1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident that we have represented the figures as the  
states gave them to us, and we are confident we made every attempt 
to get correct figures from the states and to confirm them with 
them,'' Malico said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Davis, director of student services for the Indiana  
Department of Education, said the federal deadline fell in December 
-- long before state officials finished reviewing the data turned in 
by more than 1,600 state schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In Minnesota, education officials said the state only had 31  
gun-related expulsions in 1997-1998 rather than the 45 listed in 
the federal report. 
</P>
<P>
	Education officials in Idaho, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Texas  
and Nebraska confirmed the federal numbers matched their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah education authorities said the figures listed for their  
state are correct, but its drop from 80 to nine gun expulsions 
between 1996-97 and 1997-98 is misleading. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Utah included all weapons, not just guns, in its  
reporting for the 1996-1997 school year.

</P>
<P>
	Graf turned pro in 1982 at the age of 13, and even as a  
pigtailed teen-ager presented a stern and determined figure on the 
court -- a contrast to her modest, almost shy demeanor off-court. 
</P>
<P>
	She won her first tournament in April 1986, beating Chris Evert  
in Hilton Head. Graf beat Evert again 11 months later in Key 
Biscayne, becoming the youngest player to pass $1 million in 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf won her first Grand Slam title in June 1987, beating  
Martina Navratilova at the French Open, and in August of that year 
earned the No. 1 world ranking for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed ``Fraulein Forehand'' for her devastating trademark  
shot, Graf won more than $20 million during her career. In 1988, 
she won all four majors -- the Australian, French and U.S. opens, 
and Wimbledon -- and completed a ``Golden Slam'' with the women's 
singles title at the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, Margaret Court and Maureen Connolly are the only women to  
complete the slam. Rod Laver twice swept all four majors and Don 
Budge did it once. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf won Wimbledon seven times, the French Open six times, the  
U.S. Open five times and the Australian Open four times. 
</P>
<P>
	Her growing popularity was accompanied by personal setbacks,  
including her father spending 15 months in jail in 1997 and 1998 
for tax evasion on her tennis winnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early '90s, Graf met her match in the young Monica Seles.  
But Seles was stabbed by a deranged Graf fan during a tournament in 
1993 in Hamburg, interrupting her career for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf's injuries -- over 50 in all -- peaked in June 1997. She  
underwent knee surgery, and her career appeared to be over. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the 8 1/2-month layoff, Graf fought through several other  
injuries to reach the top again -- winning this year's French Open 
in a dramatic, emotional final against Hingis. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf said she plans a farewell tour of exhibition matches later  
this year, and will concentrate on her marketing company and 
developing young German talent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the first thing Graf plans to do is travel -- without a  
tennis racket. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the plane coming back from San Diego, I just started poring  
through these magazines and thinking of all the places I could 
go,'' Graf said, laughing.

<HEADLINE> Tennis Star Steffi Graf Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Steffi Graf is the fifth sports superstar to step away from  
competition this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf announced Friday that she was calling it quits, joining  
Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, John Elway and Barry Sanders as 
athletes who retired in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all retired at the same time,'' two-time U.S. Open  
champion Tracy Austin said. ``What are they doing to us?'' 
</P>
<P>
	All Graf did was dominate her sport while earning a women's  
record $21,839,777, along with 22 Grand Slam tournament singles 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have done everything I wanted to do in tennis,'' the  
30-year-old Graf said in Heidelberg, Germany. ``It is time to 
stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bart McGuire, the WTA Tour's chief executive officer, said, Graf  
``has been a role model for women athletes in all sports. She has 
been a catalyst for the resurgence of women's tennis, especially in 
Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Steffi is a class act,'' McGuire said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can kind of sympathize with what she's going through because  
when you're at the top, it is not easy to maintain it,'' Pete 
Sampras, the top-ranked men's player, said. ``She had an 
unbelievable career, did it with a lot of class. 
</P>
<P>
	``She went out and got the job done and made the racket do the  
talking. I have always looked up to her, the way she approached the 
game. She worked very hard and is a great athlete. But she has 
nothing to be ashamed of after winning 22 Grand Slams. That is not 
easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras has been No. 1 in the world rankings for 272 weeks in  
his career, a record for men. Graf was No. 1 377 weeks, a women's 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	The nimble footwork and big forehand changed women's tennis,  
although Graf, unlike many other young players, was not an 
overnight success. She didn't win her first Grand Slam tournament 
title until 1987, when she surprised Martina Navratilova in the 
final of the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was so disciplined. She was always focused, always trying  
100 percent,'' Austin said. ``Just very professional about her job 
and her work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Agassi, the third-ranked man, said Graf's retirement ``is  
certainly a loss for tennis because in my opinion she is the best 
lady that has ever played, dominated on every surface. And on the 
other side of it, there is a sense of happiness for the next 
chapter of her life, which I am sure she is looking forward to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, Graf played her first WTA Tour match in Filderstadt,  
Germany. The 13-year-old participated in the draw and pulled 
Austin's name as her first-round opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was this kid who hit the ball so hard I couldn't believe  
it,'' Austin remembered Friday. ``It was 4-all in the first set and 
she was painting the lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austin won the next 10 games, but knew she had seen the future  
of women's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew she was going to be a very, very good player,'' Austin  
said. ``She had a huge, huge forehand and she moved like a deer out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario played Graf in seven Grand Slam  
tournament finals, winning the 1989 French Open and the 1994 U.S. 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been a great player, a great champion, a good person and  
a friend,'' Sanchez-Vicario said in Manhattan Beach, Calif., where 
she is playing in the Acura Classic. ``No one can replace Steffi. 
It's kind of hard to think she isn't going to be there anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsay Davenport, the Wimbledon champion and the defending U.S.  
Open champion, thought Graf would wait before retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really expecting her to kind of end her career at the  
U.S. Open, so it is a little bit of a surprise,'' she said. ``What 
I thought was really great was the older she got and the more she 
was winning, probably in the mid-'90s, the happier it seemed to 
make her. When she was playing in the '80s and just dominating, she 
never looked that happy and I think she really learned to 
appreciate the game the older she got and more she played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billie Jean King called Graf ``the all-time great singles player  
in women's tennis.''	   ``I'm glad that she is able to retire on her own terms and hope 
that she will keep some involvement and commitment to our sport the 
rest of her life,'' King said. ``We will miss her great athletic 
ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austin, whose career was shortened by a back injury, said she  
wasn't surprised by Graf's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great loss for women's tennis, but I love the fact that  
she's doing it on her terms because after all of these injuries 
she's had, it's great that she's not going out because of an 
injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Pierce, whose lone Grand Slam tournament title came at the  
1995 Australian Open, was surprised at the retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm happy for her that she feels at peace,'' Pierce said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon semifinalist Alexandra Stevenson said Graf's  
retirement ``gives me goose bumps. Also, knowing I will never have 
the privilege of playing against her makes me sad. But I will 
memorize her graceful and courageous run at the 1999 French Open. 
Steffi Graf was always my measure of greatness.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Challenges Gore on Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Sen. Bill Bradley is challenging Vice  
President Al Gore to make clear just where he stands on the issue 
of federal funding for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who is Gore's only opponent for the 2000 Democratic  
presidential nomination, issued the challenge Thursday following 
seemingly conflicting statements on abortion by Gore's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is time for him to answer what his position is,''  
Bradley said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``On this 
issue in particular you've got to say what you believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lehane tried to clarify Gore's position  
when asked about the vice president's position on federal funding 
for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehane said Gore's position has been to support the current  
federal law -- ``federal funding of abortion in situations involving 
incest, rape and when the life of the mother is endangered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was later asked if Gore favored Medicaid funding for poor  
women's abortions without the restrictions in the current law. 
``The vice president supports federal funding for abortions, 
period,'' Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bradley campaign, however, released a series of statements  
by Gore, both as a congressman and senator, showing he was opposed 
to federal funding for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have consistently opposed federal funding of abortion,''  
Gore said in a newspaper story in 1984. ``I believe the government 
should not participate in the taking of what is arguably a human 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Gore's change of positions since he was in Congress -- as  
Bradley's campaign alleged -- Lehane said that the important issue 
is only his current position. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue shouldn't be what his position was a decade ago,''  
Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Associates say Gore has shifted to the point that he now favors  
no restrictions on federal funding for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore addressed the issue himself at a campaign stop in Iowa, but  
without giving any details. 
</P>
<P>
	``I support federal funding, if that's what you're asking,''  
Gore said in response to a question shouted by a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bradley challenge was prompted by a story in Sunday's Des  
Moines Register in which a Gore spokesman said the vice president 
was against federal funding for abortion except in cases of rape, 
incest, or the need to save the life of the mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Roger Salazar retracted that statement and said he had  
inaccurately depicted Gore's position, and that the vice president 
opposes restrictions on abortion funding. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides say President Clinton, during the 1992  
campaign, said he would not veto any bill that allowed for the 
Medicaid funding of abortions, and they said he has not addressed 
that exact question since. 
</P>
<P>
	National Abortion Rights Action League president Kate Michelman  
said Gore's position on federal funding for abortion has 
``evolved'' over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said that she is confident that Gore's position mirrors  
her group's, and that he is in favor of Medicaid funding for poor 
women's abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have confidence that the vice president does support  
Medicaid funding for abortion for poor women,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelman said regardless of differences between the two  
Democrats, they are still far better choices than any of the 
Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue here,'' Michelman said, ``is that Gore and Bradley  
both would protect the right of a woman to choose.''

<HEADLINE>  Candidates Pushing Hard in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- In a feverish burst leading to the  
weekend straw poll the campaigns have buses criss-crossing the 
state and their phone banks are buzzing -- in some cases with the 
candidates taking their own calls. 
</P>
<P>
	While aides say her phones have been hot for weeks, former  
Cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole joins in today, manning her 
campaign headquarters for personal pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	The upcoming Iowa straw poll on Saturday is being portrayed as a  
turning point in the fight for the Republican presidential 
nomination -- and the candidates are responding in kind. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes has bought up last-minute television ads and Lamar  
Alexander has campaigned in virtually every corner of Iowa in the 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	George Bush arrived in Davenport Thursday night to begin a  
weekend of campaigning for straw poll votes, adding a special plea 
to his well-worn stump speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saturday is a pretty important test. So I'm here not only to  
share what's in my heart and tell you why I'm running, I'm hear to 
ask you to come to Ames. It's important,'' Bush told about 600 
supporters at a rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush met with about 500 Hispanics in Davenport today and urged  
them to vote in Saturday's straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of you never may never have participated in the  
Republican caucuses. It's important that you participate, important 
that you come,'' said Bush, opening his first full day of 
campaigning for Saturday's contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollsters say polling for Iowa's political events is tough  
because it is hard to identify the population that will show up for 
the caucus and the straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	One poll taken for several television stations of likely caucus  
attendees showed Bush with almost a 3-1 lead over Forbes and 
another taken by a Maryland firm called Research 2000 showed Bush 
and Forbes in a dead heat. The other candidates were grouped 
together behind Bush and Forbes in both polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all of the Republican rivals have built substantial  
organizational efforts for the straw poll. Only Arizona Sen. John 
McCain is absent, calling the straw poll a ``scam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not a cheap deal. Bush admits to spending $750,000, and  
accuses Forbes of spending $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not discussing budgets,'' said Forbes aide Bill Dal Col.  
``This is a test along the way to February. This is a check to see 
who can deliver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Forbes bus has been rumbling around the state for nearly two  
months, all pointing to Saturday night. He has bought a half-hour 
of television time Friday evening to air a campaign commercial 
featuring prominent social conservatives, a group he's worked 
overtime to court. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans for a live debate at WOI-TV studios the night before the  
GOP straw poll were canceled Thursday after just three candidates -- 
Alexander, commentator Pat Buchanan and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah -- 
agreed to appear. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the work is pure drudgery, the kind of nuts-and-bolts  
work that goes on in campaign boiler rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has been running phone banks, both from campaign  
headquarters in Des Moines and from his campaign bus, leaving 
nothing to chance. 
</P>
<P>
	For Bush, the phone banks are searching for ``team leaders,''  
folks who agree to bring along nine others to the straw poll and 
collect a special reward. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's technique is to find ``ticket captains,'' valued  
backers who volunteer to show up at the straw poll and bring along 
10 friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets are $25 apiece, largely provided by the campaigns.  
People have to be from Iowa and they get one vote each. The 
Republican Party has not said how many they've sold, but say the 
tickets are still selling. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander has worked his way through a brutal, 21-day grind that  
took him to every corner of the state. He admits only to ``low 
six-figure'' spending, but his campaign has focused almost 
exclusively on the straw poll all summer 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is running a low-budget operation, but his campaign  
office is filled every night with volunteers making phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative activist Gary Bauer has been working hard on a  
church-based network, working night and day to lure social 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all of the Republican contenders were buzzing around  
the state Thursday, most focusing on the just-opened Iowa State 
Fair. Bauer headed to a cattle exhibit, while former Vice President 
Dan Quayle sought support at a pork exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there is the logistical headache of getting supporters to  
Ames for the straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've leased approximately 100 buses,'' said Woolson. ``Our  
strategy has been more of an organizational strategy as opposed to 
those campaigns that are spending money on television and radio.''

<HEADLINE> Padres Honor Gwynn in Ceremony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Tony Gwynn, who reached the 3,000-hit milestone  
last week at Montreal, was honored in a ceremony before Friday 
night's game against Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, appearing at Qualcomm Stadium for the first time since  
getting his 3,000th hit against Montreal's Dan Smith, received four 
standing ovations, including one that lasted 2 1/2 minutes when he was 
introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the highlights of the 55-minute ceremony was the unveiling  
of a banner with a picture of Gwynn and the number 3,000. It joined 
banners of 21 other members of the 3,000-hit club that have hung 
since early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn went 1-for-4 with an RBI single in the eighth inning for  
career hit 3,008, moving him into 20th place past Al Kaline. The 
Padres lost 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres plan to hang a banner Saturday to honor Wade Boggs,  
who collected his 3,000th hit Sunday at Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn also presented to Hall of Fame officials his bat, batting  
helmet, pants and shoes he used when he collected hit No. 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all of the living members of the 3,000-hit club  
congratulated Gwynn via video clips, including Hall of Famer Ted 
Williams, the former Boston Red Sox great who has enjoyed a close 
relationship with Gwynn in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Entertainers Bill Cosby and Jay Leno, and broadcasters Vin  
Scully and Dick Enberg were also among those who sent 
congratulations to Gwynn by video clips. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are really excited,'' Gwynn said at a news conference  
before the game. ``I'm really excited. But as a player, I've got to 
turn the page and move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn thanked his family, including his wife, Alicia, who  
presented Gwynn with a 3,000-hit leather jacket, and Padres fans 
for their support during his 18-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	A replay of Gwynn's 3,000th hit was shown on the video monitors  
to the cheers of a crowd, estimated to be 50,000 by club officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The start of the game was delayed by 39 minutes because of the  
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``What time is this game supposed to start?'' Gwynn quipped near  
the end.

	Plans for a live debate at WOI-TV studios the night before the  
GOP straw poll were canceled Thursday after just three candidates -- 
Alexander, commentator Pat Buchanan and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah -- 
agreed to appear. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the work is pure drudgery, the kind of nuts-and-bolts  
work that goes on in campaign boiler rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has been running phone banks, both from campaign  
headquarters in Des Moines and from his campaign bus, leaving 
nothing to chance. 
</P>
<P>
	For Bush, the phone banks are searching for ``team leaders,''  
folks who agree to bring along nine others to the straw poll and 
collect a special reward. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's technique is to find ``ticket captains,'' valued  
backers who volunteer to show up at the straw poll and bring along 
10 friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets are $25 apiece, largely provided by the campaigns.  
People have to be from Iowa and they get one vote each. The 
Republican Party has not said how many they've sold, but say the 
tickets are still selling. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander has worked his way through a brutal, 21-day grind that  
took him to every corner of the state. He admits only to ``low 
six-figure'' spending, but his campaign has focused almost 
exclusively on the straw poll all summer 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is running a low-budget operation, but his campaign  
office is filled every night with volunteers making phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative activist Gary Bauer has been working hard on a  
church-based network, working night and day to lure social 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all of the Republican contenders were buzzing around  
the state Thursday, most focusing on the just-opened Iowa State 
Fair. Bauer headed to a cattle exhibit, while former Vice President 
Dan Quayle sought support at a pork exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there is the logistical headache of getting supporters to  
Ames for the straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've leased approximately 100 buses,'' said Woolson. ``Our  
strategy has been more of an organizational strategy as opposed to 
those campaigns that are spending money on television and radio.''

<HEADLINE> X-Files' Duchovny Suing Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- ``The X-Files'' star David Duchovny  
is suing the show's producer, 20th Century Fox Film Corp., claiming 
Fox gave its own stations sweetheart deals on ``X-Files'' reruns. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed Thursday in Superior Court, claims Fox breached  
Duchovny's contract and paid ``X-Files'' creator Chris Carter more 
than $34 million and promised him a new series to keep him quiet 
about the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit did not specify damages.  
</P>
<P>
	Fox sold the series to its own broadcast network, Fox  
Broadcasting Co., and its own cable network, FX Cable Network. 
Syndication rights were sold to its own group of stations, Fox 
Television Stations. The lawsuit contends that Fox should have sold 
the series to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox said in a news release that it would not comment. A message  
left at Carter's office Friday was not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> 15 Arrested in Prostitution Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Nine people were arrested in what the FBI and  
local police say was a family-run prostitution ring that snared at 
least 50 young women and girls from across the Midwest, some as 
young as 14. 
</P>
<P>
	After a two-year investigation, authorities on Thursday unsealed  
a 44-count federal indictment accusing 12 members of the 
Minneapolis-based ``Evans family,'' and three associates, of crimes 
ranging from money laundering to illegal transport of minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents described a 17-year-old family-run organization with  
influence in 24 states and Ontario, Canada. Five people people 
remained at large on Friday; police seized five homes and six 
luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment said five brothers and seven nephews worked in  
the Evans ``family business,'' ranging in age from their early 50s 
to a 20-year-old nephew. 
</P>
<P>
	``They grew up seeing that's how their father made money,'' said  
Andrew Schmidt, a city police detective who helped in the 
investigation. The organization started to unravel when two young 
prostitutes were arrested with fake identification in Maryland 
Heights, Mo., in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say since 1982 the organizers had recruited girls  
mostly between 14 and 18 years old, mostly from Minnesota and 
Wisconsin, and employed them under fake names in escort services 
and massage parlors nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The women ``serviced three to 10 clients, referred to as  
'tricks,' a day, seven days a week,'' the FBI said, earning between 
$2,000 and $15,000 a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization started to unravel when two young prostitutes  
were arrested with fake identification in Maryland Heights, Mo., in 
1997. Within two months, the FBI was asked to help.

<HEADLINE> 15 Accused in Prostitution Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- For years, a prostitution ring lured girls and  
young women from across the Midwest into a life of illicit 
servitude and forced them to remain there with beatings, torture 
and rapes, the FBI says. 
</P>
<P>
	After a two-year investigation, authorities on Thursday unsealed  
a 44-count federal indictment accusing 15 members of the 
Minneapolis-based ``Evans family'' of crimes ranging from money 
laundering to illegal transport of minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine people were arrested Thursday and six remain at large, said  
William Eubanks of the FBI's St. Louis office. Police also seized 
five homes and six luxury cars, including three Mercedes Benz. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1982, members of the ring -- eight of whom are related --  
allegedly enticed girls as young as 14 to work for massage parlors 
and escort services, the FBI said. The girls were often runaways 
from the Midwest, though some came from regular homes, authorities 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``family'' would force the girls into road trips to 23 other  
states and Canada, earning an estimated $1 million annually for the 
ring, said Detective Joe Delia of the Maryland Heights, Mo. police, 
which helped the FBI break the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is as close to modern slavery as you can get,'' Delia  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation began in 1997 when police became suspicious  
after stopping two prostitutes near St. Louis, authorities said. 
Within two months, the FBI was asked to help. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges were filed here because the ring was discovered in  
the St. Louis area. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have identified at least 50 women involved in the  
operation over the past 17 years, including 27 involved as minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Most were lured into the ring at shopping centers and dance  
clubs, seduced by initially kind treatment only to be later 
submitted to beatings, torture and rape, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Evanses would place ads for girls (to be) exotic dancers  
or lingerie models and go anywhere young kids hung out,'' said 
police Sgt. Andy Schmidt. Later, he said, ``they would also shame 
them into staying, telling them that their families would never 
take them back because of what they did. It was almost like a 
cult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some escaped after a few weeks, but others remained in the ring  
for up to seven years, Eubanks said. 
</P>
<P>
	One 15-year-old prostitute told an investigator: ``I'd rather be  
dead than doing what I'm doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the family used cell phones and pagers to keep  
track of the prostitutes. One girl told police she took her pager 
to middle school. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were very skilled at picking them up when they were most  
vulnerable,'' Minneapolis police Detective Andy Schmidt said. 
``It's kind of like a cult, they break them down. It's 
brain-washing.''

<HEADLINE> County Fairs Affected by Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CENTREVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Fourteen-year-old Kim Brown swirled a  
moist paper towel along the ebony-colored fur lining the inner ear 
of her sheep. Then she wiped the top of the animal's head to make 
it look shiny and pert for the afternoon sheep show at the Queen 
Anne's County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim would have liked to clean her sheep from hoof to tail with a  
garden hose, the way she did several times a day last year. But 
this summer she's using damp wash rags as often as she can. 
</P>
<P>
	The devastating Eastern drought, which led Maryland's governor  
to demand that residents conserve water, is making its presence 
felt at this summer's traditional county fairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Animal bathing isn't the only traditional practice being  
restricted -- water-balloon fights are gone, water rides are being 
reconsidered and beverage vendors have been asked to save their 
melted ice for plants. 
</P>
<P>
	At the weeklong Garrett County Fair in western Maryland, manager  
Ralph Miller allows animal baths only on show day and picture day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just use a three-gallon bucket and a brush,'' Miller said.  
``You save a lot of water that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Less frequent washing means livestock competing in shows need to  
be kept especially clean. David Butler, whose 200-pound yearling 
ewe was named the grand champion sheep for fitting and showing in 
Garrett County, said he protects his animal from dust by wrapping 
her in a canvas blanket. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Queen Anne's County Fair, which draws nearly 3,000  
visitors a day and ends Saturday, Kim shared another animal hygiene 
tip: ``We keep them in so they don't get dirty as often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Signs posted throughout the 4-H Park urge water conservation.  
</P>
<P>
	The worsening drought has cost Maryland farmers $72 million in  
lost corn, soybeans, hay and tobacco, the state Department of 
Agriculture said Thursday, and the effects are evident in the 
vegetable and crop categories at county fair contests. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardeners displayed less produce than usual at the Carroll  
County Fair, and farmers were discouraged from competing for prizes 
because of stunted field crops, county 4-H secretary Mary Ellen 
Arbaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fair organizers are cutting other water corners as well.  
</P>
<P>
	The fair in Frederick County won't begin until Sept. 17.  
However, planners are re-examining whether to allow a carnival ride 
that drops people in fake logs down a water slide. 
</P>
<P>
	Fair organizers in Carroll and Queen Anne's counties have  
canceled the end-of-the-fair water balloon battles in which 
livestock farmers traditionally engage their crop-growing cousins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of disappointed that we won't have it,'' said Mike  
Handleman, 14, as he gingerly sprayed his cow with water. ``But I 
can understand why we can't.''

<HEADLINE> Attorney Killed Near N.M. Courthouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- An attorney known for handling child  
neglect and abuse cases was shot to death today as he walked to a 
court session involving the death of a newborn. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Vigil was killed in a drive-by shooting just yards away  
from the Steve Herrera Judicial Complex, said Audra Montoya, 
criminal court clerk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just down the street. You can see it from our doors.  
They have it all taped off,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vigil, 52, was heading to state District Judge T. Glenn  
Ellington's court when shots rang out 
</P>
<P>
	Ellington said Vigil's first scheduled court appearance was for  
an arraignment for Michelle Blevin, 23. She was charged with murder 
in the death of her newborn baby, a girl whose body was found 
floating in a toilet in February. Vigil was her attorney. A second 
case was sentencing in a driving-while-intoxicated case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm stunned,'' said Ellington, who described Vigil as a  
personal friend. ``He was not abrasive or someone who would bring 
out strong emotions. ... He was a calming, kind individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses saw a mint-green Ford pickup truck with a loud  
muffler, driven by a man who appeared to be in his 20s, leave the 
area. ``That's what we're looking for,'' police Sgt. Gilbert C' de 
Baca said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vigil's body was lying on the sidewalk a half block from the  
courthouse entrance. Police stood around the body, and courthouse 
workers and attorneys stood in small groups nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm devastated for Carlos, for his widow and for the whole  
legal community,'' said Richard Shapiro, a fellow lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if this was somebody who had a grudge against  
lawyers or whether it was somebody that was out to get Carlos 
Vigil. It doesn't matter to me. I've lost a friend,'' said Shapiro, 
who was in the courthouse when the shooting happened. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his work as a private attorney, Vigil served part  
time as an attorney for Rio Arriba County, primarily handling 
personnel matters, said Tomas Campos, assistant county manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Campos said he was meeting with other county officials when he  
heard that Vigil had been shot. ``We couldn't continue our meeting, 
we were so upset,'' Campos said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Soars 184.26 to 10,973.65 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared Friday as a new government report  
suggested inflation remains in check, raising hopes that the 
Federal Reserve need not be aggressive in raising interest rates to 
cool off the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 184.26 points to close at  
10,973.65, a gain of 1.7 percent. For the week, the blue-chip index 
gained 259.62 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also sharply higher. The Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 rose 29.52 to 1,327.68, and the Nasdaq composite index 
rose 88.32 to 2,637.81. 
</P>
<P>
	Defying any fears of bad luck on Friday the 13th, stocks rose  
following a Labor Department report of a modest rise in the 
Producer Price Index, a measure of inflation pressure before it 
reaches the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices at the wholesale level rose a less-than-expected 0.2  
percent in July, the Labor Department said. Yields on the new 
30-year Treasury bonds auctioned Thursday fell to 6.10 percent from 
6.19 percent before the figures were released. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the trigger for the rally,'' said Ricky Harrington,  
technical analyst at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. ``The 
market had a very understandable, predictable reaction to good 
news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have been nervous for weeks about the likelihood that  
Fed policy-makers will raise interest rates for a second time this 
summer when they meet Aug. 24. There also are fears of a third rate 
increase this fall if the economy shows signs of overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	The small advance in wholesale prices reported Friday, if  
matched at the consumer level, could ease concerns somewhat at the 
Fed about a potential breakout of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will hold to the view that the Fed will tighten,'' said  
Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. But 
he said various components of the survey indicated that inflation 
may never make its way to U.S. consumers, and should mollify the 
Fed. 
</P>
<P>
	The brighter outlook on interest rates powered a strong rally,  
especially in the technology and financial services sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the Dow industrials were American Express, up 4 15/16 at  
134 11/16, and J.P. Morgan, up 6 1/4 at 133 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Nasdaq, Microsoft rose 2 15/16 to 84 11/16 and Intel  
advanced 3 13/16 to 79 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently battered Internet stocks also gained, with search  
engine Yahoo rising 4 7/16 to 132 13/16 and online auction firm 
eBay rising 6 5/8 to 98 on Nasdaq. America Online rose 4 1/8 to 96 7/8 on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Those companies have faltered in recent weeks under the threat  
of higher rates. Investors buy those shares on the promise of 
strong future growth, and higher rates reduce the value of future 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington said Wall Street will remain intensely focused on any  
possible signs of inflation in the days leading up to the Fed's 
next meeting. Next week, the government will release its Consumer 
Price Index, another barometer of inflationary pressures. Bad news, 
he said, could stop the market's run. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is very sensitive to all this data,'' he said.  
``Market psychology can change in a minute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
NYSE. Composite volume totaled 829.85 million shares, compared with 
887.90 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 10.75 to 621.38, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.09 to 783.74. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.23 to 434.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.07 percent.  
European indexes gained ground following the release of the U.S. 
inflation data. Germany's DAX index percent rose 1.8 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 1.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 
1.6 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Texaco Cut 2,500 Jobs, Not 1,400 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Texaco Inc., which announced last year  
that it was cutting 1,400 jobs to trim costs, revealed Friday that 
it had actually cut 2,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokeswoman Kelly McAndrew said she could not specify  
the job cuts by location except to say they included domestic as 
well as overseas positions and about 150 were at company 
headquarters in White Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the workers have already left Texaco's employ, she said,  
and the last 100 or so will be gone by the end of next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco said last year that the job cuts would help it remain  
profitable as oil prices plunged to their lowest levels in two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing a $286 million profit for this year's second  
quarter, Texaco chairman Peter Bijur noted that a rise in the 
benchmark price for crude oil signaled higher earnings ahead.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Wife Seeks Woman's Account </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- In a move that may lead to an embarrassing  
court fight for Newt Gingrich, divorce lawyers for his estranged 
wife have won permission to question a woman with whom the former 
House speaker has been romantically linked. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old former Georgia congressman, who espoused family  
values during his campaigns, has reportedly for years been seeing 
Callista Bisek, 33, an aide to the House Agriculture Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Daily News of New York and the New York Post quoted  
sources in Friday's editions who said the pair has been spotted 
together often in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb County Superior Court Judge Dorothy Robinson signed an  
order Thursday that allows attorneys for Marianne Gingrich to take 
a videotaped deposition from Ms. Bisek in Arlington, Va., where she 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	No date for the deposition has been set and Mrs. Gingrich's  
lawyer, John C. Mayoue, declined to say what questions he plans to 
ask. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you that she thought that they had a very sound  
marriage, right up until this unexpected demand for divorce,'' 
Mayoue said Friday. ``And I can also tell you that Marianne is 
prepared to thoroughly investigate Mr. Gingrich's personal life as 
well as his business activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayoue said it's too early to say what financial settlement Mrs.  
Gingrich might seek from the former speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich separated from his wife May 10 and filed for a divorce  
July 29. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney, Randolph Evans, said he hadn't seen the judge's  
order and could not comment on the reports that Gingrich had been 
seeing Ms. Bisek before separating from his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get into all of that because it just doesn't serve any  
useful purpose,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich's personal spokesman, Mike Shields, declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The Gingriches were married Aug. 8, 1981. Reports of trouble  
between the two surfaced in 1989, when the couple told The 
Washington Post they didn't know if their marriage would last. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich said his ``habit of dominance'' contributed to their  
problems, adding that he'd found ``frightening pieces that related 
to ... my own life'' in the book ``Men Who Hate Women and the Women 
Who Love Them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second failed marriage for Gingrich, who married his  
former high school geometry teacher, Jackie Battley, when he was 
18. They had two daughters during their 19-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Within months of their divorce, Gingrich married Marianne  
Ginther, a county planner and business consultant from Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The architect of the Republican revolution in the House,  
Gingrich served as speaker from 1995 until the end of last year, 
when he gave up his seat in Congress after the Republicans' 
disappointing showing in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Gingrich was asked about reports that he'd had  
extramarital affairs while running for Congress on a family values 
platform in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the 1970s, things happened -- period. That's the most I'll  
ever say,'' he said. ``I start with an assumption that all human 
beings sin. So all I'll say is that I've led a human life.''

<HEADLINE> Kournikova Withdraws Due to Foot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Anna Kournikova of Russia, the 12th-ranked  
women's player in the world, withdrew Friday from the du Maurier 
Open tennis championships, which starts Monday, because of a minor 
stress fracture in her right foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Kournikova injured her foot while practicing Friday and will  
likely be out for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Kournikova, who lost to Conchita Martinez of Spain in the third  
round of last year's du Maurier Open in Montreal, is to be replaced 
in the main singles draw by Cristina Torrens-Valero of Spain.

	Wholesale Prices Rise in July  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices at the wholesale level rose a modest  
0.2 percent in July as a huge jump in energy prices overwhelmed a 
sharp drop in food costs, the Labor Department said today. The 
increase in the Producer Price Index, which measures inflation 
pressures before they reach the consumer, matched the 0.2 percent 
rise in May. July's increase was slightly better than expected with 
many analysts had been anticipating that prices would rise 0.3 
percent in July. But many analysts and investors remain concerned 
that the Federal Reserve wants to raise interest rates, sensing 
rising wage pressures in the tight job market.

	L.A. Suspect Scouted Jewish Institutions  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Suspected gunman Buford Furrow reportedly  
told investigators he did not intend to shoot children at the 
Jewish community center. The Los Angeles Times today says he told 
investigators the three children ``got in the way'' as he tried to 
shoot a 68-year-old receptionist and a teen-age counselor. The 
newspaper says Furrow scouted three prominent Jewish institutions, 
but found security too tight. Flags are flying at half-staff today 
in Southern California in honor of murdered letter carrier Joseph 
Ileto. Prosecutors say Furrow has admitted to shooting Ileto 
because he was not white and worked for the government.

	Disabled Man Requests Death

	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Prosecutors say they won't oppose a  
severely disabled man's request to unplug the hospital ventilator 
that has kept him alive since 1967, when he broke his neck in a 
high school gymnasium. Under New York law, patients can opt to 
discontinue lifesaving treatment. Bill White is believed to be one 
of America's longest surviving quadriplegics on a ventilator. In 32 
years, he has rarely left his hospital bed. Monroe County District 
Attorney Howard Relin's office concluded yesterday that White ``has 
the right to refuse treatment.'' Ending White's treatment is likely 
to end his life within minutes.

	AMBON, Indonesia (AP) -- Government security forces overwhelmed  
by recent east Indonesian religious rioting that has left at least 
94 people dead denied today that troops gunned down rioters inside 
a church. In the eastern Maluku province, witnesses said the death 
toll from clashes between Muslims and Christians include 24 people 
shot by troops in and around a Protestant church in Galala, a 
suburb of the provincial capital of Ambon. Those shootings were 
Tuesday and Wednesday. Church secretary Benny Tamaela said he saw 
security forces shooting at battling mobs armed with homemade 
spears, bows and arrows and gasoline bombs.

	Italy Accuses Coke in Antitrust Case  
</P>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italian authorities have accused Coca-Cola Co. of  
abusing its dominant market position through questionable trade 
practices, according to a preliminary report released today. The 
report alleges Coke offered discounts to retailers who displayed 
its products more prominently than those of competitors. It also 
says the company allegedly discriminated against wholesalers who 
refused to displace competitors' products. In July, European Union 
officials raided Coke's offices in Austria, Denmark, Germany and 
Great Britain as part of an inquiry into the company's marketing 
practices.

	HEIDELBERG, Germany (AP) -- Steffi Graf, one of just five players  
to complete the tennis Grand Slam in one year and a dominating 
force for more than a decade, retired from the sport today, saying 
her ``motivation wasn't what it was in the past.'' Even though her 
career has been marked by a series of injuries, she said those had 
nothing to do with her decision. ``Right now, I'm perfectly fit,'' 
Graf said. ``This is no way about injuries.'' In her latest 
comeback, the 30-year-old Graf stunned top-ranked Martina Hingis to 
win the French Open. She then lost in the Wimbledon final to 
Lindsay Davenport.

an accommodating Medinah Country Club today, shooting a 6-under 30 
on the front nine to move into contention in the second round of 
the PGA Championship. Kendall, who has never won on the PGA Tour, 
also birdied the 10th hole to get 7-under for the day and was two 
strokes behind first-round leader Sergio Garcia. Garcia was 1-under 
through three holes as Medinah's No. 3 course served notice it 
would not be too challenging to par today.

	Yeltsin Seeks Approval of Premier  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin said today that the  
communist-dominated lower house of parliament wouldn't dare 
opposing his new choice for prime minister. Yeltsin abruptly sacked 
Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin and named Vladimir Putin, a former 
KGB spy, as his successor on Monday -- the fourth Cabinet reshuffle 
in 17 months. ``It would be preferable if (Putin) is approved on 
the first attempt,'' Yeltsin said at the start of a meeting in the 
Kremlin with Alexander Kotenkov, his envoy to the lower house, the 
State Duma.

	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey and Iran agreed today to cooperate  
more in fighting Kurdish rebels, but failed to come to a deal on 
the very issues that have recently strained their relations. Iran 
refused to assure Turkey it would expel Kurdish rebels from Iran, 
where Ankara claims the rebels have bases. And Turkey refused to

according to published reports. The New York Times and the 
Washington Post reported today that while the warning could be 
saber rattling or psychological warfare aimed at Taiwan, the 
administration believes the threats could be real. Unidentified 
administration officials told the Times that Washington has warned 
Beijing that any military action would force the United States to 
retaliate.

the pilot to death in the cockpit. Yuji Nishizawa is accused of 
commandeering the All Nippon Airways jet just after takeoff from 
Tokyo's Haneda Airport on July 23. He allegedly killed the pilot 
for refusing to let him fly the plane. None of the 503 passengers 
and 13 other crew members was hurt. Nishizawa was subdued after his 
brawl with the pilot and arrested when the plane returned to Tokyo.

	Clinton: Mideast Peace Deal Possible

the Palestinians could be reality within three weeks, President 
Clinton says. Clinton is hoping that Congress will approve the $1.2 
billion in special aid for Israel and $400 million for the 
Palestinian Authority that the House and Senate so far have omitted 
from foreign aid legislation. Clinton made these two points at a 
90-minute meeting yesterday with some 30 American Jewish leaders at 
the White House, a participant, Malcolm Hoenlein, said afterward. 
It was based on the proposition that Israel should seek security by 
relinquishing territory to the Arabs in exchange for promises of 
peace.

victory over top-ranked Martina Hingis to win the French Open this 
summer. She then lost in the Wimbledon final to Lindsay Davenport.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stolen animation cells of the Grinch showed up  
for auction on the eBay Web site and two teen-age clerks at an art 
gallery were arrested Friday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web service cooperated with the investigation, which  
involved a detective posing as a buyer and offering $1,500 for the 
image of the Dr. Seuss character creeping toward a Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
	Morales Stroud, 18, and Angela Rodriguez, 20, both of New York,  
were arrested on charges of grand larceny and criminal possession 
of stolen property. They could be sentenced to up to 15 years in 
prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested the couple after arranging to pay the winning  
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The cells were among $100,000 worth of stolen animated images  
reported missing from the gallery, which police didn't identify. 
Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, Batman and Garfield were included. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at eBay told police it was the first time anyone was  
arrested on charges of stealing artwork offered for sale on the 
giant auction site, said Lt. Chris Malinowski, commanding officer 
of the police force's 4-year-old Computer Crimes Unit.

<HEADLINE> Steelers Gain TD Via Instant Replay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Steelers used instant replay to  
gain a touchdown in Friday's exhibition game against Chicago when 
coach Bill Cowher successfully challenged an out-of-bounds call on 
an end zone fumble. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala of the Steelers blocked Todd Sauerbrun's  
punt into the Bears' end zone, where Hines Ward fell on the ball 
just before it reached the end line. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials initially ruled that Ward slid out of bounds as he  
recovered the ball, a safety. Referee Johnny Grier reversed the 
call after watching a replay on a TV monitor set up behind the 
Steelers' bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than leading 9-7, the Steelers went ahead 14-7 on Ward's  
touchdown with 3:51 left in the first quarter, his second of the 
quarter. He scored earlier on a 45-yard touchdown catch. 
</P>
<P>
	Instant replay returned to the NFL in March with a system that  
allows coaches to challenge two calls per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Replay was in effect from 1986 until 1991, but was voted out in  
1992, in large part because it was delaying games. 
</P>
<P>
	The old system used a replay official who could stop the game on  
a questionable call and make the decision. In the new system, the 
replay official can challenge calls only in the final two minutes 
of each half and in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The plays covered by replay are like those in the old system --  
goal-line and sideline plays and possession -- and do not apply to 
penalties.

<HEADLINE> Report: BNP Gains Control of Paribas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French banking group Banque Nationale de Paris has  
won control of the Paribas bank and up to 42 percent of Societe 
Generale, a French newspaper reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The daily Le Figaro said that according to preliminary results  
of rival tender offers that closed Friday, Paribas shareholders 
pledged between 58 percent and 60 percent of the investment bank's 
shares to BNP and about 32 percent to Societe Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 percent of Paribas stockholders opted to keep their  
shares, the newspaper said, citing unnamed sources. 
</P>
<P>
	French banking authorities are expected to intervene in the  
takeover battle if BNP ends up with less than 50 percent of Societe 
Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	A merger of the three banks would create the world's first $1  
trillion bank in terms of assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The bidding war has pitted BNP against Societe Generale, which  
both aimed to create a global banking giant. 
</P>
<P>
	It began last March, when BNP trumped a friendly merger between  
Societe Generale and Paribas, offering $37 billion for the two 
banks. Societe Generale and Paribas rejected BNP's surprise offer 
and have spurned its advances since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale shareholders tendered between 36 and 42 percent  
of the company's shares to BNP, which would give BNP control of 
between 30 and 35 percent of the voting rights in Societe Generale, 
Le Figaro said. 
</P>
<P>
	French stock market authorities weren't immediately available to  
comment on the report. The three banks also have declined comment 
until the French stock market regulator, Conseil des Marches 
Financiers, announces official results Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Angels' Erstad Placed on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Anaheim Angels, decimated by injuries all  
season, placed outfielder Darin Erstad on the 15-day disabled list 
Friday with a strained ligament in his right knee. The move is 
retroactive to Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Erstad injured himself Tuesday against Cleveland and was  
scratched from the Angels' lineup the next night when pain 
persisted. 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI Thursday showed abnormalities in the lateral collateral  
ligament, and he was put on the disabled list after another 
examination Friday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Erstad was batting .246 with 10 home runs and 37 RBIs in 111  
games. He is the 16th player placed on the disabled list by the 
Angels this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The club recalled infielder Andy Sheets from Triple-A Edmonton  
to take Erstad's spot on the roster. Sheets joined the team in time 
for Friday night's game at Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Colts' Bennett To Make Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Cornelius Bennett will finally be cheered in  
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett was the Colts' first pick in the 1987 draft. But he  
never signed, and forced a trade to Buffalo. Now, having signed 
with Indianapolis in the off-season, he will make his debut with 
the Colts, 12 years belated, against Cincinnati Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a little strange, after nine years and four  
Super Bowls with Buffalo. Coming in, they always booed every time 
my name was called, which was a lot,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, a five-time Pro Bowl selection who played in his fifth  
Super Bowl with Atlanta last year, hasn't forgotten the 
Indianapolis fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always heard them. It's a badge of honor really that they  
remember me and boo. It will be fun for those fans to have their 
fun and cheer for me now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett had arthroscopic surgery on the left knee following the  
Super Bowl and has been working himself slowly into shape. He's 
missed some drills and has not participated in twice-a-day workouts 
with his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett didn't play last week when the Colts opened their  
exhibition schedule in a 9-6 loss at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The knee is coming along fine and I know that I'll be ready  
when it counts,'' he said. ``I think I'm as fast as I need to be 
out here with these young guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts' defense ranked 29th among the league's 30 teams in  
nearly every statistic last season. They are looking to the 
6-foot-3, 240-pound linebacker for leadership on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is just keeping him healthy and getting him out  
there on the field,'' said second-year quarterback Peyton Manning. 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of the defensive guys have already talked about just  
what his presence can do for a defense. He's been there before, 
played in a lot of big games, most obviously the five Super 
Bowls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett expects to play only a few series against Cincinnati.  
The Colts are saving him for the season opener Sept. 12 at home 
against Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Colts and Bengals are expected to play without their  
first-round draft picks. Indianapolis didn't sign running back 
Edgerrin James until Thursday and the Bengals haven't reached an 
agreement with quarterback Akili Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals are also missing veteran wide receiver Carl Pickens,  
who has been designated the team's franchise player. Pickens, 29, 
has said he will sit out a season and forego a year's pay -- about 
$3.5 million -- rather than play for the Bengals again.

<HEADLINE> Pipe Sanction Request Clears Hurdle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department can consider punitive  
tariffs on foreign steel pipes used by oil and natural gas 
producers, a U.S. panel ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission found evidence that  
shipments of seamless pipes from Japan, the Czech Republic, 
Romania, South Africa and Mexico have or could hurt the U.S. steel 
industry, which blames low-priced imports for thousands of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary 6-0 ruling clears the way for Commerce to  
determine whether producers in those countries engaged in illegal 
pricing. If the department finds illegal pricing, the commission 
will make a final injury ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Tariffs could lead to higher prices for pipes bought by oil and  
gas companies, which are struggling themselves because of dwindling 
prices. Several months would pass before any tariffs would be 
imposed, but steel users say the impact could be felt sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market adjusts to a preliminary ruling as if it were a  
final ruling,'' said Brian Petty, senior vice president for 
government affairs with the International Association of Drilling 
Contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department finds illegal pricing in almost every  
case it considers, although sometimes not to the extent alleged by 
the U.S. industry involved. The commission makes a final injury 
ruling that allows imposition of tariffs in only about half the 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry, proceeding with trade complaints that  
target about a half-dozen product lines, already won tariffs on 
Japanese shipments of the core product, hot-rolled carbon steel. 
The hot-rolled case has contributed to recent reductions in import 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is some companies don't make that much hot-rolled  
steel, so these (other) cases have a big impact on them,'' said 
Greg Mastel, program director for international trade studies at 
the Center for National Policy, a Washington think tank. ``Also, 
some countries don't make as much hot-rolled as other products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Imports surged last year in the wake of the Asian financial  
crisis, which reduced demand for steel abroad and prompted foreign 
producers to unload goods in U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest case was filed by the United Steelworkers of America  
and five companies, including U.S. Steel Group and its joint 
venture with Kobe Steel of Japan. The industry charged that the 
foreign producers sold their products in the United States at 
prices below production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	While the industry won tariffs on Japanese hot-rolled shipments,  
the U.S. government reached separate deals last month to let Russia 
and Brazil avoid tariffs by voluntarily curbing steel shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the commission closed out the Russian and Brazilian  
cases by determining the illegal pricing involved caused actual or 
threatened injury.

<HEADLINE> 'Voices' Play Not Scary Enough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sometimes a scare isn't enough.  
</P>
<P>
	There are several spooky moments in ``Voices in the Dark,'' a  
convoluted thriller by John Pielmeier that arrived Thursday at 
Broadway's Longacre Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	But audiences are more likely to scratch their heads than shiver  
at Pielmeier's tortured tale of a radio talk show therapist trapped 
in an isolated mountain cabin and tormented by an unseen maniac, 
who chats with her on the phone. This guy, who has electronically 
altered his voice, wants to do more than talk. He has murder on his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem with ``Voices in the Dark'' is not that it doesn't  
work as a thriller. It doesn't work as a play. Peppered with purple 
dialogue and outdated psychobabble, ``Voices'' collapses on itself 
as it rushes toward a preordained face-off between hunter and prey. 
</P>
<P>
	Our heroine, Lil, has come up to the Adirondacks to repair her  
faltering marriage with a philandering hubby. The helpmate never 
makes it to the cabin because of the snow. Lil has enough visitors 
to keep her busy, though. There's Owen, the local simpleton whose 
crush on the woman manifests itself in odd ways. And Blue, Owen's 
best buddy, another local yokel whose strange personality radiates 
a sinister ambiguity. 
</P>
<P>
	Pielmeier pads the play -- probably to confuse the audience. For  
example, he brings in Lil's broadcast producer who urges her to 
take a more high-profile job on television where cameras will show 
the desperate people who dial in for help. 
</P>
<P>
	The evening opens with Lil on the air. Her radio program is  
prophetically called ``Last Resort'' -- and she is seen and heard 
counseling a victim of child abuse. Voices play big roles in this 
show and credit sound designer T. Richard Fitzgerald that they work 
as effectively as they do. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Christopher Ashley pushes things at a furious pace,  
which is wise, not allowing theatergoers time to think about the 
impossibilities of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	The play's beleaguered heroine is portrayed by a game Judith  
Ivey, one of the theater's most likable actresses. Ivey has an 
ingratiating stage personality. She also has a sense of humor which 
fitfully comes through here, despite some of the raunchy talk that 
always seems to center on sex. 
</P>
<P>
	The other performers are even more prisoners of the plot. Peter  
Bartlett is wasted as the campy radio producer, while Raphael 
Sbarge plays the childlike Owen with convincing naturalness. John 
Ahlin turns in an unnerving performance as the irritating Blue, and 
Zach Grenier manages to be particularly obnoxious as an aggressive 
policeman. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Act 2 finale, Ivey tussles effectively with her assailant  
(don't worry -- the identity will not be revealed here). By then the 
lights have gone out in the cabin and the battle takes place in 
semi-darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	Fight director B.H. Barry stages some pretty effective and  
violent fisticuffs. No wonder Ivey thanks her Pilates instructor 
and personal trainer in the theater program. 
</P>
<P>
	The rustic log cabin setting, designed by David Gallo and Lauren  
Helpern, is splendid -- complete with a Jacuzzi and a collection of 
deer heads that includes ``Bambi's father,'' according to one of 
the characters. It looks like the kind of place where one could 
actually have a fun vacation and get away from plays like ``Voices 
in the Dark.''

<HEADLINE> Wholesale Prices Rise in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices at the wholesale level rose a modest  
0.2 percent in July as a huge jump in energy prices overwhelmed a 
sharp drop in food costs, the Labor Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in the Producer Price Index, which measures  
inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, matched the 0.2 
percent rise in May. Wholesale prices had actually fallen 0.1 
percent in June, only the second decline this year. 
</P>
<P>
	July's increase was slightly better than expected. Many analysts  
had been anticipating that prices would rise 0.3 percent in July. 
Financial markets liked the good news on inflation. The bond market 
staged an immediate rally, pushing the yield down on Treasury's 
30-year bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The moderate advance in wholesale prices, if matched at the  
consumer level, could ease concerns somewhat at the Federal Reserve 
about a potential breakout of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many analysts and investors are still worried that the  
central bank will raise interest rates for a second time this year 
on Aug. 24. Their fear is that the economy is still growing too 
strongly and could spark inflation down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Commerce Department said today that  
the level of inventories held by businesses on shelves and backlots 
rose 0.3 percent in June, but sales climbed at an even faster 0.9 
percent pace. 
</P>
<P>
	That brought the inventory-to-sales ratio to 1.34, meaning it  
would take 1.34 months to exhaust inventories at the June sales 
pace. Analysts see the current inventory level as posing no threat 
that businesses will be forced to cut back production to work off 
unwanted supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, wholesale prices have been rising at an annual  
rate of 1.7 percent, compared to no change for all of 1998. The 
pickup in this year's wholesale prices is coming from big increases 
in energy costs, which had been falling for much of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	For July, energy costs rose 3.4 percent, led by a hefty 12.7  
percent increase in gasoline prices, an advance that motorists felt 
at the pumps last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The July gain in gasoline prices was the largest since a 26  
percent surge in April, which helped push overall wholesale prices 
up by 0.5 percent in April, the biggest increase this year. That 
gain plus an even sharper rise in consumer prices in April put the 
Fed on inflation alert and led to a June 30 increase in a key Fed 
interest rate, the first hike in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices had reached their highest point in more than 18  
months in July partly because of production cuts by the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, as well as a pickup 
in demand from recovering economies in Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	But a nationwide check of gasoline stations by the Lundberg  
Survey has shown a slowing in the rate of price increases at the 
pump in the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3.4 percent rise in energy costs in July was partially  
offset by a 0.9 percent drop in food prices. Beef prices, which had 
risen sharply in June, declined by 3.4 percent in July, the biggest 
one-month drop since February 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Vegetable prices also were down a sharp 8.1 percent in July, led  
by steep declines in the price of cauliflower, broccoli, tomatoes, 
and green peppers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fruit prices also were down, declining 3.2 percent as the price  
of blueberries, nectarines, melons and peaches all fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, wholesales  
prices were unchanged in July, after having fallen 0.2 percent in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of food and energy, inflation was kept in check by a 0.2  
percent drop in the price of new cars.

<HEADLINE> Irwin Always a Factor at Medinah  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Jack Nicklaus has Augusta National. Hale  
Irwin has Medinah. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA Championship may represent the strongest field ever  
assembled for a major, but the 54-year-old Irwin looked like he was 
enjoying another banner day on the Senior PGA Tour on Friday by 
working himself into contention after two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the kind of course that I think elicits out of me my best  
golf,'' Irwin said after a 3-under 69, putting him at 139 going 
into the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Every time Medinah Country Club holds a major championship,  
Irwin seems to be around the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine years ago, he became the oldest U.S. Open champion when he  
beat Mike Donald in a 19-hole playoff at Medinah. And in the 1975 
U.S. Open at Medinah, Irwin missed the playoff by one stroke and 
finished in a tie for third. He probably would have been a factor 
in the 1949 U.S. Open, but he was only 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had success here,'' Irwin said. ``It's not as if I don't  
know the golf course. It's not as if this is a bad venue for me -- 
just the opposite. I feel comfortable playing the golf course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gallery flocked to see Sergio Garcia, the teen-age  
sensation, try to build his lead in the PGA Championship. They 
wound up cheering for a senior citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, you're not 50,'' someone yelled from the gallery after  
Irwin saved par from the bunker on No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	This caused Irwin to stop in his tracks, look back and smile.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're right,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Irwin's play for 36 holes is reminiscent of what Nicklaus did at  
Augusta National in 1998, when the six-time Masters champion made a 
Sunday charge and tied for sixth. At 58, Nicklaus became the oldest 
player to finish in the top 10 in the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Medinah hasn't held enough majors to give Irwin that level of  
comfort and confidence, but even the gallery that swelled to 
four-deep by the end of his round sense something magical watching 
him turn back the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't look in the mirror and see gray hair, and you can't  
look in the mirror and see a kid with freckles,'' Irwin said. ``You 
don't pay attention to how old they are. They are players in the 
field who are trying to beat you. And if you feel as if you're 
going to be beaten by these players, you will be beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't like to think that way.''  
</P>
<P>
	He never has. Irwin, who already has won five tournaments and  
$1.5 million on the senior tour, has been playing without the 
pressure he feels on the 50-and-over circuit to be at the top of 
every tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, ``I didn't come here to be the token old fellow,''  
said Irwin, who received a special exemption to play this PGA 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	His age may show off the tee. Garcia and Phil Mickelson were  
hitting 7-irons while Irwin had to pull a 4-iron to reach the same 
green. But he hit them well, and had just as many birdie 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether he can keep it up, not even Irwin knows. The oldest  
player to win a major championship was Julius Boros, who won the 
PGA Championship in 1968 at age 48. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I can continue playing as I have been,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Irwin has been playing so well, he was even asked whether Ben  
Crenshaw might consider him for the Ryder Cup team should be win 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we going to get paid?'' Irwin cracked. He quickly added,  
``I'd pay to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin would give anything for two more rounds at Medinah. If  
not, there's always the 2006 PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin will be 61, but the PGA of America might consider  
extending him another exemption. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, it will be played at Medinah.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Victim, Father Face Fights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- When Richard Castaldo was shot eight  
times and critically wounded in the Columbine rampage, his father 
jumped on a plane and flew 1,500 miles to be at his bedside. 
</P>
<P>
	But as he tended to his now paralyzed son, Rick Castaldo learned  
that he had his own battle to fight -- against Hodgkin's disease, a 
form of cancer that attacks the lymph nodes. 
</P>
<P>
	Castaldo could have become overwhelmed by the one-two punch of  
the tragedies. Instead, he came up with a plan: He gave up his job, 
moved to Colorado from his Manassas, Va. home, and began 
chemotherapy here so he could support his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have the time to be sick,'' the 45-year-old said as he  
and a cousin poured concrete at his new home, which he is making 
wheelchair-accessible for his son. ``The worst thing you can do is 
sit around and mope about your misfortune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was about lunchtime on April 20 when Richard, 17, was sitting  
outside Columbine with classmate Rachel Scott. 
</P>
<P>
	Seniors Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, both heavily  
armed, turned a corner and opened fire, killing Miss Scott and 
hitting Richard eight times. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard played dead, lying in a pool of his own blood while the  
gunmen strode into the school. They eventually killed a dozen 
students and a teacher and wounded at least 23 before they 
committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Castaldo watched the tragedy unfold on CNN from Virginia, hoping  
to get a glance of his son, while Richard's mother, in Littleton, 
went to the scene. When he learned Richard was among those shot, he 
rushed to Denver to see his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing he asked was how long I was going to stay,''  
he said. ``I said, `As long as you want.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Only six days before the younger Castaldo was wounded, his  
father had surgery to remove swollen lymph nodes. While he was 
tending to Richard, Castaldo got the news that he had Hodgkin's, a 
neoplastic disease characterized by enlargement of the lymph nodes, 
spleen and liver. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his diagnosis, Castaldo isn't feeling sorry for himself.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anything I have to go through is a minor inconvenience  
compared to him,'' Castaldo said of his son. ``Just imagine. You 
can't do even the simplest thing like tie your shoe. You look at 
your legs but you can't move your feet. And still he has this 
amazing attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past four months, father and son have settled into a  
routine. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard remains at Craig Hospital, where he is learning to  
adjust to life without the use of his legs. The floppy-haired, 
quiet teen-ager spends six hours to eight hours a day at pool 
therapy, wheelchair classes and even driving lessons. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the only victim of the tragedy still hospitalized. He is  
scheduled to be released next Friday, four days after classes 
resume at Columbine. He plans, at least initially, to move in with 
his dad and return to Columbine so he can graduate with his 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Castaldo holds down a job as an electrical engineer  
specializing in aviation safety while undergoing chemotherapy and 
radiation treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Castaldos' biggest concerns is money. Richard's  
medical bills have topped $800,000 so far. 
</P>
<P>
	The Castaldos have insurance, but that only covers initial  
rehabilitation. They have received $150,000 of the nearly $5 
million in donations that poured in after the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard is grateful that his father has been able to be around  
during his rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just him being here helps,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Richard is confident that his father will recover.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to be fine. They caught it early,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As he sits in a wheelchair, Richard also holds onto a glimmer of  
hope that he may one day walk again. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said 10 years ago it was a lost cause, but now I guess  
they're not saying that anymore. They're doing a lot of spinal cord 
research and stuff,'' he said. ``But I'm pretty much just trying to 
live my life ... without that ... in my head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-ager is determined not to let his condition stop him.  
He has already gone whitewater rafting, canoeing, fishing and 
go-carting with his dad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty much just taking off with my life where I left off,  
I guess ... except for a few things,'' Richard said. ``I don't 
think it's gonna really change the way I look at life.''

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Wife Seeks Woman's Account </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- In a move that may lead to an embarrassing  
court fight for Newt Gingrich, divorce lawyers for his estranged 
wife have won permission to question a woman with whom the former 
House speaker has been romantically linked. 
</P>
<P>
	The 56-year-old former Georgia congressman, who espoused family  
values during his campaigns, has reportedly for years been seeing 
Callista Bisek, 33, an aide to the House Agriculture Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Daily News of New York and the New York Post quoted  
sources in Friday's editions who said the pair has been spotted 
together often in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb County Superior Court Judge Dorothy Robinson signed an  
order Thursday that allows attorneys for Marianne Gingrich to take 
a videotaped deposition from Ms. Bisek in Arlington, Va., where she 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	No date for the deposition has been set and Mrs. Gingrich's  
lawyer, John C. Mayoue, declined to say what questions he plans to 
ask. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you that she thought that they had a very sound  
marriage, right up until this unexpected demand for divorce,'' 
Mayoue said Friday. ``And I can also tell you that Marianne is 
prepared to thoroughly investigate Mr. Gingrich's personal life as 
well as his business activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayoue said it's too early to say what financial settlement Mrs.  
Gingrich might seek from the former speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich separated from his wife May 10 and filed for a divorce  
July 29. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney, Randolph Evans, said he hadn't seen the judge's  
order and could not comment on the reports that Gingrich had been 
seeing Ms. Bisek before separating from his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get into all of that because it just doesn't serve any  
useful purpose,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich's personal spokesman, Mike Shields, declined comment.  
Ms. Bisek could not be reached for comment. A message left at her 
home Friday night was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gingriches were married Aug. 8, 1981. Reports of trouble  
between the two surfaced in 1989, when the couple told The 
Washington Post they didn't know if their marriage would last. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich said his ``habit of dominance'' contributed to their  
problems, adding that he'd found ``frightening pieces that related 
to ... my own life'' in the book ``Men Who Hate Women and the Women 
Who Love Them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second failed marriage for Gingrich, who married his  
former high school geometry teacher, Jackie Battley, when he was 
18. They had two daughters during their 19-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Within months of their divorce, Gingrich married Marianne  
Ginther, a county planner and business consultant from Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The architect of the Republican revolution in the House,  
Gingrich served as speaker from 1995 until the end of last year, 
when he gave up his seat in Congress after the Republicans' 
disappointing showing in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Gingrich was asked about reports that he'd had  
extramarital affairs while running for Congress on a family values 
platform in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the 1970s, things happened -- period. That's the most I'll  
ever say,'' he said. ``I start with an assumption that all human 
beings sin. So all I'll say is that I've led a human life.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Accused of Drug Sale Over Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Two men were accused Friday of selling  
instructions and ingredients for a powerful ``date-rape'' drug on 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Gorton, 63, of Merritt Island, Fla., and John Hedrick, 22,  
of Colorado Springs, Colo., have been charged in Michigan with one 
count each of solicitation to manufacture a controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney General Jennifer Granholm said the instructions  
on how to make GHB, or gamma hydroxybutyrate, were so easy ``a 
third-grader could have put them together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Drug dealers who move their operations off the street corner  
and onto the Internet should know that they're not welcome in the 
state,'' Granholm said. 
</P>
<P>
	State agents went to the mens' Web site and purchased the  
materials needed to make GHB, she said. The site included an order 
form that directed customers to send cash or money orders to a post 
office box registered to Hedrick. 
</P>
<P>
	Three ``G-WiZzZzZ'' kits were ordered June 29 for $200 each and  
arrived at Michigan post office boxes in mid-July. The kit included 
GBL, potassium and ``step-by-step instructions that you can do at 
your kitchen counter,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	GBL, or gamma-butyrolactone, is a substance in such products as  
paint thinners or as a dietary supplement. GBL metabolizes into GHB 
after it's ingested. 
</P>
<P>
	Hedrick has been arrested but Gorton has not yet been taken into  
custody. The two likely will be extradited to Michigan to face the 
charges, Granholm said. 
</P>
<P>
	They each face up to 30 years in prison if convicted.  
</P>
<P>
	GHB is called a date-rape drug because a person who drinks a  
beverage laced with a few drops can lose consciousness within 20 
minutes and the next morning have no memory of what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1990, there have been at least 32 deaths and more than  
3,500 overdoses linked to the drug nationwide, according to the 
Drug Enforcement Administration.

<HEADLINE> Small Plane Crashes in Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEMBROKE PINES, Fla. (AP) -- A single-engine plane crashed into a  
home just after takeoff on Friday, killing both people aboard and 
burning down the house. 
</P>
<P>
	All six people in the house were able to escape before the  
explosion and fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The Piper PA28-140 registered in Broward County to a law firm  
crashed about a mile from the airport. The plane did not catch fire 
immediately, so the people inside were able to escape before it 
destroyed the house and the car parked out front. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen anything go up like this,'' said George  
Finger, a neighbor who saw the plane crash into the home's roof. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they were not sure who was aboard the plane,  
which was en route to Spanish Cay, Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The airplane burned so bad we cannot read the number on the  
airplane,'' said Jorge Prellezo, regional director of the National 
Transportation Safety Board in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration are  
investigating.

	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Motley Crue bassist Nikki Sixx was hauled off  
to jail after police accused the heavy metal rocker of encouraging 
violence during a concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixx, whose real name is Frank Ferrano, was arrested Wednesday  
and booked on a charge of provoking a breach of the peace at the 
Mandalay Bay Event Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Lt. Richard Alba said Sixx told the crowd that every time  
the group comes to Las Vegas the police tell them they can't be 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't like it, we can start flipping over cop cars  
like we did a couple of years ago,'' Sixx was quoted as saying in 
the police report. 
</P>
<P>
	Alba said the crowd of 8,000 began to respond violently, and  
several people attempted to pick up folding chairs to throw them. A 
spokesman for the event center said there was no damage reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Police went to arrest Sixx after the show, around midnight, and  
the three band members tried to interfere with the arrest, Alba 
said. They were also arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Alba said police had met with the band's management to outline  
how the show would run to avoid the problems that occurred when 
Motley Crue performed here in 1997. A man assaulted vocalist Vince 
Neil on stage, forcing a temporary halt in the concert.

<HEADLINE> Some Getting Sick From 'Blair Witch' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Movie theater employees are enduring something  
even more frightening than ``The Blair Witch Project'' -- having to 
clean up after fans who get sick after watching the low-budget 
horror hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the fictional documentary opened last month, workers at  
movie theaters have had to get out the gloves and mops as 
moviegoers get motion sickness from watching the film's jerky, 
first-person perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first weekend someone threw up in the women's restroom,  
the men's restroom and in the hallway,'' said Kris Monroe, manager 
at Lefont Plaza Theater in Atlanta. ``It's not pleasant to clean 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``One guy -- he was really cool -- he threw up in the restroom and  
he just came out and asked us for a mop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Kendall Square Cinema in Cambridge, Mass., assistant  
manager Nancy Campbell said she has started making announcements 
informing moviegoers to leave the cinema if they feel nauseated. 
Cinema staffers were upset about having to clean up messy seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beyond the scope of service we like to provide here,''  
Ms. Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent film, which has raked in $80 million since its  
release, follows three student filmmakers as they venture into the 
woods to track a legendary witch. The mock documentary features 
footage supposedly shot by the students and discovered in the woods 
a year after their disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Although blood and gore is virtually nonexistent, the cameras  
are in constant motion as the characters tramp through the woods. 
Throughout the one-hour, 27-minute film, the picture is often 
grainy and out of focus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've heard different analysis of why it happens,'' said  
producer Robin Cowie. ``Some simply may get a little motion 
sickness, that combined with the tension and the pace of the 
film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Someone vomits at just about every showing of the movie at AMC  
Colonial 18 in suburban Lawrenceville, said Bonnie Hunsaker, 
managing director. 
</P>
<P>
	``This past weekend we put up a sign that said the hand-held  
camera can create motion sickness and if you're susceptible to 
motion sickness you may want to rethink your viewing choice,'' she 
said.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Court Nixes Boy Scout Gay Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A Chicago judge has ordered the Boy Scouts to  
stop barring gay applicants in hiring decisions, saying that the 
policy amounts to illegal discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mere sexual orientation of an employee ... is not related  
to any nondiscriminatory basis for denying opportunities for 
employment,'' Circuit Judge Stephen A. Schiller said in a ruling 
handed down Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling followed by one week a New Jersey Supreme Court  
ruling that the ouster of assistant scoutmaster James Dale violated 
state law. 
</P>
<P>
	Schiller upheld a 1996 decision by the city's Commission on  
Human Relations, which barred a policy under which the Chicago Area 
Council of the Boy Scouts in 1992 denied job consideration to gay 
Eagle Scout Keith Richardson. He complained to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	George Davidson, a New York attorney who represents the Boy  
Scouts of America, said the council wants to appeal the decision.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Acts Quickly After Tornado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Fire Chief Tom Tallon had seen it before --  
human chains relaying materials and volunteers streaming to command 
posts, asking how they could help. 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't referring just to the deadly tornado that struck Salt  
Lake City on Wednesday. He had seen the response in 1983, when 
floods turned sandbag-lined streets into rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both events really brought out the humanity of this town,''  
said Tallon, a 27-year fire department veteran. ``They are a robust 
group of citizens, and their spirits are high in times like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado struck quickly, killing one person and injuring  
dozens of others. The National Weather Service had issued a severe 
thunderstorm warning, but forecasters said they couldn't 
immediately tell a tornado was roaring through downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters normally rely on computers to interpret radar images  
and give an early indication that a tornado is likely. In this 
case, forecaster Mike Conger said, the system didn't pick up the 
telltale signature of a twister until it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't a lot of hard evidence prior to its development  
that would have given us a reason to go with a tornado warning,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	City and state officials said there was no indication the  
weather service made mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado came in too low for the weather service's radar on  
Promontory Point, meteorologist Bill Alder said. The radar cannot 
detect anything in the Salt Lake Valley -- including tornadoes -- 
below 9,000 to 10,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Aiming the radar lower would allow hills to block some waves and  
make other waves bounce off the ground, ruining data used for 
forecasting, said Jim Belville of the NEXRAD Operational Support 
Facility in Norman, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem with the radar system -- part of a $4.5 billion  
weather service modernization -- is that software so good at using 
radar data to spot Midwest tornadoes cannot yet recognize the 
telltale signature in the mountainous West, Belville told The Salt 
Lake Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado damaged 127 homes, including 34 that are now  
uninhabitable. Mayor Deedee Corradini on Thursday placed 
preliminary damage estimates from the surprise twister at $150 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Outdoor Retailers Market, held twice a year in Salt Lake  
City for the past four years, was to open today after a one-day 
delay. It allows manufacturers of everything from fishing poles to 
kayaks to peddle their goods to stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to hurt, but we're not going to let this keep us  
down,'' said Rich DiLeo, a California businessman who makes hot dog 
holders and fly swatters. ``We didn't come this far to have a 
tornado take us out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as quickly as the twister came and went, volunteers were  
directing traffic and striding through neighborhoods, equipped with 
chain saws and hard hats. 
</P>
<P>
	For Tallon, who has served as chief four years, the response was  
reminiscent of 16 years ago. After heavy rain, residents stuffed 
sandbags and placed them along State Street, turning one of Salt 
Lake's major arteries into a wide river of muddy water. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as comparing a natural catastrophe, this event is  
larger than the flood of 1983,'' Tallon said. ``It required more 
resources over a much shorter period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But one thing remained the same. Mormon church members quickly  
hit the streets with a 50-page disaster booklet and a 
military-style plan for handling emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, Mormon leaders have urged members, who make up some  
70 percent of Utah's population, to stockpile a year's supply of 
food as a hedge against the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
	Before survivalism was popular, Utah companies sold food in  
40-pound bags, 100-hour candles and water storage barrels. The 
church has a silo filled with 19 million pounds of wheat in case 
normal distribution systems break down. 
</P>
<P>
	Those policies, which date to the state's pioneer history have  
helped when Utah is hit by natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had dozens of people turn out just to help clean up,'' said  
Ronald Coleman, bishop of the First Capitol Hill Ward, the first 
residential area hit by the storm after it hit downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that the church is known for helping out  
in emergency situations,'' said Corradini, who is not Mormon.

<HEADLINE> AltaVista Offers Free Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- AltaVista, a Web destination that  
persistently lags in popularity, thinks it's hit on the perfect 
gimmick to try to catch up to industry leaders Yahoo! and America 
Online: Free Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy's success depends on how many consumers willingly  
subject themselves to a constant stream of advertisements. 
AltaVista requires customers to click on a window of ads and Web 
links on the computer screen at least once an hour, or be 
disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
	But if AltaVista succeeds in luring millions of Internet  
customers, as well as many more visitors to its network of sites, 
it could trigger a new movement by large access providers. 
AltaVista says it's signed up 50,000 users since launching the 
service Thursday and aims for 1 million users within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Several small upstarts, such as ZapMe! and Bigger.net, currently  
offer free Internet access that elsewhere costs up to $260 or more 
a year. But AltaVista stands out as the first major Web brand to 
join the trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's inevitable that these types of services will be  
offered,'' said AltaVista spokesman David Emanuel. ``We think it's 
a very viable economic model.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some weren't so sure other providers would swap the monthly  
fees they rely on for revenue for less certain advertising sales. 
Joe Laszlo, who follows Internet usage for the Jupiter 
Communications research firm, said AltaVista's action is unlikely 
to force the top Internet content providers to provide free access. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, which drew more than 5 million new users in the past year  
despite raising its rates by $2 a month to $21.95, has no plans to 
give away the store, spokeswoman Tricia Primrose said. 
</P>
<P>
	AltaVista, based in Palo Alto, Calif., was sold by Compaq  
Computer Corp. in June to the Internet investment firm CMGI Inc. 
for $2.5 billion in a deal that has not yet closed. 
</P>
<P>
	It is depending on 1stUp.com in San Francisco for computers and  
other hardware needed to provide Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts say AltaVista, which ranked No. 10 among Web sites  
last month, has little choice but to take a radical approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to because they're so far behind,'' said Charlene  
Li, an analyst with Forrester Research. ``AOL and Yahoo! are just 
huge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only 1 million of the 63 million people online in the United  
States dial in for free, but that's changing as computer makers and 
even banks have begun to bundle free access with their own 
traditional services. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a consumer point of view, it's a bonanza,'' Li said. But  
profit margins will be tight, and few companies can afford to 
follow suit for long, she warned. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be somebody coming out next week offering free  
Internet service to compete with AltaVista that doesn't require 
clicking on an ad. So the bar will keep going down, down, down,'' 
she predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Some smaller companies offering free access, such as Bigger.net,  
have foundered over complaints of poor service and an endless 
streams of ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthias Gordon-Murer, a woodworker in San Francisco, eagerly  
signed up for FreeMac's offer of a new iMac computer next month in 
exchange for paying for three years of Internet access -- a $720 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that AltaVista is offering the same access for free, he's  
not sure the new computer is worth it. And like AltaVista, FreeMac 
will monitor his Internet usage to send advertising in his 
direction -- a condition he'd rather do without. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of like an electronic collar,'' said Gordon-Murer.  
``It turns me off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To sign up for AltaVista FreeAccess, users must provide the  
company with demographic information including age, sex and ZIP 
code. Describing shopping habits and favorite Web sites is 
optional. The information -- and the ability to follow every mouse 
click the users make -- will be used to target the ads.

<HEADLINE> Young and Old Collide at PGA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Old age and treachery beats youth and skill  
every time. 
</P>
<P>
	Except this once.  
</P>
<P>
	The past and the future collided Friday at the PGA Championship  
and this time they just split the difference. The ``token old 
fella,'' as 54-year-old Hale Irwin referred to himself, toured 
Medinah Country Club in the company of ``El Nino,'' as everyone 
refers to 19-year-old Sergio Garcia, and both finished the round at 
5 under par, within shouting distance of the top of the 
leaderboard. 
</P>
<P>
	And the disparate ways they arrived there just might be one of  
the best things about golf. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't get misty-eyed just yet. This isn't a story about  
shared experience, about wise counsel being passed down from one 
generation to the next. On the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin won his third U.S. Open the last time it was played at  
Medinah, in 1990, and so might be singularly qualified to pass on 
advice to anybody under 30 on how to play the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	But when asked whether he had imparted any sage words to the  
Spanish teen-ager, who wasn't even born until four months after 
Irwin had won his first Open, the older man's expression went 
blank. 
</P>
<P>
	``You mean,'' he said, ``like the facts of life?''  
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, for his part, wanted it known that he didn't need help  
understanding the birds and bees, nor for that matter, Medinah's 
bunkers and trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I know how to play the golf course,'' he said. ``I  
think I'm doing fine the way I'm playing. We were talking about 
clubs and those kinds of things, but nothing really, really 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest surprise, though, is that they were able to talk  
about anything at all. Garcia's average driving distance for the 
first two rounds of the PGA is 298 yards; Irwin's is 257. Typical 
of the day, Garcia was so far ahead of Irwin after striping a drive 
on No. 3 that somebody stumbling onto the scene might have assumed 
they were playing in different threesomes. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to worry. They arrived at every green together thanks to the  
heavy metal being played by Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is every bit as accurate with a 4-iron as the rest of the  
guys are with 7-irons,'' marveled 29-year-old Phil Mickelson, the 
third member of the group. ``I honestly believe that if he played 
on the regular tour full-time, he'd win at least once a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was a time when Irwin would have dismissed that estimate  
with a laugh -- as way too low. 
</P>
<P>
	He starred as a defensive back at Colorado in the 1960s, went on  
to win 20 times on the regular PGA Tour in 27 years and has added 
another two dozen victories to his resume since joining the seniors 
four years ago. He is as nasty a contestant as golf allows. Better 
yet, it might be the last sport gentle enough that Irwin can fight 
age to a standstill. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you have to do as a competitor,'' he said, ``is put a bag  
over everybody's head, including your own. That way, you can't look 
in the mirror and see gray hair or a kid with freckles. You just 
don't -- you don't pay attention to how old they are. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I'm comparing my distance with Garcia and Mickelson,  
those two specifically, I can't compete. But my irons are pretty 
good. I keep the ball in play, I make a putt every now and again 
and that's my game. 
</P>
<P>
	``That may be their game on an occasional basis, but maybe not  
as frequently as I. So,'' Irwin finished, ``things even out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Translation: On this day, Garcia hit every one of the first 12  
greens, promptly missed six birdie tries inside 12 feet and 
finished with 33 putts in a round of 1-over 73. Irwin hit 12 greens 
total, but needed only 27 putts to cobble together a round of 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Though they were tied approaching the final green, Irwin got  
there first and bathed briefly in the cheers of a gallery much 
closer in age to him than Garcia, a crowd old enough to remember 
his stirring win on the first extra hole after an 18-hole playoff 
nearly a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	As the roar grew, Irwin doffed his cap to the crowd. Then he  
turned and extended it toward Garcia, almost as if he were ushering 
the youngster into the spotlight. Respectfully, the young Spaniard 
pulled off his own cap and simply let the moment linger, passing on 
the temptation to respond with an in-kind gesture -- which, 
considering his age, would have been something along the lines of 
``raise the roof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then the old man and the young one both made pars, and went  
their separate ways again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you think of anything you have in common with Hale besides  
golf?'' Garcia was asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' he replied.  
</P>
<P>
	As if to underscore that, Irwin was asked a few moments later  
what kind of mental and physical adjustments he would have to make 
in the next few days, going from contending for a major against 
young lions this weekend to defending his title in a senior event 
in Boston the next. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well,'' Irwin said, brightening, ``I won't be the oldest  
player there.''

<HEADLINE> Cher Shops While on Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Michael Wybrew couldn't believe his eyes  
when Cher dropped by his store before her concert. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old entertainer, on tour promoting her hit album  
``Believe,'' stopped in the Crown Surplus shop wearing dark glasses 
and a straw hat and spent about 45 minutes shopping on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She bought a bunch of European military surplus stuff for her  
show and her son,'' said Wybrew. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a really nice lady. She just poked around at stuff and  
made me try on everything,'' said John Cumming, the owner's 
brother-in-law who was told he is the same size as Cher's son, 
Elijah. 
</P>
<P>
	Other customers did not approach Cher, letting her shop in  
peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody asked for an autograph. Canadians are very cool. We  
just very nicely asked for one photograph because we didn't think 
anyone would believe us,'' Wybrew said.

<HEADLINE> Attorney Killed Near N.M. Courthouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- An attorney who took on child murder and  
civil rights cases, along with poor clients nobody else wanted, was 
shot to death Friday in a drive-by shooting as he walked near his 
office to court. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Vigil, 52, died on a sidewalk just yards from the Steve  
Herrera Judicial Complex where he represented clients in a variety 
of cases, often charging them only what they could afford to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were looking for a man with a criminal record whom Vigil  
had filed a harassment complaint against on Thursday, said Espanola 
Municipal Judge Charles Maestas, a family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Vigil had represented the man in Maestas' court in July, when  
the man pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana and a misdemeanor 
charge of assault on a police officer, Maestas said. Maestas 
sentenced the man to 20 days already served. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Capt. David Segura wouldn't discuss whether police were  
seeking that person in Vigil's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be personal or it might be work related. We haven't  
ruled out anything,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vigil was killed as he headed to an arraignment for a  
23-year-old woman charged with murder in the death of a newborn 
found floating in an apartment toilet. Vigil was her attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses saw a pickup truck with a loud muffler, possibly  
driven by a man in his 20s, leaving the area. ``That's what we're 
looking for,'' police Sgt. Gilbert C' de Baca said. 
</P>
<P>
	District Judge T. Glenn Ellington, who was scheduled to hear  
Vigil's first case Friday, said he was stunned by his friend's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was not abrasive or someone who would bring out strong  
emotions,'' Ellington said. ``He was a calming kind of 
individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People stood quietly around the courthouse after the shooting.  
Across the street, a group of Vigil's family, friends and 
colleagues gathered under a tree while a brown-robed priest said 
prayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Shapiro, a Santa Fe lawyer who had known Vigil for 21  
years, said he was devastated for Vigil's widow, Andrea, and the 
whole legal community. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if this was somebody who had a grudge against  
lawyers or whether it was somebody that was out to get Carlos 
Vigil. It doesn't matter to me. I've lost a friend,'' Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vigil was known as ``de la plebe,'' a common man, in his  
hometown of La Mesilla near Espanola, said Rio Arriba County 
Manager Lorenzo Valdez, a lifelong friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd take cases a lot of times that other people wouldn't  
touch,'' Valdez said. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> AP Corrects Heart Bias Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A study's use of an unusual statistical method led  
The Associated Press to misreport and greatly exaggerate 
conclusions about possible gender and race bias in heart care in a 
Feb. 24 story. 
</P>
<P>
	Several news organizations, including the AP, interpreted the  
study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, to show 
that doctors were 40 percent less likely to order cardiac 
catheterization tests for women and blacks than for men and whites. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the likelihood of women and blacks being referred for  
the tests was 7 percent less than for men and whites. 
</P>
<P>
	The journal editors said they ``take responsibility for the  
media's overinterpretation'' of the study's findings and said they 
should not have allowed the use of misleading statistics which 
appeared to support the 40 percent figure.

<HEADLINE> VP Ousted Over Chicago Power Outages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The lights in the city are back on, but a top  
official at Commonwealth Edison is out. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after a power outage plunged a portion of downtown into  
darkness and sent confused commuters home early, a vice president 
handed in his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul McCoy had run the distribution system for the utility,  
already under fire for outages that left 100,000 without power 
during July's brutal heat wave. Officials at Unicom, ComEd's parent 
company, said it needed to make changes at the top level. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, if we had been performing better, he would still be  
here,'' Robert Manning, a Unicom vice president, said of McCoy. 
``Obviously, we're disappointed with the performance of our system, 
of our organization in that regard. And consequently, Paul has 
resigned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ComEd officials say they restored power to all customers near  
and in downtown by 4 a.m. Friday. However, they struggled with more 
outages later in the day on the city's south and west sides. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,400 customers were affected by those outages, which were  
not related to Thursday's problems. Power was fully restored by 
late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, ComEd was sued by two companies who say they lost  
money due to the outages and a man who says he injured his knee as 
he stumbled around in the dark. The lawsuit seeks class-action 
status. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning said the utility is not legally responsible for damages  
because of power outages.

<HEADLINE> Governor: National Drug War Failing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Gov. Gary Johnson barely rippled the  
political waters five years ago when, as a candidate, he admitted 
using marijuana and cocaine during the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Republican is making waves now by promoting the  
decriminalization of drugs. It is a stand that has put him at odds 
with his own party and left him with virtually no political allies 
on the controversial issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm out on my own,'' he said. ``Some day we'll  
address this, and maybe this is one of the first dominoes that gets 
the whole thing moving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 46, an avid athlete who doesn't drink alcohol or use  
drugs, said people shouldn't go to jail for smoking marijuana. He 
contends the national war against drugs has failed to stop the flow 
or use of drugs and it consumes too much money that law enforcement 
and the judicial system could better use to stop violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants to hold a series of public forums later this year to  
start a debate on how the state and nation deals with drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not trying to be a wacko,'' Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
	He is alone among the nation's governors in pushing  
decriminalization as a front-burner topic of public policy. 
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura suggested during his campaign that the 
state should consider legalizing marijuana, but hasn't pushed for 
it since. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's support for lifting criminal sanctions for marijuana  
possession runs contrary to the national GOP position of tough 
penalties -- including mandatory minimum sentences -- for 
drug-related crimes. The National Governors' Association strongly 
opposes drug legalization. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Mexico, Republican legislators worry the governor's drug  
stance could hurt candidates next year. The state GOP executive 
committee reminded Johnson of the party's tough-on-drugs position 
in a letter last month and asked him not to advocate 
decriminalization of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're an elected official, this is dangerous ground to  
tread on because it's very easy to attack someone as pro-drugs,'' 
said Norman Ornstein, a political analyst at the American 
Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 11 states have lifted criminal sanctions for possession of  
small amounts of marijuana, often treating it like a traffic 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Mexico, possessing an ounce or less of marijuana is a  
misdemeanor, punishable by 15 days in jail. Possession of more than 
eight ounces is a felony punishable by 18 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	During his 1994 campaign, his first bid for public office,  
Johnson disclosed he had smoked marijuana in college and shortly 
thereafter. He even admitted to using cocaine three times. But the 
drug use never became a major campaign issue. Johnson won 
re-election last year and vowed not to run for another political 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson doesn't advocate the use of drugs and said he still  
supports prison time for drug traffickers. He also said it will 
take several years to change anti-drug laws, and doesn't plan to 
push for legislation next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has won praise from groups in New Mexico and nationally  
that oppose marijuana prohibition. They say public attitudes about 
drug laws are softening. A Gallup poll earlier this year found that 
a majority of American continue to oppose legalizing marijuana but 
they backed the medical use of marijuana almost 3-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Gov. Johnson is so far ahead of the American  
people. He is simply ahead of most of the elected officials,'' said 
R. Keith Stroup, executive director of the National Organization 
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws in Washington, D.C.

	Questions on Gore's Abortion Stance  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore's position on federally funded  
abortions for poor women needs clarification, Democratic rival Bill 
Bradley said Thursday. ``I think it is time for him to answer what 
his position is,'' Bradley said. ``On this issue in particular 
you've got to say what you believe.'' Gore spokesman Chris Lehane 
tried to clarify Gore's position when asked Thursday about the vice 
president's position on federal funding for abortions. Lehane said 
Gore's position has been to support the current federal law -- 
``federal funding of abortion in situations involving incest, rape 
and when the life of the mother is endangered.''

	Japan OKs Joint U.S. Missile Plan  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Cabinet today endorsed a plan to research a  
missile defense system with the United States, a project spurred in 
part by North Korea's ballistic missile program, a government 
official said. Tokyo and Washington agreed last year to jointly 
research the defense system, and the Japanese government already 
has set aside $8.4 million for it in this year's budget. The 
project was announced last year just weeks after North Korea fired 
a rocket that sailed over northern Japan and into the Pacific. Many 
fear Pyongyang is preparing to test a second missile.

	Spy Case Could Prompt Punishment

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former director of the Los Alamos nuclear  
weapons lab and two former counterintelligence officers face 
possible discipline arising from the mishandling of a China spy 
investigation at the research center, officials said. Energy 
Secretary Bill Richardson said Thursday he strongly urged lab 
officials to take disciplinary action against the three, including 
the scientist who headed the prestigious lab for nearly a dozen 
years. Neither Richardson nor Los Alamos officials would name the 
three officials, citing privacy policies. But sources familiar with 
the internal investigation said one of them was Siegfried ``Sig'' 
Hecker, who was director of the New Mexico weapons lab from 1986 to 
1997.

	House Lawmakers Fund Colleagues

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With control of the House at stake, lawmakers  
are opening their campaign checkbooks as never before to help 
colleagues facing tough re-election races. More than a year away 
from Election Day, incumbents already have given away more than $1 
million. ``It's a matter of political economics as well as 
friendship and personality,'' said Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., 
whose role as a House manager during President Clinton's 
impeachment trial helped put him on the GOP endangered list. His 
colleagues already have helped him to the tune of $53,000. Federal 
lawmakers facing easy re-election campaigns long have shared their 
financial largesse with their less fortunate brethren, either 
through their campaign committees or through political action 
committees they control.

	Study Shows Teen Pregnancy Pattern  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two-thirds of sexually active teen-age girls  
are having sex with boys close to their own age, according to a 
first-ever study that also found that those girls who have older 
partners are much more likely to end up with babies. By looking at 
all teen sex, not just liaisons that lead to childbirth, the new 
data refine earlier research that found most teen mothers had older 
partners. Only about 7 percent of sexually active girls ages 15 to 
17 had partners who were at least six years older than they were. 
But these girls accounted for 19 percent of the teen pregnancies.

<HEADLINE> Former Marine Sentenced to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) -- A former Marine who said he bludgeoned a  
13-year-old boy with a sledgehammer because he wanted to know what 
it felt like to kill someone was sentenced Friday to die by lethal 
injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Rizzo, 20, admitted before sentencing that Stanley Edwards  
``never deserved what happened to him,'' but he defiantly described 
the death penalty as ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted luring Stanley into his back yard in September 1997  
under the guise of hunting snakes. Rizzo told police he straddled 
Stanley ``like a horse'' and hit him 13 times with a 3-pound 
sledgehammer as the boy begged him to stop. Then he dumped the 
boy's body in a wooded lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, he bragged about the killing in a letter to a  
Marine buddy, saying murder was near the top of his 10 goals in 
life.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Suspect Scouted Jewish Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The white supremacist who allegedly opened  
fire at a Jewish center had a map marking three other targets to 
kill Jews, but reportedly abandoned the attacks because of tight 
security, the founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Marvin Hier said the Wiesenthal center, the University of  
Judaism and a third location were circled. He said law enforcement 
officials warned him but asked him to keep the information 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early on, we were immediately informed and asked by the LAPD  
and the FBI not to reveal the fact that we had been a prime target 
for this attack,'' Hier said. He went public after a law 
enforcement official leaked the information to the media, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Buford O. Furrow Jr., 37, the white supremacist suspected of  
killing a postal worker after wounding five people during Tuesday's 
attack at the North Valley Jewish Community Center, surrendered 
Wednesday in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Simon Wiesenthal Center, named after the famed Nazi hunter,  
researches the Holocaust and hate groups and operates the Museum of 
Tolerance. The University of Judaism is in the city's Bel Air 
section. 
</P>
<P>
	The third institution allegedly targeted by Furrow was the  
Skirball Cultural Center, a museum on Jewish culture, the Los 
Angeles Times reported Friday, citing an unidentified law 
enforcement source. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow gave up on the three targets, then stumbled upon the  
North Valley center when he got off a freeway to get gas, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	He told investigators he had no intention of shooting small  
children and that they ``got in the way'' as he shot at a teen-age 
counselor and the center's receptionist, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, information about the origins of the weapons Furrow  
allegedly used surfaced, including the revelation that a Washington 
state police department once owned the pistol Furrow is accused of 
using to kill a postal carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cosmopolis (Wash.) police department bought the weapon from  
the manufacturer in 1996, but decided ``it was not suitable for our 
needs,'' Patrolman H. Layman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The department traded the new 9mm Glock Model 26 semiautomatic  
pistol to a gun shop, which sold it to a private citizen who then 
asked a gun collector to sell it at a gun show, The Daily World of 
Aberdeen, Wash., reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales between private individuals and at gun shows are  
unregulated, so it's unknown what happened to the weapon once it 
went to the gun show. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, only one shooting victim remained hospitalized  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Five-year-old Benjamin Kadish was in critical condition at  
Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua Stepakoff, 6, was released from the hospital Friday  
afternoon. The boy was wheeled out of the hospital wearing a black 
Los Angeles Police Department baseball cap and a knee-high cast on 
his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks to the wonderful staff at this hospital, Joshua is  
doing remarkably well,'' said his father, Alan Stepakoff. ``My 
family and I want to express our sincere appreciation for the 
outpouring of support we have received from around the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Stepakoff said his son is a ``very strong little boy,'' but  
is not ready to talk about what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot understand someone who has that kind of hate,'' the  
boy's father said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Joshua and his 8-year-old brother planned to return to the  
community center. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles County prosecutors have charged Furrow with murder  
in the death of 39-year-old postal worker Joseph Santos Ileto and 
five counts of attempted murder in the attack at the center. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors had already charged Furrow in the Ileto  
shooting on Wednesday; 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Magistrate Judge Carolyn Turchin refused bail for Furrow,  
who has had mental problems and ties to hate groups in the 
Northwest.

<HEADLINE> House Lawmakers Share Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Jay Dickey, a Republican representing an  
Arkansas district that gave favorite son President Clinton 60 
percent of the vote, has more than doubled his fund-raising this 
year to prepare for a strong Democratic challenge next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	He got help from his Republican colleagues, who contributed  
almost $27,000 to his campaign. ``To get it early like this really 
helps,'' Dickey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, with control of the House at stake, both  
Democratic and Republican lawmakers are opening their campaign 
checkbooks as never before. More than a year away from Election 
Day, incumbents already have given away more than $1 million, both 
to needy colleagues and to strong challengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of political economics as well as friendship and  
personality,'' said Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., whose role as a 
House manager during Clinton's impeachment trial helped put him on 
the GOP endangered list. His colleagues already have helped him to 
the tune of $53,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the aisle, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  
chairman Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island sent a letter asking House 
Democrats to help 14 ``marginal freshman members,'' complete with 
names and addresses of their campaign committees. ``Please send as 
much as you can,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal lawmakers facing easy re-election campaigns long have  
shared their financial largesse with their less fortunate brethren, 
either through their campaign committees or through political 
action committees they control. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the Democrats needing just five seats to capture  
control of the House from the majority Republicans, never before 
have so many given so much so soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always believed that sitting on my wallet wasn't helpful  
to anyone,'' said Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio. ``Giving it to those 
candidates who needed it was important -- and especially early money 
to needy candidates. It helps show credibility, puts them on the 
map and wards away potential challengers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boehner boosted his contributions to GOP candidates to $91,658  
between January and June, up 55 percent over the $61,800 he gave 
during the same period two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Others increased their donations even more. House Majority  
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, gave $10,500 to GOP candidates during 
the first six months of 1997. This year, his contribution total was 
$119,500. Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., gave just $500 to 
Democratic candidates in the first six months of 1997. During the 
same period this year, he contributed $38,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The three top House Republican leaders boosted their giving by  
529 percent, from $67,087 during the first six months of 1997 to 
$421,990 during the same period this year. The three top Democratic 
leaders increased their contributions from $7,000 to $91,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides giving directly to their colleagues, lawmakers have  
donated more than $2 million to the parties' congressional campaign 
committees, which also aid vulnerable incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a widespread recognition on the part of members that  
we are on the verge of retaking the House,'' said John Del Cecato, 
a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 
``We've seen an unprecedented surge in support from members who 
want to be a part of making that happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This dollar generosity is coupled with a general fund-raising  
increase by House candidates overall: 23 raised at least $500,000 
during the first six months of 1999, compared with just three 
during the same period in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickey more than doubled his fund-raising take during the first  
six months of 1999 as compared to two years ago, from $191,713 to 
$446,723. 
</P>
<P>
	Money from colleagues has gone to vulnerable incumbents such as  
Rush Holt, a New Jersey Democratic freshman. Two years ago at this 
time, Holt had raised $7,896 and had $6,241 in the bank. Through 
June 30, he had taken in $571,239 and had a bank account balance of 
$486,918. His Democratic colleagues had given him $16,500. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Republican side, Rep. Jack Quinn of New York, who  
switched his position and voted to impeach Clinton, raised $287,528 
during the first six months of the year, double the $140,864 he 
took in during the same period in 1997. He had $466,598 in the 
bank, as compared to $92,122 as of June 30, 1997. GOP lawmakers 
contributed more than $40,000 to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's especially satisfying when your colleagues think enough  
of the work you do to add their hard-earned funds to my effort,'' 
Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those contributing to Quinn's campaign was fellow New York  
Republican James Walsh, who shared $20,000 from his campaign 
committee with his GOP colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like being a chairman,'' said Walsh, who would lose his post  
as chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that handles 
veterans and housing programs should the Democrats recapture the 
House.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A twist of fate in a smoky Southern  
California bar changed Melissa Etheridge's life. 
</P>
<P>
	The rocker was performing one night a decade ago when Chris  
Blackwell, then head of Island Records, was in the audience. He 
liked what he heard and plucked Etheridge from bar circuit 
obscurity to a major-label record deal. So far, she has sold more

	It's the first TV gig for the Grammy-winning singer known for  
the hits ``Come to My Window'' and ``I'm the Only One.''

	Lifetime, with programming that targets women, approached  
Etheridge to be host. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt it had to be very organic and very natural, and it had  
to be a storytelling emphasis,'' she said. ``It was not to be 
sensational or strange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Etheridge's husky-voiced narration is woven with interviews of  
the people whose lives have changed. She tapes her segments 
separately, often doing a couple a day. That allows her to spend 
time with her 2 1/2-year-old daughter and an 8-month-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the stories that moved Etheridge was that of a young girl  
and boy at a German concentration camp. The girl secretly brings 
food to the boy until the day he tells her he's being transferred 
to another camp. Years later in the United States, they meet again 
-- on a blind date. The couple has been married ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get all choked up every time I talk about it,'' Etheridge  
said. ``That was really special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another story involves a black woman who gets in touch with a  
white sociology professor 2,000 miles away to help trace her 
ancestry back to the days of slavery. The two women eventually 
discover that the black woman's ancestors were once owned by the 
professor's forebears. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's fabulous is, each story is so different. There are  
stories that border on the impossible,'' Etheridge said. ``They're 
like little documentaries. I love the information. I'll watch any 
biography on anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Etheridge doesn't sing or write music for the show, but she said  
she might base a future song on one of the stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something that I had thought about,'' she said. ``They  
are such cool stories, and they're so compelling that I find that 
inspiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show's researchers check each story for authenticity. They  
predict future segments will be prompted by viewers pitching their 
own ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said once these start airing, then people start calling  
in and writing and e-mailing,'' Etheridge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The series is her first foray into the working world after a  
three-year vacation from recording and touring. Her new album, 
``Breakdown,'' is due in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed a break. People needed a break from me,'' she said.  
``At the end of the last tour, there were 20,000 people in the 
arena. It wasn't special anymore, and I didn't want it to get like 
that. I'm happy to be back.''

<HEADLINE> Kendall Sets Course Record at PGA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Skip Kendall was still groggy and  
sleep-deprived as he arrived at Medinah Country Club for a 6:49 tee 
time Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	What happened next was like a caffeine jolt.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just got off to a great start. And probably because I wasn't  
awake this morning. It was early,'' Kendall said after setting a 
course record with a 7-under-par 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, playing his first major of the season and seeking his  
first-ever tour victory, birdied six of his first nine holes and 
then finished with two birdies and a bogey on the backside to move 
into contention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The course record is nice. I didn't even know it was one and  
it's nice to find that out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But where I'm on the leaderboard is obviously more important.  
I want to have a good weekend and see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, 34, has two top-10 finishes in his last three  
tournaments. At 5-foot-8, 150 pounds, he's not intimidated by the 
deliriously long course at Medinah that is measuring 7,401 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	He birdied two of the par 5s, the 588-yard No. 7 and the  
582-yard 10th. And he saved par on the par-5 14th after his second 
shot hit a tree on the right side of the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the length on the golf course seems be on the par 5s  
and par 3s. For me, they're three-shot holes anyway. So I'm laying 
up and hitting. I really don't think it's really playing much 
longer than what we play week in, week out, anyway,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, Kendall was on the Nike Tour. Since then, he's  
improved his game after revamping his putting, and last year tied 
for 10th at the PGA. He shot a 74 in Thursday's first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I'm on an upswing. Obviously, I have a lot of  
confidence going,'' Kendall said. ``I feel real comfortable out 
there, putting well. Hopefully, it will lead to good things. So far 
it has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Simpson, Scott Simpson, Jeff Sluman and Mike Hulbert all had  
66s during the 1990 U.S. Open at Medinah, and Sergio Garcia had the 
same score Thursday in the first round of the PGA before being 
eclipsed by Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Cooper's 63 in the 1930 Medinah Open was the lowest score  
on the No. 3 course in any competition. It was so low, in fact, 
that it forced embarrassed club officials into making numerous 
alterations even though the course had just opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine holes were renovated, and 600 yards and a watering system  
were added before the course reopened nearly two years later.

<HEADLINE> Communities Trade Guns for Rewards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The plan was simple: District of Columbia  
residents would be paid $100 for each gun they turned in during a 
five-day period, no questions asked. 
</P>
<P>
	But the program was so successful that on the third day, some of  
those lined up to exchange their firearms this week had to be 
turned away because the program temporarily ran out of money. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, police and community groups running similar  
programs have attracted thousands of people ready to turn in guns 
for rewards. In some cases, the response has been so overwhelming 
that cash-strapped cities have cut back their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	In other places, officials are making payments with gift  
certificates, sneakers or even sewing machines to make sure that 
people giving up their guns won't turn around and buy new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The right incentives have persuaded some people to get rid of  
weapons they no longer need or feel comfortable keeping around the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	D.J. Scott used to hide his .44 caliber gun in the basement. But  
Scott said reports of youths accidentally shooting guns made him 
wary of keeping the weapon in a house with five children. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they look around long enough, they'll find it,'' said  
Scott, toting a gun inside a paper bag at one of Washington's 
police stations Friday. The city's program, after temporarily 
running short of cash, continued the collection Friday, after 
already taking in more than 400 guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``For $100 for an old gun, I'll take it,'' said Amelia Harris of  
Cheverly, Md., who was turning in a tarnished gun that had belonged 
to her grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the thousands of weapons turned in through such programs  
over the past few years barely makes a dent in the number of 
firearms in circulation across America, estimated at 220 million to 
250 million by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Those 
figures do not account for firearms destroyed or rendered unfit for 
use, souvenirs brought back from overseas battles, guns smuggled 
into or out of the country or guns manufactured illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	ATF does not keep track of how many guns are collected through  
the firearms swaps. 
</P>
<P>
	A key draw of buyback programs is the ``no questions asked''  
policy that affords protection to those who turn in guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we start taking names, we would only get legally owned  
guns,'' said Lt. Edward Zunino of Kennett Square, Pa., where a gun 
buyback program in place since May has draw in 25 rifles and 30 
handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	The monetary rewards, meanwhile, have lured an avalanche of  
participants. In Connecticut, a 1994 statewide gun swap drew so 
many weapons the program quickly wound up owing $400,000 more than 
it had to give away. The program that offered a sliding scale of 
paybacks up to $500 in store vouchers for working assault-style 
firearms had been expected to draw 1,000 weapons over the course of 
four weeks. Instead, it attracted 4,000 guns in just four days. 
</P>
<P>
	Budget constraints prevented the Salt Lake City police  
department from offering money, so they had collected only a 
handful of guns during a 10-day program that ended Friday. A city 
buyback program several years ago drew about 1,000 guns. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes initiated a  
guns-for-cash program dubbed ``Turn it in for a Benjamin,'' 
referring to Benjamin Franklin, whose portrait is on $100 bills. 
After collecting more than 650 guns, the program spread citywide. 
</P>
<P>
	But some groups have opted not to use cash, including Operation  
Hope, a nonprofit organization in New Orleans. It considered paying 
$50 to $100 per gun, but decided against it, concerned that 
criminals might use the money to buy more guns or purchase illegal 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to make sure that the money was funneled into things  
that were healthy or humanistic,'' said John Royes, the group's 
president. Instead, sewing machines or grocery store gift 
certificates worth $50 or more were given in exchange for guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Coordinating with police in Lexington, Ky., McDonald's started a  
``Guns for Buns'' initiative, handing out restaurant gift 
certificates for guns and assault-style weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trend has been toward purchasing gift items like movie  
tickets and sneakers,'' said Wendy Adler, director of law 
enforcement at the Washington-based Center to Prevent Handgun 
Violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Some police departments are asking police ballistics  
laboratories to determine if turned-in firearms might be linked to 
any criminal investigations, but are not using them as trial 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	While many cities destroy or melt down the collected weapons,  
New Orleans found a more one ingenious use. Local sculptors 
assembled the gun parts into works for an exhibition called ``Guns 
in the Hands of Artists.''

<HEADLINE> Mayor Pushes Spanish in Texas Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL CENIZO, Texas (AP) -- The mayor of a Mexican border community  
says he doesn't know and doesn't care how many of the town's 
residents are illegally in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rafael Rodriguez stood fast Thursday behind ordinances  
adopted last week declaring the town a ``safe haven'' for illegal 
immigrants and requiring Spanish at City Council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know who's legal or illegal. I would treat anyone the  
same, whether they're here illegally or not,'' said Rodriguez, who 
was once an undocumented resident. ``We're residents and we don't 
want to create problems by getting into private lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any city worker who helps the U.S. Border Patrol uncover  
undocumented immigrants will be fired, the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	El Cenizo, incorporated in 1989, is an impoverished town with a  
high population of first-generation immigrants, both documented and 
undocumented. It sits alongside the Rio Grande about 10 miles south 
of Laredo. 
</P>
<P>
	City secretary Elsa Degollado estimated the city has about 7,800  
Spanish-speaking residents, about 1,000 of whom probably are in the 
United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	She said many undocumented immigrants living in El Cenizo leave  
their homes daily to make a living -- seeking temporary employment 
as gardeners, housekeepers or construction workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people need to feed their families,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The other new ordinance stipulates that local government  
transactions be conducted in Spanish; an English translation is 
provided with 48 hours of notice. 
</P>
<P>
	In compliance with state and federal laws, written ordinances  
will be adopted in English and translated into Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez himself does not speak English and says it's  
discrimination in City Council meetings ``not to speak Spanish and 
explain what is going on.''

<HEADLINE> Coffee, Wheat Futures Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coffee futures surged Friday on forecasts for frost in growing  
regions of Brazil, the world's largest producer. 
</P>
<P>
	On other commodity markets, wheat was higher, soybeans mixed and  
crude oil rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee for September delivery rose 4.85 cents to 98.60 cents a  
pound on the Board of Trade of the City of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee rallied as traders weighed news of the cold front moving  
across parts of Brazil. The market's response was a reversal of 
Thursday's action, when coffee futures prices fell as traders bet 
the Brazilian cold front was unlikely to cause any damage. 
</P>
<P>
	While most of this year's coffee crop has already been  
harvested, frost could damage trees that will produce next year's 
crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices were higher while corn and soybeans were  
mixed Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat opened mixed before turning mostly higher on strong export  
news. The crop production report released by the U.S. Agriculture 
Department on Thursday -- bearish for corn and soybean prices -- 
wasn't as negative for wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans opened lower, following through on Thursday's sharp  
decline, which was caused in part by the crop production report 
that suggested more of this year's crop will survive the summer 
heat wave than had been expected. Heavy rains in parts of southern 
Illinois and southern Indiana also weighed on prices, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices in some contract months turned to the positive side in a  
mixed day. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn also closed mixed as market participants weighed whether  
Thursday's crop report was overstated in its harvest forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 5 cents to $2.85 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1/2 cent to $2.22 3/4 a bushel; December oats fell 1/2 
cent to $1.16 a bushel; November soybeans fell 2 1/4 cents to $4.54 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading resumed on time Friday a day after the Board of Trade  
closed an hour early due to power outages in Chicago's downtown 
Loop area. The problems were blamed on the failures of two power 
transmission cables. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures were higher and feeder cattle mixed on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while lean hogs were mixed and pork 
bellies higher. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose 0.55 cent to 66.05 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell 0.13 cent to 77.27 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs rose 0.15 cent to 54.60 cents a pound; February pork bellies 
rose 1.38 cents to 58.20 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures were higher in trading on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil futures were boosted by news that North Sea supplies will be  
cut next month, and word that a joint-venture between Texaco Inc. 
and Chevron Corp. was forced to stop pumping oil off the coast of 
Nigeria because of violent protests against the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil for September delivery rose 19 cents to $21.67 a  
barrel.

<HEADLINE> Stakes High in Iowa Straw Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) -- Free food. Free music. Free admittance.  
It's easy to dismiss the Iowa straw poll as a political 
free-for-all, but it's more than that to nine Republican 
presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Their campaigns could rise and fall based on the high-profile,  
high-stakes contest Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only thing shaping the race for a while,'' said  
Rich Galen, a GOP political operative who flew from Washington to 
witness the spectacle. ``We'll have no way to measure what's going 
on other than polls and money for months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``straw poll'' is an unscientific beauty contest, eerily  
unpredictable. Not once has the straw poll winner gone on to win 
the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a straw poll, money talks,'' Lamar Alexander, whose  
campaign is struggling and strapped for cash, grumbled Friday as he 
grilled pork chops at the State Fair. ``I don't think there's a 
front-runner before anyone votes'' in the February caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Any Iowa resident with a ticket ($25 each, purchased by  
campaigns for anybody who asks) can cast a vote after a day of free 
food, live music and curious sideshows -- such as the sight of 
Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson riding his Harley Davidson in support 
of George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the Texas governor, holds a wide lead in public polls and  
a tenfold lead in the earliest political test: fund-raising. A 
convincing victory would suggest that he can also organize at local 
levels. A weak showing would tarnish the aura of inevitability Bush 
has so carefully crafted since his landslide re-election in Texas 
in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He has spent at least $750,000 on the straw poll, but the figure  
does not include priceless aid provided by trade associations and 
state politicians who know how to organize in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	His campaign will dispatch 100 buses across the state to haul  
voters to the Ames, Iowa, site. Aides estimate that 300 to 400 of 
the supporters will be Hispanic, newcomers to Iowa GOP politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of you may have never participated'' in Republican events  
like Saturday's straw poll, Bush told Hispanic leaders here Friday. 
``It's important that you participate, important that you come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes, a millionaire conservative seeking his first  
elective office, is expected to be competitive with Bush. He must 
do well to show that his money and message can convert to votes; a 
poor showing, even in a straw poll, could raise questions about his 
electability. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making no predictions on win, place or show,'' Forbes  
said Friday after his bus rolled into the fairground blaring 
``Stars and Stripes Forever'' from a loudspeaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has easily topped the $1 million mark to rent buses,  
throw parties for supporters, staff phone banks, mail recruitment 
letters and air television advertisements. He bought a half-hour of 
time Friday night for a televised town hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Little-known Washington activist Gary Bauer could make a name  
for himself with a top-tier finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, a former domestic policy adviser in the Reagan White  
House, has quietly canvassed Iowa churches and plumbed his contacts 
with the home-schooling community. He hopes to replicate the work 
of religious broadcaster Pat Robertson, who won the 1987 straw poll 
in a shocker that demonstrated the below-the-radar power of social 
conservative voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a chance for a shocker,'' Bauer said Friday.  
``There may be a few surprises like a significant number of 
minorities supporting me. I think it would be a shock if I finished 
in the top half considering I don't have the money like Bush or 
Forbes, and I'm not a celebrity like Elizabeth Dole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole is the other big question mark. The former president of the  
American Red Cross is drawing huge crowds of young and professional 
women, who may or may not turn out Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The straw poll likely is Alexander's last stand. The former  
Tennessee governor, who has focused all his energies on Iowa, needs 
to show his political organization is worth keeping alive. 
</P>
<P>
	He must finish third, maybe fourth, to remain viable,  
Alexander's supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Quayle has not made Saturday do-or-die, but his campaign  
needs a boost. 
</P>
<P>
	He likes to say that, as a former vice president, nobody doubts  
he is ready to be president but they wonder if he could get 
elected. The straw poll may be Quayle's best and last chance to 
show that he is a serious vote-getter. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan is competing against Quayle and Bauer to carry the  
mantle for social conservatives. He was the top conservative 
candidate in 1992 and 1996, and could show Saturday that he is 
still a force. ``Do not let anyone buy your straw poll,'' he said 
Friday during a local radio interview. ``Do not let anyone buy your 
caucuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Keyes is a marginal threat to win the nomination, but drew  
several hundred staunch conservatives to the 1996 Iowa poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch is a late-comer to the race. He is trying  
to build his base, beginning with fellow Mormons. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona has nothing to win or lose Saturday.  
He called the poll a ``sham'' and refused to participate.

<HEADLINE> Police Regret Pepper Spray Comment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- The city's police commissioner  
apologized Friday for a course that taught cadets that pepper spray 
doesn't always subdue Mexican-Americans and other ethnic groups 
because of their tolerance for spicy foods. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no empirical or scientific evidence to support these  
statements,'' Commissioner Ronnie Watson said, adding that such 
instruction will be dropped from the cadet curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in the city of Harvard University use the spray, a  
mixture of cayenne pepper, resin and oil stored in an aerosol pump, 
to quell people resisting arrest. Police call it ``O.C.,'' short 
for oily resin of capsicum, another name for peppers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can guarantee you the ingestion of pepper orally does not  
increase the resistance of eye tissue to pepper spray,'' said Dr. 
Nicolas Carballeira, director of policy and planning at the Latino 
Health Institute. ``If it weren't so inherently racist it would be 
amusing because it is that ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cambridge officer Frank Gutoski taught the course in which  
cadets were told that people exposed to hot peppers at an early age 
develop a resistance to the spray. He said the information came 
from the Massachusetts Criminal Justice Council. But council 
officials denied the recommendation was theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutoski and other Cambridge police officials did not return  
calls for comment Friday. Earlier this week, Gutoski told the 
Cambridge Chronicle newspaper that longtime ingestion of spicy 
foods minimizes the spray's effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people that it doesn't affect are people who have consumed  
cayenne peppers from the time they are small children, and this 
generally breaks into ethnic categories,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Extensive handling of spicy foods -- either on a farm or in a  
processing plant -- makes people less susceptible to pepper spray, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mexican-Americans tend to be pickers. So, with Cajuns,  
Mexican-Americans, Pakistani, Indian .... what happens is the O.C. 
is effective for a much shorter time,'' Gutoski said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995 -- the year for which the most recent statistics are  
available -- about 8 percent of Cambridge's 96,000 residents were 
Latino, 15 percent were black and 9 percent Asian, according to a 
study by the University of Massachusetts-Boston.

<HEADLINE> Five Dead in Calif. Home Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTERVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Federal and local officials on Friday  
were investigating the deaths of five people found in a house that 
exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of all five -- a man, his wife and three children --  
were found in the wreckage of the house and were burned beyond 
recognition, Fire Chief Frank Guyton said. Autopsies were to be 
completed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  
Firearms, said Friday that the man shot his wife and three young 
daughters before setting off the explosion. But local officials 
said there was no evidence of a shooting and the cause of the fire 
was still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``That information is absolutely erroneous. No conclusions have  
been arrived at,'' said police Capt. Silva Rodriguez. ``There's no 
evidence or indication that a firearm was used.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contacted again later Friday, the ATF spokeswoman, Marti McKee,  
said she had ``misspoke'' earlier and could neither confirm nor 
deny the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls were 11, 7 and 2 years old, McKee said.  
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors reported the explosion Thursday night and the house  
was engulfed in flames when firefighters arrived minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	Porterville is 150 miles north of Los Angeles.

</P>
<P>
	SHELBURNE, Vt. (AP) -- Whitney Darrow Jr., a popular cartoonist  
for The New Yorker, died Tuesday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Yorker published more than 1,500 of Darrow's cartoons  
during a 50-year career that started in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his favorite cartoons was inspired by the advent of  
Laundromats. Darrow drew a woman in a busy Laundromat washing all 
her clothes, including those she'd been wearing. Naked, she stares 
in amazement at the newfangled machine doing her wash. 
</P>
<P>
	John Russell, reviewing a Darrow exhibition in 1978, wrote in  
the New York Times that ``Whitney Darrow has been one of the best 
cartoonists around for as long as anyone can remember. He is an 
environmental cartoonist, in that he goes on setting the scene in 
that misleadingly easygoing style of his until he is ready for a 
one-liner. And what a one-liner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He published four collections of his cartoons and also  
illustrated books by Jean Kerr, Nathanial Benchley and many others. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Jean Drapeau    	
</P>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Jean Drapeau, the autocratic mayor for 29 years  
who brought Expo 67 and the 1976 Olympics to Montreal, died 
Thursday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	The longtime mayor had hospitalized since July 5. At the  
family's request, the hospital did not disclose the cause of death. 
Drapeau had suffered a stroke several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Drapeau, who first won office in 1954, maintained an iron  
control over city hall and a hands-on approach to local problems. 
He left a civic legacy that includes a new subway system in 1966, 
major league baseball, Grand Prix racing, and the 1967 World's Fair 
known as Expo 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Drapeau served all but three years from 1954 until he stepped  
down in 1986.

</P>
<P>
	HASKINS, Ohio (AP) -- Frank Enright, the mayor of Portage, was  
killed Thursday when he touched a 2,400-volt power line while doing 
electrical work. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth death in the Toledo area in the last 10 weeks  
involving electric shock. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-term mayor was helping prepare a pole to hang a new  
transformer in a parking lot of Haskins Elementary School when the 
accident happened, Haskins police Chief Jerry Eversman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Enright worked for Bowling Green's electric department beginning  
in the late 1940s, then started Enright Electric in Portage.

<P>
	LOS ALTOS HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Robert Thomas Jones, who began  
his career as a handyman for a flying circus and later developed a 
wing design as a NASA scientist that revolutionized air travel, 
died Wednesday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Jones designed swept-back wings in 1944, jet wings were  
built perpendicular to the fuselage. Pivoting them back created 
less wind resistance, allowing for supersonic speeds with the same 
engine power. Virtually every commercial and military jet uses the 
design today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones enrolled in the University of Missouri in 1927 but dropped  
out after his freshman year to join Charles Fower's flying circus. 
Jones received flying lessons in exchange for carrying gasoline 
cans and patching up holes in airplane wings. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones began his research career in 1934 when he joined the  
predecessor to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration -- 
the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics -- at its laboratory 
in Langley, Va. He transferred to NASA Ames in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, the year he retired, Jones received the Congressional  
Excalibur Award for his contributions to aeronautical science and 
the Smithsonian Institution's Langley Award, an honor also given to 
the Wright brothers and Charles Lindbergh.

</P>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Vocalist Tommy Ridgley, a veteran performer  
from the golden age of New Orleans rhythm and blues, died Wednesday 
of lung cancer. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Ridgley never had a national hit, his more than 70  
recordings have endured around the globe. He was a fixture in the 
city's nightclubs and at private functions for 50 years, and has 
been featured at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival since 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridgley signed with Decca Records in 1952 and produced  
``TraLaLa'' which was later covered by Pat Boone. 
</P>
<P>
	He also recorded over the years for Atlantic Records, where he  
was billed as ``The New King of the Stroll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1965, Ridgley released an acclaimed comeback album, ``Since  
the Blues Began,'' on Rounder Records. Last year Ridgley announced 
plans for a new CD, and remained optimistic about performing even 
after he was diagnosed with lung cancer.

</P>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Robert Viles, a former dean and president  
of the Franklin Pierce Law Center, died Monday in a swimming mishap 
while vacationing in France with his wife. He was 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Viles was swimming off the coast of Brittany when he was pulled  
under by ocean currents. The Concord Monitor quoted friends of 
Viles as saying that he was pulled ashore but attempts to revive 
him failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Viles, originally from Skowhegan, Maine, studied law at New York  
University and Yale. He moved to New Hampshire in 1973 to help 
start Franklin Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the school's dean in 1976, a position he held until  
1997. In 1992 he also became the law center's president. 
</P>
<P>
	He stepped down as president in June to become vice chairman of  
the board of trustees.

<HEADLINE> Russian Tax Collections Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's cash-poor government, trying to boost its  
budget revenues, has managed to nearly double federal tax 
collection in the first seven months of 1999, the Tax Ministry said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax authorities collected the equivalent of $6.27 billion in  
cash between January and July, up 96.6 percent from the same period 
of 1998, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The collections exceeded the government's goal by 11 percent.  
The revenues collected were for the consolidated budget, which 
includes both federal and regional tax sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Improving tax collection has been a top priority for the  
government, which has been under heavy pressure to increase its 
income in the wake of last year's financial crisis and pressure 
from multilateral lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal tax collection for the first seven months of the year  
constituted 7.1 percent of gross domestic product, up from 5.8 
percent of GDP in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	One economist said the devaluation of the ruble was responsible  
for the improved tax collection, since it has stimulated some 
sectors of the economy by making Russian goods more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been this massive windfall effect from the  
devaluation and it would be surprising if they hadn't had some 
success tapping into those revenues,'' said Roland Nash, an 
economist with Renaissance Capital investment bank in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the increase in world oil prices was undoubtedly a  
major factor as well. Oil is Russia's leading export. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil companies were settling only 43 percent of their tax  
payments in cash at the beginning of 1999. That rose to 88 percent 
in July and was believed to have hit 100 percent as of Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax Minister Alexander Pochinok said he expected overall August  
tax collections to be more than the ministry's target, the 
equivalent of $1.08 billion. He said he didn't expect this week's 
change in government, which was ordered by President Boris Yeltsin, 
to affect collections.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays' Wells Day-to-Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Blue Jays left-hander David Wells was scratched  
from his start Friday night because of a stiff back. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells was scheduled to pitch against Oakland's Kevin Appier in  
the opener of a three-game series between AL wild-card contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, who struggled with back problems during spring training,  
said his back stiffened up Thursday. Wells received treatment from 
a chiropractor Friday and tried to walk off the stiffness, but 
couldn't. He approached manager Jim Fregosi and told him he wasn't 
able to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I follow through that's when it catches,'' said Wells,  
who's listed as day-to-day. ``There's no use going out there and 
hurting it. Better safe than sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells missed several starts during spring training because of  
his back, but said Friday that his current problem is not as 
severe. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Halladay allowed six runs -- five earned -- and six hits in 4  
2-3 innings. He struck out eight.

<HEADLINE> Oregon Adoption Law on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- Oregon's law opening up birth records to  
adult adoptees will be kept on hold for an additional 90 days, the 
Oregon Court of Appeals decided Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Approved by voters last fall, the adoption law gives adult  
adoptees the right to see their original birth certificates, which 
frequently have the names of one or both birth parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal challenges have prevented the law from taking effect so  
far, but supporters of the law had hoped the appeals court would 
allow it to take effect immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	But the appeals court Friday issued an order preventing the law  
from taking effect for 90 days, unless the court is able to reach a 
ruling before then on a constitutional challenge to the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Anxious adoptees who support the law said that finding their  
birth parents could help detect potential health problems and, more 
importantly, give them a sense of identity. 
</P>
<P>
	``This waiting is just absolutely hell. There are adoptees who  
are dying to know,'' Helen Hill, the chief petitioner for the birth 
records law, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 900 adoptees have requested birth certificates under  
Measure 58. 
</P>
<P>
	But Frank Hunsaker, an attorney who represents six birth mothers  
who are suing the state, said the records should be kept 
confidential while the courts decide the measure's 
constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunsaker said the adoption law violates the implied contract the  
women thought they had with the state that their identities would 
be protected. 
</P>
<P>
	If the records are opened before the courts decide the  
constitutionality of the measure, he said, ``Quite simply, the cat 
would be out of the bag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Marion County judge last month upheld the law, saying that the  
Oregon Constitution contains no promise of secrecy for women who 
give up their babies for adoption. That is the decision now being 
reviewed by the appeals court.

<HEADLINE> New Reynolds Bidder Emerges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Days after aluminum giant Alcoa Inc. made  
an unsolicited offer for Reynolds Metals Co., a Chicago investment 
firm has made its own surprise bid. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum company,  
offered $65 a share in cash and stock for the nation's 
third-largest aluminum maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa valued the deal at $5.6 billion, though it did not provide  
additional details. At $65 a share, the deal would be worth only 
$4.2 billion based on the number of Reynolds shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan Avenue Partners, a privately held investment firm, said  
in a statement Friday it has made an all-cash offer for Reynolds 
that surpasses Alcoa's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its purchase of of Reynolds would not raise the  
same antitrust issues that would occur if Alcoa acquired Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	Other details, including the offering price, were not disclosed.  
A Michigan Avenue spokesman declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	An Alcoa spokeswoman dismissed the bid. ``We are the only ones  
who have a bonafide offer on the table for Reynolds to consider,'' 
Joyce Saltzman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lou Anne Nabhan, a spokeswoman for Richmond-based Reynolds,  
declined to comment on the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan Avenue and Reynolds have had some dealings in the past.  
Last year, Michigan Avenue purchased McCook Aluminum Sheet &AMP; Plate 
Plant from Reynolds for an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
	The news Friday was the latest in a tumultuous week of events  
that threatens to reshape the aluminum industry. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Canadian aluminum giant Alcan Aluminium announced  
plans to combine with French company Pechiney and Alusuisse-Lonza 
(Algroup) of Switzerland to form a new company provisionally called 
Alcan-Pechiney-Algroup. It would be the world's largest aluminum 
company with $21.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	An Alcoa-Reynolds combination would have revenue of about $21  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds officials have refused to comment on the Alcoa offer,  
other than to say the company's board will meet Sunday to discuss 
the bid and will issue a statement after the close of business 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts said Alcoa's offer was too low and predicted a  
bidding war. The president of the Montreal-based Alcan said 
Thursday the company has not ruled out the possibility of making a 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Reynolds closed Friday at 69.37 1/2, up $3 or 4.5  
percent, on the New York Stock Exchange. Alcoa closed at $66.50, 
down $1.25 or about 1.8 percent, also on the Big Board.

<HEADLINE> Searchers Just Miss Jailed Convict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHILDS, Md. (AP) -- An escaped murderer whose crimes were  
portrayed in the film ``At Close Range'' was spotted on the porch 
of a relative's home but he managed to elude authorities yet again. 
</P>
<P>
	Police dogs repeatedly picked up Norman Johnston's scent  
Thursday after two officers spotted him outside a home in a rural 
area in northeast Maryland, more than a week after he broke out of 
a Pennsylvania prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the man fled into the woods after the two officers  
turned their car around to get a better look at him. 
</P>
<P>
	The home belonged to a member of the Johnston family, police  
said. They would not identify the residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities continued the search with helicopters and police  
cars overnight and they sent officers into the woods on horseback 
early today, said Pennsylvania State Police Capt. Henry Oleyniczak. 
Several unconfirmed sightings were reported overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Dogs briefly picked up Johnston's scent four times Thursday but  
lost it each time, said Cecil County Sheriff Rodney Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, 49, escaped Aug. 2 from the maximum-security State  
Correctional Institution in Huntingdon, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	He escaped by making a lifelike dummy and cutting through his  
window and two security fences. 
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted in 1980 of killing four teen-agers to cover up  
a multimillion-dollar burglary ring he ran with his brothers. The 
film ``At Close Range,'' starring Sean Penn, was based on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston's brothers, Bruce and David, were also convicted of  
killing the teen-agers and sentenced to life, Bruce was convicted 
of killing two potential witnesses as well.

<HEADLINE> Code Cracker Worries Cryptographers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                            *BY JEFF DONN   	
</P>
<P>
	WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- Experts in computer encryption say a new  
computer design, if built, could crack the kind of secret keys that 
now protect the bulk of electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated cost of such a computer -- $2 million -- would be  
manageable for many organizations. But most highly sensitive 
military, banking and other data are already protected by stronger 
keys, according to cryptographers at the conference where the 
design was shown. 
</P>
<P>
	The commonly used weaker keys, though, would become ``easy to  
break for large organizations,'' said cryptographer Adi Shamir of 
the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	He developed both the new computer design and helped invent the  
widespread coding system -- known as RSA public-key encryption -- 
that it attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Shamir spoke Thursday at the opening of a two-day conference of  
more than 120 cryptography experts from around the world at 
Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer scientists said his work underscores the growing  
vulnerability of the most commonly used short form of RSA keys, 
which consists of just 512 bits. The key -- a sequence of 1s and 0s, 
or bits -- unlocks the secret coding of a computer transmission so 
it can be deciphered. 
</P>
<P>
	Shamir dubs his idea for the computer Twinkle, which stands for  
The Weizmann Institute Key Locating Engine and also refers to the 
twinkle of its light emitting diodes. The 6-by-6-inch optical 
computer would measure the light from diodes to perform 
mathematical calculations solving 512-bit RSA encryption keys 
faster than ever -- within two or three days. An effort in February 
to solve shorter, easier 465-bit keys took hundreds of computers 
and several months. 
</P>
<P>
	Shamir first informally showed a prototype of his device at a  
conference in Prague, the Czech Republic, in May. He publicly 
outlined its workings at length for the first time Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twinkle is a little out there, but it looks like it's  
buildable to me,'' said Seth Goldstein, an expert in computer 
architecture at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University. 
</P>
<P>
	Organized crime, friendly and unfriendly governments, research  
institutions and others might take an interest in such a project, 
conference participants suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, users of 512-bit keys ``should be worried,'' said  
Christof Paar, a computer engineer at Worcester Polytechnic 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the current state of the art, it is not secure,'' added Bob  
Silverman, a research scientist at Bedford-based RSA Laboratories, 
a division of RSA Data Security. Shamir co-founded RSA Data but no 
longer works there.

	Pentagon Clarifies Gay Policy  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon announced mandatory training on  
anti-harassment guidelines for all troops beginning with boot camp, 
an update of its ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy for gays in the 
military. The directives make no basic changes in the practices and 
protections in place since 1994. Michelle Benecke, co-director of 
the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, the leading advocacy 
group on the issue of gays in the military, said the real issue 
``is whether leaders will be committed at every level to stop 
anti-gay harassment.''

	Hatch Resents Charge of Intolerance  
</P>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Sen. Orrin Hatch says he resents any  
implication that he is intolerant: He said that when he told fellow 
Republicans at their state convention two months ago that they 
should be proud of their party because ``we don't have the gays and 
lesbians with us,'' he didn't intend the comment to sound 
prejudicial. The Utah lawmaker was just pointing out that ``gays 
and lesbians, by and large, are very intelligent, highly educated, 
high-earning people, who support mainly Democrats,'' he told The 
Salt Lake Tribune in a story for today's editions.

	Bush Predicts Success in Straw Poll  
</P>
<P>
	CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush said today  
he has ``a good chance'' of winning the Iowa Straw Poll over his 
Republican competitors. Bush said the straw poll will be a good 
test of his campaign organization. Tomorrow's straw poll is an Iowa 
GOP fund-raiser traditionally seen as an early gauge of 
organizational strength, but this summer's event took inflated 
importance, partially because Bush declared he would go all out to 
win it.

	Russia Mulls Wider War in Caucasus  
</P>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russia launched new airstrikes and  
sent reinforcements to bolster an offensive against Islamic 
militants today in Dagestan. The acting prime minister said the 
campaign might be carried into neighboring Chechnya. The threat to 
strike Chechnya, which fought a war of secession against Russia 
from 1994 to 1996, was the strongest indication yet that the 
uprising in Dagestan -- a Russian republic in the Caucasus region -- 
could lead to a wider war.

	Experts Urge Quick Serbia Reforms  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A group of experts today warned that  
Yugoslavia needs to move quickly to oust President Slobodan 
Milosevic. The Pact for Stability -- comprised of economists, legal 
experts and writers -- said Serbia would face civil war if the 
government and opposition parties fail to support a transitional 
government of independent experts. The group envisions a transition 
that would foster economic recovery and re-establish Serbia's ties 
with the world.

	Israel Coalition Govt. Faces Split  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Ehud Barak's coalition government faced a  
possible split Friday when two religious parties threatened to quit 
in a controversy over the Sabbath. The parties made their threat 
after Barak authorized the transportation of equipment on the 
Sabbath day. Under Orthodox Jewish custom, driving is forbidden on 
the Sabbath, which lasts from sundown Friday until sundown 
Saturday. The arrangement between the religious parties and 
government is that work is not done on the Sabbath if it can be 
postponed. But wide loads have always been transported overnight on 
the Sabbath because traffic jams would result if they were moved on 
a weekday.

	AltaVista Offers Free Internet

<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- AltaVista, a Web destination that  
persistently lags in popularity, thinks it's hit on the perfect 
gimmick to try to catch up to industry leaders Yahoo! and America 
Online: Free Internet access. The strategy's success depends on how 
many consumers willingly subject themselves to a constant stream of 
advertisements. AltaVista requires customers to click on a window 
of ads and Web links on the computer screen at least once an hour,

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared today as a new government report

average closed up 184.26 at 10,973.65., a gain of 1.7 percent. On 
the NYSE, advancers led decliners 1,953-1,044. The Nasdaq closed up

	Lee Westwood Has PGA Clubhouse Lead  
</P>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Teen-ager Sergio Garcia faltered, while  
54-year-old Hale Irwin kept up his improbable run today and they 
both finished the second round of the PGA Championship at 139, one 
stroke behind clubhouse leader Lee Westwood. Westwood took the 
early lead by firing a 68 today for a 138 total, while Skip Kendall 
shot a course record 65 to tie with Garcia and Irwin. Kendall used 
some spectacular iron play and a streaky putter to make eight 
birdies against a lone bogey on the par-3 13th.

	LONDON (AP) -- Thieves broke into the London home of Hollywood  
director Ridley Scott, punched his 94-year-old mother and took the 
Rolex watch from her wrist, a newspaper reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Her screams alerted a nurse and Scott's ex-wife. As they fled

<HEADLINE> Magazine Ditches Import Car Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Motor Trend magazine is ditching its Import  
Car of the Year award in response to the increasing globalization 
of the automobile market. 
</P>
<P>
	Mergers and the use of foreign assembly plants by automakers in  
recent years has made it tougher to tell the difference between an 
import and a domestic car, C. Van Tune, editor-in-chief of the Los 
Angeles-based magazine, said in a statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning with year 2000 models, Motor Trend will simply pick a  
``Car of the Year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The change comes as Motor Trend celebrates its 50th year of  
publication. 
</P>
<P>
	The import award was established in 1976 to highlight an  
increasing number of imports in the U.S. market. The difference 
between import and domestic cars has been blurred in recent years 
by the merger of Chrysler Corp. and German automaker Daimler-Benz 
AG, as well as the increasing of number of U.S. assembly plants 
owned by other foreign carmakers such as Toyota, Honda and Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford owns 33 percent of Japanese carmaker Mazda Motor Corp. and  
this year purchased the passenger car division of Sweden's Volvo 
AS.

<HEADLINE> Galaxy Reacquire Salcedo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Galaxy reacquired  
midfielder Jorge Salcedo from the Tampa Bay Mutiny on Friday for 
midfielder Daniel Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	Salcedo, 26, had one assist in 16 games for Tampa Bay, and one  
goal and five assists in 15 games last season after being acquired 
from the Chicago Fire on June 29, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He had two goals and one assist for the Galaxy in 1996, and was  
traded to the Colorado Rapids on Feb. 1, 1997, for the first pick 
in Major League Soccer's supplemental draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, 24, played in 12 games for the Galaxy this season. He  
was the team's second-round draft pick in the 1998 MLS draft after 
playing at Southern Methodist.

<HEADLINE> BB Playoff Ticket Prices Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As promised, World Series tickets won't cost  
more this year after doubling last season. When it comes to the 
playoffs, though, prices are soaring like home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland and Arizona became the first teams to announce their  
postseason ticket prices Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians said their top price of a ticket for the league  
championship series will be $85. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks, with a 7 1/2-game lead in the NL West in only  
their second season, are charging even more: up to $100 for 
clubhouse seats for the league championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's rise is a a 42 percent increase from last year's top  
of $60, and 70 percent above the $50 charged for the best seats in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland is charging up to $50 for the first-round division  
series, an increase of 35 percent from $37 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the World Series, box seats will remain at $150 and $120,  
with reserved seats at $100 and $85, bleachers and general 
admission at $40 and standing room at $25. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, teams charge higher for premium seats. The New York  
Yankees charged $700 a seat for the front-row Legends Boxes last 
year and $300 for their box seats with waiter service. The Yankees' 
postseason ticket plan for this year has not been finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, most Series box seats cost $75, while reserved seats  
were $50 and general admission $30. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner's office told teams its league championship  
ticket prices should range from $40 to $75 this year. Last year, 
the commissioner's office set specific prices, saying box seats 
should sell for $60, reserved seats for $45 and general admission 
and bleachers for $30. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's top price is higher because Jacobs Field has many  
high- and low-priced seats with relatively few in the middle range. 
The Indians are charging $70 for lesser box seats for the league 
championship, while reserved seats will cost $45 and $35, with 
standing room and general admission at $25. 
</P>
<P>
	For the division series, the commissioner's office gave teams a  
range of $17 to $35, a slight change from last year's range of 
$17.50 to $30. Cleveland is selling tickets for $50, $40, $35, $25, 
$20 and $15. 
</P>
<P>
	Super Bowl tickets cost $400 (luxury suites) and $325 last year,  
a $50 hike. Ticket prices for January's game in Atlanta have not 
been set, NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the NBA and NHL, teams set their own postseason ticket  
prices. The top tickets for the NBA Finals this year cost $2,700 
per game in New York and $275 in San Antonio, except for four house 
seats at $500. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Stanley Cup finals, Dallas had a top price of $350 and  
Buffalo had a high of $111.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Gearing Up for Iowa Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- The carnival tents were in place and the  
barbecue warming for a high-test straw poll that could leave some 
Republican presidential campaigns sputtering in the dust. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivals were pointing to Texas Gov. George W. Bush as the one to  
beat today, and a confident-sounding Bush and his aides did 
absolutely nothing to dispel that perception. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to look at it as an opportunity to bolster my  
organization and find out whether we need work -- if we need any 
work at all,'' said Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The basketball arena and surrounding grounds at Iowa State  
University were set up for a giant party, with free food and music 
by big-name entertainers competing for the politicians' attention. 
</P>
<P>
	For the nine GOP candidates participating the stakes were high,  
although some sought to disparage the vote in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of graveyards in Iowa for front-runners, some  
of them from Texas and some of them who had a lot of money,'' said 
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Iowa residents can vote in the straw poll, with the state  
Republican Party reaping the proceeds from sales of $25 tickets. 
The various campaigns are buying the tickets and passing them out 
to anyone who pledges to vote for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa Republican Party officials estimated initially that 12,000  
to 15,000 people would show up for the vote, but they have been mum 
on ticket sales. That made handicapping the outcome of the event 
tricky. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote is getting heavy attention because a large and diverse  
GOP field is running hard in key early states like Iowa, but 
there's nothing to offer a measure of their standing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only thing shaping the race for a while,'' said  
Rich Galen, a Republican operative. ``We'll have no way to measure 
what's going on other than polls and money for months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was spending at least $750,000 on the straw poll, and  
others said publisher Steve Forbes was spending even more and that 
the event was money-driven. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Arizona Sen. John McCain opted to stay away, and he blasted  
the vote even as his rivals were arriving for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Iowa straw poll has degenerated into a spending frenzy  
where the winner is not the candidate who is best able to define a 
vision for America's future, but who can rent the most buses and 
buy the most votes,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush had publicly set a goal of getting 5,000 backers to the  
event, and aides were confidently predicting they would exceed that 
goal, perhaps substantially. Bush is far ahead in raising money, 
and a demonstration of organizational prowess from a candidate who 
only this summer began campaigning in Iowa would be a big boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Falling short would suggest there are organizational weaknesses  
others could exploit. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no shortage of effort by the major contenders. Bush  
sent 100 buses around Iowa to gather supporters, and Forbes has 
waged an intense grassroots campaign for nearly two months. He 
rejected arguments about money. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't have a message, money won't get you much,'' said  
Forbes. ``The only way they will come is if they believe in you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The event took on new intensity when Bush decided to not only  
join in the effort, but to compete hard to win. ``I'm glad we made 
the decision,'' he said. ``Our organization was anxious to work 
hard to see whether we can perform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was getting substantial help from his backing of much of  
Iowa's GOP establishment, veteran organizers who brought him a 
ready-made campaign organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes also has something riding on the event, because he has  
spent heavily on the event and on early television advertising and 
needs to demonstrate that can be converted into real votes. He 
vowed to be competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making no predictions on win, place or show,'' said  
Forbes. ``We're using this as a benchmark in our drive to the 
caucuses'' next year that will award delegates to the Republican 
National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative activist Gary Bauer hoped to gain support with a  
church-based network but he was likely to get competition from 
commentator Alan Keyes. ``I think there's a chance for a shocker,'' 
Bauer said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole is the other question mark. The former president  
of the American Red Cross draws big crowds of young and 
professional women, who may or may not turn out. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Quayle argues that, as a former vice president, he's  
prepared to serve, but he needs a chance to demonstrate he can get 
votes as well as govern. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch is a latecomer to the race. He is trying  
to build his base, beginning with fellow Mormons.

<HEADLINE> Tennis Star Steffi Graf Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEIDELBERG, Germnay (AP) -- Steffi Graf, who dominated women's  
tennis for a decade before injuries started hindering her career, 
announced today she was retiring from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, 30, won 22 Grand Slam singles titles and had more than 100  
victories on the WTA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	In her latest comeback, Graf posted a stunning, emotional  
victory over top-ranked Martina Hingis to win the French Open this 
summer. She then lost in the Wimbledon final to Lindsay Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
	She announced her retirement at a news conference in Heidelberg,  
near her hometown of Bruehl. Graf has an apartment in Heidelberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf won 107 WTA titles in a career that paralleled that of  
Germany's male star, Boris Becker. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker and Graf were responsible for making tennis one of the  
most popular and lucrative sports in Germany. Becker also retired 
earlier this year, playing his last match at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf won more than $20 million in her career and spent a record  
377 weeks as No. 1 in women's rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, she completed a ``Golden Slam,'' winning the four  
majors and adding the Olympic gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed ``Fraulein Forehand'' for her devastating forehand  
shot that was her trademark, Graf suffered personal setbacks late 
in her career. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father, Peter, spent time in prison after being convicted  
for evading taxes on her earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	A long list of injuries hindered her in the last few years and  
Graf spent long spells off the circuit and began losing to lower 
ranked players she would normally beat with ease.

<HEADLINE> Mets and Royals Exchange Pitchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Kansas City Royals and New York Mets  
exchanged minor league pitchers Friday with the Royals receiving 
Derek Wallace and Jeremy Jackson going to the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City, which has blown 25 save opportunities going into  
Friday's game against Tampa Bay, said that Wallace would join the 
major league club. A roster move will be made upon his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that Derek can strengthen our bullpen, not only for  
the remainder of this year, but also as we look towards the 2000 
season,'' Royals president and assistant general manager Allard 
Baird said. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be Wallace's second stint in the Royals organization.  
Kansas City got him from the Cubs in April 1995 in a trade that 
sent Brian McRae to Chicago. The Royals then sent him to the Mets 
in July of that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace, who pitched in 19 games for the Mets in 1996, was 2-5  
with a 3.60 ERA in 36 appearances this season at Triple-A Norfolk. 
He was a member of the silver-medal winning United States team at 
the recently completed Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was a 10th-round pick for the Royals in 1998. The  
left-hander was 4-5 with a 4.41 ERA in 13 starts this season for 
Single-A West Virginia.
