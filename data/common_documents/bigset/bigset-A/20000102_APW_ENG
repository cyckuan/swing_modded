<HEADLINE> Badgers Win Back to Back Rose Bowls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Fresh off a New Year's celebration, Wisconsin
residents had another reason to party Saturday: The Badgers became the first Big
Ten team to win back-to-back Rose Bowls by beating Stanford 17-9.
</P>
<P>
	   "I couldn't be prouder of my team, my school and my alma mater," said
33-year-old Eric Steelmack, a 1992 University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate from
Minneapolis, who celebrated by dancing a polka with his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   Steelmack was among the rowdy fans who watched the game at the Regent Street
Retreat bar in Madison, where people sang the UW-Madison alumni song, "Varsity,"
and chanted "U-RAH-RAH Wisconsin."
</P>
<P>
	   No. 22 Stanford entered the game a 14-point underdog, but led 9-3 at
halftime, briefly unsettling Wisconsin fans who considered a loss by their
fourth-ranked Badgers next to impossible.
</P>
<P>
	   "I expected a blowout, but it was a lot closer than I thought it would be,"
said 22-year-old Wisconsin senior Elizabeth Severo, before downing a celebratory
shot.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rose Bowl excitement gave Madison a party atmosphere for the second
consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
	   Tracy and Geoff Smith were both wearing Wisconsin sweatshirts and sipping
red Killer Kool-Aid from a plastic football cup as they watched the game at the
Big Ten Pub in Madison.
</P>
<P>
	   "We wanted to be as close to Camp Randall as possible," said Geoff Smith,
who came to Madison from Appleton. "I think people this year are -- if not as
enthusiastic -- more enthusiastic. I think a lot of it has to do with the
millennium. It's the Rose Bowl 2000!"
</P>
<P>
	   Dick Van Caster, 39, of Milwaukee, was decked out in a red floppy hat; a
Badgers sweatshirt; red pants; a fake Badgers tattoo on his cheek; a rose and
Wisconsin pins attached to his hat; red shoe laces and red-and-white Mardi Gras
beads.
</P>
<P>
	   "We couldn't ride in his car without wearing something Badger," said his
friend Dawn Golla, 29, a student in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
	   Marilyn Drager watched the Rose Bowl with her husband at the Clubhouse
Sports Bar in Appleton. She said the couple has been following the Badgers since
their son graduated from UW-Madison in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Drager had a Bucky Badger stuffed animal on the table that played the
Wisconsin fight song whenever Wisconsin scored and they gave it a squeeze.
</P>
<P>
	   Fans said Ron Dayne's Heisman Trophy win made this year's season special.
Dayne, who set the major-college career rushing mark this season, became only
the third player to win back-to-back Rose Bowl MVP awards.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wish the Packers could draft him because he's a very solid runner and he
gives 100 percent every game, but he's not cocky about it," Geoff Smith said,
referring to Wisconsin's other football passion in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Najam, 20, a junior at UW-Madison, was grilling steak and bratwurst at
his house with friends in preparation for the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think it's as big a deal this year as it was last year," Najam
said. "The big thing this year was Ron Dayne winning the Heisman."
</P>
<P>
	   "Absolutely not!" protested his friend Rob Kanack, a 23-year-old postal
worker. "I don't think it's less of a big deal. No way, dude! That's like saying
Green Bay going to the Super Bowl two years in a row isn't a big deal."

<P>
    PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- It's Pasadena, not Hollywood, so the "Troy Walters'
Story" did not end with the determined Stanford wide receiver making a
game-winning catch.
</P>
<P>
	   That he made any catches was plenty impressive.
</P>
<P>
	   Three days earlier, Walters was downcast as he talked about having to miss
the Rose Bowl after dislocating his right wrist in practice Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, however, Stanford coach Tyrone Willingham indicated there was
some chance that Walters might play. The first time Stanford got the ball on
Saturday, there was Walters, lining up in his usual wide receiver spot.
</P>
<P>
	   He made a 28-yard catch to help Stanford get out of a hole at its 3 on the
way to a first-quarter field goal, then caught a 19-yarder to the Badgers 3 to
set up the Cardinal's only touchdown later in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's an impact player. He made plays right off the bat just like we
anticipated he would," Willingham said of Walters, who is less than 5-foot-8 but
still won the Biletnikoff Award this season as the nation's top receiver.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were really pleased he was able to play the majority of the game under
the conditions he played. In my mind, that's what a champion-caliber player
does."
</P>
<P>
	   With Stanford threatening in the waning moments of the game, Walters
appeared to have a step on the defensive back on fourth-and-12 from the
Wisconsin 46, but had to watch as quarterback Todd Husak was sacked to end the
Cardinal's final chance in the 17-9 loss to Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
	   Walters, the Biletnikoff Award winner this season as the nation's top
receiver, said the loss was disappointing, but that he still was thrilled to
play in the Rose Bowl -- Stanford's first in 28 years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Tuesday and Wednesday were low points, so just being able to play was
special," he said after making three catches for 52 yards. "Once the adrenaline
started, I didn't even think about my wrist."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   BUCKY'S BACK: Though their presence wasn't quite as dramatic as last year,
Wisconsin's fans again turned out in the thousands for the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Badgers fans began gathering at the Rose Bowl before dawn, with tailgaters
filling the parking lots and side streets. Most wore red, with more than a few
sporting cheeseheads as well. Signs dotted the crowd, including one reading "Eat
Cheese Or Die!"
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Badgers fans turned UCLA's home stadium into a near-Camp Randall
Stadium West in Wisconsin's 38-31 upset of the Bruins. The Wisconsin backers
were quieter this time, during a game that had little fireworks, but came to
life when the Badgers drove to their fourth-quarter touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd of 93,731, the smallest since 1955, was particularly rosy, since
the Badgers' color is red and Stanford's is cardinal. Even the ushers wore red
coats and both end zones were painted the same color.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   LOW-SCORING: The 26 combined points were the fewest in the Rose Bowl since
USC beat Michigan 14-6 in 1977. Stanford was sixth in the nation in scoring,
averaging 37.2 points a game, and Wisconsin was No. 10 at 35.6.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ONE LEFT: Ron Dayne, the Heisman Trophy winner and two-time Rose Bowl MVP,
and coach Barry Alvarez have one game remaining together before their four-year
relationship ends -- the Hula Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   CALIFORNIA DREAMING: Dayne might consider making the San Francisco 49ers,
Oakland Raiders or San Diego Chargers his team of the future, since California
seems to bring out the best in him. The Badgers' rumbling runner has rushed for
700 yards in three games in the state -- 254 at San Jose State in 1997, 246 in
the 1999 Rose Bowl, and 200 in the win over Stanford.

Y2K Chief Suggests Expanding Network
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The nations that established a World Bank-backed network to
prepare for Y2K computer problems are considering ways to extend their
cooperation, the U.S. government's top Year 2000 expert said Saturday. As part
of the preparations, John Koskinen said, Latin American nations had produced a
continent-wide map of electricity grids, "something that has never been done
before." An International Y2K Cooperation Center was established in February
1999 under the auspices of the United Nations. Some 170 nations provided
information on critical infrastructure systems such as energy and communications
to the center during the rollover period.

Many Computer Systems See Monday As Y2K Test
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Although ATM machines, subway trains, airports and
electricity got through midnight functioning normally, many computer systems
still await their Y2K test, starting Monday when the world -- particularly the
financial world -- goes back to work and reboots its computers. The U.S. banking
industry, which spent an estimated $9 billion updating computer systems so they
would not misread 2000 as 1900, had to meet a target of having its systems ready
six months ago. Federal bank examiners aggressively went after stragglers to
ensure 100 percent compliance by December.

Two Killed in Brazil Prison Clash

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Riot troops stormed a prison in southeastern
Brazil on Saturday, ending a 60-hour rebellion by hundreds of inmates who
demanded to be transferred to other prisons. An official at the Presidente
Bernardes Penitentiary, 340 miles northwest of Sao Paulo, said police killed two
of the uprising's leaders and freed three guards held hostage since Wednesday
night, when the rebellion began. Four prisoners were wounded, said the official.
The Agencia Estado news agency said the two rebellion leaders were threatening
to stab the hostages to death when they were shot by police.

early Saturday when a bank employee knocked the gun from the woman's hand. No
shots were fired and no one was injured. Phouvanpheng Nicki Siriboury, 23, was
charged Saturday in federal court in Kansas City, Kan., with one count of
attempted bank robbery and one count of brandishing a firearm at the Bank of
America branch in suburban Kansas City. "I had nothing to lose," the woman had
said in a phone call to KMBC-TV during the standoff. "I lost it all, lost my
job, lost my family, lost it all."

Haitian Migrants' Boat Runs Aground
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- More than 400 would-be migrants packed shoulder-to-shoulder on
a wooden boat had to be persuaded by Coast Guard crews to abandon ship after the
boat ran aground on a sandbar early Saturday about a mile from Key Biscayne. All
406 Haitians and Dominicans eventually climbed voluntarily aboard Coast Guard
cutters, said Petty Officer Scott Carr. He said the group may have been at sea
on the 60-foot vessel for as long as five days. The boat ran aground at 2:30
a.m. about 1 1/2 miles from the Cape Florida Lighthouse. Under a Haiti-U.S.
agreement, would-be immigrants are returned once they are intercepted.

offered New Year's greetings to thousands of well-wishers at the imperial
palace. "I pray for happiness for Japan and the world at the beginning of the
year," Akihito told the crowd. Nearly 17,000 people had gathered at the grounds
of the sprawling palace in central Tokyo as of midmorning to hear the greeting
and catch a glimpse of the royal family. The palace grounds are generally closed
to the public, except on Jan. 2 and the emperor's birthday on Dec. 23.

Russia Unleashes Fierce Assault on Grozny

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces on Saturday unleashed an exceptionally
fierce assault on the capital of Chechnya, dropping scores of bombs on the city
from low-flying jets. Federal forces claimed progress against the rebels, but
apparently were still far from capturing the center of Grozny. The intensified
effort to take the Grozny came as acting President Vladimir Putin visited
Russian forces in Chechnya. The visit came on Putin's first full day in office
and underlined his determination to win the war in Chechnya.

expired Saturday to cap the No. 9 Michigan State Spartans' most successful
season in decades with a 37-34 victory over No. 10 Florida in the Citrus Bowl.
The kick sailed through and the Spartans (10-2) charged off the sideline, jumped
up and down on the field, soaked in their band's fight song and celebrated like
national champs.

<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Tom Brady threw for 369 yards, and Michigan beat Alabama by
inches in Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Brady threw four touchdown passes, including three to David Terrell, and the
Wolverines won 35-34 in overtime Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   After Michigan's Shawn Thompson caught a 25-yard touchdown pass on the first
play of overtime, Alabama scored on Andrew Zow's 21-yard pass to Antonio Carter.
But Ryan Pflugner's extra-point kick was inches wide to the right.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a great football game," Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said. "It was a
shame somebody had to lose. As much I enjoy winning, I hate to see it end the
way it did, with a missed extra point."
</P>
<P>
	   The Wolverines won even though they lost a fumble at the Alabama 1 in the
fourth quarter and had a 36-yard field goal attempt blocked to force the
overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaun Alexander, the Southeastern Conference player of the year, rushed for
161 yards and three touchdowns in his final game for Alabama. His scores came on
runs of 5, 6 and 50 yards, and teammate Freddie Milons scored on a 62-yard punt
return.
</P>
<P>
	   The eighth-ranked Wolverines (10-2) managed just one first down in the
opening 28 minutes but completed their third consecutive 10-win season. The
Wolverines rallied from fourth-quarter deficits to win three times during the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've done that all year long," Carr said. "I'll be glad to get rid of
them; I don't have much heart left."
</P>
<P>
	   The fifth-ranked Crimson Tide (10-3) lost in their 50th bowl game, an NCAA
record.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wolverines' first six possessions produced just one first down, which
came on a 5-yard gain on a fake punt. The offense finally mustered a first down
with 1:18 left in the opening half, then scored two plays later on a 27-yard
pass from Brady to Terrell.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wolverines erased deficits of 14-0 and 28-14 thanks to Terrell, who tied
Orange Bowl and Michigan bowl records with three touchdown receptions. They
covered 27, 57 and 20 yards from Brady.
</P>
<P>
	   Brady, who was 34-for-46, led Michigan to three touchdowns in a 12-minute
span in the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillip Weeks blocked a field-goal attempt by Hayden Epstein as time ran out
in the fourth quarter, forcing the overtime. Earlier in the period, Anthony
Thomas lost a fumble at the Alabama 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Attendance based on tickets sold was 70,461, but the actual crowd totaled
only about 50,000. The no-shows missed a game filled with penalties and punts
but also plenty of big plays and swings in momentum.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander turned a third-and-1 run into a 50-yard touchdown, breaking three
tackles to give Alabama a 21-14 lead in the third period. Less than three
minutes later, Milons caught a 51-yard punt, weaved across the field and scored
untouched to make the score 28-14.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wolverines made the score 14-all on their first series of the second
half. Terrell caught a short pass from Brady, eluded cornerback Milo Lewis and
sprinted the end zone, completing a 57-yard play.
</P>
<P>
	   Terrell beat Lewis again in the third period for a 20-yard score.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama picked up only one first down in the opening period, but a 32-yard
run by Alexander got the Tide rolling. The play started a 76-yard drive that
ended with Alexander's 5-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
	   Three minutes later, Alabama scored again. Milons' 23-punt return and a
late-hit penalty gave the Tide the ball at the Michigan 31, and Alexander's
6-yard touchdown run made the score 14-0.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Alexander's Numbers Not Enough  </HEADLINE>
    By FRED GOODALL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Michigan's defense never really stopped Shaun Alexander. It
was the Wolverines' offense that finally slowed down the Alabama star in the
Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander rushed for 161 yards on 25 carries and scored three touchdowns,
however, the Southeastern Conference player of the year wasn't much of a factor
in the latter stages of the Crimson Tide's 35-34 overtime loss on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Brady's passing helped Michigan overcome a 28-14 third-quarter deficit.
And once the Wolverines caught up, Alabama abandoned the running game that had
helped it take control of the game after a slow start.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander scored on second-quarter runs of 5 and 6 yards, staking the
Crimson Tide to a 14-0 lead that Brady wiped out with two touchdown passes to
David Terrell.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC's leading rusher finished the first half with 84 yards on 15
carries. He did most of his post-halftime damage on one run, a 50-yard burst up
the middle in which he broke three tackles before outrunning Michigan's Whitley
James to the end zone for a 21-14 Alabama lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Freddie Milons returned a punt 62 yards to put the Crimson Tide up by 14
again. Alabama wouldn't score again until the overtime when Andrew Zow faked a
handoff to Alexander and threw to a wide-open Antonio Carter for a TD that
trimmed Michigan's lead to 35-34.
</P>
<P>
	   Ryan Pflugner missed the extra point, giving Michigan the game and the MVP
award to Terrell, who had 10 receptions for 150 yards and three TDs.

<P>
    PHOENIX (AP) -- Doug Weight scored his second goal of the game with 1:04
remaining Saturday night as the Edmonton Oilers rallied for a rare road victory,
5-4 over the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oilers, who have the Western Conference's worst road record at 4-14-3,
appeared headed for another defeat until Todd Marchant tied the game at 4 when
he backhanded in a rebound with 4:40 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Weight got the game-winner when Pat Fallon flipped a blind backhander at the
net. Weight, standing alone in front of the net, deked Coyotes goalie Bob
Essensa and slid the puck between his pads.
</P>
<P>
	   It ended a three-game road losing streak for the Oilers, who got 23 saves
from Tommy Salo.
</P>
<P>
	   Phoenix, playing again without captain Keith Tkachuk (back spasms), took a
3-2 lead when Travis Green and rookie Trevor Letowski scored 14 seconds apart
early in the second period.
</P>
<P>
	   Juha Ylonen's first goal since Oct. 10 -- a 33-game span -- made it 4-2 with
11 minutes left in the second before Edmonton closed the gap on Ethan Moreau's
fluke goal with 5:16 remaining in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Essensa skated into the corner to clear the puck, which bounced off an
Oilers player and back toward the slot. Moreau batted it out of the air and off
Coyotes defenseman Stan Neckar's foot, with the puck rolling into the empty net.
</P>
<P>
	   Phoenix winger Dallas Drake had a hand in both first-period goals -- one for
each team.
</P>
<P>
	   Roman Hamrlik's slap shot went off the blade of Drake's outstreatched stick
7:25 into the game. Drake tied the score with 4:31 left in the period, tipping
in Shane Doan's blast from the far boards.
</P>
<P>
	   Essensa finished with 32 saves and lost for just the fourth time this season
against 12 wins.

<P>
	   Three minutes later, Alabama scored again. Milons' 23-punt return and a
late-hit penalty gave the Tide the ball at the Michigan 31, and Alexander's
6-yard touchdown run made the score 14-0.

<HEADLINE> Wis. Family Spent $20,000 for Y2K  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUDSON, Wis. (AP) -- Dennis Olson is a little disappointed: After all, he
spent $20,000 on food, drinking water, medical supplies and a generator to
prepare for Y2K-related chaos that never happened on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a little bittersweet to see it end this way,'' said Olson, a
41-year-old electrical engineer and computer consultant.
</P>
<P>
	   Olson, who has a wife and two teen-age sons, feared the Y2K computer bug
might bring power shortages or water-system failures or even government-imposed
martial law. He said he logged more than 1,000 hours on the Internet chatting
with like-minded survivalists.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I studied everything there was to know about the power grid, the
just-in-time supply system, fuel shipments, food storage, communications and
martial law,'' he said. ``I even have a medical kit equipped for minor
surgery.''
</P>
<P>
	   As for the 400 boxes of Hamburger Helper in his basement, the 175 pounds of
pasta, 50 bars of soap, nine tubes of toothpaste and other supplies -- they may
be needed yet, Olson said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is hardly over,'' he said. ``Thank God, we got through to night. I
did the happy dance. But I don't think we're out of the woods until May or June.
Plenty of computer problems can turn up between now and then.''
</P>
<P>
	   If they don't, Olson said he would likely donate some provisions to
organizations serving the needy.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's First Baby Is Ailing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- New Zealand's -- and perhaps the world's --
first baby of the millennium has developed health complications and has been
moved to another hospital for special treatment, a hospital official said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The little boy is not well,'' said Rachel Haggerty, general manager for
Auckland's Waitakere Hospital, where he was born. ``He's currently quite
stable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hospital officials, on the instructions of the parents, were not releasing
details of the complications or where he was being treated. The troubles were
discovered right after birth, and he was moved on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy, who has not been named, was born at 12:01 a.m. on Jan. 1 in a
region that was among the first to greet the new year. So far, no claims of
earlier births have been made by the island nation of Tonga, which hit midnight
an hour before New Zealand.

<HEADLINE> Alexander's Numbers Not Enough  </HEADLINE>
    By FRED GOODALL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Michigan's defense never really stopped Shaun Alexander. It
was the Wolverines' offense that finally slowed down the Alabama star in the
Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander rushed for 161 yards on 25 carries and scored three touchdowns,
however, the Southeastern Conference player of the year wasn't much of a factor
in the latter stages of the Crimson Tide's 35-34 overtime loss on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Brady's passing helped Michigan overcome a 28-14 third-quarter deficit.
And once the Wolverines caught up, Alabama abandoned the running game that had
helped it take control of the game after a slow start.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the reasons was penalties. The Crimson Tide finished with 18 for 132
yards, constantly leaving themselves in long yardage situations that forced
Andrew Zow and Tyler Watts to throw more than coach Mike DuBose would have
liked.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was really frustrating," Alexander said. "We would make a big play, then
they would call it back. And (Michigan) would keep making big plays. Whenever we
did shoot ourselves in the foot, they took advantage of it."
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander scored on second-quarter runs of 5 and 6 yards, staking the
Crimson Tide to a 14-0 lead that Brady wiped out with two touchdown passes to
David Terrell.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC's leading rusher finished the first half with 84 yards on 15
carries. He did most of his post-halftime damage on one run, a 50-yard burst up
the middle in which he broke three tackles before outrunning Michigan's Whitley
James to the end zone for a 21-14 Alabama lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Freddie Milons returned a punt 62 yards to put the Crimson Tide up by 14
again. Alabama wouldn't score again until the overtime when Zow faked a handoff
to Alexander and threw to a wide-open Antonio Carter for a TD that trimmed
Michigan's lead to 35-34.
</P>
<P>
	   Ryan Pflugner missed the extra point, giving Michigan the game and the MVP
award to Terrell, who had 10 receptions for 150 yards and three TDs.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a game of inches," said Alexander, who embraced Pflugner in support as
the kicker left the field. "Sometimes it falls for you, and sometimes it
doesn't. We're still really proud of this team. Life goes on, we'll be all
right."
</P>
<P>
	   The senior tailback, just the second player in school history to run for
more than 3,000 in his career, set a Crimson Tide bowl record for rushing TDs in
a game. He fell 5 yards short of the school's rushing mark of 166 set by Sherman
Williams in the 1995 Citrus Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander's 50-yard TD run is the longest against Michigan in a bowl game,
eclipsing the previous long of 46 yards by Alexander in the Outback Bowl three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every team has big players they can count on," Terrell said. "The big
players for each team came to play and came through in the clutch. Shaun did a
great job for Alabama."

<HEADLINE> Missed Kick Dismays Ala.'s Pflunger  </HEADLINE>
    By STEVEN WINE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Ryan Pflugner watched his kick sail barely to the right of the
right upright. Behind the goal post, he could see the Michigan band erupt in a
victory celebration.
</P>
<P>
	   Pflugner collapsed to the ground in dismay. Teammates helped him to his feet
and hugged him, but they could do nothing about his missed kick.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan 35, Alabama 34.
</P>
<P>
	   Pflugner pushed an extra point wide on the final play in overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone is going to blame me," the senior said. "I missed the last kick.
It came down to an extra point I should have made. But it's a team game.
Everyone probably could have done something to make it better."
</P>
<P>
	   Pflugner was right.
</P>
<P>
	   The Alabama defense twice blew a 14-point lead. The offense failed to score
in the fourth quarter. Michigan squandered two scoring chances in the fourth
quarter, but the Crimson Tide failed to take advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Pflugner went 21-for-25 on extra points during the regular season. Teammates
expressed sympathy for their kicker, and running back Shaun Alexander gave him a
hug on the field.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just wanted to let him know I love him and I felt for him a lot,"
Alexander said. "That would be like me fumbling on the last play of the game."
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan scored first in overtime. Alabama's Andrew Zow threw a 21-yard
touchdown pass to Antonio Carter, but Pflugner missed the conversion.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're still going to have a smile on our face," Carter said. "We're going
to pat him on the back and move on. He did a great job for us all year."
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama beat Florida during the regular season in similar circumstances. The
Gators missed an extra point on the final play in overtime to lose 40-39.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's crazy," Alexander said. "Playing this game, you see missed field goals
and missed extra points and you don't know what to think sometimes."

Y2K Chief Wants To Expand Cooperation
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The nations that established a World Bank-backed network to
prepare for Y2K computer problems are considering ways to extend their
cooperation, the U.S. government's top Year 2000 expert said Saturday. As part
of the preparations, John Koskinen said, Latin American nations had produced a
continent-wide map of electricity grids, "something that has never been done
before." An International Y2K Cooperation Center was established in February
1999 under the auspices of the United Nations. Some 170 nations provided
information on critical infrastructure systems such as energy and communications

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Although ATM machines, subway trains, airports and

still await their Y2K test, starting Monday when the world -- particularly the

industry, which spent an estimated $9 billion updating computer systems so they
would not misread 2000 as 1900, had to meet a target of having its systems ready
six months ago. Federal bank examiners aggressively went after stragglers to
ensure 100 percent compliance by December.

<HEADLINE> Japan Emperor Greets New Year Crowd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Amid cheers and waving of flags, Emperor Akihito on Sunday
offered New Year's greetings to tens of thousands of well-wishers at the
imperial palace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am very happy to be able to celebrate the new year with you,'' Akihito
told those in crowd, many of whom were waving the national flag. ``I pray for
happiness for Japan and the world at the beginning of the year.''
</P>
<P>
	   More than 60,000 people gathered on the grounds of the palace in central
Tokyo to hear the greeting and catch a glimpse of the royal family.
</P>
<P>
	   Shouts of ``Long live the emperor'' greeted Akihito, 66, as he stepped out
onto a palace balcony with his family.
</P>
<P>
	   The palace grounds are generally closed to the public, except on Jan. 2 and
the emperor's birthday on Dec. 23. On each occasion, Akihito and his family
generally appear several times to offer greetings.
</P>
<P>
	   Akihito, dressed in a gray silk tie and tails, was accompanied by his wife
Empress Michiko, who wore a flowing, pastel green dress.
</P>
<P>
	   Other family members, including sons Crown Prince Naruhito, Prince Akishino
and daughter Princess Sayako also waved to the crowd. Akishino's wife Princess
Kiko also appeared.
</P>
<P>
	   Absent was Naruhito's wife Princess Masako, who palace officials say is
recovering from surgery for a miscarriage several days ago. Naruhito is next in
line to succeed the Chrysthantheum Throne.

new acting president, on his selection to succeed Boris Yeltsin and assured him
"we are always together on the core points," the White House spokesman said
Saturday. In a 10-minute New Year's morning telephone call, the president told
Putin he believes the acting Russian president is "off to a good start" and that
the move is "encouraging for democracy in Russia," presidential spokesman Joe
Lockhart told reporters. Lockhart said that issues of concern remain on the
table between the two nations, especially over the Russian military thrust into
Chechnya.

Schulz Says Farewell to 'Peanuts'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Snoopy, perched on his doghouse in front of his
typewriter, looks over a farewell message from creator Charles Schulz in the
last new daily "Peanuts" strip, running in newspapers Monday. Schulz, 77, who
has written, drawn, colored and lettered every "Peanuts" strip for almost 50
years, decided to retire after being diagnosed with colon cancer in November.
His contract stipulates that no one else will ever draw the comic strip.
Schulz's beloved cast of characters appear in 2,600 newspapers, reaching an
estimated 355 million readers daily in 75 countries. A final new Sunday strip by
Schulz will run in newspapers on Feb. 13. After that, United Feature Syndicate
will publish "Peanuts" reprints.

Anti-Communism Papers Dropped on Cuba
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A pilot flew a small plane from Florida into Cuban airspace
and dropped anti-communism pamphlets on Havana, Customs officials said. A
Customs radar center in Long Beach, Calif., tracked the single-engine plane once
it left U.S. airspace after departing Tamiami Airport in Miami on Saturday, said
Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan. "His reason for going down was to drop
leaflets, anti-communist leaflets in multiple languages," Sheehan said. While
the man was flying the rented plane over Havana, the Cuban government sent two
MiG fighter jets to monitor his flight until he left Cuban airspace, Sheehan
said.

	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- New Zealand's -- and perhaps the world's --
first baby of the millennium has developed health complications and has been
moved to another hospital for special treatment, a hospital official said
Sunday. Hospital officials, on the instructions of the parents, were not
releasing details of the complications or where he was being treated. The
troubles were discovered right after birth, and he was moved on Saturday. The
boy, who has not been named, was born at 12:01 a.m. on Jan. 1 in a region that
was among the first to greet the new year.

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The nations that established a World Bank-backed network to
prepare for Y2K computer problems are considering ways to extend their
cooperation, the U.S. government's top Year 2000 expert said Saturday. As part
of the preparations, John Koskinen said, Latin American nations had produced a
continent-wide map of electricity grids, "something that has never been done
before." An International Y2K Cooperation Center was established in February
1999 under the auspices of the United Nations. Some 170 nations provided

<TEXT>
<P>
    CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Banks and stock exchanges across the Middle East opened
Sunday for the first time this year and reported no signs of Y2K computer
problems.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, where banks and markets were closed, government agencies and
businesses said there no Y2K malfunctions on the first business day of 2000. As
in many countries, the government's Y2K monitoring center was closed early
Sunday because "there was no reason" to keep it open, said Efraim Lapid, an
administration spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   The stock markets in Kuwait, Cairo and Alexandria were among the first in
the world to open in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The Egyptian markets and the banks carried out mock trading Saturday to test
the transition. Egypt declared Saturday it had successfully bypassed any Y2K
bug-related problems and that all major services -- electricity, telephones and
other utilities -- were operating normally across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Central Bank (of Egypt) has received reports from 50 banks working in
the country that all banking operations were carried out Sunday normally and
with no problems," Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Mahmoud Abu el-Oyoun,
the bank's deputy governor, as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   In Kuwait, where the exchange is considered one of the most active in the
Arab world, officials had worked on potential Y2K problems for a year.

News Agency that "all trading operations were normal and there were no problems
whatsoever."

<HEADLINE> Medication for Infants Studied  </HEADLINE>
    By TIM WHITMIRE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Premature infants on ventilators are also getting a
tiny dose of morphine at the University of Kentucky Children's Hospital, where
doctors say they hope to learn whether the pain medication can improve medical
results for their tiniest patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Ventilators are used for premature infants whose lungs are not sufficiently
developed to allow them to breathe on their own. Though adult patients on
ventilators routinely receive pain medication, such treatment generally has not
been given to premature infants.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, doctors believed that the brains of very young infants were not
sufficiently developed for them to feel or retain subsequent memories of pain
and did not want to run the risk of administering pain-relieving drugs to such
small patients.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, though, research has provided "unequivocal evidence that
(young infants) are more sensitive to pain," said Dr. Nirmala Desai, a
University of Kentucky neonatologist who is overseeing the research at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kentucky hospital is one of a dozen nationwide participating in the
study led by the University of Arkansas and funded by the federal National
Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
	   If the study shows morphine to lead to better results for premature infants,
"I feel like that would become the standard of care," Desai said.
</P>
<P>
	   A preliminary study published earlier this year in the Archives of Pediatric
and Adolescent Medicine suggested that the pain and stress of being on a
ventilator can cause infants to struggle, leading to bleeding in the brain,
softening of brain tissue and even death. University of Kentucky researchers
also participated in that study.
</P>
<P>
	   "They don't allow the respirator to breathe for them," Desai said. "They
fight it. That causes disturbances in the blood flow to the brain."
</P>
<P>
	   The preliminary study also indicated that giving pain medication to infants
on ventilators might reduce their rate of neurological injury -- a hypothesis
which is the basis for the current research.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, which is to last three years, is open to premature infants who
are on ventilators for more than three days and who are born at less than 32
weeks gestation. Pregnancy usually lasts from 38 to 42 weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Infants entering the study will be randomly assigned to receive either a
constant low dose of morphine or a placebo. Any of the placebo-receiving infants
who show signs of pain or discomfort will also be given morphine.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing at a Dec. 21 news conference with Desai and Dr. Thomas Pauly, the
medical director of the University of Kentucky Children's Hospital, were Kelly
Kearns and Matt Brandon. Their son, Austin Brandon, was born Nov. 24 after just
24 1/2 weeks of gestation and weighed one pound, 10 ounces.
</P>
<P>
	   Though she was made somewhat nervous by the prospect of her son being given
morphine, Kearns said she still decided to enroll Austin in the study. "The way
I understood the study, there were no disadvantages to it," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't want my baby to be in pain, so it seemed to be the way to go,"
Matt Brandon said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the study is "blind," neither the parents nor Desai know whether
Austin is receiving morphine or a placebo.

<HEADLINE> Democrats face fiscal mess as they take over Nassau legislature  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) - When Judy Jacobs moved to Long Island in 1967,
there were still corn fields and cabbage patches in Nassau County.
<P>
	   "I thought it was always going to be that way," she recalls. Then one
morning she awakened to the sight of a four-story office building going up in
her Woodbury neighborhood. "And we said lo and behold, we'd better get involved
in our own community."
</P>
<P>
	   Getting involved, it turns out, was just the start of it.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Sen. Charles Schumer and many of the state's top Democrats will
join Jacobs as she is sworn in as the presiding officer of the Nassau County
Legislature - the first Democrat to hold such a powerful post in the
Republican-dominated county in more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
	   But the time for celebrating will be brief for Jacobs and her fellow
lawmakers, who need to immediately tackle a budget deficit that state
Comptroller H. Carl McCall says could rise as high as $190 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unfortunately, we've inherited an absolute mess here," Jacobs said. She
said the budget shortfall, which fueled a voter revolt last November that ousted
five Republicans and gave Democrats a 10-9 majority, is "worse than I think most
people believed."
</P>
<P>
	   "There's been such ineptitude and such mismanagement and such a lack of
accountability and communication that it's beyond our wildest thoughts as to
what we were about to uncover," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacobs, a plainspoken, raspy-voiced mother of three grown children, first
ran for the Oyster Bay town board in 1977. She remained active in civic groups
and county politics, but never won any race until she was elected to the county
legislature four years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   After decades of domination by one of the strongest Republican political
machines in the country, Jacobs admits she was as shocked as anyone when the
election results last November yielded a Democratic upset.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never thought we'd take the majority," she says. "I did think - and I've
been in politics long enough - I thought there was something happening."
</P>
<P>
	   Jacobs knows that with only a 28 percent voter turnout and a one-vote
majority, the Democrats can't exactly claim a mandate. "You know what I think it
is, it's a call for changing 'business as usual.' And if the Democrats don't
provide it, then we're going to be thrown out in two years."
</P>
<P>
	   She vows to improve the legislature's committee process and intends to seek
testimony from every department head in county government to examine where
budget savings can be found.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the first thing we owe to the people this county is to truly do
some investigative work," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The county has already seen its bond rating reduced to nearly junk level,
but Jacobs hopes Wall Street "will be willing to give us a month or two to get
our feet on the ground. Because they really have no way of judging what's about
to happen in Nassau County."
</P>
<P>
	   She noted this will be the first time Republican County Executive Thomas
Gulotta will have to work with a Democratic legislature. "They don't know how
effective he'll be," she said. "So a lot of good things might happen."
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Gulotta says he is "optimistic that we can forge a bipartisan
effort that will benefit all the residents of the county."
</P>
<P>
	   Gulotta contends that despite the fiscal woes, Nassau is "still rated one of
the best counties to live in, according to national surveys." He said the crime
rate is at its lowest point in 30 years, the unemployment rate is the lowest in
the state and welfare rolls have been cut 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mr. Gulotta ... to his credit, didn't raise the general property tax for
eight of nine years," says County Comptroller Fred Parolla, also a Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   "So what you had was a shrinking or stabilized general property tax fund and
increasing burdens. Quite obviously, the way that we got here is that you have
escalating costs."
</P>
<P>
	   Only 19 percent of a Nassau homeowner's property tax bill comes from the
county, Gulotta said. The remainder comes from school, village and town taxes.
The county portion amounts to about $980 annually, Gulotta said.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest portion of the county levy goes for police protection; Parolla
said that with overtime, a police officer averages $110,000 annually. But
Gulotta noted that police salaries have risen because of binding arbitration.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nassau refuses to give in during negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his party affiliation, Parolla thinks a Democratic takeover of the
legislature may not be so bad.
</P>
<P>
	   "The people have spoken. They're angry. Nassau County is a joke. It's one of
the most affluent areas in the world to live, a wonderful place to live and yet
you have this anomaly that the county government is in the red."
</P>
<P>
	   It remains to be seen how the Democratic victory in Nassau County will
affect the upcoming Senate race, but Jacobs agrees with those who think the
suburbs will be a key.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it throws us right into the ballgame," Jacobs said. "I think it
shows that the people of the suburbs have a very strong thought process. That
they will go either way. ... Nobody should be taken for granted and nobody
should ever write us off."

<HEADLINE> Russia Claims Inroads in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
   By MIGUEL GIL MORENO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTHERN CHECHNYA, Russia (AP) -- Russian military advances into rebel-held
southern Chechnya are trapping civilians in cellars and sending others fleeing
through snowy mountain passes and forests littered with corpses, Chechen
officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   After days of heavy fighting, the Russian military claimed Sunday to have
made inroads into Chechnya's southern mountains, capturing strategic heights
overlooking Vedeno, a major rebel stronghold. Russian forces can now position
artillery on the heights, making it easier to drive the rebels out of Vedeno.
</P>
<P>
	   But the constant air and artillery attacks that precede the advance of
Russian troops have left civilians trapped in southern mountain villages, afraid
to venture under the bombs and shells raining on the roads, Chechen officials
and civilians said.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents of the capital Grozny who had fled the city in hopes of escaping
to Georgia, which borders Chechnya to the south, have been stuck in the villages
of Itum-Kale, 50 miles south of Grozny, and Shatoi, 35 miles south of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People cannot venture out of their homes because the shelling continues
around the clock,'' said Ramzan Bisiyev, head of the village administration in
Rodina, just outside the capital Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   Bisiyev, an Itum-Kale native, was trying Sunday to negotiate with Russian
authorities for a safe corridor so civilians could leave southern Chechnya for
Russian-controlled areas in the north.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In despair, people go through the forests, along mountain passes, and come
under artillery fire. A lot of dead bodies lie around those forests,'' said
Bisiyev, who visited southern Chechnya last week.
</P>
<P>
	   No figures were available on the number of civilians trapped in the south,
but Bisiyev said only about 10 percent of residents had managed to leave the
area.
</P>
<P>
	   Having swept across the plains in Chechnya's north, Russian forces have been
trying to crush rebel fighters concentrated in the mountainous south.
</P>
<P>
	   After taking the heights near Vedeno, the Russian forces seized a large
cache of arms and ammunition, including grenade launchers, two anti-aircraft
rocket launchers and several flame-throwers, said Maj. Alexander Diordiev, a
military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian forces also kept up air and artillery bombardments of Grozny -- the
only rebel-controlled town in Chechnya's north -- as a major offensive to take
the city entered a second week. Russian commanders said their forces fought off
an overnight rebel attack on federal artillery positions northwest of Grozny, on
the Tersky Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian commanders claimed their ground forces were making progress in
Grozny, but the federal forces still appeared to be far from taking the city
center from rebel fighters in heavily fortified positions.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian media reported a chlorine cloud over Grozny on Sunday, and the
military accused rebels of using chemical bombs. Both sides have repeatedly
accused the other of using chemical weapons during this war, but the claims have
not been verified.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops entered Chechnya in September after Chechen-based militants
invaded a neighboring region and were blamed for apartment bombings elsewhere in
Russia. Russians terrified of the kidnappings and other violence that has
plagued the Caucasus region in recent years largely support the war.
</P>
<P>
	   A 49-year-old woman held captive for three months in Chechnya escaped and
walked for four nights to reach the border with the neighboring Russian region
of Ingushetia on Saturday night, ITAR-Tass reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Larisa Mzokova said she was kept in a cellar and escaped when her guard fell
asleep. Mzokova, who was kidnapped from her house in the nearby republic of
South Ossetia, said she stayed away from the roads in Chechnya during her
flight, fearing a chase.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, two Russian soldiers, Andrei Drozhenov and Vladimir Ulyanov, both 19,
were freed from captivity in Chechnya during a special operation by Russian
security forces, ITAR-Tass reported Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hails Yeltsin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton hailed Boris Yeltsin in a magazine essay
as the ``Father of Russian Democracy'' but said how Yeltsin's successor handles
such ``unfinished business'' as corruption and the war in Chechnya will
determine Russia's place among nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin's successor, Vladimir Putin, has been a moving force behind Russia's
attack on the rebellious region of Chechnya, a campaign of which Clinton has
been an outspoken critic. Clinton suggested that the outcome in Chechnya would
set the tone for relations between the new leadership in Moscow and other
nations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The question for President Yeltsin's successors is not only how to
liberate Grozny without killing thousands of civilians; it's also whether this
war becomes a model for how to deal with other problems involving terrorists and
separatists,'' Clinton wrote in the essay that appears in the Jan. 1 issue of
Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Russia has to find the right balance between the use of effective force
and decent respect for individual rights and international norms,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to helping the Russian economy grow, Putin must do more to fight
crime and corruption, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unless that battle is joined ... the democratic norms and the market
economy that have been Yeltsin's prime focus can be undone,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also noted there have been ``plenty of strains'' in U.S.-Russian
relations and that many observers have questioned the value of partnership
between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``President Yeltsin and I believed our countries should, whenever and
wherever possible, work together on our many common interests and work hard to
keep our disagreements from preventing us from cooperating in other areas,''
Clinton wrote, listing the dismantling of 5,000 nuclear weapons, the withdrawal
of Russian troops from the Balkans and efforts to liberalize the Russian economy
and bolster democracy as successes of the policy of engagement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Russia's new leaders -- the generation to whom Boris Yeltsin gave the
stage last Friday -- endorse this as firmly as he did, they will find in America
an eager and active partner,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> New Jersey has contributed to few presidential tickets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Bill Bradley and Steve Forbes are challenging history
as well as front-runners in their respective quests for the Democratic and
Republican nominations for president.
<P>
	   Through two-plus centuries, New Jersey has contributed a mere handful of
favorite sons to presidential tickets. Besides Woodrow Wilson and Grover
Cleveland - the latter remembered more as a New Yorker than for his Garden State
ties - New Jersey's contribution has totaled three vice presidential candidates,
two of whom were on losing tickets.
</P>
<P>
	   President selections are determined by numerous factors, of course, many of
them specific to a given year and field of candidates. But for many decades at
least, New Jersey roots may have hindered aspiring leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   "For a long time, the presidential nominations and vice presidential
nominations went to people from large and closely competitive states," said
Gerald Pomper, a political scientist at Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute
of Politics. "The idea was, the home state advantage would give you extra votes
and have a big weight in the electoral college. New Jersey was never one of
those humongous states."
</P>
<P>
	   The first New Jerseyan on a major party's presidential ticket was Theodore
Frelinghuysen. He represented the state in the U.S. Senate for six years before
being tapped as Henry Clay's vice presidential partner on the Whig Party ticket
in 1844. Clay won New Jersey but lost the election to Democrat James K. Polk of
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   (Truth be told, Frelinghuysen was a former New Jerseyan by the time he
joined the ticket, having moved to New York to be chancellor of New York
University. But he later returned to New Jersey as president of Rutgers
College.)
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey produced a second vice presidential candidate 12 years later,
former senator William L. Dayton. The new antislavery Republican Party chose him
in 1856 to join the ticket led by John C. Fremont, whose explorations of the
American West had earned him the nickname "the Pathfinder."
</P>
<P>
	   In winning the No. 2 slot on the ticket, Dayton overcame pretty good
competition: Abraham Lincoln. But Fremont lost to Democrat James Buchanan, who
carried New Jersey despite Dayton's presence on the other ticket.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty years passed until New Jersey provided the nation with a vice
president - and almost a president.
</P>
<P>
	   Garret A. Hobart was born in Long Branch and became a wealthy and
politically active lawyer in Paterson. He served in the state legislature and
became active in the national Republican Party, which tapped him in 1896 to run
as vice president on a winning ticket headed by William McKinley of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   When McKinley was assassinated in 1901, six months into his second term, his
vice president ascended to the Oval Office. By then, however, Hobart himself was
deceased. His successor as McKinley's No. 2, Theodore Roosevelt, finished
McKinley's term and then won a second term.
</P>
<P>
	   In the case of presidents, Cleveland was born in Caldwell (where his
birthplace is now a national museum) and retired to Princeton. But he arrived at
the White House as a New Yorker, having been mayor of Buffalo, and then governor
of New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson, by contrast, was born in Staunton, Va., lived in Georgia and studied

<HEADLINE> China UFO Sightings Reported  </HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES HUTZLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PUSALU VILLAGE, China (AP) -- Poor farmers in Beijing's barren hills saw it:
an object swathed in colored light arcing heavenward that some say must have
been a UFO.
</P>
<P>
	   They're not alone. People in 12 other Chinese cities reported possible UFO
sightings last month. UFO researchers, meanwhile, were busy looking into claims
of an alien abduction in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   At the beginning of the new millennium, China is astir with sightings of
otherworldly visitors. Such sightings are treated with unexpected seriousness in
this country usually straightjacketed by its communist rulers.
</P>
<P>
	   China has a bimonthly magazine -- circulation 400,000 -- devoted to UFO
research. The conservative state-run media report UFO sightings. UFO buffs claim
support from eminent scientists and liaisons with the secretive military, giving
their work a scientific sheen of respectability.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some of these sightings are real, some are fake and with others its
unclear,'' said Shen Shituan, a real rocket scientist, president of Beijing
Aerospace University and honorary director of the China UFO Research
Association. ``All these phenomena are worth researching.''
</P>
<P>
	   Research into UFOs will help spur new forms of high-speed travel, unlimited
sources of energy and faster-growing crops, claims Sun Shili, president of the
government-approved UFO Research Association (membership 50,000).
</P>
<P>
	   A foreign trade expert and a Spanish translator for Mao Tse-tung, Sun saw a
UFO nearly 30 years ago while at a labor camp for ideologically suspect
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was extremely bright and not very big,'' said Sun. ``At that time, I
had no knowledge of UFOs. I thought it was a probe sent by the Soviet
revisionists.''
</P>
<P>
	   For thousands of years, Chinese have looked to the skies for portents of
change on Earth. While China is passing through its first millennium using the
West's Gregorian calendar, the traditional lunar calendar is ushering in the
Year of the Dragon, regarded as time of tumultuous change.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All of that sort of millennial fear and trepidation fits in so nicely with
Chinese cosmology -- and also the Hollywood propaganda that everybody's been
lapping up,'' said Geremie Barme, a Chinese culture watcher at Australia
National University.
</P>
<P>
	   In Pusalu, a patch of struggling corn and bean farms 30 miles from Beijing,
villagers believe cosmic forces were at play on Dec. 11. As they tell it, an
object the size of a person shimmering with golden light moved slowly up into
the sky from the surrounding arid mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was so beautiful, sort of yellow,'' villager Wang Cunqiao said. ``It
was like someone flying up to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
	   What ``it'' was remains a topic of debate. Many villagers are fervent
Buddhists. But local leaders want to play down any religious overtones, fearing
that government censure may spoil plans to attract tourism to Pusalu.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some say it was caused by an earthquake. Some say it was a UFO. Some say
it was a ray of Buddha. I'm telling everyone to call it an auspicious sign,''
said Chen Jianwen, village secretary for the officially atheistic Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
	   State media ignored religious interpretations and labeled the celestial
events in Pusalu, Beijing, Shanghai and 10 other Chinese cities in December as
possible UFOs. But UFO researchers have largely dismissed the sightings as
airplane trails catching the low sun.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the military didn't chase it, it's because they knew it wasn't a UFO.
They were probably testing a new aircraft,'' said Chen Yanchun, a shipping
company executive who helps manage the China UFO Research Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Operating from a dingy three-room flat in a Beijing apartment block, the
Resource Center keeps a version of China's X-Files: 140 dictionary-sized boxes
of fading newspaper clippings and eyewitness accounts of sightings. The
collection has, among others items, accounts that the military scrambled planes
in 1998 in an unsuccessful pursuit of a UFO.
</P>
<P>
	   Chen said the center has had 500 reported UFO sightings in 1999, but after
investigation confirmed cases will likely number 200 or so. He's currently
checking on a worker's claims that aliens entered his Beijing home in early
December and, with his wife and child present, spirited him 165 miles east and
back in a few hours.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The increase in flying saucer incidents is natural,'' said Chen, a former
Aerospace Ministry researcher with a Ph.D. in aerodynamics. He cited more
manmade aerospace activity and radio signals from Earth penetrating farther into
space.
</P>
<P>
	   Sun has another theory: He believes aliens may find China attractive for the
same reason foreign investors and tourists do.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's very possible that relatively rapid development attracts
investigations by flying saucers, and here in China we're becoming more
developed,'' he said. ``Generally, well-developed areas like the United States
have reported more sightings.''

<HEADLINE> Banks Expect Few Problems Monday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans shouldn't have any problems withdrawing cash
from ATMs or making trades on Wall Street as banks, stock exchanges and other
financial institutions open for business on Monday after the holiday weekend,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Banks and savings and loans escaped the Y2K computer changeover unscathed
with no major problems reported over the New Year's weekend. Banking and
industry officials expect more of the same on Monday when business is expected
to pick up after the holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   "At this point, we expect business as usual on Monday," Federal Reserve
spokeswoman Rose Pianalto said Sunday. The Fed will continue to check in with
banks and other financial institutions on Monday to see how their computer
systems are performing, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   With Americans back to work on Monday, traffic at automated teller machines
should increase but "I expect things will run smoothly and then there will be a
big sigh of relief," said Kurt Helwig, executive director of the Electronic
Funds Transfer Association, which represents the nation's major ATMs.
</P>
<P>
	   The securities industry also expected a smooth Monday as major exchanges
reopen for business after a brief holiday break.
</P>
<P>
	   "As of now, we are expecting business as usual. The preliminary signs have
been extremely encouraging," said Margaret Draper, a spokeswoman for the
Securities Industry Association. Draper said that over-the-weekend processing of
trades entered on Dec. 29 occurred without any serious problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Major U.S. exchanges expect to open normal time Monday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything is good to go for Monday," said Nasdaq spokeswoman Nancy Condon.
She said Nasdaq conducted a test trading day Saturday and everything went
without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration's Y2K point person, John Koskinen, also believes
that banks and financial institutions will fare just fine on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those industries have been at the head of the parade. We have no
expectation of any serious problems," he said on NBC's "Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. banking industry has spent an estimated $9 billion updating
computer systems so they would not misread 2000 as 1900.
</P>
<P>
	   And, the Fed since October has delivered $80 billion in cash to banks to
meet unexpected demands.
</P>
<P>
	   While there had been concerns that banks in other nations could experience
problems that might have an impact in the United States, officials said that as
of Sunday no major problems had developed.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Banker Delays Departure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The governor of the Bank of Israel extended his term by a
week on Sunday, allowing Prime Minister Ehud Barak the extra time to name a
successor.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacob Frenkel had expected to wind up his 8 1/2-year tenure at midnight, but
a bank statement said he accepted Barak's request to work another week until a
successor can be named.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has been preoccupied with relaunching talks with Syria. The talks
begin Monday. The Bank of Israel statement said Barak promised Frenkel he would
name a successor by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1954 Bank of Israel Law does not foresee a bank without a governor, nor
does it provide a mechanism for naming an interim governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Markets haven't reacted to the absence of a replacement governor because
Barak has taken pains to say Frenkel's tight money policy won't change.
</P>
<P>
	   But both the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and the foreign currency market were
closed Sunday in connection with Y2K preparedness, so an immediate reaction
couldn't be gauged.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has known since August of Frenkel's intention to resign. The clock
started ticking publicly when Frenkel announced his plans Nov. 14 -- but Barak
and Finance Minister Avraham Shochat haven't managed to agree on a candidate who
wants the job.
</P>
<P>
	   Shochat is known to have adamantly opposed Barak's plan to appoint former
Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman as the new central bank chief. With inflation
rates at about 8 percent and unemployment topping 9 percent, Shochat knows
Neeman could be politically unpalatable. A prominent tax lawyer who favors a
tight monetary policy, Neeman is associated with the interests of the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
	   Shochat and Finance Ministry sources wouldn't respond when asked whether
Neeman is still a candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak is expected to spend a week, possibly two, in peace talks with Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa.

<HEADLINE> Hitch Stops Oil Tanker Monitoring  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BREST, France (AP) -- An underwater robot monitoring the wreckage of an
oil-filled tanker perilously submerged off France's Atlantic coast is jammed and
has stopped relaying images, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The robot, which had been in operation for only 12 hours, was keeping tabs
on the tanker which split in half on Dec. 12, pouring at least 3 million gallons
of oil into the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities had hoped to use the robot's pictures to determine how to remove
the tanker's remaining oil cargo. December's powerful storms in France caused
more oil to seep out of the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Investigations for the time being have been interrupted,'' the local said
in a statement Sunday, adding that a second robot will soon be sent down to try
and repair the existing one.
</P>
<P>
	   The Franco-Belgian oil company TotalFina, which had chartered the tanker,
has offered to pay $6 million to aid the massive cleanup of the region's
coastline. The tanker was carrying refined heavy oil from Rotterdam,
Netherlands, to Leghorn, Italy.
</P>
<P>
	   The oil has spread along 250 miles of coastline, killing thousands of birds.
On Saturday, rescue teams found two struggling seals caked in thick oil.
</P>
<P>
	   After drifting southwards, more patches of oil appeared Sunday on the coast
of the Ile de Re island just south of Brittany.
</P>
<P>
	   Specialists and volunteers continued shoveling up the thick black residue
off beaches, and 500 schoolchildren from across the country were to join the
cleanup on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We began cleaning on Friday and will continue tomorrow and for days to
come,'' local official Jacques Neveur said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   France's environment minister, Dominique Voynet, has come under fire for
initially underestimating the gravity of the oil spill. She said in December
that it was not an ecological disaster.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview published Sunday by Le Journal de Dimanche, Voynet, a member
of the Green Party, admitted she hadn't handled the affair well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This week has been tough. In a few weeks the moment will come to draw
conclusions,'' she was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who led the Green Party's list in June's European
Parliament elections, said in an interview with the newspaper Le Parisien on
Sunday that Voynet had committed ``a serious error.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Foreign Policy Outlook Better  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost imperceptibly, the Clinton administration has put
together a string of foreign policy advances, a trend reassuring to officials
with memories of what was a decidedly grim international picture just a few
months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   As a new year begins, officials are highlighting a modest revival of
U.S.-Chinese relations following a long period in the deep freeze. Prospects for
peace in the Mideast have brightened and there have been long strides toward a
permanent settlement in Northern Ireland. The situation in Kosovo has
stabilized. And a sore point with much of the rest of the world -- the United
States' skipping out on its dues owed the United Nations -- has been partially
put to rest.
</P>
<P>
	   For Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, officials say there was no moment
more discouraging than the lonely, late night trek she made to the Chinese
Embassy last May 7 to apologize to Ambassador Li Zhao Xing for the accidental
NATO bombing of Beijing's Embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides the three Chinese who were killed and the many injured, another
casualty was U.S.-Chinese relations, which the United States had been
assiduously nurturing. After the bombing, ties with Beijing went into a deep
freeze for months.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a difficult time for President Clinton and his foreign policy team
and not only because of the problems with China. Israelis and Palestinians were
not implementing the U.S.-brokered Wye River agreement they had reached in
October 1998. Perceived military posturing by North Korea was generating anxiety
in Northeast Asia. And there were grave doubts about whether NATO's air war over
Yugoslavia would produce a positive outcome.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, almost eight months later, grounds for hope exist. Some reasons:
</P>
<P>
	   --U.S.-Chinese relations have revived somewhat after their mid-year chill.
The two countries were able to reach a trade agreement this past fall that will
enable China to join the World Trade Organization, which sets rules for
international commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   --With the help of almost 50,000 mostly-European forces, the situation in
Kosovo has stabilized for the time being. NATO's air war over Yugoslavia proved
far more effective in bringing Yugoslavia to heel than skeptics had believed.
All Kosovo Albanians who were evicted from the province by Yugoslav forces have
returned. But the goal of ethnic harmony between the Albanians and Serbs seems
far off.
</P>
<P>
	   --With a nudge from U.S. diplomacy, Israeli and Syrian leaders have resumed
peace talks for the first time in almost four years. A crucial new round of
discussions begins on Monday in West Virginia. Meanwhile, the tone of
Israeli-Palestinian relations has improved markedly but progress on substance
remains difficult.
</P>
<P>
	   --North Korea has bowed to U.S. insistence that it not go ahead with a test
of a long-range missile. The prospect of a new test on the heels of one in 1998
had been causing alarm in much of Northeast Asia. Officials caution, however,
that it is too early to declare victory in their bid to wean Pyongyang on to a
peaceful path.
</P>
<P>
	   --With an assist from the United States, a new Protestant-Catholic
government has taken power in Northern Ireland, where war has flared
intermittently for 30 years. Resistance to disarmament by paramilitaries remains
a potential obstacle to a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
	   --An enormous headache for the administration was eased when Congress voted
in December to pay $926 million in U.N. arrears over three years. U.N.
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke called the vote a ``terrain-changing event.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Clinton administration has made a lot of progress in foreign policy,''
says Lee Hamilton, a former Democratic chairman of the House International
Relations Committee who now heads the Wilson Center, a research group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The big relationships are heading in the right direction,'' he says,
citing U.S. ties with Japan and the European Union. One question mark among
analysts, however, is the future of U.S.-Russian relations now that Boris
Yeltsin has stepped down as president.
</P>
<P>
	   Helmut Sonnenfeldt of the Brookings Institution isn't sure the positive
trend of recent months means very much.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a whole host of things that in some respects are better. Whether
they are fundamentally better you can't tell,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
	   John Bolton, a one-time top aide to former Secretary of State James A.
Baker, believes 2000 will be fraught with dangers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The past year has been a year of things that didn't happen,'' Bolton says.
There could be military tensions with China, he says, at the time of Taiwan's
presidential elections in March, much as there were when the last such elections
were held, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Bolton also is concerned that Iraq may be developing weapons of mass
destruction with impunity now that more than a year has passed since President
Saddam Hussein forced U.N. weapons inspectors out.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.N. Security Council resolution approved last month authorizes a new
weapons inspection system but Iraq says it won't cooperate. For Saddam, the
downside of this stance is that U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq, now almost
nine years old, will remain in place.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Foley says Iraq is increasingly isolated in
the Middle East. Citing the progress Israel and its neighbors have been making,
Foley says, ``The forces of peace are back in the ascendance. It is not a
regional context that is beneficial to Saddam.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hamilton also finds Iraq a worrisome problem but says the United States must
also deal with a larger issue, one that relates to the preeminent place of the
United States as a global military and economic power.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How do we use it for good and for the achievement of American and national
interests?'' he asks. That's the great challenge in foreign policy as we move
into the year ahead.''

<HEADLINE> Crisis-Free Y2K Could Boost Markets  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stock market averages powered their way to record
highs as 1999 ended despite some lingering worries about the Year 2000 computer
conversion.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, with market officials around the world reporting no major system
troubles, many analysts expect stocks to soar anew.
</P>
<P>
	   "We could see a new wave of money coming into the market based entirely on
the good news about Y2K," said Jim Weiss, deputy chief investment officer for
equities at State Street Research and Management Co. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   All major U.S. stock market indicators ended 1999 at record highs, with the
Nasdaq composite index capping a spectacular rise of nearly 86 percent for the
year. The Nasdaq, Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 all
completed an unprecedented fifth straight year of double-digit percentage gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Many major world stock market indicators also are beginning the new year at
all-time highs.
</P>
<P>
	   This weekend's smooth sailing on Y2K removed one obstacle to a continued
stock-buying binge.
</P>
<P>
	   Market analysts and Y2K gurus caution that the full impact of the computer
conversion isn't known yet, and may not be clear for days or weeks. But weekend
tests, and early trading in Middle Eastern markets that opened for business on
Sunday, showed little evidence of the problems that many feared.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, banks, stock exchanges and other financial services companies
said their systems were fully operational on Saturday and will be ready for
business on Monday. The 48 organizations reporting to the Financial Services
Coordination and Communication Center also includes electronic communications
networks, which trade stocks online, and government securities dealers.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Tokyo's stock exchange reported no problems in trading or clearing
systems. But a number of small brokerages reported glitches in a recordkeeping
system developed by Nomura Research Institute. Nomura said it hopes to fix the
problem by late Sunday. Japanese financial markets are closed until Tuesday,
giving exchange officials an extra day to run tests.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kuwait Stock Exchange offered one of the first true tests, opening for a
full trading session on Sunday. Safaak al-Rukeibi, deputy general manager, told
the Kuwait News Agency that "all trading operations were normal and there were
no problems whatsoever."
</P>
<P>
	   Market officials in Singapore, Cairo and Rome also proclaimed their
readiness for trading this week. That's good news to market watchers in the
United States, who believe businesses and financial exchanges here are the best
prepared in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   "The U.S. and Europe have been aware of Y2K for far too long, and have spent
far too much money, to have left things unchecked," Weiss said. "Most big
systems have been subjected to three to six months of testing, and should be
more than ready."
</P>
<P>
	   With market enthusiasm running high, a smooth conversion could provide some
extra punch, Weiss added.
</P>
<P>
	   "There has been a bit of a cautionary approach in the way investors have
allocated new money," he said, citing an influx of money into more conservative
money market funds. That could change if investors perceive the successful
conversion to Y2K as reason to pour money into the buoyant market.
</P>
<P>
	   In the next few weeks, the market will also face a host of seasonal factors
that could be magnified in the wake of Y2K, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The first couple of months of the year are generally good months for the
market as year-end bonuses and tax refunds are put into investments," said
Charles G. Crane, chief market strategist at Key Asset Management. "This year,
the IRS may be working overtime to get refunds back to people early and prove
that they had no Y2K-related difficulties."
</P>
<P>
	   Year 2000 worries, however, aren't the market's only concern. The market's
course in early 2000 will be determined largely by the Federal Reserve. The Fed,
highly concerned about the scorching pace of economic growth, raised interest
rates three times in 1999 but left rates unchanged at their last meeting of the
year, saying they wanted to help ensure a smooth transition into Y2K.
</P>
<P>
	   The glitch-free conversion could encourage the Fed to resume tightening
rates as soon as their next meeting, scheduled for Feb. 1 and 2, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The consensus is that they'll raise rates 25 basis points," or a
quarter-percentage point, said Crane. "There's a growing view that they could go
as far as 50 basis points."
</P>
<P>
	   An increase of 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, would be the
steepest increase in the federal funds rate since a boost from 5.50 percent to
6.0 percent on Feb. 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Another possible tightening of credit could come if the Fed, as expected,
starts draining billions of dollars from the banking system. The Fed had been
generous in providing banks with extra cash in advance of the year 2000 in
anticipation that consumers would be making bigger-than-usual withdrawals to
prepare for any problems with automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
	   With no big runs on bank accounts, that surplus money is expected to be
removed from the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Many analysts expect the next few weeks to bring a modest reversal of
fortunes for U.S. stock sectors. Technology shares, which soared in the last
half of the year, may finally be ripe for some profit-taking, Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors would have loved to have booked their profits in recent weeks,
but many held off to avoid tax penalties," he said. Selling now would allow
investors to pay capital-gains taxes in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, many of the sectors neglected in the frenzy for
technology shares could rebound, said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist
at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been in a very selective market," he said. "But we believe the market
is ready to broaden out."

<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- The people have spoken, and to no one's surprise they want
more Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
	   Ty Inc. had stunned collectors by saying it would "retire" the bean bag
critters, but then announced that it would let consumers vote on whether the
company should continue to pump them out.
</P>
<P>
	   Ninety-one percent of the consumers who took the trouble to surf into Ty's
Web site voted in favor of continued production of the little collectibles, the
company announced on its Web site Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Skeptics had suspected that owner Ty Warner planned all along to continue
Beanies in some form. Warner has, after all, expanded his factories and has
several trademark applications pending for Beanies with new names.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the spirit of P.T. Barnum still alive," toy analyst Chris Byrne said
when the vote was announced. "How do you milk even more publicity out of a
4-inch stuffed toy?"
</P>
<P>
	   In all, 209,763 voted in the election that ran from 6 a.m. Dec. 31 until 6
a.m. January 2. Ninety-one percent voted in favor of continuing the line and
only 9 percent voted against it, the Web site said.
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives of the company, based in Oak Brook, didn't respond to calls
for comment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Each vote cost 50 cents, with all the proceeds going to the Elizabeth Glaser
Pediatric AIDS Foundation. Because Ty announced it would contribute three times
the amount spent to vote, nearly $420,000 was raised for the foundation, said
Mary Beth Sobolewski, editor-in-chief of Mary Beth's Bean Bag World Monthly,
which has a business relationship with the company.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Scandal Could Grow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The financial scandal dogging former chancellor Helmut Kohl
appeared poised to spread Sunday, as legislators pressed his successor as head
of the Christian Democrat party to explain a large money transfer from
legislators to the party's main accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Revised financial statements the party filed Friday showed that the party's
legislators transferred $575,000 to the party in January 1997. Legislators from
the Greens, junior members in Germany's governing coalition, quickly called on
Wolfgang Schaeuble, the Christian Democrats' longtime leader in parliament and
current party chairman, to explain the transfer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it is confirmed, under Schaeuble's leadership of the party faction,
that money from the faction flowed to the party contrary to party laws, then
this is now also a case against Schaeuble,'' Volker Beck, the Greens' legal
expert, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Christian Democrats' legal adviser, Andreas Schmidt, rejected the
accusations as unfounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Though no one has offered evidence that the transaction was illegal, it has
raised eyebrows in the wake of the Kohl scandal. Kohl has admitted receiving up
to $1 million in secret cash contributions for the party from 1993 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Up to now, members of Kohl's own party have been laying all the blame for
financial irregularities on Kohl, who ruled the party with a strong hand for 25
years, 16 of them as chancellor, until his defeat in 1998. Politicians across
the spectrum have called on him to reveal the names of the donors who gave him
the money, but Kohl has refused to break his word to keep their names secret.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, prosecutors in Bonn are scheduled to officially open an
investigation against Kohl for possible criminal charges. Kohl is still a
legislator and has immunity from prosecution. Parliament would have to lift the
immunity before any charges could go forward.
</P>
<P>
	   Schmidt, the Christian Democrats' adviser, said the new transaction being
called into question involved money from a monthly $25 fee that parliament
members paid to their faction, or caucus. He said the account had to be closed
because of a change in the law.
</P>
<P>
	   The transfer of money was handled ``completely legally correctly,'' he said,
adding that no party law had been violated.
</P>
<P>
	   The parliament faction's financial manager, Joachim Hoerster, told the Welt
am Sonntag newspaper on Sunday that the transfer was his suggestion. He said the
account contained ``on the whole'' deposits from the membership fees.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Greens' party faction chairman, Rezzo Schlauch, told Welt am Sonntag
he doubted that the fees alone would have created such a large pot of money.

<HEADLINE> Putin Fate May Depend on Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though his hard line on Chechnya has driven up his
popularity, acting Russian President Vladimir Putin's political future may
depend whether he settles the conflict peacefully, top Clinton administration
officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Having ascended to the presidency following Boris Yeltsin's surprise New
Year's Eve resignation, Putin is the early favorite in the March elections. But
a Chechnian quagmire may bring him down, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Chechnya now is a dilemma,'' National Security Adviser Samuel Berger said
on ABC's ``This Week.'' ``If it goes on too long, or if it begins to cause
increasing Russian casualties, as we seem to be seeing now, with an intensified
resistance, this could become something that mires Putin down, and the wave he
rode up could become the wave that engulfs him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Putin has been an outspoken supporter of Russia's military intervention in
Chechnya, defending it against criticism in the West. On his first full day as
acting president, he visited Russian forces in Chechnya to praise them for the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Chechnya war won't be settled on the battlefield but around a
negotiating table, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on NBC's ``Meet
the Press.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There can only be a political solution to this,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   The outcome of the war also will set the tone for relations between Moscow
and other nations, President Clinton said in a farewell essay to Yeltsin
published in Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Clinton administration officials said the peaceful handoff of
power to Putin bode well for Russia's democratic future.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This transfer of power is something we believe has taken place
democratically,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, there was an element of uncertainty with Putin, aides warned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So far, we're pleased with the statements that he's made about affirming
Russian democracy, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of
conscience, private property,'' Berger said. ``But I don't think we yet have all
the answers as to where Mr. Putin -- what direction he intends to lead Russia.
We hope that it will continue to be the democratic direction.''
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials noted that Putin was a member of the KGB, the
Russian spy agency, but also was part of the reformist government of the city of
St. Petersburg. ``He has been a prime reformer,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   And Dmitri Yakushkin, Russian deputy chief of administration, said Putin's
KGB pedigree should not be of concern.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can name you a number of Americans who worked for the CIA and became
great statesmen,'' Yakushkin said on NBC. ``The KGB was part of the government
structure. People who worked in the KGB were very professional.''

<HEADLINE> 'Stuart Little' Tops Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- "Stuart Little" did big business at the weekend box
office, reclaiming the top spot with $16 million, according to industry
estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Combining computer animation and live action, "Stuart Little" pushed its
total gross to $79.7 million in 17 days of release. The movie, based on E.B.
White's children's tale and featuring the voice of Michael J. Fox, debuted as
the No. 1 film two weeks ago then dropped to third over Christmas weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   "With Christmas Eve falling on a Friday, that's notoriously rougher on
family films," said Ed Russell, executive vice president for publicity at Sony
Pictures, which released "Stuart Little." "This past week is where kids came
back with their families."
</P>
<P>
	   With no new movies opening in wide release this weekend, holdovers made up
the top 10.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Green Mile" was No. 2 with $13.2 million. Last weekend's top film, "Any
Given Sunday," was a close third with $13.1 million, "Toy Story 2" took fourth
with $12.2 million and "The Talented Mr. Ripley" was fifth with $12 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The films were bunched so closely that rankings could change when studios
release final weekend numbers Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Toy Story 2" climbed to $208.6 million since its Thanksgiving release,
passing "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" as the No. 3 movie released in
1999. "Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace" is first with $430.5 million
and "The Sixth Sense" is second with $276 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The "Star Wars" prequel, which reopened on Christmas for a three-week
domestic run, moved into second place last week on the all-time worldwide list
with $922 million, about $2 million more than "Jurassic Park," according to
"Star Wars" distributor 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   "Titanic" grossed $1.8 billion worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest weekend premiere was Disney's "Fantasia/2000," an update of the
1940 animated classic that opened Saturday for an exclusive four-month run in 75
large-screen Imax theaters around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   At 46 of those theaters in the United States and Canada, the movie did an
average of $22,060 a screen on Saturday, about $1 million overall, said Chuck
Viane, head of distribution for Disney. "Stuart Little's" three-day average was
$5,517 in 2,900 theaters.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney was unable to gather "Fantasia/2000" numbers Sunday from the other 29
Imax theaters, Viane said.
</P>
<P>
	   Opening in limited release for Oscar consideration was "The Hurricane,"
which grossed $295,000 in 11 theaters for a $26,818 average. Based on a true
story, the movie stars Denzel Washington as boxer Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, who
spent decades fighting for release from prison on a trumped-up murder
conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North American theaters,
according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures are to be released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   1. "Stuart Little," $16 million.
</P>
<P>
	   2. "The Green Mile," $13.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   3. "Any Given Sunday," $13.1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   4. "Toy Story 2," $12.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   5. "The Talented Mr. Ripley," $12 million.
</P>
<P>
	   6. "Galaxy Quest, $9.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   7. "Bicentennial Man," $8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   8. "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo," $5.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   9. "Man on the Moon," $5.2 million.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Rally Opposes Fundamentalism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Nearly 5,000 people gathered at a New Year's Day
rally in the Bangladeshi capital Sunday, waving banners and chanting slogans
against Islamic fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fundamentalism is opposed to civilization,'' read one of the many banners
at the demonstration where Bangladesh's leading academics and women rights
activists warned against conservative Islamic groups.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are opposed to Islamic fundamentalists because they don't recognize the
rights of women,'' said Ayesha Khanam, president of Bangladesh Maohila Parishad,
a women rights group.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though secular laws govern predominantly Muslim Bangladesh, there are
dozens of Islamic fundamentalist groups that want women to wear all-enveloping
veils and oppose their education.
</P>
<P>
	   Islamic radicals forced Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasrin to flee the
country for the second time last year, accusing her of blaspheming Islam in her
writings. They called for her death after she called for changes in Islamic
Shariah law to give Muslim women more rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Nasrin lives in self-imposed exile in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   In Bangladesh, conservative Muslim groups have little political appeal, but
Islamic preachers have pockets of influence in the villages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must not lower our guard against those who are opposed to liberalism
and secularism,'' Syed Hasan Imam, a popular stage actor said.

<HEADLINE> Hijacking Hurts Nepal Tourism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) -- From shopping trips to honeymoons, Nepal attracts
thousands of Indian tourists every year. But since an Indian Airlines plane was
hijacked minutes after taking off from Katmandu, the number of Indians visiting
Nepal has plunged.
</P>
<P>
	   Indian Airlines canceled its three flight to Nepal from the Indian cities of
New Delhi, Calcutta and Varanasi. India blamed serious security lapses at
Katmandu's Tribuwan International Airport for the highjacking.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the week that followed the hijacking, room cancellations reached 70
percent. This has been a disaster for the industry,'' said Sunim Tamang, Sales
Manager of Hotel Soaltee Crowne Plaza, Nepal's largest hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost 40 percent of the half-million tourists visiting Nepal are Indians.
The remaining are either Asians or westerners who visit Nepal in the fall and
spring for trekking and mountaineering.
</P>
<P>
	   The winter months are referred to as the `Indian season' when Indian
tourists are lured by attractive packages that include free casino coupons.
Others come to visit the many popular Hindu temples.
</P>
<P>
	   All major hotels have been flooded with cancellations and are expecting the
following months to be worse. Luxury hotels have been the worst hit because most
of their business comes from Indian honeymooners.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the past one week we have received cancellations of at least 25 percent
every day and in January we expect the cancellation figure to go up even more,''
said Paras Rana, manager of Hotel Annapurna.
</P>
<P>
	   Tourism workers in Nepal are angry with the negative reporting carried on a
few Indian television channels.
</P>
<P>
	   India's Zee Television channel aired reports saying that Nepal is a haven
for Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence agency and Kashmiri militants
planning attacks on India.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Their reports have tarnished Nepal's image as a destination for Indian
tourists,'' Tamang said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tourism industry analysts however predict things will eventually return to
normal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is just a temporary episode that could last barely a couple of
months. When people are cleared of the distorted image the number should
increase again,'' said Bhuwan Bajracharya of the Center for Economy Development
and Administration.

<HEADLINE> Albright: No Israel-Syria Deal Yet  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA ABU-NASR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- As local clergy led prayers for successful
peace talks between Israel and Syria, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Sunday there is ``no done deal'' and additional rounds of negotiations may be
needed before a settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all understand how fateful the decisions are,'' Albright said in an
interview with The Associated Press on the eve of the U.S.-sponsored talks. ``We
are aware of that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States chose as a site for the talks, which open Monday, a
semi-secluded conference center 70 miles from Washington. President Clinton
cleared his schedule to preside over the first day of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Israel and Syria appeared determined to work toward ending more than 50
years of enmity.
</P>
<P>
	   As he left for Washington, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday
that he felt the ``burden of responsibility'' to achieve an agreement within the
year. ``We don't need to wait for another millennium, another century, or even
another 10 years to find a way to make peace with our neighbors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, leading his country's delegation,
also headed to the United States on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Syria, the news media, which reflect government thinking, said Damascus
pins great hopes on the upcoming negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Thawra newspaper said Syria heads into the talks with ``open minds and a
truthful desire to bring about a just and comprehensive peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Israel and Syria broke down in 1996 following a series of
suicide bombings in Israel. The talks were revived in Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has made Mideast peace a top foreign policy goal for 2000, and the
administration will be pushing both sides to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the Israel and Syrian track, the president is pressing for a
resumption of talks between the Israelis and Palestinians to implement the Wye
River peace accords, over which he presided in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian President Hafez Assad wants to recover the Golan Heights, a strategic
border enclave that Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War, in exchange for
peace with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has indicated he is prepared to give up some land, but has not said
whether he was willing to meet Assad's demand for territory all the way to the
Sea of Galilee, the storehouse of Israel's valuable water supplies. Security is
a prime issue for the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright, interviewed in Washington, said she would participate directly in
the talks at the Clarion Hotel and Conference Center except when Barak and
al-Sharaa choose to meet alone.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior U.S. mediator Dennis B. Ross, who conferred with the two sides last
week, will also be on hand.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no done deal,'' Albright said, knocking down any notion that all
that remains is to dispose of some details.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are at the beginning of a process here, not at the end of it,'' she
said of the complex bargaining between the antagonists who have fought three
wars since Israel's founding in 1948.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said there may have to be additional rounds of negotiations to
achieve a final settlement. But, she noted, both Barak and al-Sharaa, as well as
Assad, were ``dedicated to making this work.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, the residents of Shepherdstown prepared for the talks and
the influx of some 1,000 people -- mainly State Department staff and
journalists.
</P>
<P>
	   About 50 people -- Christians, Muslims and Jews -- gathered for prayers
Saturday at Shepherdstown Presbyterian Church to bless the talks. The church
will open its doors every day at noon during the negotiations for special
prayers.
</P>
<P>
	   Pam Berry, a bakery owner, was busy Sunday making pastries, muffins, cookies
and a couple of apple pies that she planned to take to the conference site later
in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   And the town's small museum -- which usually is open only from April to
October -- planned to unlock its doors to educate visitors about the town's more
than 250-year history.
</P>
<P>
	   Berry said a State Department official warned business owners at a meeting
last week to expect a lunch and dinner rush that will last all hours of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Shepherdstown Business Association decided it will be business as
usual but with more volume,'' said Berry. ``There won't be a lot of hoopla.''
</P>
<P>
	   On German Street, the town's main street, residents discussed the talks as
they walked to church and at local eateries.
</P>
<P>
	   Marty Bowen and Meredith Wait spread their local paper over a table and
pored over maps of the Middle East as they sipped coffee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had to do our history lesson this morning,'' said Bowen, a 48-year-old
archaeologist. ``We're all really excited about this.''

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Price Often U.S. Cash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's bid to mediate peace between Syria and
Israel has drawn wide bipartisan praise in Congress. But the roar of applause
that would greet success might fade once the tab is tallied.
</P>
<P>
	   Estimates in the region put the potential pricetag at up to $30 billion, ten
times what Israel now gets annually in U.S. assistance. And at $3 billion,
Israel is the largest single foreign aid recipient.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the most conservative estimate, of about $10 billion, rivals the entire
U.S. annual foreign aid budget, around $13 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   With talks resuming Monday in Shepherdstown, W.Va., little has been said
about what an Israel-Syria peace agreement might cost American taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   Nor is it yet clear how the administration would get around the fact that,
as one of seven nations branded as supporting terrorism, Syria is presently
ineligible for most U.S. assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   There's little doubt that Congress, currently out of session, will
eventually be asked to foot most of the bill if an Israel-Syria deal is reached.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There has not been any agreement that has been made in the Middle East
that hasn't, in some way, meant that we would be giving some kind of
assistance,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters even as she
declined to answer questions on cost.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut, the senior Democrat on the House
International Relations Committee, thinks the higher estimates are ``incredibly
inflated.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, Gejdenson said that, at this stage, potential costs are a secondary
consideration. ``The opportunities for peace aren't there forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has a history of spending billions for peace in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before Congress left for the holidays, it approved $1.8 billion in
special aid for Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians to carry out the 1998 Wye
River peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   Egypt, rewarded two decades ago for becoming the first Arab state to make
peace with Israel, is now the second-largest recipient of U.S. aid after Israel,
getting about $2.2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
	   When Israel evacuated the Sinai Peninsula as part of that accord, the United
States gave Israel $3 billion in special aid -- some of it to compensate 7,000
Israeli settlers forced to move. Some of the families were given as much as
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 18,000 Israelis live in the Golan Heights, which Syria wants back as
part of any peace agreement. Israel captured the strategic highlands in the 1967
war.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican-led Congress has been stingy about foreign aid, although
there is also a long tradition of generosity towards Israel -- most pronounced
during election years.
</P>
<P>
	   However, that generosity could be strained by huge requests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be difficult extracting the funds necessary,'' said Tom Mann, an
analyst at the Brookings Institution who studies Congress. He said a lot would
depend on how well Israeli's receive a peace plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls indicate Israelis are almost evenly divided over whether to trade the
Golan Heights for peace with Syria. Prime Minister Ehud Barak has pledged a
referendum if such a deal is struck.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Israeli legislators and newspaper reports, Israel might seek
$20 billion to $30 billion from the United States to help seal a deal. Barak
once estimated it would take about $10 billion to defend Israel without the
heights.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond the issue of compensation for settlers, Israel is likely to request
sophisticated military equipment and intelligence-sharing to compensate for the
loss of its listening posts in the heights.
</P>
<P>
	   Providing for the Syrian component of the package would be problematic
because of the legal ban on assistance to countries on the State Department's
list of nations that support terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts have suggested the simplest course might be to assemble a
package in which other countries, including Japan and European allies, shoulder
the Syrian portion. Syria's making peace with Israel itself might prompt a
reassessment of its terrorism designation.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, providing billions to resettle Golan Heights settlers might generate
the most U.S. resistance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we see is the various parties to the Arab-Israeli dispute getting in
line with their hands out for American dollars,'' said Ted Galen Carpenter, a
foreign policy expert at the conservative Cato Institute. ``I don't think that
benefits the people in these countries.''

<HEADLINE> Indian Cites Pakistan Hijack Link  </HEADLINE>
   By HEMA SHUKLA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's top security adviser on Sunday accused
neighbor -- and nuclear rival -- Pakistan of having links with the five men who
hijacked an Indian Airlines plane last week, holding 155 people hostage.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to Star TV, Brajesh Mishra said Indian intelligence intercepted
several radio conversations between militant groups in Kashmir, confirming that
Pakistan was involved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear it is a terrorist state,'' said Mishra, India's National
Security Adviser of longtime rival Pakistan. ``The establishment backs
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   The hostages were freed on Friday after being held for eight days, but the
crisis raised tensions between India and Pakistan, two nuclear-armed countries
that have fought three wars over the past half century.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of those wars were over Kashmir. India accuses Pakistan of backing a
decade-long insurgency in Kashmir, the Himalayan territory that is divided
between the two countries. Pakistan denies the charge and says it provides only
moral support to the movement.
</P>
<P>
	   The five hijackers acted in support of militant Kashmiris fighting against
Indian control of the Himalayan territory. They fled the southern Afghan city of
Kandahar on Friday, leaving the airport with three Kashmiri militants who had
been released from Indian jails in a deal to free the hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia gave the hijackers 10 hours to get out
of the country. They remained out of sight Sunday, while India and Pakistan
feuded over their identities and their whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
	   India claims the five are Pakistani citizens who crossed back into their
homeland from Afghanistan, and were near the southwestern city of Quetta.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have the names of all the hijackers who are Pakistani and the list of
militants they wanted to be released contained majority of Pakistani
nationals,'' said Mishra.
</P>
<P>
	   But Pakistan said the men were not Pakistani nationals, had not set foot on
its territory, and would be apprehended if they did turn up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Under no circumstances will these persons be allowed to enter Pakistan,''
said the country's Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider. He said Pakistan was on
``high alert'' to prevent the hijackers from slipping across the border.
</P>
<P>
	   Mishra claimed that in one of the messages intercepted by New Delhi -- a
discussion between members of two different separatist organizations -- one man
asked why the other had condemned the hijacking, saying that the hijackers were
acting on the instructions of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Mishra also said that an alleged refusal by Pakistan to accept some of the
sick and injured passengers when the plane temporarily landed at Lahore,
indicated Islamabad complicity in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear that Pakistan is showing enmity,'' said Mishra, who is also
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's principal secretary. ``As long as this
enmity continues there can be no talks between us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Armed with grenades, pistols and knives, hijackers seized Flight 814 some 40
minutes after it took off from Katmandu, Nepal, on a scheduled flight to New
Delhi, India, on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane made stops in India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates before
landing in Afghanistan the next day.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was carrying 178 passengers and 11 crew members when it took off
from Nepal. Twenty-seven hostages and the body of the slain man were unloaded in
the Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Bank Head Says Euro Has Potential  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- The euro has a "strong upward potential,"
European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Sunday in an interview for
Dutch television.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm glad the downward trend has stopped," Duisenberg said, referring to
last year's slide of the euro compared with the dollar, "and I expect the trend
to go in the opposite direction in the course of 2000."
</P>
<P>
	   Since it was introduced Jan. 4, the euro has fallen 13.5 percent against the
dollar. In the final day of 1999 trading on Friday, the euro was quoted at
$1.0092.
</P>
<P>
	   Duisenberg said faster economic growth in the U.S. in the past year had been
the main reason for the weakening of the single European currency, but that a
comeback of the European Union should help the euro to strengthen in the first
year of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think that the economic growth in Europe will start to outpace growth in
the U.S. in the course of 2000 and willl continue to do so in 2001," Duisenberg
said. "This is the essential reason why we expect the euro will recover."
</P>
<P>
	   Duisenberg didn't predict how far the euro could recover but did say he
doesn't expect the currency to again drop below the parity level. The euro
briefly fell to just below parity at the end of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Candidate Helps Chile's Right  </HEADLINE>
   By EDUARDO GALLARDO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLA HUAPI, Chile (AP) -- Standing on an ox-drawn wagon in the heart of
Chile's Mapuche Indian region, presidential candidate Joaquin Lavin drew
applause from hundreds of potential voters as he promised to stand up for their
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will not forget you, the poorest of the poor,'' said Lavin, eliciting an
ovation from the Indians gathered about him. He went on in his trademark style,
promising to grant them subsidies so their children can finish high school and
pledging to back the price of their crops.
</P>
<P>
	   With such tactics, Lavin has become Chile's strongest right-wing
presidential hopeful in decades. He has posted gains in poor areas long
considered leftist domains, and his Jan. 16 runoff against socialist favorite
Ricardo Lagos is now too close to call.
</P>
<P>
	   With less than two weeks left to go before the election, Lavin is traveling
the length of this South American country, kissing children and women and
shaking hands with men.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the election's first round on Dec. 12, Lavin staged a number of
massive rallies, something alien to rightists in the past. The result: He pulled
off a shocker by holding Lagos, the center-left pro-government coalition's
candidate, to a virtual draw. That forced the runoff election to decide a
winner.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You know me,'' the almost boyish-looking candidate told residents of Isla
Huapi, an island in the middle of the Bidu salt lake, during a visit last week.
``I am not a man of words. I am a man of action and what I say I will do.''
</P>
<P>
	   Standing beside him, Mapuche chief Nicolas Paillan read a welcome speech --
mainly a litany of problems the poor community faces, from a lack of electricity
and running water to high unemployment and alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
	   Quickly, Lavin asked Paillan for the handwritten pages of his speech. He
folded them into his pocket and said: ``I will take this with me to the
presidential palace and will come back here as president with the solutions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin, 46, earned a reputation as a politician who gets things done while he
was mayor of Las Condes, a wealthy suburb of Chile's capital, Santiago. He
tackled problems ranging from pollution to crime. After a first term, he was
re-elected with an unprecedented 78 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   With Lavin, ``a new right is born,'' said backer Pablo Longueira, a Chilean
congressman.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos concedes he faces a formidable rival.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What people ask the most ... is about jobs, jobs, jobs,'' he said. ``The
right-wing candidate has assumed a correct position in that sense.''
</P>
<P>
	   For the runoff campaign, Lagos has followed his challenger's lead. Instead
of emphasizing political issues like changing the constitution inherited from
Gen. Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, he has been talking about creating jobs
and curbing crime.
</P>
<P>
	   During the campaign, Lavin's foes called him a populist, a liar, a clown.
But he hardly answered, saying he doesn't have the time for ``small political
infighting.'' That strategy seems to have played well to Chile's voters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Chileans want to overcome the atmosphere of confrontation in which we have
lived for too long,'' said Francisco de la Masa, Lavin's campaign manager.
``People understand that fighting will not solve problems, and that knowing who
was wrong or who was right 15 or 20 years ago does not bring solutions.''

<HEADLINE> Iran Teen Pardoned Before Hanging  </HEADLINE>
   By AFSHIN VALINEJAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A 17-year-old murderer -- hands cuffed, tears streaking
his ashen face and a noose draped around his neck -- was granted clemency Sunday
seconds before he was to be hanged.
</P>
<P>
	   The man who spared his life? The murder victim's father.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Iran's Islamic legal system, whether the convicted boy would die was
up to the relatives of his victim. After the boy's family and many of the public
hanging's 4,000 spectators pleaded with the victim's father, he told authorities
to spare Morteza Amini Moqaddam's life.
</P>
<P>
	   The teen's family, overcome with joy, said they would never forget the act
of mercy by the father, Ali Mohebbi.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ever since his son died I have been praying for him. I will never forget
as long as I live how he gave me my son's life back,'' said Moqaddam's mother,
who did not give her first name.
</P>
<P>
	   Moqaddam returned to prison in the ambulance that had been waiting to take
his body to the morgue. He is expected to be resentenced soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Moqaddam was convicted of fatally stabbing 22-year-old Hadi Mohebbi on Dec.
13 after a quarrel about smoking in public. He was to be hanged from a crane
fixed atop a truck 30 feet from the electronics shop where he committed the
crime.
</P>
<P>
	   A dozen of Moqaddam's relatives, including his parents and grandmother,
gathered in front of the shop before dawn, holding open copies of Islam's holy
book, the Koran, and chanting, ``Islam demands forgiveness. Forgive him for the
sake of the Koran.''
</P>
<P>
	   A crowd watched over by hundreds of anti-riot police began to build in the
working-class neighborhood. The street was closed to traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after sunrise, a judicial official brought Moqaddam, dressed in a
blue sweatshirt and sweatpants, out of the police car where he had been waiting.
The official read out the death sentence and fixed a thick rope around
Moqaddam's neck. The teen-ager's face went pale and he started weeping.
</P>
<P>
	   His family began screaming and turned to the crowd around them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Please help us,'' they pleaded. ``He's only 17 years old. Please ask for
forgiveness with us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of people joined Moqaddam's family. About a dozen others shouted
against clemency: ``He should be killed,'' they yelled. ``Otherwise he will kill
again.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mohebbi's father then spoke to judicial officials, saying he had forgiven
Moqaddam.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd rejoiced at the news, clapping, crying, and shouting ``Allahu
Akbar!'' or ``God is great!'' Some lifted Mohebbi's father on their shoulders,
exclaiming, ``Long live Mohebbi!'' Even police officers joined the celebration.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday evening, authorities brought the teen to Mohebbi's home for a meeting
with both families. State-run Iranian television ran footage of Moqaddam
repeatedly thanking Ali Mohebbi and kissing his hand and face.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I really appreciate the father of Hadi, whom I owe until the last moment
of my life,'' Moqaddam said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ali Mohebbi said he decided to forgive Moqaddam because ``I just considered
the honor of Islam.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I forgave him, maybe millions of people who would watch the news would
learn about forgiveness -- and that is the message of Islam,'' he said. ``When I
saw his hands cuffed behind him and the noose around his neck and everyone was
waiting for my order, I thought that first of all if this boy is dead, it will
not bring back my son.''
</P>
<P>
	   What kind of sentence Moqaddam will face is uncertain. A friend who
participated in the killing was sentenced to 15 years in prison and 74 lashes.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Penny Stock King Has Lien on Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DENVER (AP) -- Former penny-stock king Meyer Blinder, convicted of
securities fraud, now faces a $5 million tax lien on his Englewood home.
</P>
<P>
	   The lien, recently filed by the Internal Revenue Service, claims Blinder
owes taxes from 1982, 1989, 1990 and 1991. His late wife is also named on the
lien.
</P>
<P>
	   Blinder built the Denver-based penny brokerage firm of Blinder Robinson &AMP;
Co. into an empire with 85 branch offices and 1,800 brokers before its collapse
in 1990. He was convicted in 1992 for racketeering, money laundering and
securities fraud and served 40 months in a federal prison in Jefferson County.
</P>
<P>
	   Glen Keller, a lawyer who served as trustee overseeing payment of claims to
Blinder's creditors, said he believes Blinder has few assets other than his home
left.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is one time the IRS might come up short," Keller said.
</P>
<P>
	   About $100 million has been distributed to customers and creditors.
Customers received all the securities in their accounts, about $80 million
worth, as well as $7 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
	   Creditors will end up with about $5 million, or about 17 percent of what
they were owed.

<HEADLINE> Police remember 'adopted' son  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MERIDEN, Conn. (AP) - The memory of an abandoned 7-and-a-half pound,
blue-eyed baby boy, who froze to death here Jan. 2, 1988, remains a symbol of
the tragedy of child abuse.
<P>
	   The Meriden Police Department will have its twelfth memorial observance
Monday for the boy local clergy named David Paul meaning "God's beloved little
man."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not just about David Paul," Eric Henderson, pastor of the First United
Methodist Church, said Saturday. "He has become a representative for child abuse
everywhere."
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the community donated a grave and a casket 12 years ago out of
pure love for the child, Henderson said. The boy was found frozen, under a tree
in a parking lot. Since then, he said, the community has embraced the annual
observance.
</P>
<P>
	   David Paul was unofficially adopted by the police department. Police Chief
Robert E. Kosienski said at the time that he would not let a year go by without
remembering David Paul, until the investigation of his death was closed.
</P>
<P>
	   "People still come forward and give us information," said Detective Gary
Brandl. "It gets more and more difficult each year that passes. We hope that
someday, someone will find it in their heart to come forward and give us the
information that we need.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think eventually we are going to have good closure to this case," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Henderson said the 10 a.m. observance will include references to the tender
place Jesus had in his heart, "especially for children, or anyone who is weak
and fragile, even the mother."
</P>
<P>
	   "We all make mistakes," he said. "We pray for her too. Now we have become
David Paul's family and we will not let his birthday, the day he died, go by
without remembering him, before there is some kind of closure."
</P>
<P>
	   The service of remembrance is to take place at the First United Methodist
Church, at 159 E. Main St. The service is to be followed by a graveside ceremony
at Walnut Grove Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
	   "The sanctity and value of life have diminished greatly in this land,"
Henderson said. "Good and righteous people, who believe that life is meaningful
to God, the creator, need to draw the line. Things like this don't need to
happen."

<HEADLINE> Real test ahead for employees returning to work on Monday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Phase one of averting a statewide Y2K shutdown of
computer systems is over and New York has done well. But phase two may be more
of a problem when state and private sector employees return to work on Monday
and turn their computers on.
<P>
	   "A major hurdle will be when people return to work after extended holidays
and try to reboot their computers, many of which were turned off to avoid
problems," said Julie Leeper, state Y2K project coordinator for the Governor's
Office for Technology.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday state workers will check some 300 high-priority computer systems
in agencies like the state department of Criminal Justice, the Department of
Mental Health and the Department of Banking.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not anticipating any major problems in government, but problems could
occur the private sector," Leeper said.
</P>
<P>
	   Leeper and a reduced staff of state emergency workers continued to monitor
power lines, hospitals and other vital services at the state's underground Y2K
command center in Albany on Sunday, and there have been few reports of problems.
</P>
<P>
	   A small number of food stamp recipients had difficulties at grocery stores
when they tried to use their electronic benefits cards used for purchasing food.
The electronic prompt said that the cards had expired.
</P>
<P>
	   In another incident call boxes along the side of the Adirondack Northway are
not working because of a systems glitch. Most of those call boxes are not likely
to be fixed because of the systems' advanced age.
</P>
<P>
	   That said, about half of the staff at the Y2K command center have been sent
home, according to officials who said the center is now down to about 75 people
per shift.
</P>
<P>
	   "Much of the work to be done over the next few days will be completed by
technicians monitoring systems in individual agencies and their counterparts in
the private sector," said Leeper.
</P>
<P>
	   At 8 p.m. Saturday, officials closed down each of the 10 Y2K regional
command centers across the state, after all systems were determined to be
bug-free.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Saturday, Gov. George Pataki proudly told emergency workers that New
York - after a tremendous amount of effort - updated its computer systems for
the 21st Century and passed the Y2K test with flying colors.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were hoping for the most expensive non-event in history. That would be
good news," Pataki said. "And it was a non-event."
</P>
<P>
	   There were scattered power outages - including a temporary power loss to 966
customers Saturday in Eden in Erie County. But Gary Davis, state Y2K project
director, said those outages were ordinary occurrences unrelated to Y2K.
</P>
<P>
	   Regardless, the state's Y2K command center will remain fully activated
through Tuesday, when officials will decide if operations can be scaled back.
</P>
<P>
	   While state officials exulted in their initial success, others wondered if
maybe the Y2K wasn't quite the monster it was made out to be.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think a lot of it was the media, it scares you more than anything," said
Chris Ericson, a North Carolina resident shopping in Albany's Colonie Center
Mall with her family. "I think they got people overly worried about it."
</P>
<P>
	   Davis said the state will be on heightened alert for Y2K problems for a
while. He noted that this is a leap year, and Feb. 29 is being mentioned as a
potential trouble date for computers.

<HEADLINE> In Atlantic City, Caesars acquisition breaks Boardwalk land  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Park Place Entertainment Corp., which
completed its $3 billion acquisition of the Caesars World casino empire last
week, is wasting no time in taking advantage of its new properties.
<P>
	   The company plans to begin construction within a month on a $25 million
expansion of its Wild Wild West Casino on a prime parcel of land that had gone
undeveloped in a high-stakes game of Monopoly between the two former rivals.
</P>
<P>
	   The addition will include the installation of 300 new slot machines, retail
outlets and restaurants. It will be completed by next fall, according to Wallace
Barr, executive vice president of Park Place Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've already been out there doing test borings and drawing building
permits. We got all the long-lead items in place. Now, it's just a matter of
starting," Barr said.
</P>
<P>
	   Park Place Entertainment's purchase of Caesars World Inc. from Starwood
Hotels and Resorts Inc. will allow Park Place to develop the parcel at the
corner of the Boardwalk and Arkansas Avenue.
</P>
<P>
	   The Park Place-owned parcel is separated from Bally's Park Place by the
facade of the 70-year-old Warner Theater, which was owned by Caesars.
</P>
<P>
	   Caesars, which added a 25-story hotel tower in a $280 million expansion two
years ago, was unable to build it fronting the Boardwalk because Park Place
Entertainment would not sell the parcel.
</P>
<P>
	   Park Place Entertainment, in turn, was blocked from building on it because
the theater stood between it and the Wild Wild West property.
</P>
<P>
	   Barr told The Press of Atlantic City the expansion will be completed by
Labor Day. It will link Bally's Park Place with Caesars, marrying the city's
most profitable and third-most profitable casinos under one roof.
</P>
<P>
	   Park Place, which was formerly Bally Entertainment Corp., is the world's
largest casino company, with 29 properties worldwide under the Bally's, Hilton,
Grand, Paris and Caesars brands.
</P>
<P>
	   In Atlantic City, it owns the Atlantic City Hilton, Bally's Park Place and,
now, Caesars Atlantic City.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- The traditional Three Kings returned to Cuba on Sunday after
slowly disappearing decades ago as the annual sugar harvest and Karl Marx took
precedence over centuries-old church festivals.
</P>
<P>
	   Several hundred Cuban Catholics applauded as three Puerto Rican men wrapped
in the brocaded robes and capes of Melchor, Baltazar and Gaspar rose the steps
of Havana's towering cathedral for a Mass celebrated by Cuban Cardinal Jaime
Ortega.
</P>
<P>
	   With Christmas hymns and clouds of incense, the Wise Men strode toward the
altar as the visiting Roman Catholic group from Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico, shared
its island's annual holiday celebration with the congregation.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, they kissed a baby boy playing the role of the Christ child and
prostrated themselves on the floor before him.
</P>
<P>
	   Three Kings Day is a mystery to most Cuban children, as well as most of
their parents.
</P>
<P>
	   In most Latin countries, it is Three Kings Day on Jan. 6 -- not Dec. 24 or
25 -- that small children receive their Christmas gifts. Many Christians believe
the Wise Men who brought gifts to Jesus exemplify devotion and generosity.
</P>
<P>
	   The Three Kings are especially beloved in Puerto Rico, where they are
celebrated in popular paintings and sculpture.
</P>
<P>
	   Ortega, Cuba's top Catholic churchman, encouraged children not to ask the
kings for material things but for spiritual things of greater value -- peace in
their families, good friends.
</P>
<P>
	   As for the grownups, the prelate encouraged them to ``believe in stars'' --
to have the kind of wonder and faith the Three Kings of biblical tradition
expressed 2000 years ago as they followed the bright, shining star that led them
to the Christ child.
</P>
<P>
	   Four-year-old Maria Fernandez's eyes grew wide as the kings strode by the
pews, greeting small children as they walked by.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She was very excited,'' said the girl's mother, Marta Dararas, 36. ``Our
family never lost these traditions, but they were interrupted for most people
for many years. I imagine with time they can return.''
</P>
<P>
	   The primary mission of the visiting Puerto Rican group is to promote Three
Kings Day celebrations, still observed in Spain and many parts of Latin America
on Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
	   It has also traveled to the Dominican Republic and New York. This is its
first visit to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Three Kings Day celebrations -- along with most Christmastime festivities --
slowly disappeared in Cuba after the 1959 revolution that brought Fidel Castro
to power.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba's communist government was then more concerned with having enough
manpower for the annual sugar harvests than with holiday celebrations it
associated with the middle and upper classes.
</P>
<P>
	   The government declared itself atheist in the mid-1960s. Religious worship
was never banned, but believers were viewed as suspect or even strange.
</P>
<P>
	   But religious expression has become increasingly accepted in Cuba over the
past decade. In 1992, the government declared itself a lay state, loosening
restrictions on religious worship and allowing believers to belong to the
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
	   The celebration of Christmas got a boost in December 1997, when the
government declared Dec. 25 an official holiday to honor the January 1998 visit
by Pope John Paul II to the island. The day has since been declared a permanent
holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   In keeping with the spirit of giving, about 30 members of the Puerto Rican
group brought donated packages of medicine for local children's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
	   The kings will also visit several other Catholic congregations before
returning to Puerto Rico on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs $10M for Gun Research  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's new budget will include $10 million
for research into how to prevent guns from being fired by anyone but their
owners, a top White House aide said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   White House Chief of Staff John Podesta said the National Institute of
Justice would help fund research and development of so-called smart gun
technology, now being developed by several handgun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   Podesta said the Clinton administration hoped to work with the gun makers on
developing the technology, which would use fingerprints, radio waves or other
ways to ensure that a weapon would fire only when used by its owner.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had some discussions with them about this, about how we can improve
the technology so that, again, only a lawful owner can use the gun,'' Podesta
said on CBS's ``Face the Nation.'' ``And if that's true, what you can prevent is
a police officer being disarmed by a felon and having the gun used against the
police officer. But I think almost most importantly, it'll prevent children from
being able to get access to guns and use them.''
</P>
<P>
	   The $10 million would be in Clinton's proposed budget for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1. Clinton had proposed $4 million for smart-gun research in the
current year's budget, but Congress rejected his request, according to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
	   Podesta announced the smart-gun initiative as he also urged Congress to pass
gun control legislation. Following the shootings at Columbine High School in
Colorado, House and Senate negotiators failed to agree on a juvenile crime bill
that contained gun control measures, including background checks of purchasers
at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Given the Congress that we have in front of us, it's going to be a very
difficult chore to get that passed through this Congress,'' Podesta said. ``But
we are going to press ahead. With members going home and listening to their
constituencies, we still have a good chance of getting the common-sense gun
legislation that is before Congress passed into law this year.''

<HEADLINE> Indian Cites Pakistan Hijack Link  </HEADLINE>
   By HEMA SHUKLA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's top security adviser on Sunday accused
neighbor -- and nuclear rival -- Pakistan of having links with the five men who
hijacked an Indian Airlines plane last week, holding 155 people hostage.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to Star TV, Brajesh Mishra said Indian intelligence intercepted
several radio conversations between militant groups in Kashmir, confirming that
Pakistan was involved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear it is a terrorist state,'' said Mishra, India's National
Security Adviser of longtime rival Pakistan. ``The establishment backs
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   The hostages were freed on Friday after being held for eight days, but the
crisis raised tensions between India and Pakistan, two nuclear-armed countries
that have fought three wars over the past half century.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of those wars were over Kashmir. India accuses Pakistan of backing a
decade-long insurgency in Kashmir, the Himalayan territory that is divided
between the two countries. Pakistan denies the charge and says it provides only
moral support to the movement.
</P>
<P>
	   The five hijackers acted in support of militant Kashmiris fighting against
Indian control of the Himalayan territory. They fled the southern Afghan city of
Kandahar on Friday, leaving the airport with three Kashmiri militants who had
been released from Indian jails in a deal to free the hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia gave the hijackers 10 hours to get out
of the country. They remained out of sight Sunday, while India and Pakistan
feuded over their identities and their whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
	   India claims the five are Pakistani citizens who crossed back into their
homeland from Afghanistan, and were near the southwestern city of Quetta.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have the names of all the hijackers who are Pakistani and the list of
militants they wanted to be released contained majority of Pakistani
nationals,'' said Mishra.
</P>
<P>
	   But Pakistan said the men were not Pakistani nationals, had not set foot on
its territory, and would be apprehended if they did turn up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Under no circumstances will these persons be allowed to enter Pakistan,''
said the country's Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider. He said Pakistan was on
``high alert'' to prevent the hijackers from slipping across the border.
</P>
<P>
	   Mishra claimed that in one of the messages intercepted by New Delhi -- a
discussion between members of two different separatist organizations -- one man
asked why the other had condemned the hijacking, saying that the hijackers were
acting on the instructions of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Mishra also said that an alleged refusal by Pakistan to accept some of the
sick and injured passengers when the plane temporarily landed at Lahore,
indicated Islamabad complicity in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear that Pakistan is showing enmity,'' said Mishra, who is also
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's principal secretary. ``As long as this
enmity continues there can be no talks between us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Armed with grenades, pistols and knives, hijackers seized Flight 814 some 40
minutes after it took off from Katmandu, Nepal, on a scheduled flight to New
Delhi, India, on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane made stops in India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates before
landing in Afghanistan the next day.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was carrying 178 passengers and 11 crew members when it took off
from Nepal. Twenty-seven hostages and the body of the slain man were unloaded in
the Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Attends Millennium Service  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton offered a prayer at the National
Cathedral's first Sunday service of the third millennium, giving thanks for his
family's ``good health, good fortune, and the opportunity to serve the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We thank you for the amazing grace you have shown in getting us through
and beyond our individual and collective sins and trials,'' Clinton said in a
brief prayer following the intercession, which he led with first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Through the darkest hours of the 20th century, the shameful trauma of
racial oppression, the pain and sacrifice of war, the fear and deprivation of
depression, when all we could do was walk by faith, it was your guiding light
that saw us through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The service held under the soaring arches and stained glass windows of the
cathedral was a solemn coda to the gala year-end celebrations held over the
weekend at the White House and on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech to revelers gathered at the Lincoln Memorial on New Year's Eve,
and again in his prayer Sunday, Clinton urged Americans to reflect not only upon
the glories of the past ``American Century,'' but also upon its wars and grief.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As we awaken to this second morning of a new millennium, help us to
remember that all we are and all we do begins with you,'' Clinton prayed. ``We
begin this jubilee year in humility, with profound thanks for the divine light
first revealed 2,000 years ago that has brought us now to this sacred place
today.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Claims Inroads in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
   By MIGUEL GIL MORENO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTHERN CHECHNYA, Russia (AP) -- Russian military advances into rebel-held
southern Chechnya are trapping civilians in cellars and sending others fleeing
through snowy mountain passes and forests littered with corpses, Chechen
officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   After days of heavy fighting, the Russian military claimed Sunday to have
made inroads into Chechnya's southern mountains, capturing strategic heights
overlooking Vedeno, a major rebel stronghold. Russian forces can now position
artillery on the heights, making it easier to drive the rebels out of Vedeno.
</P>
<P>
	   But the constant air and artillery attacks that precede the advance of
Russian troops have left civilians trapped in southern mountain villages, afraid
to venture under the bombs and shells raining on the roads, Chechen officials
and civilians said.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents of the capital Grozny who had fled the city in hopes of escaping
to Georgia, which borders Chechnya to the south, have been stuck in the villages
of Itum-Kale, 50 miles south of Grozny, and Shatoi, 35 miles south of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People cannot venture out of their homes because the shelling continues
around the clock,'' said Ramzan Bisiyev, head of the village administration in
Rodina, just outside the capital Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   Bisiyev, an Itum-Kale native, was trying Sunday to negotiate with Russian
authorities for a safe corridor so civilians could leave southern Chechnya for
Russian-controlled areas in the north.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In despair, people go through the forests, along mountain passes, and come
under artillery fire. A lot of dead bodies lie around those forests,'' said
Bisiyev, who visited southern Chechnya last week.
</P>
<P>
	   No figures were available on the number of civilians trapped in the south,
but Bisiyev said only about 10 percent of residents had managed to leave the
area.
</P>
<P>
	   Having swept across the plains in Chechnya's north, Russian forces have been
trying to crush rebel fighters concentrated in the mountainous south.
</P>
<P>
	   After taking the heights near Vedeno, the Russian forces seized a large
cache of arms and ammunition, including grenade launchers, two anti-aircraft
rocket launchers and several flame-throwers, said Maj. Alexander Diordiev, a
military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian forces also kept up air and artillery bombardments of Grozny -- the
only rebel-controlled town in Chechnya's north -- as a major offensive to take
the city entered a second week. Russian commanders said their forces fought off
an overnight rebel attack on federal artillery positions northwest of Grozny, on
the Tersky Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian commanders claimed their ground forces were making progress in
Grozny, but the federal forces still appeared to be far from taking the city
center from rebel fighters in heavily fortified positions.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian media reported a chlorine cloud over Grozny on Sunday, and the
military accused rebels of using chemical bombs. Both sides have repeatedly
accused the other of using chemical weapons during this war, but the claims have
not been verified.
</P>
<P>
	   Military doctor Oleg Zayev said on Russia's ORT television Sunday that he
sees dozens of wounded troops daily from in and around Grozny. The military has
been tight-lipped about casualty figures, especially as the war drags on. Both
the Russians and the Chechens exaggerate enemy losses and play down their own.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops entered Chechnya in September after Chechen-based militants
invaded a neighboring region and were blamed for apartment bombings elsewhere in
Russia. Russians terrified of the kidnappings and other violence that has
plagued the Caucasus region in recent years largely support the war.
</P>
<P>
	   A 49-year-old woman held captive for three months in Chechnya escaped and
walked for four nights to reach the border with the neighboring Russian region
of Ingushetia on Saturday night, ITAR-Tass reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Larisa Mzokova said she was kept in a cellar and escaped when her guard fell
asleep. Mzokova, who was kidnapped from her house in the nearby republic of
South Ossetia, said she stayed away from the roads in Chechnya during her
flight, fearing a chase.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, two Russian soldiers, Andrei Drozhenov and Vladimir Ulyanov, both 19,
were freed from captivity in Chechnya during a special operation by Russian
security forces, ITAR-Tass reported Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Mother of Spain's King Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Maria de las Mercedes de Borbon y Orleans, the mother
of Spain's King Juan Carlos, died Sunday in her residence on the Canary Island
of Lanzarote, the royal palace reported. She was 89.
</P>
<P>
	   De Borbon, who was also the Countess of Barcelona, died at 3 p.m. in the La
Mareta residence surrounded by her family, the Zarzuela Palace said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   No details on the cause of death were immediately available. The countess
had used a wheelchair for many years since suffering a stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   King Juan Carlos and the entire royal family had traveled to Lanzarote to
celebrate the New Year at the residence.
</P>
<P>
	   The remains are to be flown to Madrid later Sunday and her body is to lie in
state at the Oriente Palace in the Spanish capital, the national news agency Efe
reported. She is to be buried Tuesday in the monastery of San Lorenzo de El
Escorial on Madrid's western outskirts, the burial place for all Spanish royals
including the countess' husband, Don Juan de Borbon y Battemberg.
</P>
<P>
	   The countess was mother to four children, including Juan Carlos, who took
the throne in 1975 following an agreement between Don Juan and then-ruling Gen.
Francisco Franco.
</P>
<P>
	   A known lover of bullfighting, art and music, the countess spent almost half
her life, 1934-1976, in exile. She left Spain on the proclamation of the II
Republic in 1934 and went to live first in Paris and later Estoril, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
	   She met here future husband in 1935 in Rome, where three years later she
gave birth to Juan Carlos.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition Socialist party spokesman Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba highlighted
``the role she played alongside Don Juan de Borbon in keeping the image of the
monarchy alive during (Franco's) dictatorship, something which was fundamental
during the transition'' to democracy.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Generals Uneasy With Roles  </HEADLINE>
   By PETER MUELLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- For now, the battle for influence between
Brazil's top military brass and civilians has ended with an uneasy truce.
</P>
<P>
	   But the infighting, which erupted over the sacking of Air Force chief Walter
Brauer, cast doubts on the future of Brazil's fledgling Defense Ministry. It
also brought to light simmering unrest among many military officers with their
reduced role under the Defense Ministry, which is headed by a leading civilian.
</P>
<P>
	   The dissatisfaction erupted on Dec. 15, after a congressional drug
trafficking probe pointed to links between organized crime and an official named
Solange Rezende. Rezende is a top aide to Elcio Alvares, the civilian Defense
Ministry chief.
</P>
<P>
	   In a pointed reference to Rezende, Brauer stated publicly that civil
servants should be ``untarnished'' by scandal. Faced with that challenge to
hierarchy, Alvares, under orders from President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, fired
both Rezende and Brauer.
</P>
<P>
	   But Brauer didn't go quietly. In a stinging farewell speech, he touched on
issues that have irked his colleagues, including the government's delay in
replacing the Air Force's aging fleet and the sale of a 20 percent stake in
Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer to four French companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The Embraer sale has stirred nationalist sentiment in the armed forces,
which consider the company essential to national security.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident revived memories of the 1964-85 military dictatorship and its
aftermath, when Brazilians watched anxiously for signs of discontent in the
barracks. While no one believes the armed forces want to take power again, the
latest clash could complicate the government's plans to reduce the military's
size and sell off state-owned assets.
</P>
<P>
	   The generals also are concerned with their waning influence. With the
creation of the Defense Ministry in June, the heads of the three military
branches lost their Cabinet-level status. With it, they lost much of their
influence to obtain a share of the country's budget, which has been trimmed down
under a sweeping agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   The Brauer incident brought out some virulent anti-Cardoso sentiment among
the president's more outspoken critics. Retired Gen. Ivan Frota called for the
president's impeachment, and Rep. Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain, said
Cardoso should be shot. Opposition congressmen have proposed suspending
Bolsonaro for his remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   New Year's commemorations helped soothe hard feelings. More than 700 people
attended a lunch in Brauer's honor at the Air Force Club in Rio, and many felt
the incident was laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If there are no other acts of disrespect, the case is closed,'' the club's
president, Gen. Ercio Braga, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, memories of the military dictatorship are not dead.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The military can make these protests thanks to the democracy that they did
not help to build,'' said Rep. Miro Teixeira, leader of the leftist Democratic
Labor Party.

<HEADLINE> Former Cuban Agent To Testify  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Puerto Rican separatist granted clemency by the White
House last summer helped pull off one of the nation's biggest armed robberies
with funding from the Cuban government, according to a former Cuban intelligence
agent set to testify Monday before a House committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Jorge Masetti, who in the early 1990s defected to Europe, has been
interviewed by aides to the House Government Reform Committee and is set to
testify at a public hearing near Miami, chief counsel James Wilson said in an
interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson said Masetti will tell how the Cuban government helped finance the
1983 robbery of a Wells Fargo armored truck in West Hartford, Conn., which
netted $7.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   One of those involved in the robbery, Juan Segerra Palmer, was caught and
sentenced to 55 years in prison. Palmer was one of 12 Puerto Rican nationalists
granted clemency by Clinton in August. Eleven of those were released, but Palmer
struck a deal that will allow him to go free in five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Repeating a story published in his book, ``The Fury and the Delirium,''
Masetti has told investigators that Palmer get $50,000 in ``seed money'' from
the Cuban government to help carry out the Wells Fargo robbery, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the robbery, the $7.2 million booty was smuggled to Mexico City in a
recreational vehicle outfitted with special hidden compartments, Masetti has
told investigators, according to Wilson. Masetti says he was involved in
shipping $4 million of the Wells Fargo money from the Cuban Embassy in Mexico
City to Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban Interests Section in Washington, which acts as Cuba's Embassy,
told the Hartford Courant that the tale was ``more science fiction than anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Puerto Rico, nationalists said their links to Cuba were confined to Cuban
support for Puerto Rico's independence from the United States -- support that
predated Fidel Castro's 1959 communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Masetti's testimony is part of the committee's latest effort to link Cuba to
the FALN -- the Spanish abbreviation for the Armed Forces for National
Liberation -- and its Puerto Rican arm, the Macheteros, or ``Cane Cutters.''
</P>
<P>
	   Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., has requested any records showing a
link between the separatists and the Cuban government. He also issued subpoenas
to the Justice Department and FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   Burton wrote a letter to CIA Director George Tenet asking for surveillance
intercepts and any other records on a Cuba-Puerto Rico connection. He also
sought a briefing on the agency's knowledge of the pro-independence guerrilla
groups the nationalists belonged to.
</P>
<P>
	   The FALN carried out a wave of bombings in the United States in the late
1970s and early 1980s that left six dead and scores wounded. The Macheteros have
been responsible mainly for attacks in Puerto Rico.

<HEADLINE> Albright: No Israel-Syria Deal Yet  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA ABU-NASR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- As local clergy led prayers for successful
peace talks between Israel and Syria, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Sunday there is ``no done deal'' and additional rounds of negotiations may be
needed before a settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all understand how fateful the decisions are,'' Albright said in an
interview with The Associated Press on the eve of the U.S.-sponsored talks. ``We
are aware of that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States chose as a site for the talks, which open Monday, a
semi-secluded conference center 70 miles from Washington. President Clinton
cleared his schedule to preside over the first day of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Israel and Syria appeared determined to work toward ending more than 50
years of enmity.
</P>
<P>
	   As he left for Washington, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday
that he felt the ``burden of responsibility'' to achieve an agreement within the
year. ``We don't need to wait for another millennium, another century, or even
another 10 years to find a way to make peace with our neighbors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, leading his country's delegation,
also headed to the United States on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Syria, the news media, which reflect government thinking, said Damascus
pins great hopes on the upcoming negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Thawra newspaper said Syria heads into the talks with ``open minds and a
truthful desire to bring about a just and comprehensive peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel's army radio that the
country would ask Syrian President Hafez Assad to join the talks to prove that
he was serious about peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Assad rarely appears in public, even at home, and his trips abroad are even
rarer. Al-Sharaa is a close, trusted aide and has represented Syria in previous
negotiations with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Israel and Syria broke down in 1996 following a series of
suicide bombings in Israel. The talks were revived in Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has made Mideast peace a top foreign policy goal for 2000, and the
administration will be pushing both sides to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the Israel and Syrian track, the president is pressing for a
resumption of talks between the Israelis and Palestinians to implement the Wye
River peace accords, over which he presided in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian President Hafez Assad wants to recover the Golan Heights, a strategic
border enclave that Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War, in exchange for
peace with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has indicated he is prepared to give up some land, but has not said
whether he was willing to meet Assad's demand for territory all the way to the
Sea of Galilee, the storehouse of Israel's valuable water supplies. Security is
a prime issue for the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright, interviewed in Washington, said she would participate directly in
the talks at the Clarion Hotel and Conference Center except when Barak and
al-Sharaa choose to meet alone.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior U.S. mediator Dennis B. Ross, who conferred with the two sides last
week, will also be on hand.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no done deal,'' Albright said, knocking down any notion that all
that remains is to dispose of some details.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are at the beginning of a process here, not at the end of it,'' she
said of the complex bargaining between the antagonists who have fought three
wars since Israel's founding in 1948.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said there may have to be additional rounds of negotiations to
achieve a final settlement. But, she noted, both Barak and al-Sharaa, as well as
Assad, were ``dedicated to making this work.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, the residents of Shepherdstown prepared for the talks and
the influx of some 1,000 people -- mainly State Department staff and
journalists.
</P>
<P>
	   About 50 people -- Christians, Muslims and Jews -- gathered for prayers
Saturday at Shepherdstown Presbyterian Church to bless the talks. The church
will open its doors every day at noon during the negotiations for special
prayers.
</P>
<P>
	   Pam Berry, a bakery owner, was busy Sunday making pastries, muffins, cookies
and a couple of apple pies that she planned to take to the conference site later
in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   And the town's small museum -- which usually is open only from April to
October -- planned to unlock its doors to educate visitors about the town's more
than 250-year history.
</P>
<P>
	   Berry said a State Department official warned business owners at a meeting
last week to expect a lunch and dinner rush that will last all hours of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Shepherdstown Business Association decided it will be business as
usual but with more volume,'' said Berry. ``There won't be a lot of hoopla.''
</P>
<P>
	   On German Street, the town's main street, residents discussed the talks as
they walked to church and at local eateries.
</P>
<P>
	   Marty Bowen and Meredith Wait spread their local paper over a table and
pored over maps of the Middle East as they sipped coffee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had to do our history lesson this morning,'' said Bowen, a 48-year-old
archaeologist. ``We're all really excited about this.''

<HEADLINE> Graham: Farrakhan Not for Unity  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Rev. Billy Graham says Nation of Islam leader Louis
Farrakhan is not the person to preach unity for all races and religions.
</P>
<P>
	   Graham told Fox News Sunday that Farrakhan could not be the unifying figure
he now says he wants to be.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I doubt if he could,'' Graham said noting that Farrakhan had asked to meet
with him. ``His views and my views will be very far apart, and it would be very
difficult for us. We could be friends, but it would be very difficult for us to
say that we are the same, or that we could be the same religiously.''
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Farrakhan made his first public appearance in months following
a bout with prostate cancer and a radiation-related rectal ulcer. Criticized for
making anti-white and anti-Semitic remarks in the past, Farrakhan said his
health problems have changed his outlook.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Only through our act of atonement can we be forgiven for what we have said
or done to injure other human beings -- a member of another race or a member of
another religious group, another nation or another ethnic group,'' Farrakhan
said at that time.
</P>
<P>
	   Graham also offered comments on controversial plans by the Southern Baptist
Convention, his own denomination, to send evangelists into Chicago to try to
convert Jews and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I normally defend my denomination. I'm loyal to it,'' Graham said. ``But I
have never targeted Muslims. I have never targeted Jews. I believe that we
should declare the fact that God loves you, God's willing to forgive you, God
can change you, and Christ and his kingdom is open to anybody who repents and by
faith receives him as Lord and Savior.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the same Fox News interview, Graham said it was ``wonderful'' to hear
Texas Gov. George W. Bush name Jesus Christ as the philosopher or thinker who
had the most impact on his life.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a wonderful answer,'' Graham said. ``I mean, to millions of young
people especially in the United States, Jesus Christ is the greatest man in this
-- in the history of the world. And to me, he's the greatest person in the
history of mankind and the universe. We can't prove it, I can't put it in a test
tube or in an astronomical formula, but by faith I believe it because the Bible
teaches it.''
</P>
<P>
	   During a debate last month in Iowa, Bush responded to the question on who
was philosopher or thinker who had the most influence on his life by naming
Christ.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you turn your heart and life over to Christ, when you accept Christ
as your savior it changes your heart,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other Republican presidential candidates, Sen. Orrin Hatch and Gary
Bauer, also mentioned Jesus.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm glad to know that we do have political leaders that believe in God,
and that has been true from the days of George Washington,'' Graham said.

<HEADLINE> Barak Reassures Israelis Over Golan  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Seeking to reassure a public wary of handing over the
Golan Heights, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday that opening borders and
diplomatic relations with Israel's longtime enemy Syria is the real key to
peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Before flying to West Virginia to relaunch peace talks with Syria, Barak
said he felt the ``burden of responsibility'' to achieve an agreement within the
year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't need to wait for another millennium, another century, or even
another 10 years to find a way to make peace with our neighbors,'' Barak told
reporters on the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria has demanded a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a
strategic plateau captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has implied, but not explicitly stated, his willingness to hand over
almost all of the Golan and to dismantle Israeli settlements there in exchange
for security and normalization with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Reports in Israeli newspapers have said that Syrian President Hafez Assad is
willing to concede little beyond demilitarization in the zone, a prospect that
makes many Israelis -- hungry for acceptance among Arab neighbors -- nervous.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak vowed to work towards an agreement that would give Israelis a real
feeling of peace and the assurances it seeks on security and water issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We (seek) of course an agreement of full normalization -- open borders,
embassies,'' Barak said in an interview with Israel radio before his departure.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before leaving, he staged a photo opportunity with a group that wants
to keep the strategic plateau, a symbol of his determination to bring even his
fiercest opponents on board the peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement from Barak's office said he told the Council for the Golan that
``he has no illusions regarding the Middle East reality and that the real
guarantee of Israel's existence is not any agreement we might sign, but its
security, strategic and economic strength.''
</P>
<P>
	   Underscoring the importance of the negotiations to the United States,
President Clinton will open the talks in Shepherdstown, W.Va. on Monday. A
meeting two weeks ago in Washington between Barak and Syria's foreign minister
re-established talks after a 3 1/2-year impasse.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister David Levy, en route to Shepherdstown, told Israel's army
radio that Israel will ask Assad to join the talks to prove he is serious about
peace. So far, protocol at the talks has been unbalanced -- Barak has headed the
Israeli team while Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa heads the Syrian
side.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, pressing for a land-for-peace deal, has made Mideast peace a top
foreign policy goal for 2000. Barak has promised to bring any peace agreement to
a vote in a national referendum.

<HEADLINE> Many French Still Without Power  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A week after killer storms struck France, half a million homes
remained without electricity on Sunday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The death toll rose to 88 after a young couple was found in a house whose
roof had caved in.
</P>
<P>
	   At one stage last week, 3.4 million homes had no power. The head of French
power company Electricite de France said Sunday that restoring power in rural
communities was proving difficult.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to face up to a situation which is more complicated today,''
Francois Roussely said. ``We are progressing far slower in the countryside.''
</P>
<P>
	   The power company has said it will offer a year's worth of free service to
people who were forced to spend New Year's without electricity because of the
storms.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to causing deaths and power outages, the storm ripped millions
of trees from the ground across France. It also damaged cultural monuments,
including the Versailles royal palace and Notre Dame cathedral.

<HEADLINE> Clergy Incorporate 2000 Into Sermons  </HEADLINE>
   By RENEE RUBLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   At one church it was ``Y2J'' -- Jesus 2000. One minister called it ``a new
day.'' Another pastor told his congregation to leave the past behind.
</P>
<P>
	   From coast to coast Sunday, the beginning of 2000 was a common theme in
religious sevices, with clergy using the opportunity to call for a fresh start
and a millennium of faith, peace and devotion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Get into Y2J instead of Y2K -- Jesus 2000,'' the Rev. Jim Holley preached
to members of Detroit's Little Rock Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
	   ``God was in the last century, and he's in this one,'' said one of his
congregation members, Shelia Whitlow. ``I just hope for the future that man can
do better than last century, that we all can get along.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Dumas Harshaw Jr. of the predominantly black First Baptist Church
in Raleigh, N.C., urged his congregation to leave strife in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't be filled with arguing and don't be angry. You can't live in the
past. You have to live now,'' he said to ``amens'' from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   Several hundred cheerful people attended a service at Glide Memorial United
Methodist Church in San Francisco, where the Rev. Douglas Fitch exhorted: ``It's
a new day. It is a new way.''
</P>
<P>
	   He told the congregation to come out from behind the ``highly edited
versions'' of themselves. ``That's why I like the new year. It gives every one
of us the chance to tell the secret of who we truly are even if we only tell it
to ourselves,'' Fitch said.
</P>
<P>
	   Celiste Carter, a member of St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral in Oklahoma City,
said she was inspired by the beginning of 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to take a closer look at religion as we enter the new
millennium,'' she said. ``Religion seems to have fallen to the wayside. I think
that may be some of the reasons for youth problems.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a prayer at the National Cathedral in Washington, President Clinton gave
thanks for the ``guiding light that saw us through'' the worst times of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We begin this jubilee year in humility, with profound thanks for the
divine light first revealed 2,000 years ago that has brought us now to this
sacred place today,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Bettie Chaplin of the United Methodist Churches in Aura and
Monroeville, N.J., said many people have been preoccupied with worries about the
Y2K computer bug and need to devote as much energy to faith.
</P>
<P>
	   In her sermon, called ``heaven compliant,'' Mrs. Chaplin said: ``We can use
this time to get our spiritual side in order and have a fresh start.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Robert Kopp of the Center Presbyterian Church southwest of
Pittsburgh mentioned Y2K fears that grew out of control because of a lack of
faith.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Existential millennialists without religion have been scaring the heaven
out of people with all their talk about nukes going off when computers go down,
gas lines making the oil crisis of the '70s look like a bad hair day, food being
so scarce that Spam makes a comeback as part of a healthy diet, banks going
broke, power going out, and other catastrophic prognostications,'' Kopp said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even for clergy who saw no special religious significance in the new
millennium, it was on their minds nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Jesus came into the world to bring peace that people would start loving
each other and live in tranquility with each other,'' said the Rev. Don Kribs of
Precious Blood Catholic Church in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He gave us the power to do that, but 2,000 years later it's the same as it
was then except now we have technology, now we can blow up the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Fort Worth, Texas, churchgoers at University Christian Church lined up
shoeless in the fellowship hall to pray. The circle was the idea of the Rev.
Scott Colglazier, who sent letters asking clerics across the country to preach
for peace Sunday. Dozens of pastors responded.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's how we create peace, one drop at a time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   After listening to his pastor at the First Christian Church of Oklahoma City
preach about living instead of fearing, Bob Harrington had some words of his own
about our moment in time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today is the tomorrow we worried about yesterday,'' Harrington said. ``I
never worry about it. I'm one of those who takes it one day at a time.''

<HEADLINE> Baby Dies When Car and Cow Collide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOMPOC, Calif. (AP) -- A 2-week-old child riding with his parents in a car
was likely killed by a cow's hoof when the vehicle collided with the wandering
animal, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They think that maybe when the cow came over the hood that a hoof could
have struck the child,'' said California Highway Patrol spokesman Ken Hoyle. He
cited a preliminary Santa Barbara County coroner's report.
</P>
<P>
	   Jarrett Garife Jr., who was in a car seat, died from internal injuries
following the accident Tuesday on Highway 1. His parents -- driver Jarrett
Garife, 23, and his wife Mickki Garife, 20 -- suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said the animal apparently had wandered from a nearby ranch run by
the federal prison in Lompoc.

<HEADLINE> Pataki wants river research institute created on Hudson River  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - An institute should be created on the Hudson River
to conduct research applicable to rivers and estuaries around the world, Gov.
George Pataki said Sunday.
<P>
	   Pataki will urge state legislators in his State of the State speech
Wednesday to authorize the formation of an international center for studying
fish, plant life, pollution, water quality, currents and other aspects of
rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are going to create on the Hudson River what will be equivalent to a
world-class research facility for rivers and estuaries," Pataki said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the governor, the institute would be modeled after the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts, which has become an international
center for research.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think we have a tremendous opportunity to create that same type of
facility," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor will ask the Legislature to appropriate $1 million in 2000 to
get the institute project started. Pataki said he had no specific site in mind
for the facility, but envisioned it being a partnership between the state, the
State University of New York, private colleges and industries. The institute
would seek to fund its work largely through government, industry and foundation
grants, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said state officials hope to create a vehicle for high-quality
research into rivers in the same way the Rockefeller University in New York City
has become a center of internationally prominent medical research.
</P>
<P>
	   Thanks to sewer projects up and down the Hudson and more stringent chemical
discharge rules, the river is cleaner than it has been in decades. However, PCB
sediments north of Albany continue to keep contamination levels in fish elevated
throughout the river. There are other less severe chemical contamination worries
as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said the fact the river is not in pristine condition could be of
benefit to scientists studying how to overcome similar pollution problems in
rivers around the globe. The governor also said that if breakthroughs in
cleaning up contaminated sediments or river waters are made at the Hudson
institute, the river itself is likely one of the first beneficiaries of new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
	   Eventually, Pataki said an institute could have an annual budget of $50
million and employ 500 or more people.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is the logical next step to the progress we have made," Pataki said
Sunday. "I think it is a very exciting concept that would really have an
incredibly positive impact."
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Jones of the Albany-based Environmental Advocates said a Hudson
institute "sounds like a great idea."
</P>
<P>
	   The Hudson Riverkeeper, John Cronin, called the proposal "breathtaking" and
"magnificent." He said that because of the river's recovery, plus its location
in the urbanized Northeast, it is the perfect waterway to study exhaustively to
glean ways of improving other rivers and estuaries. One scientist has called the
Hudson a "laboratory that could inform the world," he noted.
</P>
<P>
	   Cronin said it would make the most sense from a scientific standpoint to
site an institute in the lower half of the Hudson were the freshwater and
saltwater interactions are greatest in terms of their effects on fish and animal
life. He said that point is at about the river's 50-mile mark, or somewhere even
with northern Westchester County bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said his State of the State will also outline plans to spend $30
million more restoring the aquatic habitat of Long Island Sound. That will
include an initiative to improve the public's access to the sound from Long
Island westward to Westchester County.

<P>
	   There are only four significant public access points to the sound throughout
that entire shoreline, Pataki said. Most of the waterfront property is held by
either private landowners or municipalities.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said the state would be working with municipalities to try to get
them to free up more beaches, boat launches and other access points for the
general public.

<HEADLINE> Automakers Ready for Full Work  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM SUHR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Major U.S. automakers resumed production Sunday at various
assembly and parts plants as proof their Y2K preparedness paid off.
</P>
<P>
	   General Motors Corp., DaimlerChrysler AG and Ford Motor Co. planned to ramp
up full production globally as scheduled Monday, coming off their traditional
holiday shutdowns and a weekend free of reported Y2K computer bug snafus.
</P>
<P>
	   At DaimlerChrysler's Jefferson North Assembly Plant, company and union heads
were celebratory in firing up the site's assembly lines to make as many as 250
Jeep Grand Cherokees -- just to show all's well after Y2K.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can sleep well tonight," Roger Ruggiero, vice president and general
manager of the company's Jeep and Truck Assembly Operations, said during the
trial run that was to last just a few hours. "I know now that when we come in
tomorrow morning, our plants will be operational."
</P>
<P>
	   "We're thrilled. Like everyone else, we didn't know what to expect," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The automaker considered Sunday's "Y2K validation run" key, given the plant
is among the company's most-sophisticated, computerized assembly sites.
</P>
<P>
	   The drill also affirmed no Y2K-related kinks with the company's suppliers,
including important "just-in-time" ones that get their parts as needed to the
plant that -- like countless others -- doesn't keep large inventories on hand.
</P>
<P>
	   GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler spent about $1.3 billion preparing themselves
and suppliers for the year 2000 -- to them, money well spent in their apparently
seamless transition into the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not sure what we could have expected that could have made it much
better," said John Ahearne, a GM spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   GM, the world's No. 1 automaker, planned to fire up four assembly plants --
in Pontiac, Flint, Lordstown, Ohio, and Oshawa, Ontario -- by midnight Sunday,
Ahearne said. GM also anticipated routine startups of 18 North American parts
plants by late Sunday, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford's weekend testing also detected no Y2K glitches systemwide, ensuring
resumption of full production Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford on Sunday ramped up four assembly plants in the U.S. and Britain,
spokeswoman Kathleen Vokes said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would say we'll be in full force tomorrow," she said.

<HEADLINE> NYSE Sets Circuit Breakers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Traders returning to the floor of the New York Stock
Exchange Monday will have a new set of circuit-breaker and trading-collar
trigger levels, effective throughout the first quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Circuit-breakers suspend trading for declines in the Dow Jones industrial
average of 10 percent, 20 percent and 30 percent. As the Dow has escalated
sharply since the circuit breakers were first implemented in April 1998, the
circuit-breaker levels have risen as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning Monday, a 1,100-point drop in the Dow before 2 p.m. will halt
trading for one hour; for 30 minutes if the drop occurs between 2 p.m. and 2:30
p.m.; and will have no effect if at 2:30 p.m. or later. In the fourth quarter of
1999, a drop of 1,060 was necessary before trading was halted.
</P>
<P>
	   A 2,250-point drop in the Dow before 1 p.m. will halt trading for two hours;
for one hour if between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.; and for the remainder of the day if
at 2 p.m. or later. In the fourth quarter, the level was set at 2,150.
</P>
<P>
	   A 3,350-point drop will halt trading for the remainder of the day regardless
of when the decline occurs. That's up from 3,200 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The NYSE also imposes trading collars, which restrict some computer-driven
trading. Those will be triggered when the Dow moves 220 points or more above or
below its closing value on the previous trading day and removed when the Dow is
above or below the prior day's close by 110 points.
</P>
<P>
	   When circuit breakers were first imposed following the market crash of
October 1997, trading was suspended for a half-hour if the Dow dropped 350
points and for one hour if the index fell 550 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the old rules, the market would close for the day if the 350 level was
reached at 3:30 p.m. or if the 550 level was hit at 3 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Putin's Election Victory Likely  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNA DOLGOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- With Russia's presidential elections just three months away
and his popularity riding high, it looks like acting President Vladimir Putin
just can't lose, a senior Kremlin official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a television speech that stunned Russia and the world, Boris Yeltsin
announced Friday he was leaving office six months before the end of his term,
and turning over powers to Putin, the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
	   A new presidential election is likely to take place on March 26. The upper
house of Russia's parliament will convene Wednesday to set the exact date.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin will ``likely'' win the elections outright, with no need for a
second-round runoff, deputy chief of the presidential staff Igor Shabdurasulov
was quoted as saying Sunday by the ITAR-Tass news agency. Under Russian law, an
election runoff is required if no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the
vote in the first round.
</P>
<P>
	   The last presidential vote, in 1996, was hotly contested and led to a runoff
between Yeltsin and Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov. This time, the other
potential presidential contenders are trailing far behind Putin in opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
	   There was little public reaction over the weekend to Putin's new position
and the news of the early presidential election. The New Year's holiday,
Russia's biggest of the year, stretches on for three days, during which no
newspapers are published.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, a number of people interviewed on Moscow's streets reflected an
overwhelmingly positive attitude toward their new leader.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Putin will win by a landslide,'' predicted Alexander Khudenkov, 27, a
construction worker. ``Those old goats have no chance at all. We've had enough
of them.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 47-year-old Putin enjoys widespread public approval because of his
no-nonsense style and his tough handling of the Russian offensive in separatist
Chechnya. Many Russians support the war as the only way to protect the nation
from terrorist attacks such as the apartment bombings -- blamed on Chechen
militants -- that killed over 300 people in September.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin has also tapped into an apparent longing for stability and firm
leadership after years of chaotic rule under Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton, in a farewell essay to Yeltsin, called him the ``Father
of Russian Democracy,'' but said how future leaders handle corruption and the
war in Chechnya will determine Russia's place among nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin supporters in the province of Nizhny Novgorod east of Moscow couldn't
wait for the election date to be announced, and formed a regional campaign
headquarters Sunday, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin's every action already gets lavish and favorable coverage in Russian
media. On his first day as acting president Saturday, Putin flew to Chechnya to
praise the military and award ornamental hunting knives to about 200 Russian
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Every newscast led with the image of Putin, his hands thrust into the
pockets of a black anorak, facing rows of camouflage-uniformed soldiers and
thanking them for their valor.
</P>
<P>
	   Western criticism of Russia for the excessive use of force in Chechnya has
only strengthened Putin's popularity at home, where many people blame the West
for Russia's political, economic and social turmoil of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Americans have been trying hard to ruin everything, and Putin looks like a
man who can act tough and make them respect Russia,'' said Vladimir Ilyukhin,
74, a retired diplomat who was walking his fox terrier on the snowy Moscow River
embankment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Putin is a strong man who can put right the crumbling economy and make
life better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, a taciturn former KGB colonel, got down to presidential work Sunday,
signing several laws including a treaty tying Russia and neighboring Belarus
more tightly together, ITAR-Tass said. The treaty had been reached by Yeltsin
and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko last month and was later ratified
by both nation's parliaments.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin also met Sunday night with Ruslan Aushev, the president of Ingushetia,
a Russian republic that neighbors Chechnya and has absorbed tens of thousands of
refugees from the fighting, Russian news agencies reported. No details of the
talks were released.
</P>
<P>
	   Shabdurasulov said there were no major disputes between Putin and the
Yeltsin-era presidential entourage, and predicted there would be no radical
staffing changes.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Shabdurasulov said one Yeltsin aide would ``change her status'' --
Yeltsin's daughter and image-maker Tatyana Dyachenko. Shabdurasulov did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Other potential presidential candidates include Communist leader Zyuganov;
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov -- both
centrist foes of the Kremlin entourage; liberal lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky;
parliament speaker Gennady Seleznyov, a moderate Communist; flamboyant
ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky; and ex-security chief Alexander Lebed --
who came in third in 1996 but has receded into obscurity in the past year.

<HEADLINE> Taymor Fights for 'Titus' Rating  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- It's only Shakespeare, but director Julie Taymor still had
to wage a big fight to win an "R" rating for her new film "Titus."
</P>
<P>
	   In a phone call from Venice, Taymor defended her movie rendition of William
Shakespeare's first hit play, "Titus Andronicus." It drew fire from ratings
officials for its depictions of rape, revenge, dismemberment and cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm in a city where the churches have frescoes on the walls showing scenes
much more shocking than anything in my film," Taymor says in Sunday's The New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
	   To win the "R" rating, she had to agree to cut some shots from a Roman orgy
scene.
</P>
<P>
	   Starring Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange, "Titus" tells the story of a
fictional Roman general who returns home after a successful campaign of
destruction against the Goths, only to find he has fallen out of favor with his
emperor.
</P>
<P>
	   There is plenty of violence, but no cheap violence, Taymor said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Titus", she said, is not just about violence. "It's about how we make
entertainment ouf of violence."

<HEADLINE> Cardinal O'Connor Delivers Sermon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For the third week in a row, ailing Cardinal John O'Connor
presided over a Sunday St. Patrick's service from a seat near the cathedral's
high altar rather than from the pulpit where the sermon is traditionally
delivered.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor had a brain tumor removed four months ago and has said his legs are
weak from his treatment. He has missed Mass a number of times in the past few
months and at other times has stumbled while mounting the steep staircase to the
pulpit.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday he chose to deliver his sermon from the same spot where he sat
during Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve and for the past two Sundays. He stood up
briefly at several points during the service.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor turns 80 on Jan. 15 and has hinted that he does not expect to
preside over New York's Archdiocese for much longer. The pope will select his
replacement.

<HEADLINE> NJ computers survive Y2K, ready for business Monday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A controlled test of New Jersey government's
computer system uncovered no lurking Y2K problems Sunday, the day before the
first business day of the new century, a state computer expert said.
<P>
	   More than 200 workers from the state Office of Information Technology spent
Sunday methodically re-creating thousands of computer tasks, accomplishing them
without major glitches, according to office head Adel Ebeid. Among the
departments that passed the tests with flying colors were corrections,
transportation, motor vehicles and the Attorney General's Office, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The hardware, the software, the telecommunications all appear to coming
along fine. We have not run into any major disruptions at all," he said. "We
plan to be open for business at 7 a.m. (Monday)."
</P>
<P>
	   Computer testers found some minor problems unrelated to Y2K, but they were
fixed immediately, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ebeid said he was not surprised. Any problems attributed to computers
misreading the change of date to 2000 as 1900 would have made themselves
apparent shortly after midnight Saturday, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said computer checks will continue until March to ensure full Y2K
compliance.
</P>
<P>
	   The next big test is after business begins Monday. Office staff will keep a
keen eye on state operations to make sure any problems that arise do not spread,
Ebeid said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If nothing major happened until now, I feel safe. I feel we're on the right
track," he said. "But if this was a baseball game, we'd only be in the fifth
inning. I hope it doesn't rain."
</P>
<P>
	   Officials staffing a scaled-down state emergency management center,
meanwhile, spent Sunday fighting boredom. There were no problems reported in the
state or in any of its 21 counties over the weekend, according to State Police
spokesman John Hagerty.
</P>
<P>
	   Just in case, the emergency office will remain staffed until 8 a.m.
Wednesday, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials with the communications, transportation and chemical industries
also saw the new millennium pass without incident.
</P>
<P>
	   "Y2K is going to go down in history as the greatest story that never
happened," said AT&AMP;T spokesman Dave Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T registered some congestion midnight Saturday when callers wished each
other Happy New Year, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "As the new year would arrive in each different time zone around the world,
you would see an incredible spike right at the 12 o'clock mark in that distant
land. Then by 25, 30 minute into the hour, it would start sliding right back
off," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He expects Monday to be a heavy day for the network, but said businesses
weren't likely to experience any Y2K glitches.
</P>
<P>
	   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey closed its Y2K command center
at 4 a.m. on New Year's Day because there was nothing left to do, spokesman Bill
Cahill said.
</P>
<P>
	   The authority, which operates the New York-New Jersey region's three
airports, a commuter rail line and tolls at the bridges and tunnels linking New
York City and New Jersey, doesn't expect any different problems with computers
on Monday, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Likewise, two of New Jersey's big chemical companies expect no Y2K bug
bites.
</P>
<P>
	   Infineum USA L.P., a Linden-based chemical company jointly owned by Shell
and Exxon, had about 50 extra workers on site New Year's Eve, but starting
letting them go home about 1 a.m. Saturday, said spokeswoman Wendy Lempke.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Karlovich, a spokesman for Tosco Refining Corp., said the
Linden-based refinery had a "smooth transition" as well. Tosco had a transition
team in place, but is now back to normal staffing levels, he said.

<HEADLINE> Elizabeth Dole Set To Endorse Bush  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole, who ended her bid for the presidency after
citing problems competing for cash with George W. Bush, planned to endorse the
Texas governor this week, according to associates close to both politicians.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials, who said Sunday that the details were not final, said Dole
was expected to endorse Bush Tuesday in New Hampshire and make two campaign
stops with him in Iowa, the sites of the first two GOP presidential contests.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Dole dropped out of the race in October, nearly broke and before any
votes were cast. More than 100 fund-raisers had netted her only $5 million, less
than one-tenth of Bush's record-breaking bankroll at that time. Though second
place in many national polls -- she hovered around 10 percent -- she trailed
Arizona Sen. John McCain in New Hampshire and lagged well behind Bush
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole's endorsement would help Bush attract women to his campaign. Married
suburban mothers especially are considered critical swing votes in the general
election and early polls show Bush leading all candidates in that category.
</P>
<P>
	   A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll conducted after Dole dropped out Oct. 20 showed
that Bush's support among Republican-leaning women jumped 13 percentage points
to 68 percent after her departure. Dole had the support of 14 percent of women
before leaving the race, though it's impossible to say his gains were from her
supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole associates have urged her for weeks to endorse Bush and said Sunday
that this is the perfect time to help him, as he races McCain for first place in
New Hampshire. They hope an endorsement elevates her chances to be Bush's
running mate, though officials in both camps say no guarantees have been made.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Bush is said to favor prospects who have been elected officeholders.
Mrs. Dole is a two-time Cabinet member and former president of American Red
Cross but had never sought office before her failed 1999 bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole associates have long harbored suspicions that McCain's camp spread
rumors that she was going to drop out. The rumors hurt her campaign well before
she finally bowed out.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing her lack of ``money, money, money,'' Dole in October declared her
nomination bid futile and abandoned her effort to become the nation's first
female president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't run on air,'' she complained on CNN's Larry King Live. ``The
message is money and that's too bad, because that really diminished the
process.''

   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A New Year's Eve reveler who fell to his death on
the Las Vegas Strip after climbing a light pole was a former Stanford University
wrestling star who hoped to compete in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
	   Tod Surmon, 26, of Menlo Park, Calif., landed on his head and died early
Saturday after apparently grabbing an electrical wire attached to the pole.
</P>
<P>
	   His family and friends said Surmon had always been a daredevil.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He had an invincible attitude,'' said his older sister, Dawn DeFord. ``He
used to climb the Golden Gate Bridge in college. He would rock-climb without
ropes. We had these radio towers behind our house growing up, big tall ones, he
used to climb them at night. It was just Tod.''
</P>
<P>
	   Surmon was celebrating the new year with friends just a day after winning at
the Midlands Wrestling Championships in Chicago, a major national tournament
that put him in contention for the Olympic team, Stanford head wrestling coach
Chris Horpel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Horpel, who coached Surmon to his recent victory, went to a Chicago airport
with him Friday morning, where Surmon caught a flight to Las Vegas and Horpel
went to Los Angeles for the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I said to him, `People are going to be doing crazy things. Be careful,'''
Horpel recalled. ``And he looked at me and smiled and said, `You know I
won't.'''

Memorial Hospital. Her sister was born in the final moments of 1999 -- at 11:48

	   ``It took me by surprise,'' said the pair's mother, Tina Thornton, who began
having contractions last week despite her Jan. 22 due date.

	   GALVESTON, Texas (AP) -- The all-volunteer crew of the Elissa, a National
Historic Landmark, sailed the tall ship about seven miles into the Gulf of
Mexico to celebrate its third different century of sailing.
</P>
<P>
	   The Elissa, first launched in Scotland in 1877, has since sailed under
different names and from different countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The Galveston Historical Foundation purchased the ship in 1975 and restored
it; the Elissa is now one of only three square-riggers in the United States that
still sail.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurt Voss, director of the Texas Seaport Museum, said taking the ship out on
Saturday was one way to thank the volunteers who spend their free time
maintaining it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I liked the idea of having the ship underway on the first day of 2000, to
literally have her sailing into her third century,'' Voss said. ``Our volunteers
also have worked harder this year than we've asked them to in many years. I
wanted to do something special for them. They love sailing this ship.''

<HEADLINE> Critics say land preservation funds are too narrow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - An environmental group in New Jersey says the
state's commitment to preserve open space is too focused on farmlands. But
agriculture officials insist they need to act fast to preserve as much farmland
as possible to keep the industry viable.
<P>
	   And according to a published report, most of the land in New Jersey lost to
development is non-agricultural.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1982, New Jersey has lost about 600,000 acres of land to development,
but at most one-third was agricultural land, Gannett New Jersey reported in
Sunday's editions. Between 1992 and 1997, at least 80 percent of 300,000 acres
lost to development was non-agricultural open space.
</P>
<P>
	   Those figures worry an environmental group that says not enough emphasis
goes to other types of open space, such as forests.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not opposed to farmland getting money," Jeff Tittle, executive director
of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, told Gannett. "I am concerned that
there is going to be (a) critical shortage of money for the local towns and
counties that also want to preserve open space."
</P>
<P>
	   The state's open space program dedicates about 40 percent of funding to
preserving farmland and paying off acquisition debt. The remaining 40 percent is
supposed to be split between the state, for the purchase of recreational and
conservation lands, and local governments, in the form of grants and loans to
purchase open space.
</P>
<P>
	   Tittle said what's left over isn't enough to buy up areas that ought to be
saved from development.
</P>
<P>
	   But even if statistics don't show it, New Jersey's farming industry could be
in danger if more farmland isn't saved quickly, said Greg Romano, executive
director of the state's preservation program. He said saving farmland will help
avert a statewide crisis in farming.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we don't do it now, it's only going to get worse," Romano told Gannett.
</P>
<P>
	   About 830,000 acres in the state are set aside for farming, according to the
report. That's down from more than 1 million acres 20 years ago. Most of the
loss took place in the 1980s, when more than 150,000 acres were swallowed up by
development. That slowed to about 50,000 lost acres since 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the acreage has declined, the number of farms has increased since
1979. And more properties are receiving tax reductions under the Farmland
Assessment Act than in all but two years since the program's 1969 launch.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, state and federal data indicate the rate at which development is
overtaking types of open land besides farmland is increasing. Tittle said that's
evidence of the need to take the focus off of farmland.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Art Brown, state agriculture commissioner, said if it looks like
the state is overemphasizing farmland, it's only because it has been
underemphasized in the past. He noted that the state's 38-year-old Green Acres
program has committed about $1.4 million to conserve 300,000 acres of open land
statewide. By comparison, only about 77,000 acres of farmland has been
preserved, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   Romano said he expects preservation office will help purchase 30,000 more
acres of farmland to help keep agriculture viable.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey voters last year approved a 10-year, $98-million-a-year open
space preservation program, with Gov. Christie Whitman setting a goal of
preserving 1 million acres in a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a point where a critical mass is necessary to preserve the
agriculture industry. I think that 500,000 acres is that limit," Romano said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anything below that, you are going to be affecting the entire
infrastructure."

<HEADLINE> Bradley urges good people to step forward  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BOSTON (AP) - Bill Bradley beat Vice President Al Gore out of the 2000
starting gate Sunday, offering voters "a world of new possibilities guided by
goodness."
<P>
	   Echoing the youthful idealism of the City Year public-service corps that was
his audience, Bradley cast his campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination in the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who once blamed "the silence
of good people" for the prolonged civil rights struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   "My campaign is about asking good people to step forward and join us so that
our voices can be heard," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   To white Americans unmoved by what he called the moral imperative of racial
unity, Bradley also offered a more practical motivation. By 2010, he said,
native-born white Americans will be a minority in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   "Increasingly, the future of white Americans will depend on the talents of
non-white Americans - that is, if labor economics means anything. ... And that
is why it is the ultimate, common-sense self-interest to get this racial
division behind us," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The former senator and professional basketball player made his first Year
2000 campaign stop in Massachusetts, where news coverage crosses into
neighboring New Hampshire. There, Bradley is running neck in neck with Gore in
polls gauging the outcome of New Hampshire's leadoff primary Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   He needed a bit of warm-up getting back into the game after a Christmas and
New Year's holiday. As young, red-coated volunteers demonstrated
physical-training drills, Bradley joined their elbow thrusts and hand claps
off-rhythm to the drill sergeant's call.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was resuming his campaign with a trip to Iowa on Monday. Both
Democratic presidential hopefuls - Gore in Davenport, Bradley in Manchester,
N.H. - were using Monday speeches to restate campaign themes and kick off the
sprint to Iowa's Jan. 24 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Before heading on to Concord, N.H., for a Sunday evening town hall, Bradley
heard from City Year Boston's executive director, Robert Lewis Jr., who is black
and said he lost his grandfather "to the cause of the Ku Klux Klan" and was
himself called racial expletives growing up.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who offered Lewis a handshake and approving nod, used the occasion
to highlight racial unity as a core theme of his uphill challenge to Gore for
the Democratic Party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Acknowledging that it was premature to speculate on any presidential legacy
- "Before you have a legacy, you've got to get nominated, you've got to get
elected, you've got to serve with distinction, you have to die," he noted -
Bradley nonetheless said he would aim for this one: "That every child in America
- and I by that, I mean every child in America - has a chance to realize his or
her potential."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's attempt to be seen as the non-politician of the Democratic race
rang through his 30-minute speech to 200 people crowded into the stuffy City
Year conference hall.
</P>
<P>
	   The 18-year Senate veteran, always a formidable political fund-raiser and
aggressive campaigner, blamed today's low voter participation on the notion
among young people that politics "have become nothing more than the mechanics of
winning: Polling, fund-raising, spinning."
</P>
<P>
	   He reiterated two other "big idea" pillars of his campaign - eliminating
child poverty and providing universal health insurance - and tried to rally
idealists behind him.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to be president in order to use the power of that office to do good.
If each of you and millions of other Americans realize that you have the power
to do good - and a president is president in order to do good - then what we
thought was never possible can happen," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   "In other words, we've created a world of new possibilities guided by
goodness."

<P>
   ELKMONT, Ala. (AP) -- A small earthquake rattled windows across Alabama and
southern Tennessee Sunday morning but there were no reports of serious damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The earthquake had a magnitude of 2.7, according to the U.S. Geologic
Survey's National Earthquake Information Center. It struck Limestone County just
south of Elkmont at 9:04 a.m. and lasted about 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My husband went outside, and he didn't know what it was. He thought Browns
Ferry, the nuclear plant, had blown up,'' said Nella Harrison, who lives near
Elkmont.
</P>
<P>
	   Police phone lines were jammed with calls from nervous residents, but no
injuries or major damage was reported.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Limestone County Sheriff's Department, officers didn't ``the faintest
idea'' what had happened at first, said dispatcher Tammy Waddell. ``Everybody
was afraid it was an explosion.''

<HEADLINE> Reunion Remembered 50 Years Later  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Vt. (AP) -- One day in 1949, Glenn Skiff was talking to his
Cambridge High School science students about time and space.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He talked about the year 2000,'' said Louise Lafountain, then a
13-year-old ninth-grader named Louise Sanborn. ``I said, `What do you care; you
won't be here.' He said, `Excuse me, young lady.' I thought I'd soften it a
little and said, `None of us will be here.'''
</P>
<P>
	   The two then made a pact: At noon on Jan. 1, 2000, they'd meet on the front
steps of what was then Murray Noble's general store on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Lafountain was there Saturday with tears in her eyes. Skiff had
suffered a stroke and died just hours earlier. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
	   His son, Bill, said Glenn Skiff, known to most people as ``Pappy'' because
of his fatherly manner, had been anticipating New Year's Day 2000 for a half
century.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Basically, Dad had a wonderful life,'' he said. ``He went to sleep
(Friday) night looking forward to a reunion the next day. That's pretty nice to
think about.''
</P>
<P>
	   The reunion became a bittersweet tribute, with about 15 of Skiff's former
students sharing memories of him as they stood on the steps of the old general
store -- now an antiques shop.
</P>
<P>
	   Skiff worked as an insurance agent and farmer before getting into teaching
after World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Skiff said his lean, bespectacled father called himself the ``cleanup
man,'' because he taught everything at tiny Cambridge High -- science, English,
social studies, even physical education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He always kept your attention,'' said Peg Machia, who had Skiff as a
teacher in the 1950s and remembers that he always sat on the corner of his desk
closest to his students. ``He was just a part of us.''
</P>
<P>
	   The school had no library, so the ``cleanup man'' and his wife, Marjorie,
cleaned up an old coal bin at the school and bought some books to fill it. Mrs.
Skiff died seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Skiff and Mrs. Lafountain stayed in touch through the years, occasionally
reminding one another: 20 years, 10 years, five years until the reunion.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Skiff called Mrs. Lafountain at home Saturday morning to say his father
had died at about 7:30 a.m. She went to the old Noble's store anyway, to share
the news.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We made our history,'' Mrs. Lafountain said. ``We just didn't make it with
the glory we intended. He made it to 2000, and so did I.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Baltimore, four women who were in high school in 1943 kept a date they
made then to meet at the city's Washington Monument on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't expect to be here,'' said Pat Bacon Gressitt, 74, of Atlantic
Highlands, N.J. ``I partied a lot.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Gressit met up with Dotty Gray Zerzavy, Dottie Berlet Warfield and her
husband and Katherine Bunch Ginder and her husband. A fifth classmate from
Eastern High School came along as a witness.
</P>
<P>
	   Three of the women kept in touch over the years. For years, nobody knew what
had become of Ms. Zerzavy, until she showed up at the 55th Eastern reunion in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Warfield, who turns 72 this month, said that as a teen-ager, she could
not imagine the plan without imagining herself ``very, very old, infirm even ...
Dressed in old clothes, a black dress maybe and a little pink flower. In those
days, when you were 70, you were really, really old.''
</P>
<P>
	   The reality: ``much better than I anticipated,'' she said. I mean, we're
doing fine.''

   COLONIE, N.Y. (AP) -- The Y2K bug made a comic cameo appearance Sunday
morning at an upstate New York video store, when it socked a customer with a
five-figure late fee.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the first customers of 2000 at Super Video rental in suburban Albany
returned a tape and was told that it was 100 years late. The damage -- $91,250.

	   Store owner Terry J. Field said a computer glitch was at fault.
</P>
<P>
	   Field joked that he had been tempted to collect a couple of late fees and
head to Florida for the winter. Instead, he recalculated the charges the
old-fashioned way -- with grammar school math and a ball point pen.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Elizabeth Dole Set To Endorse Bush  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole, who ended her bid for the presidency after
citing problems competing for cash with George W. Bush, planned to endorse the
Texas governor this week, according to associates close to both politicians.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials, who said Sunday that the details were not final, said Dole
was expected to endorse Bush Tuesday in New Hampshire and make two campaign
stops with him in Iowa, the sites of the first two GOP presidential contests.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Dole dropped out of the race in October, nearly broke and before any
votes were cast. More than 100 fund-raisers had netted her only $5 million, less
than one-tenth of Bush's record-breaking bankroll at that time. Though second
place in many national polls -- she hovered around 10 percent -- she trailed
Arizona Sen. John McCain in New Hampshire and lagged well behind Bush
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole's endorsement would help Bush attract women to his campaign. Married
suburban mothers especially are considered critical swing votes in the general
election and early polls show Bush leading all candidates in that category.
</P>
<P>
	   A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll conducted after Dole dropped out Oct. 20 showed
that Bush's support among Republican-leaning women jumped 13 percentage points
to 68 percent after her departure. Dole had the support of 14 percent of women
before leaving the race, though it's impossible to say his gains were from her
supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole associates have urged her for weeks to endorse Bush and said Sunday
that this is the perfect time to help him, as he races McCain for first place in
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky said the Arizona senator holds Dole in high
regard and has attracted former Dole backers who like his platform of campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Voters have been flocking to Senator. McCain beccause of his message, not
because of his bank account or list of endorsements,'' Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole's allies hope an endorsement elevates her chances to be Bush's running
mate, though officials in both camps say no guarantees have been made.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Bush is said to favor prospects who have been elected officeholders.
Mrs. Dole is a two-time Cabinet member and former president of American Red
Cross but had never sought office before her failed 1999 bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole associates have long harbored suspicions that McCain's camp spread
rumors that she was going to drop out. McCain's camp denies the charge, but the
rumors hurt her campaign well before she finally bowed out.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing her lack of ``money, money, money,'' Dole in October declared her
nomination bid futile and abandoned her effort to become the nation's first
female president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't run on air,'' she complained on CNN's Larry King Live. ``The
message is money and that's too bad, because that really diminished the
process.''

<HEADLINE> Pilot Defends Risky Cuban Mission  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The pilot who scattered pamphlets over Havana on New Year's Day
urging Cubans to revolt against the communist government calls himself a freedom
fighter, an escapee from a Vietnamese prison camp who once hijacked a plane to
drop similar anti-goverment pamphlets over Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
	   Ly Tong was questioned by U.S. officials after Saturday's flight into Cuban
air space but was released with no immediate charges, said Customs Service
spokesman Michael Sheehan.
</P>
<P>
	   Tong, 51, surrendered his two-week-old pilot's license to the Federal
Aviation Administration before his release. He said he had been planning the
flight for months.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Very important people are paying attention to what happens the first day
of the third millennium,'' he said. ``How can I sacrifice my life for Cuban
freedom? I believe in God, justice and my mission against communism.''
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department said Sunday that Tong had engaged in a ``provocative
and reckless action.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
	   Tong is a former South Vietnamese air force fighter pilot who was shot down
by the North Vietnamese in 1975 and jailed in a ``re-education camp'' for five
years.
</P>
<P>
	   He escaped and made a 17-month trek through mountains and jungles across
five nations. He eventually reached the United States in 1984, earned a master's
degree in political science from the University of New Orleans and became a U.S.
citizen.
</P>
<P>
	   In September 1992, he hijacked a Vietnam Airlines jet from Thailand and
dropped 50,000 anti-government leaflets over Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon,
the old South Vietnamese capital. He parachuted to the ground, apparently
thinking he would lead a revolution, but was arrested and sentenced to 20 years
in prison. He was released in September 1998 as part of a mass amnesty.
</P>
<P>
	   Tong, who now lives in New Orleans, said he dropped nearly 50,000 colored
leaflets over Havana on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The pamphlets found scattered in some Havana neighborhoods called on Cubans
to launch a general strike against the communist government and to seize radio
and television stations. They were signed ``Commander in Chief of the
Revolutionary Anti-Communist Forces of the World,'' followed by an illegible
signature.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I violated the airspace. That's not important,'' Tong said. ``The most
important thing I try to do is energize the Cuban people to rise up and
overthrow the Havana tyrant.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he wants to make similar flights over China and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anywhere there is no justice, no freedom, I will come there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tong said he flew his rented small plane only 10 or 15 feet above the ocean
on his flight to Cuba to avoid detection.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Customs radar tracked him after he left Tamiami Airport in Miami,
Sheehan said. And the Cuban government sent two MiG fighter jets to monitor his
flight but took no action.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're glad that the Cubans showed some restraint in this manner,'' Customs
Service spokesman Michael Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
	   In February 1996, two small civilian planes that flew to Cuba from Miami
were shot down by Cuban fighters, killing all four people on board. The men were
members of Brothers to the Rescue, a Miami-based exile group that searches the
ocean for Cubans trying to make it to Florida. The U.S. Congress retaliated days
after the 1996 confrontation by tightening sanctions against Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Religious Violence Spreads in Egypt  </HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SEVAREID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Religious tensions in southern Egypt turned deadly
Sunday, the third day of riots and looting sparked by a dispute between a Muslim
street vendor and a Christian shop owner.
</P>
<P>
	   Egypt's Interior Ministry said two people died in the village of el-Kusheh,
275 miles south of Cairo. But a local bishop said 16 people died, and that the
violence spread to two nearby villages.
</P>
<P>
	   Security forces have sealed off el-Kusheh, Dar el-Salam and Awlad Toq West
and were trying to stop people from shooting, looting and burning shops, Bishop
Wissa, whose diocese includes the villages, said Sunday night by telephone from
his home in another nearby village, el-Balyana.
</P>
<P>
	   Wissa listed names of 16 people he said died in the rioting, including his
daughter Samiya. Fifty houses, shops and warehouses, along with a church
building, were burned in Awlad Toq West, according to Wissa.
</P>
<P>
	   El-Kusheh residents were exchanging gunfire from rooftops of their homes,
the Interior Ministry said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press late
Sunday. Security forces intervened and the situation was under control, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   El-Kusheh has been blocked off nearly round-the-clock since Friday. The
ministry didn't mention the other two villages cited by Wissa, but said Muslim
and Christian religious leaders and local officials were trying to contain the
situation.
</P>
<P>
	   Wissa said the trouble spread to Dar el-Salam after Sunday church services,
when ``barbaric people carrying rifles went on a rampage and started firing at
Christian shops and Christian houses.''
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses in Dar el-Salam, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
protesters smashed and burned scores of Christian-owned shops and offices. They
said police opened fire to disperse the protesters, some of whom fired back, and
that more forces were called to restore order.
</P>
<P>
	   Demonstrators were protesting what they claimed were Christian attacks
against Muslims, the witnesses said. Most Christians, who are a minority in the
town, stayed inside their homes, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   The trouble began Wednesday in el-Kusheh, when Fayez Awad, a Muslim street
vendor, tried to purchase on credit some textiles from Rashad Fahim Mansour, a
Christian shop owner. Mansour allegedly refused and insulted Awad.
</P>
<P>
	   According to authorities, Awad returned Friday with one or two of his
brothers. When Mansour allegedly refused to apologize for insulting him, the men
started shooting, injuring three farmers passing by on donkeys.
</P>
<P>
	   Gamal Makawi, el-Kusheh's chief administrator, and police officers said at
least 10 people were wounded Sunday in el-Kusheh.

<HEADLINE> Pataki wants river research institute created on Hudson River  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - An institute should be created on the Hudson River
to conduct research applicable to rivers and estuaries around the world, Gov.
George Pataki said Sunday.
<P>
	   Pataki will urge state legislators in his State of the State speech
Wednesday to authorize the formation of an international center for studying
fish, plant life, pollution, water quality, currents and other aspects of
rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are going to create on the Hudson River what will be equivalent to a
world-class research facility for rivers and estuaries," Pataki said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the governor, the institute would be modeled after the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts, which has become an international
center for research.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think we have a tremendous opportunity to create that same type of
facility," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor will ask the Legislature to appropriate $1 million in 2000 to
get the institute project started. Pataki said he had no specific site in mind
for the facility, but envisioned it being a partnership between the state, the
State University of New York, private colleges and industries. The institute
would seek to fund its work largely through government, industry and foundation
grants, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said state officials hope to create a vehicle for high-quality
research into rivers in the same way the Rockefeller University in New York City
has become a center of internationally prominent medical research.
</P>
<P>
	   Thanks to sewer projects up and down the Hudson and more stringent chemical
discharge rules, the river is cleaner than it has been in decades. However, PCB
sediments north of Albany continue to keep contamination levels in fish elevated
throughout the river. There are other less severe chemical contamination worries
as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said the fact the river is not in pristine condition could be of
benefit to scientists studying how to overcome similar pollution problems in
rivers around the globe. The governor also said that if breakthroughs in
cleaning up contaminated sediments or river waters are made at the Hudson
institute, the river itself is likely one of the first beneficiaries of new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
	   Eventually, Pataki said an institute could have an annual budget of $50
million and employ 500 or more people.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is the logical next step to the progress we have made," Pataki said
Sunday. "I think it is a very exciting concept that would really have an
incredibly positive impact."
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Jones of the Albany-based Environmental Advocates said a Hudson
institute "sounds like a great idea."
</P>
<P>
	   John Cronin, known as the Hudson Riverkeeper in the environmental
organization of the same name, called the proposal "breathtaking" and
"magnificent." He said that because of the river's recovery, plus its location
in the urbanized Northeast, it is the perfect waterway to study exhaustively to
glean ways of improving other rivers and estuaries. One scientist has called the
Hudson a "laboratory that could inform the world," Cronin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cronin said it would make the most sense from a scientific standpoint to
site an institute in the lower half of the Hudson were the freshwater and
saltwater interactions are greatest in terms of their effects on fish and animal
life. He said that point is at about the river's 50-mile mark, or somewhere even
with northern Westchester County bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said his State of the State will also outline plans to spend $30
million more restoring the aquatic habitat of Long Island Sound. That will
include an initiative to improve the public's access to the sound from Long
Island westward to Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
	   There are only four significant public access points to the sound throughout
that entire shoreline, Pataki said. Most of the waterfront property is held by
either private landowners or municipalities.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said the state would be working with municipalities to try to get
them to free up more beaches, boat launches and other access points for the
general public.

<HEADLINE> Retired Adm. Elmo Zumwalt Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Retired Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., known early in his
career for modernizing the Navy and later for ordering the spraying of Agent
Orange in Vietnam, died Sunday. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
	   Zumwalt died of complications from surgery at Duke University Medical Center
after doctors discovered a cancerous tumor in his chest on Sept. 24, said Horace
Robertson, a family friend.
</P>
<P>
	   As commander of Navy forces during the Vietnam War from 1968 to 1970,
Zumwalt believed he inadvertently caused the death of his own son, Elmo Zumwalt
III, by ordering the spraying of Vietnam jungles with Agent Orange, a defoliant
that contained the toxic chemical dioxin. The son, who fought under his father's
command, died of cancer in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   The son said he did not blame his father for his illness, and the elder
Zumwalt said he did not regret his order.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do not have any guilt feelings because I was convinced then and I am
convinced now that the use of Agent Orange saved literally hundreds and maybe
thousands of lives,'' Zumwalt told The Associated Press in 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Zumwalt led efforts for more research into the chemical's deadly
effects. The Department of Veterans Affairs now provides medical treatment and
payments for various cancers and other diseases associated with exposure to
Agent Orange.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one has done more to face the consequences of Agent Orange and provide
benefits to sick vets,'' Bobby Muller, president of the Vietnam Veterans of
America Foundation in Washington, D.C., said Sunday. ``Not many military
officials now want to deal with Agent Orange exposure.''
</P>
<P>
	   Zumwalt wrote two books -- ``My Watch,'' published in 1976, recounted his
Navy career and warned Americans about the Soviet naval threat. His ``My Father,
My Son,'' published in 1986, was co-written with his late son and is an account
of their Vietnam experiences and the son's cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His bold, visionary leadership brought great change to our service in the
early '70s,'' said Adm. Jay Johnson, chief of naval operations. ``His actions
had profound impacts on the size, shape and culture of our Navy, which are still
evident today, nearly three decades after his watch.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Zumwalt's most treasured legacy is his unswerving commitment to
improving the lives of sailors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He carried that commitment forward even in retirement,'' Johnson said.
``Bud Zumwalt never stopped caring for or working to improve the sailor's life.
We are a measure richer for his efforts.''
</P>
<P>
	   At age 44, Zumwalt became a rear admiral, the youngest to reach that rank.
When he became the Navy's top officer in July 1970, he was 49 and the youngest
officer named to that post.
</P>
<P>
	   He quickly became famous for his ``Z-Grams,'' which made Navy careers more
attractive by relaxing regulations that enlisted men considered demeaning and
senseless. Among other things, the ``Z-Grams'' permitted beards and long hair if
maintained neatly, the wearing of civilian clothes at shore installations and
more free time in port.
</P>
<P>
	   Zumwalt also abolished the prerequisite of attaining the rank of admiral for
holding a major command at sea and widened freedom of choice in assignments.
</P>
<P>
	   At the U.S. Naval Academy, his attitude toward meaningless regulation was
reflected early in the fact that in his class of 615 midshipmen he ranked 24th
academically but 275th in conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   As the Navy's senior officer he increased the combat effectiveness of the
dwindling U.S. fleet by outfitting ships with more sophisticated and efficient
weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Zumwalt, who was born in Tulare, Calif., graduated cum laude from the Naval
Academy in 1942. He was awarded the Bronze Star for his valor during the Battle
of Leyte Gulf during World War II. In January 1998, he received the Presidential
Medal of Freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   He retired as chief of naval operations in July 1974. He unsuccessfully ran
as the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in Virginia in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   Zumwalt lived in McLean, Va., just outside Washington, D.C. Survivors
include his wife, a son, two daughters, six grandchildren, a sister and a
brother.

<HEADLINE> New Chair for Israel's Yad Vashem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Holocaust memorial named a former parliament
speaker as the chairman of its international board on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Shevah Weiss, 64, replaces Joseph Burg, who died in October, as head of the
Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial's advisory board that meets once a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Weiss served as lawmaker for 18 years, including seven as the deputy
chairman of the parliament and four as speaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Weiss was born in Poland and survived the Holocaust to immigrate to Israel
in 1947. He was a political science professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew University
for many years and represented the ruling Labor party in parliament until last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Weiss fought unsuccessfully in 1998 against the lifting of an informal
Israeli ban on the music of Richard Wagner, Adolf Hitler's favorite composer,
whose songs were often played at Nazi rallies and in death camps.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli radio stations now play Wagner's music, although it is never
performed publicly in the country.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Election: Chance for Change  </HEADLINE>
   By SNJEZANA VUKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- For voters in Croatia, this week's parliamentary
elections mark a chance to choose the country's direction -- whether to stick
with late president Franjo Tudjman's authoritarian style or turn to Croatia's
Western-oriented opposition.
</P>
<P>
	   Polling stations outside Croatia were open on Sunday to eligible expatriate
voters, and in neighboring Bosnia even the elderly and invalids stood in line
for hours to cast their ballots. People in Croatia proper will vote on Monday
and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Staying the path set by the late president means continued problems with the
Western democracies that supported Tudjman's independence struggle but later
grew cool to his authoritarian style.
</P>
<P>
	   A victory by the opposition, on the other hand, would improve Croatia's
chances of joining the European Union and NATO but at the cost of loosening
links to Croats in Bosnia -- burying dreams of nationalists on both sides of the
border.
</P>
<P>
	   Election rules stipulate that about 350,000 Croats outside the country,
about 9 percent of the total of 4.17 million voters, can cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Bosnian Croats are not strictly part of the so-called Croatian
diaspora, most of them carry two passports and are therefore eligible to vote.
Many did so on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Veso Vegar, a Croatian Embassy official in Sarajevo, said turnout in Bosnia
during the morning throughout the country was ``above any expectations.'' He
said soldiers of the NATO-led Stabilization Force were securing the areas around
the polling stations together with the local police.
</P>
<P>
	   With most expatriate Croats traditionally conservative, they are important
for the HDZ -- the Croatian Democratic Union of the Tudjman, which has been in
power since the country won independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Bosnian Croat hard-liners' aspirations for secession during the Bosnian war
that ended in 1995 were largely supported and financed by Tudjman's party, and
financial support has continued for Bosnian Croats since then.
</P>
<P>
	   Many voters in Bosnia who lined up outside polling booths Sunday said they
were ready to again vote for the governing party in recognition of such support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's clear -- HDZ,'' 71-year-old Nikola Milicevic said, quoting the
party's slogan, while standing in line to vote in the Croatian Embassy in
Sarajevo. Milicevic said he came with an organized group by bus from the nearby
town of Kiseljak.
</P>
<P>
	   Presidential elections in Croatia are set for Jan. 24, six weeks after
Tudjman, who led Croatia with an iron fist for nearly a decade, died on Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   But the vote for the lower house of parliament is seen as potentially more
crucial -- both the opposition and some Tudjman party members expect the new
parliament to reduce presidential powers and reclaim authority lost under
Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
	   Tudjman was present in the campaigning even after death -- his party put his
image and signature on its posters and TV ads.
</P>
<P>
	   The party has also played heavily on Croats' patriotic feelings, recalling
historic moments: 1991 independence, international recognition a year later, and
the 1995 recapture of lands seized by Serb rebels during the 1991 war. The
message was simple: We made it happen.
</P>
<P>
	   While the ruling party has downplayed everyday problems -- low wages and
pensions that are often late, as well as 20 percent unemployment -- the
opposition has focused on those issues. They promised to fight corruption,
concentrate on developing the economy and improving living standards.
</P>
<P>
	   They also promoted European-style democracy and cooperation with the West,
positions subtly attacked by Tudjman's party as potentially compromising
national interests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's two worlds, basically,'' said Zvonko Mimic, a 36-year-old computer
technician. ``We'll see to which one Croats really belong.''

<HEADLINE> Candidates Opinions on Trade  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Three days a week, beginning today, The Associated Press asks the major
presidential candidates a question on the issues. Today's question and their
responses:
</P>
<P>
	   Trade
</P>
<P>
	   Should the United States seek free or liberalized trade agreements with more
nations?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: ``Yes. Agreements to lower trade barriers open export markets
and create opportunities for Americans to earn more. Global agreements reached
through the WTO (World Trade Organization) have the greatest potential benefits,
but they must take full account of the impact of trade on the environment and
labor.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``Yes. As President, I will ask Congress for the power to reach new
trade agreements, and open new markets to our goods and services. But, where
ever necessary, I will also ask for, and use, the authority to negotiate labor
and environmental protections in those agreements.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: ``The U.S. should negotiate reciprocal trade treaties with all
nations, treaties that erase our monstrous trade deficits, assure U.S. economic
independence, and put our manufacturers and workers before any claims of a
mythical 'Global Economy.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Bauer: ``The United States should seek free trade agreements with more
nations because our workers and businesses have proven year after year that they
are the most productive in the world. I am concerned about the multinational
trade agreements of recent years, including the one that created the World Trade
Organization, that left millions of American workers and farmers at a
competitive disadvantage. We need to renegotiate these agreements or, if this is
not possible, withdraw and start over with trading partners committed to free
and fair trade.''
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: ``Yes, I am a strong advocate of free and fair trade. I
believe we'll be prosperous if we embrace free trade, and I'll make it a
priority to obtain new negotiating authority. I will work to end tariffs and
break down barriers everywhere, entirely, so the whole world trades in freedom.
The fearful build walls. The confident demolish them. I am confident in American
workers, farmers and producers, and I am confident that America's best is the
best in the world. Unfortunately, the Clinton-Gore Administration is the first
in 25 years to lose presidential trade negotiating authority. We need new
leadership on trade.''
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes: ``As an international business leader and CEO, I strongly
support tearing down trade barriers and opening new markets to American goods
and services as a way to create better American jobs and increase economic
growth. I propose a new North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement between the U.S.,
Great Britain and Ireland, and free trade agreements with Japan, Australia, New
Zealand.''
</P>
<P>
	   Orrin Hatch: ``I have long supported expanding trade with more nations,
especially with our agricultural products, and have been an active supporter of
the Export Enhancement Program and the Market Access Program to promote American
products overseas. America's farmers and manufacturers should be able to compete
in an open market.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: ``The United States should negotiate trade agreements with
nations but based on the individual needs of the United States and each trade
partner nation. The United States should not be a member of such organizations
as the WTO which is not a representative body. The WTO is unelected and
unaccountable to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``Yes. I believe in free trade. I supported NAFTA and GATT
(North American Free Trade Agreement and world trade agreement), and I believe
U.S. participation in the WTO will continue to be beneficial to expanding our
business opportunities around the world. The benefits of expanded free trade
have been an important contributor to the unprecedented economic growth of the
past decade.''

<HEADLINE> Clergy Incorporate 2000 Into Sermons  </HEADLINE>
   By RENEE RUBLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   At one church it was ``Y2J'' -- Jesus 2000. One minister called it ``a new
day.'' Another pastor told his congregation to leave the past behind.
</P>
<P>
	   From coast to coast Sunday, the beginning of 2000 was a common theme in
religious services, with clergy using the opportunity to call for a fresh start
and a millennium of faith, peace and devotion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Get into Y2J instead of Y2K -- Jesus 2000,'' the Rev. Jim Holley preached
to members of Detroit's Little Rock Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
	   ``God was in the last century, and he's in this one,'' said one of his
congregation members, Sheila Whitlow. ``I just hope for the future that man can
do better than last century, that we all can get along.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Dumas Harshaw Jr. of the predominantly black First Baptist Church
in Raleigh, N.C., urged his congregation to leave strife in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't be filled with arguing and don't be angry. You can't live in the
past. You have to live now,'' he said to ``amens'' from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Gary Hogue of First Congregational Church in Traverse City, Mich.,
hoped for a religious revival.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The 20th century was dominated by ideas that left God out,'' Hogue said,
including the Marxist belief in class struggle and capitalist faith in the
``invisible hand'' of the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The 21st century will be preoccupied with questions of God,'' Hogue said.
``So often, we identify ourselves with our job, our family, our country. Your
deepest identify is as a child of God.''
</P>
<P>
	   Celiste Carter, a member of St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral in Oklahoma City,
had similar thoughts: ``We need to take a closer look at religion as we enter
the new millennium. Religion seems to have fallen to the wayside. I think that
may be some of the reasons for youth problems.''
</P>
<P>
	   Several hundred cheerful people attended a service at Glide Memorial United
Methodist Church in San Francisco, where the Rev. Douglas Fitch exhorted: ``It's
a new day. It is a new way.''
</P>
<P>
	   He told the congregation to come out from behind the ``highly edited
versions'' of themselves. ``That's why I like the new year. It gives every one
of us the chance to tell the secret of who we truly are even if we only tell it
to ourselves,'' Fitch said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a prayer at the National Cathedral in Washington, President Clinton gave
thanks for the ``guiding light that saw us through'' the worst times of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We begin this jubilee year in humility, with profound thanks for the
divine light first revealed 2,000 years ago that has brought us now to this
sacred place today,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Bettie Chaplin of the United Methodist Churches in Aura and
Monroeville, N.J., said many people have been preoccupied with worries about the
Y2K computer bug and need to devote as much energy to faith.
</P>
<P>
	   In her sermon, called ``heaven compliant,'' Mrs. Chaplin said: ``We can use
this time to get our spiritual side in order and have a fresh start.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Robert Kopp of the Center Presbyterian Church southwest of
Pittsburgh also mentioned Y2K fears, which he blamed on ``existential
millennialists without religion.''
</P>
<P>
	   The millennium was even on the minds of clergy who saw no special religious
significance in it, such as the Rev. Don Kribs of Precious Blood Catholic Church
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Jesus came into the world to bring peace that people would start loving
each other and live in tranquility with each other,'' he said. ``He gave us the
power to do that, but 2,000 years later it's the same as it was then except now
we have technology, now we can blow up the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Fort Worth, Texas, churchgoers at University Christian Church lined up
shoeless in the fellowship hall to pray. The circle was the idea of the Rev.
Scott Colglazier, who sent letters asking clerics across the country to preach
for peace Sunday. Dozens of pastors responded.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's how we create peace, one drop at a time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   After listening to his pastor at the First Christian Church of Oklahoma City
preach about living instead of fearing, Bob Harrington had some words of his own
about our moment in time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today is the tomorrow we worried about yesterday,'' Harrington said. ``I
never worry about it. I'm one of those who takes it one day at a time.''

<HEADLINE> Critics say land preservation funds are too narrow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - An environmental group in New Jersey says the
state's commitment to preserve open space is too focused on farmlands. But
agriculture officials insist they need to act fast to preserve as much farmland
as possible to keep the industry viable.
<P>
	   And according to a published report, most of the land in New Jersey lost to
development is non-agricultural.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1982, New Jersey has lost about 600,000 acres of land to development,
but at most one-third was agricultural land, Gannett New Jersey reported in
Sunday's editions. Between 1992 and 1997, at least 80 percent of 300,000 acres
lost to development was non-agricultural open space.
</P>
<P>
	   Those figures worry an environmental group that says not enough emphasis
goes to other types of open space, such as forests.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not opposed to farmland getting money," Jeff Tittle, executive director
of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, told Gannett. "I am concerned that
there is going to be (a) critical shortage of money for the local towns and
counties that also want to preserve open space."
</P>
<P>
	   The state's open space program dedicates about 40 percent of funding to
preserving farmland and paying off acquisition debt. The remaining 40 percent is
supposed to be split between the state, for the purchase of recreational and
conservation lands, and local governments, in the form of grants and loans to
purchase open space.
</P>
<P>
	   Tittle said what's left over isn't enough to buy up areas that ought to be
saved from development.
</P>
<P>
	   But even if statistics don't show it, New Jersey's farming industry could be
in danger if more farmland isn't saved quickly, said Greg Romano, executive
director of the state's preservation program. He said saving farmland will help
avert a statewide crisis in farming.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we don't do it now, it's only going to get worse," Romano told Gannett.
</P>
<P>
	   About 830,000 acres in the state are set aside for farming, according to the
report. That's down from more than 1 million acres 20 years ago. Most of the
loss took place in the 1980s, when more than 150,000 acres were swallowed up by
development. That slowed to about 50,000 lost acres since 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the acreage has declined, the number of farms has increased since
1979. And more properties are receiving tax reductions under the Farmland
Assessment Act than in all but two years since the program's 1969 launch.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, state and federal data indicate the rate at which development is
overtaking types of open land besides farmland is increasing. Tittle said that's
evidence of the need to take the focus off of farmland.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Art Brown, state agriculture commissioner, said if it looks like
the state is overemphasizing farmland, it's only because it has been
underemphasized in the past. He noted that the state's 38-year-old Green Acres
program has committed about $1.4 million to conserve 300,000 acres of open land
statewide. By comparison, only about 77,000 acres of farmland has been
preserved, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   Romano said he expects the preservation office will help purchase 30,000
more acres of farmland to help keep agriculture viable.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey voters last year approved a 10-year, $98-million-a-year open
space preservation program, with Gov. Christie Whitman setting a goal of
preserving 1 million acres in a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a point where a critical mass is necessary to preserve the
agriculture industry. I think that 500,000 acres is that limit," Romano said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anything below that, you are going to be affecting the entire
infrastructure."

<HEADLINE> Religious Violence Spreads in Egypt  </HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SEVAREID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Religious tensions in southern Egypt turned deadly
Sunday, the third day of riots and looting sparked by a dispute between a Muslim
street vendor and a Christian shop owner.
</P>
<P>
	   Egypt's Interior Ministry said two people died in the village of el-Kusheh,
275 miles south of Cairo. But a local bishop said 16 people died, and that the
violence spread to two nearby villages.
</P>
<P>
	   Security forces have sealed off el-Kusheh, Dar el-Salam and Awlad Toq West
and were trying to stop people from shooting, looting and burning shops, Bishop
Wissa, whose diocese includes the villages, said Sunday night by telephone from
his home in another nearby village, el-Balyana.
</P>
<P>
	   Wissa listed names of 16 people he said died in the rioting, including a man
and his daughter. Fifty houses, shops and warehouses, along with a church
building, were burned in Awlad Toq West, according to Wissa.
</P>
<P>
	   El-Kusheh residents were exchanging gunfire from rooftops of their homes,
the Interior Ministry said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press late
Sunday. Security forces intervened and the situation was under control, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   El-Kusheh has been blocked off nearly round-the-clock since Friday. The
ministry didn't mention the other two villages cited by Wissa, but said Muslim
and Christian religious leaders and local officials were trying to contain the
situation.
</P>
<P>
	   Wissa said the trouble spread to Dar el-Salam after Sunday church services,
when ``barbaric people carrying rifles went on a rampage and started firing at
Christian shops and Christian houses.''
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses in Dar el-Salam, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
protesters smashed and burned scores of Christian-owned shops and offices. They
said police opened fire to disperse the protesters, some of whom fired back, and
that more forces were called to restore order.
</P>
<P>
	   Demonstrators were protesting what they claimed were Christian attacks
against Muslims, the witnesses said. Most Christians, who are a minority in the
town, stayed inside their homes, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   The trouble began Wednesday in el-Kusheh, when Fayez Awad, a Muslim street
vendor, tried to purchase on credit some textiles from Rashad Fahim Mansour, a
Christian shop owner. Mansour allegedly refused and insulted Awad.
</P>
<P>
	   According to authorities, Awad returned Friday with one or two of his
brothers. When Mansour allegedly refused to apologize for insulting him, the men
started shooting, injuring three farmers passing by on donkeys.
</P>
<P>
	   Gamal Makawi, el-Kusheh's chief administrator, and police officers said at
least 10 people were wounded Sunday in el-Kusheh.

<HEADLINE> Voters Want More Beanie Babies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- The people have spoken, and to no one's surprise they want
more Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
	   Ty Inc. had stunned collectors by saying it would "retire" the bean bag
critters, but then announced that it would let consumers vote on whether the
company should continue to pump them out.
</P>
<P>
	   Ninety-one percent of the consumers who took the trouble to surf into Ty's
Web site voted in favor of continued production of the little collectibles, the
company announced on its Web site Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Skeptics had suspected that owner Ty Warner planned all along to continue
Beanies in some form. Warner has, after all, expanded his factories and has
several trademark applications pending for Beanies with new names.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the spirit of P.T. Barnum still alive," toy analyst Chris Byrne said
when the vote was announced. "How do you milk even more publicity out of a
4-inch stuffed toy?"
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Beth Sobolewski, editor-in-chief of Mary Beth's Bean Bag World Monthly,
which has a business relationship with Ty Inc., said the last numbers she knows
of on Ty's Web site showed that 211,060 consumers voted shortly after 8:30 a.m.
EST on Sunday. Shortly after that, the company took the numbers off the Web site
and posted an announcement that 91 percent voted "yes" and 9 percent voted "no"
in the two-day vote.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement made no mention of plans to continue making the toys. It
said to "Expect the unexpected."
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives of the company, based in Oak Brook, didn't respond to calls
for comment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Each vote cost 50 cents, with all the proceeds going to the Elizabeth Glaser
Pediatric AIDS Foundation. Because Ty announced it would contribute three times
the amount spent to vote, nearly $420,000 was raised for the foundation,
Sobolewski said.

<HEADLINE> Automakers Ready Return to Work  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM SUHR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Major U.S. automakers resumed production Sunday at various
assembly and parts plants as proof their Y2K preparedness paid off.
</P>
<P>
	   General Motors Corp., DaimlerChrysler AG and Ford Motor Co. planned to ramp
up full production globally as scheduled Monday, coming off their traditional
holiday shutdowns and a weekend free of reported Y2K computer bug snafus.
</P>
<P>
	   At DaimlerChrysler's Jefferson North Assembly Plant, company and union heads
were celebratory in firing up the site's assembly lines and making 181 Jeep
Grand Cherokees -- just to show all's well after Y2K.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can sleep well tonight," Roger Ruggiero, vice president and general
manager of the company's Jeep and Truck Assembly Operations, said during the
four-hour trial run. "I know now that when we come in tomorrow morning, our
plants will be operational."
</P>
<P>
	   "We're thrilled. Like everyone else, we didn't know what to expect," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The automaker considered Sunday's "Y2K validation run" key, given the plant
is among the company's most-sophisticated, computerized assembly sites.
</P>
<P>
	   The drill also affirmed no Y2K-related kinks with the company's suppliers,
including important "just-in-time" ones that get their parts as needed to the
plant that -- like countless others -- doesn't keep large inventories on hand.
</P>
<P>
	   GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler spent about $1.3 billion preparing themselves
and suppliers for the year 2000 -- to them, money well spent in their apparently
seamless transition into the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not sure what we could have expected that could have made it much
better," said John Ahearne, a GM spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   GM, the world's No. 1 automaker, planned to fire up four assembly plants --
in Pontiac, Flint, Lordstown, Ohio, and Oshawa, Ontario -- by midnight Sunday,
Ahearne said. GM also anticipated routine startups of 18 North American parts
plants by late Sunday, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford's weekend testing also detected no Y2K glitches systemwide, ensuring
resumption of full production Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford on Sunday ramped up four assembly plants in the U.S. and Britain,
spokeswoman Kathleen Vokes said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would say we'll be in full force tomorrow," she said.

<HEADLINE> Greece, Turkey Ties Hailed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) -- Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, spiritual
leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, on Sunday said Turkey was forging
closer ties with Europe and had made significant progress in relations with
rival Greece.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe Turkey will have a rapid course toward integration with the
European Union,'' Bartholomew said after arriving at this northern port city to
attend the inauguration of a new concert hall.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey was named as a candidate for European Union last month. Greece lifted
long-standing objections to the agreement after the two neighboring NATO members
pledged to peacefully resolve regional disputes that have brought them close to
war three times in the last 26 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Bartholomew, who is based in Istanbul, said Greece and Turkey had made
``significant progress'' toward easing tension in the region. He renewed a call
on Ankara to reopen an Orthodox seminary on the island of Halki, near Istanbul,
which the Turkish government ordered closed in 1971.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has also urged Turkey to open the theological school,
where many Greek Orthodox leaders were trained.
</P>
<P>
	   Premier Costas Simitis joined Bartholomew at the inauguration of the
1,500-seat Thessaloniki Concert Hall.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Fight Led to Pa. Murders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   READING, Pa. (AP) -- A machine shop foreman who killed his wife and her three
children New Year's Day, then turned the gun on himself had been arguing with
her that morning after she threatened to leave him, police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kimberly Peffer, 27, had left the house with the children after a heated
argument the night before, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   She returned Saturday morning, sent the children upstairs to pack their
clothing, then began arguing again with her husband, Henry O. Peffer Jr., 47.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At this point, we're assuming there was a discussion ... and it escalated
to a point where he snapped,'' Muhlenberg Township police Chief Robert M.
Flanagan said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The children, all from Mrs. Peffer's previous marriages, must have heard the
shot that killed their mother, police said. The two boys were scrambling toward
their older sister's room when Peffer reached the top of the stairs and shot
Dustin Kline, 7, just outside the girl's door, Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tiffany Schaeffer, 12, and Jarad Kline, 6, were shot inside the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
	   All three and their mother died with single bullet wounds to the head.
</P>
<P>
	   Peffer called 911 about 10 a.m. Saturday, telling the dispatcher he had shot
his family, then saying ``I can't do this. I can't do this'' and hanging up,
said Sandra Haller, a supervisor at the Berks County communications center.
</P>
<P>
	   He was found with his wife in the family's breakfast nook, also with a fatal
shot to his head.
</P>
<P>
	   Peffer had been married twice before, and his last wife died of a brain
tumor several years ago. Ms. Peffer had recently returned to work as a waitress.
Co-workers said she had quit six months earlier because Peffer didn't want her
to work.

   ARNAUDVILLE, La. (AP) -- Damp weather crushed this small town's hopes of
getting into the Guinness Book of World Records by shooting firecrackers
continuously for 23 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after midnight, when the first roll of 20,000 firecrackers was lit,
the air grew thick with fog, said event promoter Huey Wyble.
</P>
<P>
	   To keep the firecrackers popping, rolls were placed on top of each other.
``We had to shoot them off three and four layers at a time to keep them going,''
Wyble said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of that, the ignition of more than 1 million firecrackers, which
should have taken more than 20 hours, took only five.

watch a fireworks display. Thirteen people suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   A section of the roof at the Plaza Resort and Spa collapsed, plunging people
10 to 15 feet onto a lower bar area.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought it was an explosion or something,'' said Blair Herschman, 19.
``I fell right on top of a bartender who was in a bar below us pouring a
drink.''

	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Ken Grimes began the last 17 years the way he spent most
of his time -- drinking or taking drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   But this New Year's weekend he was clean, sober and wide awake to the
knowledge that beating his addictions in 2000 is more than a resolution. For
him, it's a matter of life and death.
</P>
<P>
	   ``2000 for me is a wakeup call. It's a chance to become a member of society

want to recover from drug habits and other problems.
</P>

people dealing with difficulties including poor diet, serious debt and mental
illness.

of 2000 partly to give people a chance to make a psychological break with their
past.

	   LeBaron McDonald, a formerly homeless man, said his goal for 2000 is to
obtain a commercial driver's license through a rehabilitation program.

<HEADLINE> Crisis-Free Y2K Could Boost Markets  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stock market averages powered their way to record
highs as 1999 ended, despite some lingering worries about the 2000 computer
conversion. Now, with markets worldwide reporting no major troubles, many
analysts expect stocks to soar anew.
</P>
<P>
	   "We could see a new wave of money coming into the market based entirely on
the good news about Y2K," said Jim Weiss, deputy chief investment officer for
equities at State Street Research and Management Co. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   All major U.S. stock market indicators ended 1999 at record highs, with the
Nasdaq composite index capping a spectacular rise of nearly 86 percent for the
year. The Nasdaq, Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 all
completed an unprecedented fifth straight year of double-digit percentage gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Many major world stock market indicators also are beginning the new year at
all-time highs.
</P>
<P>
	   This weekend's smooth sailing on Y2K removed one obstacle to a continued
stock-buying binge.
</P>
<P>
	   Market analysts and Y2K gurus caution that the full impact of the computer
conversion isn't known yet, and may not be clear for days or weeks. But weekend
tests, and early trading in Middle Eastern markets that opened for business on
Sunday, showed little evidence of the problems that many feared.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, banks, stock exchanges and other financial services companies
said their systems were fully operational on Saturday and will be ready for
Monday business. The 48 organizations reporting to the Financial Services
Coordination and Communication Center also includes electronic communications
networks, which trade stocks online, and government securities dealers.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Tokyo's stock exchange reported no problems in trading or clearing
systems. But a number of small brokerages reported glitches in a record-keeping
system developed by Nomura Research Institute. Nomura said it hopes to fix the
problem by late Sunday. Japanese financial markets are closed until Tuesday,
giving exchange officials an extra day to run tests.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kuwait Stock Exchange offered one of the first true tests, opening for a
full trading session on Sunday. Safaak al-Rukeibi, deputy general manager, told
the Kuwait News Agency that "all trading operations were normal and there were
no problems whatsoever."
</P>
<P>
	   Market officials in Singapore, Cairo and Rome also proclaimed their
readiness for trading this week. That's good news to market watchers in the
United States, who believe businesses and financial exchanges here are the best
prepared in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   "The U.S. and Europe have been aware of Y2K for far too long, and have spent
far too much money, to have left things unchecked," Weiss said. "Most big
systems have been subjected to three to six months of testing, and should be
more than ready."
</P>
<P>
	   With market enthusiasm running high, a smooth conversion could provide some
extra punch, Weiss added.
</P>
<P>
	   "There has been a bit of a cautionary approach in the way investors have
allocated new money," he said, citing an influx of money into more conservative
money market funds. That could change if investors perceive the successful
conversion to Y2K as reason to pour money into the buoyant stock market.
</P>
<P>
	   Year 2000 worries, weren't the market's only concern, however. The market's
course in early 2000 will be determined largely by the Federal Reserve, which
raised interest rates three times in 1999 but left rates unchanged at its last
meeting of the year, saying it wanted to help ensure a smooth transition into
Y2K.
</P>
<P>
	   The glitch-free conversion could encourage the Fed to resume tightening
rates as soon as their next meeting, scheduled for Feb. 1 and 2, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The consensus is that they'll raise rates 25 basis points," or a
quarter-percentage point, said Charles Crane, chief market strategist at Key
Asset Management. "There's a growing view that they could go as far as 50 basis
points."
</P>
<P>
	   An increase of 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, would be the
steepest increase in the federal funds rate since a boost from 5.50 percent to
6.0 percent on Feb. 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, many of the market sectors neglected in the 1999 frenzy
for technology shares could rebound, said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market
strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been in a very selective market," he said. "But we believe the market
is ready to broaden out."

<HEADLINE> Haitian Migrants' Boat Runs Aground  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Hundreds of protesters rallied for a second day in support of
411 Haitian, Dominican and Chinese people taken into custody after their wooden
ship ran aground off the Florida coast New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   While the would-be migrants remained on Coast Guard ships offshore pending
their expected return to their homelands, about 400 people chanted slogans
outside the Coast Guard's Miami Beach station Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters want U.S. laws changed to treat Haitians trying to get into
the country more like Cubans, who generally are allowed to remain if they reach
shore. Under a Haiti-U.S. agreement, those without proper documents are
returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph Metelous, 71, of Miami, who arrived from Haiti four years ago, said
anyone who makes the treacherous journey in an attempt to reach the United
States should be allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
	   He talked about 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez -- the Cuban boy found clinging to
a raft after a boat he and his mother were on sank -- and the controversy over
whether he should be sent back to his father in Cuba or be allowed to remain
with relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a biased, racist policy,'' said Aude Sicard, a member of the
Haitian-American Grassroots Coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas also spoke up for the Haitians during
Sunday's rally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Something must be going on in Haiti for these people to risk their lives,
to risk their children's lives and risk the lives of their family members and
seek freedom in the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The migrants were found packed shoulder-to-shoulder on a 60-foot-long by
25-foot-wide wooden boat that ran aground early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The ship first appeared on the radar of the Coast Guard patrol boat Farallon
shortly before midnight Friday. It was running in the dark at five to seven
knots, and its crews ignored warnings by radio and loudspeaker from the Farallon
that it was headed toward shallow water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were trying to tell them to turn or you'll hit the reef,'' said Coast
Guard Lt. Cmdr. Andy Blomme.
</P>
<P>
	   After the boat ran aground on a sandbar, Coast Guard crews tossed life
jackets on board and tried to explain to the migrants that the wooden ship was
not safe and that, no matter what happened, they would not be allowed to enter
the United States, Blomme said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fearing that any threatening move could provoke the passengers to jump into
the water, the Coast Guard crews waited until dawn to persuade the migrants to
leave the rickety ship.

<HEADLINE> Retired Adm. Elmo Zumwalt Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Retired Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., known early in his
career for modernizing the Navy and later for ordering the spraying of Agent
Orange in Vietnam, died Sunday. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
	   Zumwalt died of complications from surgery at Duke University Medical Center
after doctors discovered a cancerous tumor in his chest on Sept. 24, said Horace
Robertson, a family friend.
</P>
<P>
	   As commander of Navy forces during the Vietnam War from 1968 to 1970,
Zumwalt believed he inadvertently caused the death of his own son, Elmo Zumwalt
III, by ordering the spraying of Vietnam jungles with Agent Orange, a defoliant
that contained the toxic chemical dioxin. The son, who fought under his father's
command, died of cancer in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   The son said he did not blame his father for his illness, and the elder
Zumwalt said he did not regret his order.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do not have any guilt feelings because I was convinced then and I am
convinced now that the use of Agent Orange saved literally hundreds and maybe
thousands of lives,'' Zumwalt told The Associated Press in 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Zumwalt led efforts for more research into the chemical's deadly
effects. The Department of Veterans Affairs now provides medical treatment and
payments for various cancers and other diseases associated with exposure to
Agent Orange.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one has done more to face the consequences of Agent Orange and provide
benefits to sick vets,'' Bobby Muller, president of the Vietnam Veterans of
America Foundation in Washington, D.C., said Sunday. ``Not many military
officials now want to deal with Agent Orange exposure.''
</P>
<P>
	   Zumwalt wrote two books -- ``My Watch,'' published in 1976, recounted his
Navy career and warned Americans about the Soviet naval threat. His ``My Father,
My Son,'' published in 1986, was co-written with his late son and is an account
of their Vietnam experiences and the son's cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His bold, visionary leadership brought great change to our service in the
early '70s,'' said Adm. Jay Johnson, chief of naval operations. ``His actions
had profound impacts on the size, shape and culture of our Navy, which are still
evident today, nearly three decades after his watch.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Zumwalt's most treasured legacy is his unswerving commitment to
improving the lives of sailors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He carried that commitment forward even in retirement,'' Johnson said.
``Bud Zumwalt never stopped caring for or working to improve the sailor's life.
We are a measure richer for his efforts.''
</P>
<P>
	   At age 44, Zumwalt became a rear admiral, the youngest to reach that rank.
When he became the Navy's top officer in July 1970, he was 49 and the youngest
officer named to that post.
</P>
<P>
	   He quickly became famous for his ``Z-Grams,'' which made Navy careers more
attractive by relaxing regulations that enlisted men considered demeaning and
senseless. Among other things, the ``Z-Grams'' permitted beards and long hair if
maintained neatly, the wearing of civilian clothes at shore installations and
more free time in port.
</P>
<P>
	   He abolished the prerequisite of attaining the rank of admiral for holding a
major command at sea and widened freedom of choice in assignments.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig described him as an example of
innovative energy and deep personal caring for sailors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He did a terrific job of increasing the sensitivity to the well-being of
sailors and also in addressing racial tensions that were then endemic in
American society, and also in the Navy, and made the Navy really much more of an
equal opportunity employer, and a place where minorities are valued,'' Danzig
said.
</P>
<P>
	   At the U.S. Naval Academy, his attitude toward meaningless regulation was
reflected early in the fact that in his class of 615 midshipmen he ranked 24th
academically but 275th in conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   As the Navy's senior officer, he increased the combat effectiveness of the
dwindling U.S. fleet by outfitting ships with more sophisticated and efficient
weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Zumwalt, who was born in Tulare, Calif., graduated cum laude from the Naval
Academy in 1942. He was awarded the Bronze Star for his valor during the Battle
of Leyte Gulf during World War II. In January 1998, he received the Presidential
Medal of Freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   He retired as chief of naval operations in July 1974. He unsuccessfully ran
as the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in Virginia in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   Zumwalt lived in McLean, Va., just outside Washington, D.C. Survivors
include his wife, a son, two daughters, six grandchildren, a sister and a
brother.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Gov. Proposes River Research  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The governor of New York is calling for the creation of
an institute on the Hudson River to conduct research that would be applicable to
rivers and estuaries around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki said Sunday he will urge legislators to authorize the
formation of an international center for studying fish, plant life, pollution,
water quality, currents and other aspects of rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   The center would be modeled after the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in
Massachusetts, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki will ask the state Legislature to appropriate $1 million in 2000 to
get the project started. He said the institute would eventually be a partnership
between the state, the State University of New York, private colleges and
industries.
</P>
<P>
	   Thanks to sewage treatment projects up and down the Hudson and more
stringent chemical discharge rules, the river is cleaner than it has been in
decades. The institute ``is the logical next step to the progress we have
made,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, PCB-laden sediment north of Albany continues to contaminate fish
throughout the river. Pataki said the fact that the Hudson is not in pristine
condition could be of benefit to scientists studying how to overcome similar
environmental problems elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Indian Cites Pakistan Hijack Link  </HEADLINE>
   By HEMA SHUKLA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's top security adviser on Sunday accused
neighbor -- and nuclear rival -- Pakistan of having links with the five men who
hijacked an Indian Airlines plane last week, holding 155 people hostage.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to Star TV, Brajesh Mishra said Indian intelligence intercepted
several radio conversations between militant groups in Kashmir, confirming that
Pakistan was involved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear it is a terrorist state,'' said Mishra, India's National
Security Adviser of longtime rival Pakistan. ``The establishment backs
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   The hostages were freed on Friday after being held for eight days, but the
crisis raised tensions between India and Pakistan, two nuclear-armed countries
that have fought three wars over the past half century.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of those wars were over Kashmir. India accuses Pakistan of backing a
decade-long insurgency in Kashmir, the Himalayan territory that is divided
between the two countries. Pakistan denies the charge and says it provides only
moral support to the movement.
</P>
<P>
	   The five hijackers acted in support of militant Kashmiris fighting against
Indian control of the Himalayan territory. They fled the southern Afghan city of
Kandahar on Friday, leaving the airport with three Kashmiri militants who had
been released from Indian jails in a deal to free the hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia gave the hijackers 10 hours to get out
of the country. They remained out of sight Sunday, while India and Pakistan
feuded over their identities and their whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
	   India claims the five are Pakistani citizens who crossed back into their
homeland from Afghanistan, and were near the southwestern city of Quetta.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have the names of all the hijackers who are Pakistani and the list of
militants they wanted to be released contained majority of Pakistani
nationals,'' said Mishra.
</P>
<P>
	   But Pakistan said the men were not Pakistani nationals, had not set foot on
its territory, and would be apprehended if they did turn up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Under no circumstances will these persons be allowed to enter Pakistan,''
said the country's Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider. He said Pakistan was on
``high alert'' to prevent the hijackers from slipping across the border.
</P>
<P>
	   Mishra claimed that in one of the messages intercepted by New Delhi -- a
discussion between members of two different separatist organizations -- one man
asked why the other had condemned the hijacking, saying that the hijackers were
acting on the instructions of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Mishra also said that an alleged refusal by Pakistan to accept some of the
sick and injured passengers when the plane temporarily landed at Lahore,
indicated Islamabad complicity in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear that Pakistan is showing enmity,'' said Mishra, who is also
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's principal secretary. ``As long as this
enmity continues there can be no talks between us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Armed with grenades, pistols and knives, hijackers seized Flight 814 some 40
minutes after it took off from Katmandu, Nepal, on a scheduled flight to New
Delhi, India, on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane made stops in India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates before
landing in Afghanistan the next day.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was carrying 178 passengers and 11 crew members when it took off
from Nepal. Twenty-seven hostages and the body of the slain man were unloaded in
the Emirates. One more passenger, a diabetic, was released Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Man Attacks With Cleaver  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A police officer was being hailed a hero Sunday after
tackling a man who allegedly attacked half a dozen people with a cleaver on a
busy San Francisco street.
</P>
<P>
	   Ying Tan, 49, was booked for investigation of six counts of attempted
murder, seven counts of assault with a deadly weapon and one count of assault on
a police officer after the New Year's Day incident.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses told police Tan first launched an assault on a California Federal
Bank branch, smashing a glass door and then attacking an ATM machine.
</P>
<P>
	   Then he started up the street, flailing at passersby. At least some of the
injured were part of a group of half a dozen Jehovah's Witnesses handing out
magazines, according to Don Garcia, a member of a nearby Kingdom Hall of Jehovah
Witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Ingleside District Officer David Wright said Tan was ``literally a madman.''
</P>
<P>
	   An officer was able to tackle him, and a homeless man grabbed the cleaver.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said none of the injuries was life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The guy was just crazy,'' said Darwin Rivera, 20, who saw Tan on the
street. ``He was hitting everybody upside the head. Whoever was in the sidewalk,
he hit them upside the head.''

<HEADLINE> Automakers Ready Return to Work  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM SUHR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Major U.S. automakers rolled into the new millennium with no
reported Y2K computer bugs. Now, they're set to get their vehicles again rolling
off assembly lines at full speed.
</P>
<P>
	   General Motors Corp., DaimlerChrysler AG and Ford Motor Co. resumed
production Sunday at various assembly and parts plants, coming off their
traditional holiday shutdowns and a weekend free of reported Y2K snafus.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, they were to ramp up full production globally as scheduled, refreshed
about entering the 21st century apparently free of Y2K trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can sleep well tonight," Roger Ruggiero, vice president and general
manager of DaimlerChrysler's Jeep and Truck Assembly Operations, said at a
Detroit assembly plant where a trial run Sunday went without incident.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're thrilled. Like everyone else, we didn't know what to expect,"
Ruggiero said.
</P>
<P>
	   The automaker considered that "Y2K validation run" key, given the plant is
among the company's most-sophisticated, computerized assembly sites. The drill
also affirmed no Y2K-related kinks with the company's suppliers, including
important "just-in-time" ones that get their parts as needed to the plant that
-- like countless others -- doesn't keep large inventories on hand.
</P>
<P>
	   GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler spent about $1.3 billion preparing themselves
and suppliers for the year 2000 -- to them, money well spent in their apparently
seamless transition into the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not sure what we could have expected that could have made it much
better," said John Ahearne, a GM spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   The world's No. 1 automaker was scheduled to fire up four assembly plants in
the U.S. and Canada by midnight Sunday, Ahearne said. GM also anticipated
routine startups of 18 North American parts plants by late Sunday, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford's weekend testing also detected no Y2K glitches systemwide, virtually
ensuring today's resumption of full production.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, the No. 2 automaker ramped up four assembly plants in the U.S.
and Britain, spokeswoman Kathleen Vokes said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would say we are very, very positive at this point, feel good and don't
anticipate any issues that will impact the business whatsoever," said George
Surdu, Ford's technical-services director and global Year 2000 program manager.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, "I'm going to hold my optimism down and not claim success
quite yet. We have a full week of production ahead of us."

<HEADLINE> Haitian Migrants' Boat Runs Aground  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Hundreds of protesters rallied for a second day in support of
411 Haitian, Dominican and Chinese people taken into custody after their wooden
ship ran aground off the Florida coast New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   While the would-be migrants remained on Coast Guard ships offshore pending
their expected return to their homelands, about 400 people chanted slogans
outside the Coast Guard's Miami Beach station Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters want U.S. laws changed to treat Haitians trying to get into
the country more like Cubans, who generally are allowed to remain if they reach
shore. Under a Haiti-U.S. agreement, those without proper documents are
returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph Metelous, 71, of Miami, who arrived from Haiti four years ago, said
anyone who makes the treacherous journey in an attempt to reach the United
States should be allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
	   He talked about 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez -- the Cuban boy found clinging to
a raft after a boat he and his mother were on sank -- and the controversy over
whether he should be sent back to his father in Cuba or be allowed to remain
with relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a biased, racist policy,'' said Aude Sicard, a member of the
Haitian-American Grassroots Coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas also spoke up for the Haitians during
Sunday's rally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Something must be going on in Haiti for these people to risk their lives,
to risk their children's lives and risk the lives of their family members and
seek freedom in the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The migrants were found packed shoulder-to-shoulder on a 60-foot-long by
25-foot-wide wooden boat that ran aground early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The ship first appeared on the radar of the Coast Guard patrol boat Farallon
shortly before midnight Friday. It was running in the dark at five to seven
knots, and its crews ignored warnings by radio and loudspeaker from the Farallon
that it was headed toward shallow water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were trying to tell them to turn or you'll hit the reef,'' said Coast
Guard Lt. Cmdr. Andy Blomme.
</P>
<P>
	   After the boat ran aground on a sandbar, Coast Guard crews tossed life
jackets on board and tried to explain to the migrants that the wooden ship was
not safe and that, no matter what happened, they would not be allowed to enter
the United States, Blomme said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fearing that any threatening move could provoke the passengers to jump into
the water, the Coast Guard crews waited until dawn to persuade the migrants to
leave the rickety ship.
</P>
<P>
	   The ship apparently had been at sea for at lease five days, and most of the
passengers were weary and dehydrated, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two women -- one five months pregnant and possibly injured by a fall during
the trip, and one who was suffering from a fever and convulsions -- were taken
to a hospital Saturday, Petty Officer Sean Connett said. Both were in good
condition Sunday, a South Shore Hospital spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the Coast Guard rescued or turned back 363 Haitians and 406
Dominicans trying to reach the United States.

doing all the things that a normal newborn would do,'' Denning said.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors estimated the girl was born sometime on New Year's Day or early
Sunday, two to 24 hours before she was found.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators were trying to find her parents but had no leads.
</P>
<P>
	   The infant will likely be placed in foster care, police spokeswoman Virginia
Lopez said. She said she could not discuss the possible charges against the
mother or person who abandoned the baby until that person is found.

<P>
   AYACUCHO, Peru (AP) -- A crowded passenger bus carrying mostly merchants from
the central jungle town of San Francisco to the high Andean city of Ayacucho
plunged from a winding mountain road Sunday, leaving at least 29 people dead and
seven injured, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The accident occurred midday, 37 miles northeast of Ayacucho, 230 miles
southeast of the capital, Lima.
</P>
<P>
	   Police blamed a combination of unsafe speed and poor road conditions for the
crash, which claimed the lives of both the bus driver and his wife.
</P>
<P>
	   The 40-seat bus carried 36 people when it plummeted more than 495 feet from
a zigzagging mountain road, crashing onto a lower section of the highway below,
a police spokesman told The Associated Press.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley beat Vice President Al Gore out of the 2000
starting gate Sunday, offering voters ``a world of new possibilities guided by
goodness.''
</P>
<P>
	   Echoing the youthful idealism of the City Year public-service corps that was
his audience, Bradley cast his campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination in the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who once blamed ``the silence
of good people'' for the prolonged civil rights struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My campaign is about asking good people to step forward and join us so
that our voices can be heard,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   To white Americans unmoved by what he called the moral imperative of racial
unity, Bradley also offered a more practical motivation. By 2010, he said,
native-born white Americans will be a minority in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Increasingly, the future of white Americans will depend on the talents of
non-white Americans -- that is, if labor economics means anything. ... And that
is why it is the ultimate, common-sense self-interest to get this racial
division behind us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The former senator and professional basketball player made his first Year
2000 campaign stop in Massachusetts, where news coverage crosses into
neighboring New Hampshire. There, Bradley is running neck in neck with Gore in
polls gauging the outcome of New Hampshire's leadoff primary Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   He needed a bit of warm-up getting back into the game after a Christmas and
New Year's holiday. As young, red-coated volunteers demonstrated
physical-training drills, Bradley joined their elbow thrusts and hand claps
off-rhythm to the drill sergeant's call.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was resuming his campaign with a trip to Iowa on Monday. Both
Democratic presidential hopefuls -- Gore in Davenport, Bradley in Manchester,
N.H. -- were using Monday speeches to restate campaign themes and kick off the
sprint to Iowa's Jan. 24 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Concord, N.H., Elks Lodge, Bradley drew an impressive dinnertime
crowd of more than 400 to what he boasted was ``the first town meeting of the
next millennium.''
</P>
<P>
	   He ducked one woman's sticky question of how much voters should count
President Clinton's impeachment scandal against his vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do I want people to vote for me becasue they want a a fresh start? Why
not?'' But, Bradley added, he'd rather win votes for his own agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in Boston, Bradley heard from City Year's executive director, Robert
Lewis Jr., who is black and said he lost his grandfather ``to the cause of the
Ku Klux Klan'' and was himself called racial expletives growing up.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who offered Lewis a handshake and approving nod, used the occasion
to highlight racial unity as a core theme of his uphill challenge to Gore for
the Democratic Party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Acknowledging that it was premature to speculate on any presidential legacy
-- ``Before you have a legacy, you've got to get nominated, you've got to get
elected, you've got to serve with distinction, you have to die,'' he noted --
Bradley nonetheless said he would aim for this one: ``That every child in
America -- and I by that, I mean every child in America -- has a chance to
realize his or her potential.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's attempt to be seen as the non-politician of the Democratic race
rang through his 30-minute speech to 200 people crowded into the stuffy City
Year conference hall.
</P>
<P>
	   The 18-year Senate veteran, always a formidable political fund-raiser and
aggressive campaigner, blamed today's low voter participation on the notion
among young people that politics ``have become nothing more than the mechanics
of winning: Polling, fund-raising, spinning.''
</P>
<P>
	   He reiterated two other ``big idea'' pillars of his campaign -- eliminating
child poverty and providing universal health insurance -- and tried to rally
idealists behind him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to be president in order to use the power of that office to do
good. If each of you and millions of other Americans realize that you have the
power to do good -- and a president is president in order to do good -- then
what we thought was never possible can happen,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In other words, we've created a world of new possibilities guided by
goodness.''

<HEADLINE> 5 Texas Teens Dies When Truck Flips  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Five teen-age boys in the cab of a pickup truck
died when the driver lost control trying to merge onto a busy interstate Sunday
and hit another truck head-on.
</P>
<P>
	   The crash happened about 1 p.m. on Interstate 30 on the west side of Fort
Worth, said Fort Worth Police Department Lt. Ric Clark.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It crossed the median and then started flipping in the air, side over
side,'' Clark said. ``It crashed into a green Chevy truck going east on I-30 in
the right-hand lane. Both vehicles were completely totaled. It was massive
damage.''
</P>
<P>
	   All five were pronounced dead at the scene. One had been thrown from the
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
	   The driver of the other truck was hospitalized in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities were not releasing names, pending notification of their
families. Clark said all five teens lived in the Fort Worth area.
</P>
<P>
	   Removal of bodies and debris from the crash kept the eastbound lanes of I-30
closed for nearly five hours.

<HEADLINE> Indian Hostages Recall Hijackers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- The five men who hijacked an Indian Airlines plane
were remembered by the hostages on Sunday as the elusive Chief, the friendly
Burger and the cruel Doctor.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chief spoke in Hindi, India's national language, and mostly stayed in
the cockpit from where he negotiated with an Indian team at Kandahar airport in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't want you to be glum. I want smile on your faces,'' Chief told his
hostages after the plane had landed in Kandahar after stopping over at Amritsar,
Lahore and Dubai.
</P>
<P>
	   This was recalled Sunday by Rajendra Kumar Goud, copilot of the Indian
Airlines Airbus which was hijacked on a flight from the Nepalese capital
Katmandu to New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
	   The next in line was a man who introduced himself as ``Burger.'' He spoke in
English and he rarely budged from outside the cockpit, said Daman Soni, one of
the 155 passengers who were held by the hijackers until Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This man would get information from the Chief and then pass it on to
others,'' The Hindustan Times newspaper quoted Soni as saying. ``One day he was
in a good mood and told us that he had a daughter born two months ago.''
</P>
<P>
	   The most cruel of the lot was the one whom the hijackers addressed as
``Doctor.'' He killed an Indian passenger, Rippan Katyal, by slashing his throat
with a knife for defying instructions not to look at the hijackers, Soni said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Doctor'' inflicted knife wounds on another Indian passenger, Satnam Singh,
but he survived. ``He was extremely cruel and he slapped my son, who is
suffering from a kidney ailment, because he tried to look outside from the plane
window,'' Soni said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fourth hijacker, who appeared to be the youngest of the five, was
addressed as ``Shankar.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was well-built and told us that he was a boxer. He was a nice person
and sometimes he even cracked jokes. He once recited a couplet and it appeared
that negotiations with the Indian government were going on the right track,''
Soni said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fifth hijacker was referred to as Bhola, a Hindu name.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bye, Allah Ne Chaha to phit milenge (God willing we shall meet again),''
one of the hijackers told a hostage in Urdu as they began disembarking from the
Indian Airlines plane on Friday, ending the hijacking drama.
</P>
<P>
	   Another hostage was told: ``See you. We will be back soon. This is the only
beginning of our war against the Indian government.''

   DENVER (AP) -- A passenger who was detained in Denver after a United Airlines
flight from Chicago to Los Angeles made an unscheduled stop to unload him has
been released from custody, authorities said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   No charges were pending against the passenger, said Jane Quimby, spokeswoman
for the FBI in Denver. She declined to release his name, and Denver police did
not comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Quimby said another passenger on the flight had thought he overheard the
man make a comment about explosives.
</P>
<P>
	   United Airlines spokesman Kurt Ebenhoch said the 747-400, which had 179
passengers and 16 crew members, landed late Saturday night in Denver, where the
passenger was taken into police custody.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike O'Connor, a regional duty officer for the Federal Aviation
Administration in Seattle, said the plane was checked and then allowed to
continue its trip to Los Angeles. No explosives were found.

<HEADLINE> Automakers Ready To Return To Work  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM SUHR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Major U.S. automakers rolled into the new millennium with no
reported Y2K computer bugs. Now, they're set to get their vehicles again rolling
off assembly lines at full speed.
</P>
<P>
	   General Motors Corp., DaimlerChrysler AG and Ford Motor Co. resumed
production Sunday at various assembly and parts plants, coming off their
traditional holiday shutdowns and a weekend free of reported Y2K snafus.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, they were to ramp up full production globally as scheduled, refreshed
about entering the 21st century apparently free of Y2K trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can sleep well tonight," Roger Ruggiero, vice president and general
manager of DaimlerChrysler's Jeep and Truck Assembly Operations, said at a
Detroit assembly plant where a trial run Sunday went without incident.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're thrilled. Like everyone else, we didn't know what to expect,"
Ruggiero said.
</P>
<P>
	   The automaker considered that "Y2K validation run" key, given the plant is
among the company's most-sophisticated, computerized assembly sites. The drill
also affirmed no Y2K-related kinks with the company's suppliers, including
important "just-in-time" ones that get their parts as needed to the plant that
-- like countless others -- doesn't keep large inventories on hand.
</P>
<P>
	   GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler spent about $1.3 billion preparing themselves
and suppliers for the year 2000 -- to them, money well spent in their apparently
seamless transition into the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not sure what we could have expected that could have made it much
better," said John Ahearne, a GM spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   The world's No. 1 automaker was scheduled to fire up four assembly plants in
the U.S. and Canada by midnight Sunday, Ahearne said. GM also anticipated
routine startups of 18 North American parts plants by late Sunday, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford's weekend testing also detected no Y2K glitches systemwide, virtually
ensuring today's resumption of full production.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, the No. 2 automaker ramped up four assembly plants in the U.S.
and Britain, spokeswoman Kathleen Vokes said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would say we are very, very positive at this point, feel good and don't
anticipate any issues that will impact the business whatsoever," said George
Surdu, Ford's technical-services director and global Year 2000 program manager.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, "I'm going to hold my optimism down and not claim success
quite yet. We have a full week of production ahead of us."

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department, still on alert for Y2K snags, said
today there were no problems by early afternoon in New Zealand, among the first
countries worldwide to experience Monday morning. By early evening, the White
House Y2K command center had no other reports of serious trouble elsewhere.
President Clinton's top Y2K adviser, John Koskinen, called Monday "an important
and significant day" for ensuring some of the most important business computers
will work. The biggest uncertainty in the United States focused on hundreds of
thousands of small businesses that planned to reopen Monday yet took no
precautions to vaccinate their computers against the Y2K bug.

eligible expatriate voters, and in neighboring Bosnia even the elderly and

means continued problems with the Western democracies that supported Tudjman's
independence struggle but later grew cool to his authoritarian style. Election
rules stipulate that about 350,000 Croats outside the country, about 9 percent

<HEADLINE> Indian Cites Pakistan Hijack Link  </HEADLINE>
   By HEMA SHUKLA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's top security adviser on Sunday accused
neighbor and nuclear rival Pakistan of having links with the five men who
hijacked an Indian Airlines plane last week, holding 155 people hostage.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to Star TV, Brajesh Mishra said Indian intelligence intercepted
several radio conversations between militant groups in Kashmir, confirming that
Pakistan was involved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear (Pakistan) is a terrorist state,'' said Mishra, India's
national security adviser. ``The establishment backs terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   The hostages were freed on Friday after being held for eight days, but the
crisis raised tensions between India and Pakistan, two nuclear-armed countries
that have fought three wars over the past half-century.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of those wars were over Kashmir. India accuses Pakistan of backing a
decade-long insurgency in Kashmir, the Himalayan territory that is divided
between the two countries. Pakistan denies the charge and says it provides only
moral support to the movement.
</P>
<P>
	   The five hijackers acted in support of militant Kashmiris fighting against
Indian control of the Himalayan territory. They fled the southern Afghan city of
Kandahar on Friday, leaving the airport with three Kashmiri militants who had
been released from Indian jails in a deal to free the hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia gave the hijackers 10 hours to get out
of the country. They remained out of sight Sunday, while India and Pakistan
feuded over their identities and their whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
	   India claims the five are Pakistani citizens who crossed back into their
homeland from Afghanistan, and were near the southwestern city of Quetta.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have the names of all the hijackers who are Pakistani and the list of
militants they wanted to be released contained (a) majority of Pakistani
nationals,'' said Mishra.
</P>
<P>
	   But Pakistan said the men were not Pakistani nationals, had not set foot on
its territory, and would be apprehended if they did turn up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Under no circumstances will these persons be allowed to enter Pakistan,''
said the country's interior minister, Moinuddin Haider. He said Pakistan was on
``high alert'' to prevent the hijackers from slipping across the border.
</P>
<P>
	   Mishra claimed that in one of the messages intercepted by New Delhi -- a
discussion between members of two different separatist organizations -- one man
asked why the other had condemned the hijacking, saying that the hijackers were
acting on the instructions of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Mishra also said that an alleged refusal by Pakistan to accept some of the
sick and injured passengers when the plane temporarily landed at Lahore
indicated Islamabad complicity in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear that Pakistan is showing enmity,'' said Mishra, who is also
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's principal secretary. ``As long as this
enmity continues there can be no talks between us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Armed with grenades, pistols and knives, hijackers seized Flight 814 some 40
minutes after it took off from Katmandu, Nepal, on a scheduled flight to New
Delhi, India, on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane made stops in India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates before
landing in Afghanistan the next day.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was carrying 178 passengers and 11 crew members when it took off
from Nepal. Twenty-seven hostages and the body of the slain man were unloaded in
the Emirates. One more passenger, a diabetic, was released Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Critics say land preservation funds are too narrow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - An environmental group in New Jersey says the
state's commitment to preserve open space is too focused on farmlands. But
agriculture officials insist they need to act fast to preserve as much farmland
as possible to keep the industry viable.
<P>
	   And according to a published report, most of the land in New Jersey lost to
development is non-agricultural.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1982, New Jersey has lost about 600,000 acres of land to development,
but at most one-third was agricultural land, Gannett New Jersey reported in
Sunday's editions. Between 1992 and 1997, at least 80 percent of 300,000 acres
lost to development was non-agricultural open space.
</P>
<P>
	   Those figures worry an environmental group that says not enough emphasis
goes to other types of open space, such as forests.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not opposed to farmland getting money," Jeff Tittle, executive director
of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, told Gannett. "I am concerned that
there is going to be (a) critical shortage of money for the local towns and
counties that also want to preserve open space."
</P>
<P>
	   The state's open space program dedicates about 40 percent of funding to
preserving farmland and paying off acquisition debt. The remaining 40 percent is
supposed to be split between the state, for the purchase of recreational and
conservation lands, and local governments, in the form of grants and loans to
purchase open space.
</P>
<P>
	   Tittle said what's left over isn't enough to buy up areas that ought to be
saved from development.
</P>
<P>
	   But even if statistics don't show it, New Jersey's farming industry could be
in danger if more farmland isn't saved quickly, said Greg Romano, executive
director of the state's preservation program. He said saving farmland will help
avert a statewide crisis in farming.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we don't do it now, it's only going to get worse," Romano told Gannett.
</P>
<P>
	   About 830,000 acres in the state are set aside for farming, according to the
report. That's down from more than 1 million acres 20 years ago. Most of the
loss took place in the 1980s, when more than 150,000 acres were swallowed up by
development. That slowed to about 50,000 lost acres since 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the acreage has declined, the number of farms has increased since
1979. And more properties are receiving tax reductions under the Farmland
Assessment Act than in all but two years since the program's 1969 launch.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, state and federal data indicate the rate at which development is
overtaking types of open land besides farmland is increasing. Tittle said that's
evidence of the need to take the focus off of farmland.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Art Brown, state agriculture commissioner, said if it looks like
the state is overemphasizing farmland, it's only because it has been
underemphasized in the past. He noted that the state's 38-year-old Green Acres
program has committed about $1.4 billion to conserve 300,000 acres of open land
statewide. By comparison, only about 77,000 acres of farmland has been
preserved, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   Romano said he expects the preservation office will help purchase 30,000
more acres of farmland to help keep agriculture viable.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey voters last year approved a 10-year, $98-million-a-year open
space preservation program, with Gov. Christie Whitman setting a goal of
preserving 1 million acres in a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a point where a critical mass is necessary to preserve the
agriculture industry. I think that 500,000 acres is that limit," Romano said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anything below that, you are going to be affecting the entire
infrastructure."

   By The Associated Press Nat Adderly
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) -- Nat Adderley, a member of the Jazz Hall of Fame who
performed on nearly a hundred albums, died Sunday at his home of complications
from diabetes. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
	   Inducted into the Hall of Fame in Kansas City in 1997, the Florida-born
cornetist first came to prominence with his older brother, saxophonist Julian
``Cannonball'' Adderley, in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
	   The composer of such jazz standards as ``Work Song'' and ``Jive Samba,'' Nat
Adderley was known for recordings by his own group and with his late brother's
Cannonball Adderley Quintet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Cannonball was the big one. ... I'm just a little bebop trumpet player,''
Nat Adderley said in 1986. ``Bebop is the pot of gold, and you can't feel good
about yourself unless your playing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Adderley took up trumpet in 1946 and switched to cornet in 1950. He spent
time in the U.S. Army between 1951-53 and played in bands while in the service.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Cannonball's death in 1975, Nat had led his own quintets. His most
notable sidemen were altoists Sonny Fortune and Vincent Herring.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, he joined the faculty of Florida Southern College as artist in
residence. He had also headlined and hosted the school's annual ``Child of the
Sun Jazz Festival'' for more than 10 years.
George Carl
</P>
<P>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- George Carl, a comedian known for his slapstick routines
and vaudeville performances, died Saturday of complications from cancer. He was
83.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in Ohio, Carl started his career in the circus as a teen-ager. He went
on to perform for Queen Elizabeth and was honored at the Circus of Monte Carlo
with a prestigious clowning award, presented by Princess Grace and Prince
Rainier of Monaco.
</P>
<P>
	   His last professional work was a role in 1995's ``Funny Bones,'' staring
Jerry Lewis.
Maria de las Mercedes de Borbon y Orleans
</P>
<P>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Maria de las Mercedes de Borbon y Orleans, the mother
of Spain's King Juan Carlos, died Sunday in her residence on the Canary Island
of Lanzarote, the royal palace reported. She was 89.
</P>
<P>
	   De Borbon, who was also the Countess of Barcelona, died in the La Mareta
residence surrounded by her family, the Zarzuela Palace said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   No details on the cause of death were available. The countess had used a
wheelchair for many years since suffering a stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   King Juan Carlos and the entire royal family had traveled to Lanzarote to
celebrate the New Year at the residence.
</P>
<P>
	   A known lover of bullfighting, art and music, the countess spent almost half
her life, 1934-1976, in exile. She left Spain on the proclamation of the II
Republic in 1934 and went to live first in Paris and later Estoril, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
	   She met her future husband, Don Juan de Borbon y Battemberg, in 1935 in
Rome, where three years later she gave birth to Juan Carlos. He took the throne
in 1975 following an agreement between Don Juan and then-ruling Gen. Francisco
Franco.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition Socialist party spokesman Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba highlighted
``the role she played alongside Don Juan de Borbon in keeping the image of the
monarchy alive during (Franco's) dictatorship, something which was fundamental
during the transition'' to democracy.
Elmo Zumwalt
</P>
<P>
	   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Retired Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., known early in his
career for modernizing the Navy and later for ordering the spraying of Agent
Orange in Vietnam, died Sunday. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
	   Zumwalt died of complications from surgery at Duke University Medical Center
after doctors discovered a cancerous tumor in his chest on Sept. 24, said Horace
Robertson, a family friend.
</P>
<P>
	   As commander of Navy forces during the Vietnam War from 1968 to 1970,
Zumwalt believed he inadvertently caused the death of his own son, Elmo Zumwalt
III, by ordering the spraying of Vietnam jungles with Agent Orange, a defoliant
that contained the toxic chemical dioxin. The son, who fought under his father's
command, died of cancer in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   The son said he did not blame his father for his illness, and the elder
Zumwalt said he did not regret his order.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do not have any guilt feelings because I was convinced then and I am
convinced now that the use of Agent Orange saved literally hundreds and maybe
thousands of lives,'' Zumwalt told The Associated Press in 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Zumwalt led efforts for more research into the chemical's deadly
effects. The Department of Veterans Affairs now provides medical treatment and
payments for various cancers and other diseases associated with exposure to
Agent Orange.
</P>
<P>
	   At age 44, Zumwalt became a rear admiral, the youngest to reach that rank.
When he became the Navy's top officer in July 1970, he was 49 and the youngest
officer named to that post.

<HEADLINE> ABC: 175 Million Saw Y2K Coverage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- An estimated 175 million people watched at least some of
ABC's nearly 24-hour coverage of the world welcoming the year 2000, Nielsen
Media Research said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   That compares to 65 million people who tune it to ABC at some point in a
regular broadcast day, the network said.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC's Peter Jennings anchored a millennium broadcast that began at 4:50 a.m.
on Friday and stretched to 4 a.m. on Saturday, following New Year's celebrations
from the South Pacific around the world to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC dominated its rivals in prime-time, scoring an 11.7 rating and 22
audience share. NBC, which aired a "Dateline NBC" and a millennium special with
Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric, had a 6.2 rating and 12 share. CBS aired a series
of specials with David Letterman, musical artists and the Washington, D.C. New
Year's celebration, and had a 4.8 rating and 9 share.
</P>
<P>
	   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of the nation's
estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the percentage of in-use
televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
	   "People throughout the country were clearly very interested in the events
around the world on this extraordinary day," said ABC News President David
Westin.
</P>
<P>
	   Nielsen's New Year's report was based on overnight measurements from 44
major cities, representing about 60 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 128 million people watched at least some of last year's Super
Bowl between Denver and Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Asia Markets Show No Y2K Problems  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- As major Asian financial markets opened Monday for their first
trading of the new millennium, no Y2K problems were reported, and two major
stock exchanges in Asia quickly set new records.
</P>
<P>
	   "Trading has been fairly smooth so far," said John Yap, a dealer in
Singapore. "There's been no indication of any glitches. Trading has been as
smooth as we had hoped."
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark Straits Times index was up 22.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to
2,502.28 four minutes after opening, continuing the bullish trading of the past
two weeks. The index closed Thursday at a previous all-time high of 2,479.58
points.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first 15 minutes of trading, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped
183.44 points, or 1.1 percent, to 17,145.54, to reach another new record. The
index also had set an all-time high on Thursday, during the last trading of
1999, by reaching 16,962.10.
</P>
<P>
	   No Y2K glitches were reported on the stock exchange, which had conducted a
problem-free test run of simulating trading on Saturday, a move that left many
traders optimistic.
</P>
<P>
	   "Local sentiment can't get any better," Alex Wong, research manager at OSK
Securities Ltd., said at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan's stock exchange, the other main one in Asia, will not reopen in the
new year until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the United States, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board
of Trade also opened electronic trading on Sunday evening without a hitch.

<HEADLINE> Oil Slick Ravishes Small Penguins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Wildlife officers Monday were trying to save
more than 100 fairy penguins covered in thick black oil from a slick that washed
up on an island off Australia's southeast corner.
</P>
<P>
	   Ray Leivers, general manager of the Phillip Island Nature Park, said six
penguins had died so far and another 110 were being treated at an animal
hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The birds, named ``fairy penguins'' because they stand only a few inches
high, have been washed and placed in specially made woolen sweaters to stop them
from preening their contaminated feathers and ingesting toxic oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers and environmentalists fear more birds will be affected when they
try to swim out to sea to collect fish to feed their chicks on shore, he said.
Many chicks could starve to death if their parents died.
</P>
<P>
	   A large seal colony was also at risk from the oil slick that partially
washed up on Phillip Island, about 60 miles south of Melbourne, during the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The Victorian state government said the oil appears to have been dumped by
an unidentified ship some days ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Leivers said the slick missed the island's main penguin habitat site where
there are thousands of nests.

<HEADLINE> Podesta: Clinton Plans Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to call for a tax cut this year
along the lines of the array of tightly targeted proposals rejected by Congress
last year, his chief of staff said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think you can expect the president to propose a tax cut in his budget
and in his State of the Union,'' John Podesta said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.''
``I think that it will be about the size that we proposed last year.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican-run Congress last year passed, and Clinton vetoed, a 10-year,
$792 billion tax cut after rejecting the president's proposal for a targeted
package of cuts totaling about $36 billion over five years that he had included
last February in his fiscal 2000 budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   In issuing the veto, Clinton said the across-the-board GOP measure would eat
into a projected surplus without making adequate provisions for preserving
Medicare and Social Security and gave too much relief to the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
	   Podesta said Sunday the fiscal 2001 Clinton tax cut proposal would be
similar is scope to last year's package.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The reason for that is, as we said over and over again last year, that ...
we've got an important opportunity we've got an important opportunity now to
make investments in Social Security, in Medicare, in modernizing and improving
our military, in education, in these other priorities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But we do think there's room for a tax cut targeted at the middle class,
and we'll be putting forward one.'' While it will be similar to the 1999
package, ``I think we may have some new ideas in that regard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most of the net tax cut that we put forward last year went to increasing
savings, and we're going to continue with a tax relief in that area so that
people can save for their retirement along with extending the solvency of Social
Security. That's an important goal that we have,'' Podesta continued.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I think we may manage to change the package a little bit to invest in
some other important priorities, like expanding health insurance coverage and
investing and making sure that the people at the bottom end of the income scale
get a fair break in the tax code.''
</P>
<P>
	   Podesta declined to give further details or figures, saying he would that
for Clinton to lay out in his State of the Union address in several weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's proposals last year consisted of about three dozen measures
tightly targeted to benefit specific groups, but no broad overall relief. The
various credits totaled $36.2 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, he sought a $1,000 tax credit to defray the costs of caring for
a disabled or chronically ill relative and another $1,000 credit for disabled
workers to offset the extra costs they sometimes face in holding a job.
</P>
<P>
	   A third middle-class credit proposed last year was aimed at encouraging
small employers to provide health insurance for workers.

Markets To Open With Eye on Y2K Bug
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Major U.S. financial exchanges prepared to open Monday,
among the first worldwide since many countries have declared it a national
holiday. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade both
opened electronic trading this evening without a hitch. Experts cautioned that
countries and organizations that got a late start on repairs -- even here in the
United States -- aren't out of the woods yet. The biggest uncertainty in the
United States focused on hundreds of thousands of small businesses that planned
to reopen Monday yet took no precautions to vaccinate their computers against

Indian Official Cites Pakistan-Hijack Link
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's top security adviser on Sunday accused
neighbor and nuclear rival Pakistan of having links with the five men who
hijacked an Indian Airlines plane last week, holding 155 people hostage.
Speaking to Star TV, Brajesh Mishra said Indian intelligence intercepted several
radio conversations between militant groups in Kashmir, confirming that Pakistan
was involved. The hostages were freed on Friday after being held for eight days,
but the crisis raised tensions between India and Pakistan, two nuclear-armed
countries that have fought three wars over the past half-century.

Change May Come in Croatian Election

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Croatian voters this week mark a chance to choose
the country's direction -- whether to stick with late president Franjo Tudjman's
authoritarian style or turn to Croatia's Western-oriented opposition. Polling
stations outside Croatia were open on Sunday to eligible expatriate voters, and
in neighboring Bosnia even the elderly and invalids stood in line for hours to
cast their ballots. People in Croatia proper will vote on Monday and Tuesday. A
victory by the opposition, on the other hand, would improve Croatia's chances of
joining the European Union and NATO but at the cost of loosening links to Croats
in Bosnia.

	   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Jason Tucker turned a short catch into a 90-yard
touchdown, Raghib Ismail caught a 4-yard touchdown pass and Eddie Murray kicked
four field goals as Dallas beat the New York Giants 26-18 today to claim the
NFC's final wild-card berth. The Cowboys, who put their postseason chances in
jeopardy by losing their previous two games to the New York Jets and New

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION CITY, Tenn. (AP) -- A man suspected in a three-state killing spree that
started with the death of a 25-year-old Oklahoma woman was arrested Sunday at a
motel in western Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Ray Thacker, 29, of Chouteau, Okla., was arrested and charged as a
fugitive from justice and with the theft of a vehicle, Union City Police Chief
Joe Garner said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also is considered the prime suspect in the late December death of Laci
Dawn Hill of Bixby, Okla.; the stabbing death of Forrest Boyd, 24, of Polk
County, Mo., Saturday; and the killing of a tow truck driver in Dyersburg,Tenn.,
early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Thacker was arrested after an officer noticed Boyd's car outside a Union
City Super 8 Motel, Garner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thatcher was registered under another name and had dyed his hair. He was
walking out of a room with bags of trash when he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   His arraigned was scheduled for Monday in Dyersburg.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say the killing spree began after Ms. Hill advertised a pool
table for sale at her Tulsa County home and Thacker answered the ad. Her body
was discovered in a wooded area east of Chouteau on Wednesday, six days after
she was reported missing.
</P>
<P>
	   Law officers targeted Thacker after a surveillance video showed him using
Mrs. Hill's credit cards after her disappearance, FBI spokesman Dan Vogel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police found Thacker's car abandoned in a Springfield pharmacy parking lot
on Wednesday. The same day, a man matching his description answered another
woman's advertisement for a car for sale, then drove off from the same parking
lot with a 79-year-old woman and toddler in the back seat. Both were later
released unharmed.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, he alledgedly stole another car from a home in rural Polk
County about 20 miles north of Springfield and stabbed the owner to death. A
credit card belonging to Boyd was used twice the following morning in Sikeston,
Mo., and Boyd's car was found with Thacker at the Union City motel.
</P>
<P>
	   The car had a broken fuel gauge, and Thacker may have run out of gas and
called for a tow truck. Authorities believed he stabbed the tow truck driver to
death and took the truck but later abandoned it.

<HEADLINE> Rose Bowl Floats Through Pasadena  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The bands were gone, the lawn chairs packed away and
the streets swept clean, but Tournament of Roses festivities still drew a crowd
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   People traipsed through a Pasadena park all day Sunday for up-close views
and to smell the New Year's Day parade's 54 all-natural floats.
</P>
<P>
	   Every inch of every float that coursed through the streets of Pasadena in
the annual Rose Bowl parade before the big game Saturday was covered with fresh
and dried flowers, seeds, vegetables and in some cases, even seaweed.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the flowers from the floats were to be donated after the public
viewing, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 100,000 people walked among the 2 1/2 miles of floats for a last
glimpse on Sunday, said Dick Wheeler, administration captain for the Pasadena
Tournament of Roses Association's post-parade area.
</P>
<P>
	   Pasadena police also released parade-related arrest totals through Sunday.
Most of the 88 were misdemeanor alcohol-related offenses, many from the
all-night party people held to get seats for the parade. One man was jailed
Saturday after allegedly zapping a spectator with a stun gun in to get better
seats for his family, Lt. Rick Aversano said.

<HEADLINE> Podesta: Clinton Plans Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to call for a tax cut this year
along the lines of the array of tightly targeted proposals rejected by Congress
last year, his chief of staff said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think you can expect the president to propose a tax cut in his budget
and in his State of the Union,'' John Podesta said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.''
``I think that it will be about the size that we proposed last year.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican-run Congress last year passed, and Clinton vetoed, a 10-year,
$792 billion tax cut after rejecting the president's proposal for a targeted
package of cuts totaling about $36 billion over five years that he had included
last February in his fiscal 2000 budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   In issuing the veto, Clinton said the across-the-board GOP measure would eat
into a projected surplus without making adequate provisions for preserving
Medicare and Social Security and gave too much relief to the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
	   Podesta said Sunday the fiscal 2001 Clinton tax cut proposal would be
similar is scope to last year's package.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The reason for that is, as we said over and over again last year, that ...
we've got an important opportunity now to make investments in Social Security,
in Medicare, in modernizing and improving our military, in education, in these
other priorities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But we do think there's room for a tax cut targeted at the middle class,
and we'll be putting forward one.'' While it will be similar to the 1999
package, ``I think we may have some new ideas in that regard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most of the net tax cut that we put forward last year went to increasing
savings, and we're going to continue with a tax relief in that area so that
people can save for their retirement along with extending the solvency of Social
Security. That's an important goal that we have,'' Podesta continued.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I think we may manage to change the package a little bit to invest in
some other important priorities, like expanding health insurance coverage and
investing and making sure that the people at the bottom end of the income scale
get a fair break in the tax code.''
</P>
<P>
	   Podesta declined to give further details or figures, saying he would that
for Clinton to lay out in his State of the Union address in several weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's proposals last year consisted of about three dozen measures
tightly targeted to benefit specific groups, but no broad overall relief. The
various credits totaled $36.2 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, he sought a $1,000 tax credit to defray the costs of caring for
a disabled or chronically ill relative and another $1,000 credit for disabled
workers to offset the extra costs they sometimes face in holding a job.
</P>
<P>
	   A third middle-class credit proposed last year was aimed at encouraging
small employers to provide health insurance for workers.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Heat's new $215 million arena was half-empty late in
the game before the home team gave the crowd something to cheer about.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami overcame a 10-point deficit in the final three minutes of the fourth
quarter and beat the Orlando Magic 111-103 in overtime Sunday night in the first
game at American Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
	   The game drew a sellout crowd of 19,600, but many fans departed before the
wild finish. Miami trailed 93-83 with 2:32 left in the fourth quarter, but
Alonzo Mourning's 8-foot jumper with eight seconds left tied it at 96.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando's Pat Garrity missed a 20-footer as the clock ran out, forcing
overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Mourning hit three free throws in the extra period to put Miami ahead to
stay, and a 3-pointer by Dan Majerle made it 104-98.
</P>
<P>
	   Voshon Lenard led Miami with 24 points. Mourning had just two points at
halftime but finished with 21 despite missing 14 of 18 shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami's Jamal Mashburn, who returned to the lineup after missing five games
because of a sprained ankle, added 22 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Tariq Abdul-Wahad scored 22 points for the Magic, who lost despite a 63-45
advantage in rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The Heat trailed for most of the game and never got closer than seven points
in the fourth quarter until the final two minutes. Rookie Anthony Carter sparked
their comeback with the first 3-pointer of his career, closing the deficit to
95-92 with 1:17 left. Carter had been 0-for-7 previously.
</P>
<P>
	   The Heat won their third game in a row and beat the Magic for the second
time in five days. The Magic lost their fourth consecutive game and slipped to
.500.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando center John Amaechi scored the first basket in the arena -- and the
first of the new century in the NBA. His jersey will be sent to the Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
	   Darrell Armstrong scored seven points to help Orlando outscore Miami 18-2
and go ahead 26-18. Corey Maggette and Michael Doleac made jumpers to beat the
final buzzer at the end of the first and third periods for the Magic.

<P>
    MONTREAL (AP) -- Sylvain Lefebvre scored in the third period Sunday night to
give the New York Rangers a 2-2 tie with the Montreal Canadiens in a match-up of
struggling teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Lefebvre put a shot from the high slot between Jeff Hackett's pads at 10:10
as the Rangers extended their winless streak to six games (0-3-3-1).
</P>
<P>
	   Michael York also scored for New York.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the Rangers' fourth straight overtime game, after gaining ties
against New Jersey and Phoenix and losing in the extra session to Dallas last
week.
</P>
<P>
	   New York has been forced to play overtime in six of eight games and eight of
12. The Rangers set an NHL record with eight overtime games in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Benoit Brunet scored a goal and helped set one up for Sergei Zholtok as the
Canadiens' winless streak stretched to four games (0-1-3).
</P>
<P>
	   Both Original Six clubs wore their dark road jerseys for their first game of
2000, although officials told the Canadiens to switch their blue helmets to
white after the first period to help tell them apart.
</P>
<P>
	   Montreal outshot New York 30-22 before an announced crowd of 20,266.
</P>
<P>
	   York was at the side of the net to bang in Kevin Hatcher's rebound on a
power play 14:22 into the game. York leads NHL rookies with 11 goals.
</P>
<P>
	   Brunet tied it on a power play at 19:13 when he tipped an Eric Weinrich
point shot past Mike Richter from the edge of the crease.
</P>
<P>
	   Montreal was on a two-man advantage when Patrice Brisebois fed a pass to
Zholtok, who stepped in front and put a wrist shot past Richter for his 11th of
the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Brisebois, with two assists, has 10 points in 10 games since returning from
a back injury Dec. 7. Brisebois missed Montreal's last game of 1999, a 3-2 loss
to Ottawa on Dec. 29, while his wife gave birth to their first child, a
daughter.
</P>
<P>
	   Center Radek Dvorak was held scoreless in his first game since he being
acquired by the Rangers from Florida.

U.S. Keeping Eye on Y2K Bug
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of
Trade both opened electronic trading this evening without any reported problems.
Y2K experts, admittedly surprised at computers' seamless transition to 2000,
cautioned nevertheless that countries and organizations that got a late start on
repairs -- even here in the United States -- aren't out of the woods yet. The
biggest uncertainty in the United States focused on hundreds of thousands of
small businesses that planned to reopen tomorrow yet took no precautions to
vaccinate their computers against the Y2K bug.

Pakistan Accused of Hijacking Link
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's top security adviser on Sunday accused
neighbor and nuclear rival Pakistan of having links with the five men who
hijacked an Indian Airlines plane last week, holding 155 people hostage.
Speaking to Star TV, Brajesh Mishra said Indian intelligence intercepted several
radio conversations between militant groups in Kashmir, confirming that Pakistan
was involved. The hostages were freed on Friday after being held for eight days,
but the crisis raised tensions between India and Pakistan, two nuclear-armed
countries that have fought three wars over the past half-century.

Chief of Staff: Clinton Plans Tax Cut
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to call for a tax cut this year
along the lines of the array of tightly targeted proposals rejected by Congress
last year, his chief of staff said today. The Republican-run Congress last year
passed, and Clinton vetoed, a 10-year, $792 billion tax cut. This came after
Congress rejected the president's proposal for a package of cuts totaling about
$36 billion over five years. Podesta said the fiscal 2001 Clinton tax cut
proposal would be similar in scope to last year's package.

	   UNION CITY, Tenn. (AP) -- A man suspected in a three-state killing spree
that started with the death of a 25-year-old Oklahoma woman was arrested today
at a motel in western Tennessee. Steven Ray Thacker, 29, of Chouteau, Okla., was
arrested and charged as a fugitive from justice and with the theft of a vehicle,
Union City Police Chief Joe Garner said. He also is considered the prime suspect
in the late December death of Laci Dawn Hill of Bixby, Okla.; the stabbing death
of Forrest Boyd, 24, of Polk County, Mo., Saturday; and the killing of a tow

<HEADLINE> Jaguars 24, Bengals 7  </HEADLINE>
    By EDDIE PELLS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The players doused Tom Coughlin with water, the
team passed out caps to honor its AFC Central title and almost as quickly, the
celebration was over.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jacksonville Jaguars want to win the Super Bowl this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Their 24-7 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday gave the Jaguars
(14-2) the division championship and home-field advantage through the AFC
playoffs, but it wasn't quite the playoff tune-up they were hoping for.
</P>
<P>
	   Injuries to Pro Bowl tackles Tony Boselli and Leon Searcy, combined with a
lack of killer instinct, let the Bengals (4-12) hang around for much longer than
they should have.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously, you'd like to be so dominant that there's no question about it,"
Coughlin said. "But I thought we played well. I thought we did a lot of good
things."
</P>
<P>
	   Coughlin and the rest of the team seemed most concerned with Boselli, who
was scheduled for an MRI exam on his injured right knee either late Sunday or
Monday. Several players said they thought Boselli had hurt his anterior cruciate
ligament, but nobody was sure of how severe the injury was. Searcy sprained his
ankle.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're talking about two Pro Bowl players and that in itself tells you how
important they are and the type of talent they have," said offensive lineman Ben
Coleman. "We don't know the situation yet. If they can't go, we just have to
rally around each other and make things happen."
</P>
<P>
	   One thing the Jaguars did well was make Jay Fiedler feel comfortable in his
first NFL start. Playing for the injured Mark Brunell, Fiedler completed 28 of
39 passes for 317 yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   "I proved to myself what I knew all along," Fiedler said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jimmy Smith had 14 catches to match Marvin Harrison's NFL high this season.
Smith and Keenan McCardell each surpassed 100 yards receiving for the third time
this year, but even they weren't completely satisfied.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would have helped if we could have performed a little better," Smith
said. "You have to give Cincinnati credit, but we know we can always get
better."
</P>
<P>
	   The Jaguars failed to take advantage of their huge statistical edge because
of their continuing troubles finishing drives inside the opponent's 20. They
made eight trips into scoring position, five of which resulted in three points,
two missed field goals and a boatload of questions.
</P>
<P>
	   On the first failed trip, Coughlin replaced Fred Taylor with James Stewart,
who took the ball for his first carry in three weeks and fumbled into the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
	   The second time, a glitch with the play clock gave the Jaguars a full 70
seconds to run a play on fourth-and-2 from the Bengals 11. They took a
delay-of-game penalty anyway, and Mike Hollis missed a 36-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
	   They got a field goal on the third trip for a 17-7 lead before halftime. The
fourth trip resulted in a missed 28-yard field goal due to a bad snap from
Quentin Neujahr.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to be very active, very sharp and your timing has to be good in
that area," Coughlin said. "That's one area where, if we score with a fumble and
kick two field goals, it's 13 more points at a very early point in the game."
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the game stayed tight. Then Searcy went out with an ankle injury
and Boselli pulled up clutching his knee and had to be helped off the field by
trainers.
</P>
<P>
	   He appeared to be victim of a chewed-up field, the result of the Gator Bowl
game played at Alltel Stadium on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Not until Taylor plowed in for a 1-yard touchdown with 9:19 left did the
Jaguars have a 24-7 lead and a cushion they could feel comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jaguars will have home-field advantage through the playoffs thanks to
the victory and Indianapolis' 31-6 loss to the Buffalo Bills.
</P>
<P>
	   With a bye week, they won't play again until Saturday, Jan. 15, against the
Dolphins, Titans or Bills. Every indication was that they'll need the extra
time.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very important right now," Coughlin said. "We've got locker room full
of reasons."
</P>
<P>
	   Brunell still needs time to heal from the strained knee ligament he suffered
in last week's humbling 41-14 loss to Tennessee. In addition to the tackles, the
Jaguars played long stretches without Tony Brackens (neck), Damon Jones
(Achilles' tendon), Fernando Bryant (hamstring) and Taylor (cramps).
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor finished with 85 yards and two touchdowns. McCardell had nine catches
for 108 yards, including a 25-yard touchdown reception, and Smith had 165 yards
in receptions.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Blake, likely playing his last game for the Bengals, finished with 141
yards passing. Starting for the injured Corey Dillon, Michael Basnight ran for
86 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bengals, who lost an NFL-high 107 games in the 1990s, got the new decade
off to a familiar start.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was frustrating, the whole year was frustrating," said linebacker Takeo
Spikes. "We started the season with the intention of trying to get to the
playoffs. It really hurt seeing the end of the game, with the AFC Central
Division Champion caps being passed out."
</P>
<P>
	   Notes: Carl Pickens, who ripped Bengals management for its decision to
retain coach Bruce Coslet, finished with three catches for 31 yards. Aaron
Beasley had an interception to reach six for the season, breaking the team
record held by Chris Hudson and Deon Figures. ... It was Smith's ninth 100-yard
game of season and 24th of his career. ... Fiedler became Jacksonville's only
300-yard passer besides Brunell.

<TEXT>
<P>
    STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma expected his
top-ranked Huskies to run smack into a learning experience when No. 3 Louisiana
Tech visited.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Louisiana Tech who got schooled.
</P>
<P>
	   UConn (10-O) routed the Lady Techsters 93-60 Sunday night with red-hot
perimeter shooting and fierce defense. Tech (10-2) became the fourth Top 10 team
to lose to the Huskies, who have beaten those ranked opponents by an average of
33 points.
</P>
<P>
	   UConn took an 18-4 lead after six minutes, and Tech never recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   "Basketball has been and always will be a guards' game. And our guards
played great today," Auriemma said.
</P>
<P>
	   Guards Shea Ralph, Sue Bird and Kennitra Johnson combined for 32 points, 16
assists and four steals. But it was the shooting touch of Svetlana Abrosimova
whose perimeter shooting helped the Huskies pull away early. She finished with
25 points and four steals.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wasn't focused on scoring. I just wanted to run our offense and to be
careful because (Tech) is really quick," Abrosimova said. "A lot of times I was
wide open."
</P>
<P>
	   The Lady Techsters were hobbled early by poor shooting, hitting just 13 of
42 shots in the first half. They finished the game going 28-of-82 (34 percent).
</P>
<P>
	   "We have no excuses," Tech coach Leon Barmore said. "UConn was so good, we
would have had to make every shot to win this game. They were totally focused
and prepared."
</P>
<P>
	   He was not happy with his team's shot selection.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not that smart, but a 2-foot shot goes in more often than a 30-footer,"
Barmore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaka Massey hit the opening bucket at 19:28 to give the Lady Techsters
their only lead of the game. Abrosivmoa countered with a 3-pointer on UConn's
next possession, kicking off a 16-0 run.
</P>
<P>
	   UConn was 6-of-9 from 3-point range in the first half. Johnson's second 3 of
the game gave UConn a 37-14 lead, its largest of the half, with 7:58 left. UConn
took a 47-30 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Swin Cash's play on the defensive board gave the Lady Techsters few second
looks. She pulled down six of her team-high eight rebounds in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   "All of our big guys wanted to come out and make a collective effort to make
ourselves a presence in the lane," Cash said. "I think we matched up really well
with them."
</P>
<P>
	   UConn opened the second half with a 14-4 run, fueled by Abrosimova's four
points. Abrosimova also finished with six rebounds. Ralph added 15 points and
had a game-high eight assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Betty Lennox led Tech with 27 points and Tamicha Jackson had 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to get tougher inside and outside," Jackson said. "We have to be a
bit more disciplined."
</P>
<P>
	   The loss kept Barmore at 499 career victories. His .869 winning percentage
coming into the season makes him the winningest active coach -- men's or women's
-- in Division I.
</P>
<P>
	   UConn evened the four-game series against Louisiana Tech. The Lady Techsters
won 90-76 last year in Ruston.

<HEADLINE> Migrants Being Returned to Haiti  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Two days after a boat packed with more than 400 Haitians,
Dominicans and Chinese ran aground about a mile off the Florida coast, the U.S.
Coast Guard began shipping the would-be migrants home, officials said Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Four of the 411 passengers, three of them pregnant women, were brought to
shore for medical reasons and are expected to be returned later, said Mike
Gilhooly, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
	   The others have been kept on Coast Guard cutters off shore and were being
prepared Sunday night for the return to Haiti, where the voyage originated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The decision has been made that all of the migrants now on board the two
Coast Guard cutters will be returned to Haiti in accordance with U.S. law,''
Gilhooly said late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any migrant who expresses fear of persecution will be screened by INS'' on
the return trip, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 411 passengers, 16 are Dominican, two are Chinese and the rest are
Haitian, Coast Guard officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm very disappointed that INS once more has decided to continue its
racist policy vis-a-vis the Haitians and failed once more to give them the right
to a fair and due process,'' said Marleine Bastien, president of Haitian Women
of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The likely repatriation of the passengers prompted a second day of protests
Sunday in front of the Coast Guard station in Miami Beach. About 400 people
chanted slogans and carried signs in an effort to get federal officials to allow
the group into this country.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters want U.S. laws changed to treat Haitians trying to get into
the country more like Cubans, who generally are allowed to remain if they reach
shore. Under a Haiti-U.S. agreement, those without proper documents are
returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph Metelous, 71, of Miami, who arrived from Haiti four years ago, said
anyone who makes the treacherous journey in an attempt to reach the United
States should be allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
	   He talked about 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez -- the Cuban boy found clinging to
a raft after a boat he and his mother were on sank -- and the controversy over
whether he should be sent back to his father in Cuba or be allowed to remain
with relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas also spoke up for the Haitians during
Sunday's rally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Something must be going on in Haiti for these people to risk their lives,
to risk their children's lives and risk the lives of their family members and
seek freedom in the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The migrants were found packed shoulder-to-shoulder on a 60-foot wooden boat
that ran aground early on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   The boat first appeared on the radar of the Coast Guard patrol boat Farallon
shortly before midnight Friday. It was running in the dark at five to seven
knots, and its crews ignored warnings by radio and loudspeaker from the Farallon
that it was headed toward shallow water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were trying to tell them to turn or you'll hit the reef,'' said Coast
Guard Lt. Cmdr. Andy Blomme.
</P>
<P>
	   After the boat ran aground on a sandbar, Coast Guard crews tossed life
jackets on board and tried to explain to the migrants that the wooden ship was
not safe and that, no matter what happened, they would not be allowed to enter
the United States, Blomme said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fearing that any threatening move could provoke the passengers to jump into
the water, the Coast Guard crews waited until dawn to persuade the migrants to
leave the rickety ship.
</P>
<P>
	   The ship apparently had been at sea for at lease five days, and most of the
passengers were weary and dehydrated, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two women -- one five months pregnant and possibly injured by a fall during
the trip, and one who was suffering from a fever and convulsions -- were taken
to a hospital Saturday, Petty Officer Sean Connett said. Both were in good
condition Sunday, a South Shore Hospital spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the Coast Guard rescued or turned back 363 Haitians and 406
Dominicans trying to reach the United States.

<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Marcus Ragnarsson, Jeff Friesen, Marco Sturm and Patrick
Marleau each scored as the San Jose Sharks defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 4-1
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   San Jose goalie Steve Shields stopped 18 Blackhawks shots to earn his 14th
victory. Chicago's Jocelyn Thibault, who faced 38 shots, kept the game close
until late goals by Sturm and Marleau 1:04 apart.
</P>
<P>
	   Ragnarsson tied it 1-1 at 5:37 on a screened drive from the top of the slot.
Ragnarsson's goal, his first in 25 games, came five seconds after an
interference penalty to Chicago's Doug Zmolek expired.
</P>
<P>
	   Friesen had the only goal of the second period, at 8:25, while the teams
skated four-on-four. Sturm made it 3-1 from the left circle with 5:25 left in
the third before Marleau completed the scoring from the edge of the crease.
</P>
<P>
	   Jean-Pierre Dumont scored Chicago's lone goal at 1:22 of the first when he
fired in a rebound from just outside the crease.
</P>
<P>
	   With the victory, San Jose, 3-6-0 in its last nine games, avoided falling
below .500 for the first time this season.

	   TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Too much speed, too much strength. Just too much
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
	   With lightning-quick Eric Crouch at the controls of a relentless option
attack, the third-ranked Cornhuskers beat No. 6 Tennessee 31-21 in the Fiesta
Bowl on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Volunteers rallied from a 17-0 deficit to cut it to 17-14 early in
the second half behind the passing of Tee Martin, the Huskers (12-1) finished
Tennessee off with second-half touchdown drives of 96 and 99 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Cedric Wilson's 44-yard pass touchdown pass to Dante' Stallworth, his second
TD catch of the game, came on a Tennessee trick play that reduced the lead to
31-21 with 7:25 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Vols never got the ball again. Nebraska, which finished the game
with 23 consecutive rushing plays for 156 yards, drove downfield and the
Tennessee (9-3) could do nothing to stop the clock from running out.
</P>
<P>
	   It was all-too-familiar for the Volunteers, who wore down in the second half
two years ago in a 42-17 loss to Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. The Huskers have
won their last 11 bowl matchups against SEC teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Crouch's quickness was the problem the Volunteers' expected, but he did
almost as much damage with his arm.

<P>
	   Crouch's quickness was the problem the Volunteers' expected, but he did
almost as much damage with his arm.
</P>
<P>
	   Crouch was 9-of-15 for 148 yards and a touchdown. Martin, who finished his
career with a 22-3 record as a starter, was 19-of-34 for 223 yards and a
touchdown. He was intercepted twice.
</P>
<P>
	   The Huskers rushed for 321 yards and had 469 yards overall. Dan Alexander
gained 108 yards on 21 carries, Willie Miller added 87 yards on eight carries,
and Crouch had 64 yards on 17 carries.
</P>
<P>
	   Bobby Newcombe, who started the season as Nebraska's quarterback, returned a
punt 60 yards for a touchdown to help his team to its early lead.
</P>
<P>
	   After Tennessee cut the lead to 17-14, Crouch threw a 13-yard touchdown pass
to wide-open tight end Aaron Golliday to boost the lead to 24-14 with 4:44 left
in the third quarter. The pass, Nebraska's first for a touchdown in 19 quarters,
capped a nine-play 96-yard drive that included a 17-yard pass from Crouch to
another tight end, John Bowling, on third-and-13 from the Nebraska 23.
</P>
<P>
	   Golliday and Bowling saw extra duty because Tracey Wistrom, the Huskers'
all-Big-12 tight end, was out with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee pinned the Huskers at their 1 on their next possession, but
Nebraska went 99 yards in 10 plays, overpowering the tiring Vols defense.
Correll Buckhalter ran 27 yards to the Vols 19, then scored on a 2-yard run to
make it 31-14 with 12:01 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cornhuskers, in their NCAA record 31st consecutive bowl game, needed
just four plays to score on their first possession. Crouch went 30 yards on an
option play on third-and-4 to set up Dan Alexander's 7-yard touchdown run on the
next play.
</P>
<P>
	   Nebraska made it 14-0 after the Huskers' defense stopped the Volunteers deep
in their own territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Newcombe, who switched to wingback after two games, took the punt and shot
through a hole on the right side of the field, then won a footrace to the end
zone with 3:21 left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Crouch's 46-yard pass to Matt Davison set up Josh Brown's 31-yard field goal
that put the Huskers up 17-0 with 1:37 left in the first half. The kick hit the
right upright and bounced through.
</P>
<P>
	   The Volunteers finally got their offense in gear just before halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin completed 6-of-7 passes for 66 yards, with the only incompletion an
intentional spike, as Tennessee scored on an 8-play, 65-yard drive that used up
just 1 minute, 19 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to Dante' Stallworth to make it 17-7
with 18 seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander fumbled on the first play of the second half and Tennessee's
Dominique Stevenson recovered at the Nebraska 25. Four plays later, Travis Henry
scored on a 4-yard run to cut the lead to 17-14.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the only turnover of the game for the Cornhuskers, who led NCAA
Division I with 25 fumbles lost.

<HEADLINE> Body Found in Shinn Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MARSHVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- A man found shot to death near the South Carolina
border Sunday appeared to be the estranged husband of the woman who
unsuccessfully sued Charlotte Hornets owner George Shinn.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators preliminarily identified the body as that of Charlotte
podiatrist Jeff Price, Union County Sheriff Frank McGuirt said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "All indications are that it was a suicide," McGuirt said.
</P>
<P>
	   The body, which had a gunshot blast to the head, was located Sunday by
deputies after being spotted overhead by a private pilot participating in the
search for Price, who was last seen alive Tuesday. A .410-gauge shotgun was
found next to the body, McGuirt said.
</P>
<P>
	   The body was taken to Monroe for identification by the county medical
examiner, who also will determine the official cause of death and whether an
autopsy is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   The body was found about 50 feet from the South Carolina line and about half
a mile from where Price's 1994 Camaro was found last week in an isolated area of
Chesterfield County, S.C., McGuirt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Leslie Price, Price's wife, accused Shinn of forcing her to have sex with
him in his Tega Cay, S.C., home in 1997. The couple said the two-year legal
battle, which Leslie Price lost last month, strained their marriage and drained
the family financially.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Price said Sunday that she last spoke to her husband the night before
his disappearance. He did not seem distraught when he called her and told her he
would see her and their 3-year-old daughter Tuesday, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was the best man. He had a big heart and he loved his family," she said.
"Everything just got to be too much for him."
</P>
<P>
	   Price's relatives said he had been despondent over business and marital
struggles before he was last seen Tuesday at his parents' home in Monroe.
</P>
<P>
	   A broadcast report quoting the Chesterfield County sheriff late last week
said that Price bought a gun Tuesday morning and that officers found a box of
ammunition in the car with three shells missing, but not the gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Family members on Wednesday found some notes in his room expressing sadness
about circumstances of his life.
</P>
<P>
	   Price quit his podiatry practice in October because federal investigators
had stopped Medicare reimbursements. He performed podiatry services for
residents at dozens of nursing homes, then billed federal Medicaid and Medicare
programs for payment.
</P>
<P>
	   Price recently surrendered his license for prescribing controlled
substances. As part of the dispute with Shinn, Leslie Price admitted illegally
using her husband's credentials to obtain drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Price recently took a job selling cars at a Charlotte dealership, but quit.

<HEADLINE> Neb. Freshmen Crucial in Fiesta Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG ALDEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Aaron Golliday and Jon Bowling, two redshirt freshmen
who combined for five catches for Nebraska in the regular season, were able to
offset the loss of all-Big 12 tight end Tracey Wistrom in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   They gave Cornhuskers quarterback Eric Crouch a much-needed target as he
passed for 148 yards in the 31-21 win over Tennessee on Sunday night, including
two key catches during a 96-yard scoring drive that shut down the Volunteers'
momentum.
</P>
<P>
	   The sixth-ranked Volunteers (9-3) scored two straight touchdowns to cut
Nebraska's lead to 17-14 and had the Huskers facing a third-and-13 at their own
23-yard line. Crouch found Bowling alone near the sideline for a 17-yard gain
and a first down.
</P>
<P>
	   Third-ranked Nebraska (12-1) got a 47-yard run from fullback Willie Miller
then Golliday caught a 13-yard pass from Crouch to put the Huskers up 24-14 with
4:44 left in the third. Golliday's catch capped a 9-play, 96-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
	   Nebraska, which added a 99-yard touchdown drive on its next possession,
didn't throw another pass in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Wistrom, who was third on the Huskers with 16 catches, has been out since
Nov. 29, after partially tearing a knee ligament during practice.
</P>
<P>
	   Golliday caught two passes for 45 yards, giving him five catches for the
season.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowling, who didn't have a catch this season until making two while playing
for Wistrom in the Big 12 championship against Texas on Dec. 4, had two catches
for 25 yards. He caught a 28-yard pass from Crouch in the first quarter.
Nebraska didn't score on that drive, but pinned Tennessee at the 5-yard line.
The Volunteers went three-and-out and Nebraska's Bobby Newcombe returned the
punt 60 yards for a touchdown, giving the Huskers a 14-0 lead.

U.S. Watching Y2K Bug
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of
Trade both opened electronic trading Sunday without any reported Y2K glitches.
Computers' easy transition into 2000 surprised many experts who also cautioned
that countries and organizations that got a late start on repairs aren't out of
the woods yet. The biggest uncertainty in the United States focused on hundreds
of thousands of small businesses that planned to reopen tomorrow yet took no
precautions to vaccinate their computers against the Y2K bug.

Chief of Staff: Clinton Plans Tax Cut
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to call for a tax cut this year
along the lines of the array of tightly targeted proposals rejected by Congress
last year, his chief of staff said Sunday. The Republican-run Congress last year
passed, and Clinton vetoed, a 10-year, $792 billion tax cut. This came after
Congress rejected the president's proposal for a package of cuts totaling about
$36 billion over five years. Podesta said the fiscal 2001 Clinton tax cut
proposal would be similar in scope to last year's package.

known early in his career for modernizing the Navy and later for ordering the
