STALKING A DANGEROUS NEWS STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - Bernard Adelmo Ortiz sat before a bouquet of TV
microphones that had been placed at the table spe cially for him.
He smiled. This was his moment, his dream come true.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the woman Ortiz has stalked for years and is ac cused of
stalking again _ singer Linda Ronstadt _ it must have been a
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Ortiz was sentenced to three years' pro bation
after he pleaded guilty to attempted stalking of Ron stadt. Within
weeks, he vio lated the deal and was sentenced to 10 months in
prison. At the time, he wrote a letter to the judge saying, ``Linda
Ronstadt has touched my heart, soothes my soul and occupied part of
my mind for 20-and-some years.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, May 7, he was in a Maricopa County jail, staring at
the unblinking TV cameras as if they were the eyes of Linda
herself. Channel 10 was there. And Channel 15. And Channel 3.
Earlier, he'd spo ken to Channel 5.
</P>
<P>
   He no longer wore the white tuxedo he'd been ar rested in
outside the Sun dome. He no longer carried the blood red rose he'd
hoped to give to Ronstadt.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was content.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, May 6, the singer was making a guest appear ance on
Garrison Keillor's A Prairie Home Companion ra dio show being taped
in Sun City. Sheriff's deputies spot ted Ortiz in a 1978 white
Cadillac that he'd filled with boxes and flowers and copies of
letters to Ronstadt.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz admits to his obses sion. He says he wants noth ing more
than to reach Ronstadt. And here were Phoenix's major television
outlets, helping him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand where your coming from,'' Channel 3's news
director, Phil Alvidrez, told me Monday. ``Should we be putting
such people on TV? It's certainly a point worth debating.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not.
</P>
<P>
   The answer should be obvi ous, particularly for people who work
in television.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, a stalker was sentenced to prison for harassing
local newscaster Deborah Pyburn Brewer. Her attorney was Larry
Debus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a station in Phoenix that has a newscast that has
not had one of their woman harassed in some way,'' Debus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who's been through this knows all the stalker wants is
the attention of the person they're stalking. They want to be seen.
They have these demented delu sions. By putting them on TV they
play right into their hands. It's bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday is a slow news day. Stories brushed off during the week
can lead a weekend newscast. The Republic con sidered covering
Ortiz's news conference but decided against it. So did Channel 12,
the only local TV news opera tion with the sense to ignore the sad,
nauseating show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see any news value in it,'' News Director Mark Casey
said. ``And I felt bad for Linda Ronstadt.''
</P>
<P>
   Channel 3's Alvidrez, who said he wasn't involved in airing
Ortiz's interview, said, ``Gauged against the Suns having lost
earlier in the afternoon and the other events that happened over
the weekend, that was proba bly one of the more interest ing things
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same conclusion reached by most other TV news directors
in town. By people who've never been on camera. By people who've
never had someone like Ber nard Adelmo Ortiz try to bring them a
blood red rose. &QL;

 &HT;    JEFF SHAARA PICKS UP FATHER'S PEN (a) 
 &HT;    (Duplication warning: MOVING IN ``E'' and ``L'' categories) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, no matter where you hide, destiny finds you.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Jeff Shaara, who was a rare-coin dealer when his father
died in 1988. Though his dad had written a Pulitzer Prize-winning
book on the Civil War ((beginitalic)The Killer Angels(enditalic)),
Jeff had never shown any interest in writing.
</P>
<P>
   That would soon change.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Michael Shaara's death, the popularity of
historical fiction was surging, fueled by Ken Burns' sweeping
documentary (beginitalic)The Civil War(enditalic)(beginitalic).
(enditalic)In 1993, (beginitalic)The Killer Angels (enditalic)was
made into the Turner film (beginitalic)Gettysburg(enditalic), and
the movie's director suggested that Jeff find someone to write a
sequel and a prequel.
</P>
<P>
   He found someone all right - himself. Two bestsellers later,
Jeff Shaara is still surprised at his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people asked me, how did I get the courage to sit
down and write,'' said Shaara, who will be in Phoenix on May 17 to
promote his new novel, (beginitalic)Gone For Soldiers(enditalic).
``It really didn't take courage, because I had no expectations
{hellip} that any publisher would take this.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaara knows he'll be known as the son of Michael Shaara, whose
book was recognized as a masterpiece when it was published in 1974
but never enjoyed commercial success. Jeff said his first two
books, (beginitalic)Gods and Generals (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)The Last Full Measure, (enditalic)both of which are
headed to the big screen, were simply the continuation of his
father's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was writing (beginitalic)Gods and Generals (enditalic)I
showed the manuscript to my sister, and she said, `This is being
written by the ghost of Michael Shaara,''' Jeff said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's proud when people compare his style to his father's
but that he never set out to imitate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that works,'' Shaara said. ``Then it becomes all
style and no substance. {hellip} The voice has to come from
somewhere else. I think, certainly, I've been influenced by my
father's style, there's no doubt about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it a great compliment when somebody tells me they
see similarities in my style and my father's.''
</P>
<P>
   To produce the Shaara brand of historical fiction, both Jeff and
his dad put the reader into the minds of historical figures,
re-creating conversations during key meetings and battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're hearing their thoughts and hearing their words,''
Shaara said. ``By definition, that's fiction. There was nobody
walking around behind these guys with a pad and paper writing down
everything they said.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some have criticized the re-creation technique, Jeff said
all the work is based on months of research. Shaara pored over
memoirs and eyewitness accounts to re-create history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those meetings are real. {hellip} Any of the commanders in the
book could have said any of the words that I'm putting in their
mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   In what many see as a break with his father, Shaara's new book
is not about the Civil War. Instead, he chose the Mexican-American
War, in which future Civil War commanders like Ulysses S. Grant,
Robert E. Lee and Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson first learned the
art of combat. At that time, the two future Confederate generals
were fighting in the same uniform as Grant under the same Union
flag.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, (beginitalic)Gone for Soldiers
(enditalic)(named for a verse in the Pete Seeger song
(beginitalic)Where Have All the Flowers Gone?(enditalic)) is the
story of two opposing generals, War of 1812 hero Winfield Scott of
the United States and Mexico's Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana.
</P>
<P>
   To get inside their heads, Shaara found Scott's unpublished
memoirs at West Point and consulted Santa Ana's memoirs, which were
recently translated into English.
</P>
<P>
   Shaara said the Mexican-American War (1846-48) often is
overlooked. Though it allowed the United States to acquire most of
what is now Arizona, New Mexico and California, its short duration
and proximity to the Civil War make it a footnote in most history
books.
</P>
<P>
   There are also strong parallels with Vietnam, Shaara notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was seen as a bully's war, (that) basically we were going
down there to grab land,'' Shaara said. ``The themes are similar.
You have this big muscular country going down and beating on these
little guys. You had a lot of that in Vietnam. There was also the
sense that the soldiers were unappreciated back home.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
LOS ANGELES _ In some alternate universe, another reality, there
exists an NBA where the Orlando Magic is in the process of
defending another in a dynastic string of championships.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In that world, Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway are the next
generation's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson, the duo who led
the Los Angeles Lakers to league supremacy during the salad days of
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs? They were dismantled long ago, just after David
Robinson signed a free-agent deal with the Lakers in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets? They won their title in 1994, but they were rolled
by Orlando the next season, with the Magic winning the championship
in five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls? Michael Jordan returned to Chicago, but in 1996, his
first full season back, the Bulls were beaten by the Magic in the
Eastern Conference finals, and Jordan called it quits for the last
time.
</P>
<P>
   A dynasty had been born in Orlando, and it would carry the NBA
into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the way it could have been. Or the way it was
supposed to be. In this reality, though, the Orlando Magic is now a
collection of discards _ the discount bin in the NBA's bargain
basement.
</P>
<P>
   But back in the early '90s, no one could ever have imagined such
a fate for the organization that was considered the model for all
expansion franchises to follow _ one that made the NBA Finals in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   But it was there, at what was supposed to be the height of
glory, that the doomsday clock began ticking on the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a mere five years later, the pieces of the league's ``next
dynasty'' have been flung to the far corners of the NBA world.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd twist, O'Neal, the biggest free-agent prize of the
decade who signed with the Lakers in 1996, and Hardaway, who exited
the Magic kingdom last season for Phoenix, are now meeting in the
Western Conference semifinals. With O'Neal scoring 37 points and
pulling down 14 rebounds, the Lakers crushed the Suns 105-77 in
Game 1 to take a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven series that
continues here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And every time he sees O'Neal throw down one of his
Richter-scale dunks, Hardaway has flashes of what could have been
for the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see him (O'Neal) play now, and I remember all the good
times we had together, it's unbelievable,'' Hardaway said. ``I took
everything for granted back then, and now I wish I had it all back.
We just knew if we stayed together we'd be back in the Finals
another eight or 10 times before we retired. And then he left, and
that's when everything went downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   Many think NBA history would have changed had Nick Anderson made
just one of the four free throws he had in the closing seconds of
Game 1 of the 1995 Finals. Instead, Anderson clanked all four, and
Kenny Smith hit a last-gasp 3-pointer to send the game into
overtime. The Rockets won 120-118 on Hakeem Olajuwon's tip-in at
the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The demoralized Magic lost the next game at home 117-106 and
then trudged to Houston, where they lost the next two, giving the
Rockets a sweep and their second straight championship.
</P>
<P>
   One year later O'Neal was gne, seeking championships with Los
Angeles, where many of the great centers _ George Mikan, Wilt
Chamberlain and Abdul-Jabbar _ played and won.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I had regrets, but I was young enough at that point,
I said to myself, `I can start all over,''' said O'Neal of his
departure. ``If I had been 29 or 30, I probably wouldn't have made
that move. That was an excellent team. The only bad thing about
professional basketball is the business side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all mini-conglomerates. And (Lakers vice president)
Jerry West gave me a better deal than the other people did. I took
advantage of that deal because I'll probably never get another deal
like that again in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway's downfall in Orlando began soon after O'Neal left
following the 1995-96 season. With O'Neal alongside him, he looked
like one of the best guards in the league. Without O'Neal, he
struggled under the pressure of trying to keep the team near the
top.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just too much pressure on me after that,'' Hardaway
said. ``It wore me down. (Coach Chuck) Daly didn't like me. The
fans were fed up with me because I wasn't scoring 25 points a
night. I felt like I was in a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a departure from how things started.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando seemed blessed, getting O'Neal with the top pick in the
1992 draft and then landing the No. 1 pick the next year as well.
Orlando took Chris Webber but dealt his rights to Golden State for
the rights to Hardaway, whom the Warriors had taken with the third
pick.

<P>
   ``That was a situation that seemed to be made in heaven,'' said
Lakers coach Phil Jackson, then with the Bulls. ``It seemed like
Orlando got all the breaks in the draft there for a couple of years
and put some pieces together. It was wonderful for them. It's
surprising how fast things can fall apart, but it was obviously a
situation where they didn't win a championship series that was
sitting there for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built our (Chicago) team around the fact that Orlando was
the team that was going to be dominant for a while, especially
after they raided Horace Grant from our team (prior to the 1994-95
season). It's funny how things changed so quickly, but it happened
to them, and it was kind of a forewarning of what was going to come
in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, more to the point, what was going to go _ which was almost
everyone on that Magic roster.
</P>
<P>
   Grant is now in Seattle. Anderson, the Magic's first draft pick
in 1989, was dealt to Sacramento in 1999. Dennis Scott, who earned
the nickname ``3-D'' because of his 3-point shooting, became a
vagabond, going to Dallas, Phoenix, Minnesota and New York before
ending up in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   To the Lakers' Brian Shaw, another member of that 1995 Orlando
team, the erosion of the Magic is a reminder of how fragile things
can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a delicate balance,'' Shaw said. ``You can't
take anything for granted. We thought that even though we didn't
win it that year with the team that we had, we'd get back again and
again and again, but it never happened. Look at them now. Darrell
Armstrong is the only player left from that team.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what could have been, O'Neal just smiled. But the
smile soon faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a nice team,'' he said. ``We could have been something,
maybe. It happens. Called life.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruth D. Turner, a Harvard professor, author, curator and diver
who became one of the world's leading experts in the species of
mollusks that devour wooden piers and sunken ships, died on April
30 at a nursing home in Waltham, Mass. She was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Turner added volumes to the understanding of the creatures known
as teredos, commonly called shipworms because of their resemblance
to worms but actually a species of mollusk related to clams.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes called ``the mollusk with the million-dollar
appetite,'' teredos were mentioned in Greek literature dating to
350 B.C. and were dreaded by early ocean explorers, including
Columbus who lost all his vessels to the worms on his fourth voyage
to the Americas. They have also been blamed for the deterioration
of the Hudson River piers in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Turner even hypothesized that the pests caused the hole in the
wooden dike that the Little Dutch Boy plugged with his finger. ``It
may be the little Dutch boy put in more than his thumb,'' she said.
``He probably put his whole arm in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, who was affectionately called Lady Wormwood, wrote more
than 100 publications, almost all on shipworms, covering everything
from their means of reproduction to how they bore into wood and how
they dispersed over wide distances. Her study of the worms took her
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Robert D. Ballard, who discovered the sunken liner
Titanic in 1985, she identified mollusks as the reason so little
wood remained in the wreck. She investigated dozens of other
shipwrecks and appeared on National Geographic television specials
to discuss deep-sea vent systems, the warm-water ecosystems caused
by volcanic activity. She was named to the Women Divers Hall of
Fame, sponsored by several organizations including the Women's
Scuba Association and the Underwater Society of America.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, she was the first woman in the Alvin, the deep-sea
submersible owned and operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution on Cape Cod. She was comfortable in the male-dominated
society of ocean research, often enjoying poker with her male
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Her passion was mentoring researchers in the manner in which
William J. Clench, her predecessor as mollusk curator at the Museum
of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, had inspired her. She
was always ready to provide free room and board at her Cambridge
home to a needy student.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do what sets you on fire,'' Turner urged her students. ``If
you do what you love, you'll succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Dixon Turner was born on Dec. 7, 1914, in Melrose, Mass.
Her father was cabinet maker; her mother was a dressmaker. She had
seven brothers and sisters. Two sisters, Winifred Garrity of
Sudbury, Mass., and Lina MacNeil of Wayland, Mass., survive her.
</P>
<P>
   She worked her way through Bridgewater State Teacher's College,
then took a job in a one-room schoolhouse in Vermont, the first of
several teaching posts in New England. She worked for a short
period at the New England Museum of Natural History, now the Boston
Museum of Science.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, she earned a master's degree in ornithology from
Cornell University. She then taught at Vassar and worked as a
biologist at the Clapp Laboratory in Duxbury, Mass. Her next stop
was Harvard, where she worked as a research assistant as she earned
a doctorate in biology from Radcliffe in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   She remained at Harvard as a research assistant and biology
lecturer. When Clench invited her to lunch, she quickly became
intrigued by mollusks. ``Things were not going well in the bird
department,'' she later explained.
</P>
<P>
   From 1963 to 1975, she was the Alexander Agassiz Fellow at the
zoology museum. Since 1976, she has been a professor of biology.
She also served as co-editor of the scientific journal Johnsonia.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny woman with a strong jaw and equally strong opinions, she
brought an easy grace to scientific expeditions, teaching others
how to tie seaman's knots and sometimes cutting hair. She scuba
dived until she was well into her 70s and went on her last
expedition just two years ago. She never married.
</P>
<P>
   The love of her life were the students she helped to understand
science. She said this devotion came from a promise she had made to
Clench.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I asked Bill how I could return the kindness he'd given
me, he said, `You can't,''' she said. `` `Just do it for the next
generation.'''

EDITORIAL: PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, May 9:
</P>
<P>
   Presidential authority in Russia passed from Boris Yeltsin to
Vladimir Putin last New Year's Eve when Yeltsin resigned, but the
symbolism of Putin's inauguration on Sunday was still lustrous. It
completed the first transfer of power from one freely elected
leader to another in more than 1,000 years of Russian history.
After the ceremony, the energetic new president and his aging
predecessor stepped into the bright sunshine of Cathedral Square,
the very place where generations of czars appeared after being
crowned in the Cathedral of the Assumption. Little more than a
decade ago, the idea of a democratically chosen president occupying
that ground would have seemed unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   As Russians wait for Putin to make his intentions clear, they
should rejoice in the freedoms that have developed since Mikhail
Gorbachev first loosened the straitjacket of Communism and Yeltsin
set Russia on a course toward democracy and free markets. For all
the severe economic and political dislocations of the last 15
years, Russians today enjoy liberties, including open presidential
elections and a largely free press, that their ancestors never
attained. Any accounting of the period since the end of the Cold
War must begin with the recognition of this singular transformation
_ something that Americans should bear in mind in a campaign year
when there is likely to be a boisterous debate about how to handle
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Putin now has the chance to consolidate democracy in his
country. Working with the moderate Parliament that Russians elected
in December, he has an opportunity to stabilize the economy, to
reform a dysfunctional tax code, to crack down on crime and to
build a steady relationship with the United States and other
Western nations. After the stifling decades of Communism and the
erratic years of Yeltsin's rule, Russians yearn for a period of
sustained tranquillity and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who spent most of his career working for the KGB and its
successor security organization, may be tempted to exercise the
near-dictatorial powers that come with the Russian presidency.
Russia needs constant, effective leadership, not a modern variation
of authoritarian command. Putin's promise to rebuild a strong
central government should not become an excuse for drawing all
power back into the hands of the state.
</P>
<P>
   His initial moves reveal little about his governing strategy.
Putin's choice for prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, suggests a
desire to press ahead with economic reform and to reduce the
corruption that distorts Russian commerce. Kasyanov, 42, is a
financial expert with reformist instincts, but most of his work has
involved dealing with the West to reschedule Moscow's debts, not
wrestling with the deformities of the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's regard for police and military power is troubling. His
leap from political obscurity to the presidency was accomplished
primarily by directing a brutish military offensive against Chechen
guerrillas and civilians. If he applies the same approach to other
restless nationalities or uses excessive force in combating crime,
he will undermine democracy.
</P>
<P>
   As for foreign policy, Putin seems to want a wary friendship
with Washington and its allies, in part to attract Western loans
and investment. He has encouraged a new round of arms reductions
talks with the United States and reactivated Moscow's relations
with NATO, which were curtailed during the war in Kosovo. But Putin
has made clear he will plot an independent course designed to
maintain Russia's role as a great power. The Kremlin is now his to
command. What he does will help determine whether Russia is able to
escape its grim history. &QL;

BREAKTHROUGH ON CHROMOSOME 21, LINKED TO DOWN SYNDROME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Editors: fixes number of chromosomes in 4th graph) 
 
By TODD ACKERMAN 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) In the latest advance in the Human Genome Project,
scientists have unlocked the genetic code of chromosome 21, the
chromosome associated with Down syndrome and other serious
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough, which involved predicting the identity and
location of the chromosome's genes, is expected to eventually lead
to treatment for Down syndrome, in which affected children are born
with three copies of the chromosome instead of the usual two.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us the necessary information from which to sort out
what's going on in biological diseases involving chromosome 21,''
said Katheleen Gardiner, a researcher at the Eleanor Roosevelt
Institute in Denver. ``Once we know what the genes do in their
normal function, we should be able to develop drugs to ameliorate
problems in people with Down's or other disorders.''
</P>
<P>
   Chromosome 21 is the second fully deciphered chromosome _ 22 was
mapped last fall _ in the government-sponsored, international
effort to decode all 46 chromosomes, which constitute the blueprint
of human life. The effort is expected to one day lead to cures for
inherited diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the international consortium behind the project,
which includes Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said Monday
they're 85 percent finished and on schedule to complete a rough
draft in June. They said the last remaining DNA will flow into
public databases in the next six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gardiner, one of two Americans who joined with German and
Japanese scientists on the Chromosome 21 sequencing assignment,
said if researchers get lucky in understanding how the genes
operate, treatment for Down syndrome could be developed within
years; if not, it is more likely to be at least a decade. She said
Down syndrome currently is too complex a disorder to think in terms
of a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Down syndrome, diseases linked to chromosome 21 include
Alzheimer's, epilepsy, Lou Gehrig's disease (amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis), manic depression and a certain kind of leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Chromosome 21 is the smallest of the 23 pairs of human
chromosomes. In a paper that will appear in Thursday's edition of
the journal Nature, the team researchers estimated that it has 225
genes, far less than the 545 on chromosome 22 and that up to a
third of it contains no genes.
</P>
<P>
   But the 225 genes are located in a complex tangle that will make
unraveling their functions challenging, Gardiner said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the key will be how quickly researchers find and learn
the function of the most important genes. It is unclear, for
example, whether a handful of genes underlies the disorders or
whether the general imbalance from the genes in the extra
chromosome causes the problem. But the decoding of chromosome 21 at
least establishes a catalog of the relevant genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us a toolbox where we have what we need to explore
gene function,'' said Gardiner. ``Once we have that knowledge, we
should be able to modulate gene activity, to adjust it to the
correct level.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardiner also said that the chromosome mapping may shed light on
why people with Down syndrome have a very low rate of breast, lung
and gastrointestinal cancers. She said scientists suspect that an
extra copy of chromosome 21 has tumor-suppressing qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Down syndrome, the most common form of genetically caused mental
retardation, occurs in about one in 700 live births. It can also
cause congenital heart disease and Alzheimer's by age 40.
</P>
<P>
   Because scientists had originally expected chromosomes 21 and 22
to have more genes, the small number they found has led them to
lower the estimated total number of human genes to 40,000 from the
70,000 to 100,000 figure that has historically been believed.
Scientists said that may mean humans are not that different from
the fruit fly, which was fully deciphered in March. It was
estimated to have 13,600 genes.
</P>
<P>
   But a California bioinformatics company called DoubleTwist said
Monday it has downloaded the Human Genome Project's existing data
and, with its own software, already identified about 105,000
probable human genes.
</P>
<P>
   Team researchers said the map of chromosome 21 is 99.7 percent
complete. Technical limitations prevented a complete mapping.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium is in a race with a private rival, Celera Corp.
of Rockville, Md., which is rumored to be about to announce that
it's decoded all the chromosomes. The directors of the consortium's
leading centers said Monday they've decoded 16 million units of DNA
and are now moving into the final phase _ filling in the remaining
gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've finished most of the hard part,'' said Richard Gibbs,
director of Baylor's Human Genome Sequencing Center. ``What we've
done is not perfect, but we're like a steaming juggernaut now.''

 LOCKYER SEES NO END TO HIGH GAS PRICES IN CALIFORNIA  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Californians will continue to see price spikes and
consistently high gasoline prices unless the Legislature or
governor act, Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a 70-page report that wrapped up his yearlong investigation
into the state's soaring gasoline prices, Lockyer concluded that
while there are many factors causing the spike, there are few
immediate solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Last year when he created the task force, Lockyer promised to
take legal action if evidence of price gouging came to light, but
Monday he said that there is still no hard evidence to support
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to tilt at windmills unless it looks like there's
a serious chance to prevail,'' Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, California gas prices spiked to nearly 50 cents a
gallon over the national average, and have remained about 20 cents
a gallon or more over the rest of the nation for more than a year,
the task force found.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer said lack of competition is the primary contributor to
the high prices, and that the situation will continue to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 10 years, we will be consuming 2 billion more gallons of
gasoline a year than we currently consume,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we figure out a smart way to both increase the supply
of gas and enhance competition, then the overpricing and the price
spikes that outraged consumers are going to be a regular market
phenomenon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer also blasted oil companies for continuing to increase
their profits during times of short supply. Profit margins rose
from an average of 25 cents to 66 cents in March, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But representatives of the oil industry dispute the notion that
high profit margins are what cause high gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``California refiners make no higher a profit than other
others,'' said Anita Mangels, a spokeswoman for the Western States
Petroleum Association, a group that represents oil companies.
``Right now, the global economy is having a heavy impact
nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, oil company profits have soared during the past year
as oil prices climbed to more than $34 a barrel, the highest level
since 1990. Oil prices rose as OPEC nations curbed the amount of
crude they put on the market.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, profits at Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest
publicly traded oil company, doubled during the first three months
of this year when compared with the same quarter a year ago. No. 2
Chevron's earnings rose fourfold.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the increase in oil company profits, however, came from
selling crude oil that the companies pumped out of the ground.
Profits from the sale of gasoline have generally not risen as
quickly because oil companies have not had time to fully pass on
the higher oil costs to their gasoline customers.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer is sponsoring several bills with solutions he believes
will help increase the supply of gasoline in California _ and
thereby reduce prices _ but the legislation is facing tough
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   One bill, which would create a strategic oil reserve, has been
held up in the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee for the
past several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the committee, Assemblyman Rob Wright, D-Los
Angeles, said he does not see that there is a major problem with
gas prices _ and that the emphasis should be just as much on
decreasing demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's too high?'' he said Monday. ``There is no evidence that
the oil companies are price gouging. California has the highest per
capita usage of fuel anywhere in world. There's not that much the
state can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Other pending legislation would study the feasibility of
creating a pipeline to bring gasoline into the state and require
state purchasers to go outside the state to acquire gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has been noticeably silent on the issue, but his
spokesman said he has talked to oil companies and officials in
Washington, D.C., about some of the international causes of rises
in gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a variety of factors that cause the prices,'' said
Davis' spokesman Michael Bustamante. ``The governor has been in
office a little over a year, and in resonably short order has had
those conversations. They should have the opportunity to do the
right thing. Otherwise we may have to take a look at options.''
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante said Davis has not taken a position on the bills
Lockyer is sponsoring. Last year, the governor vetoed $1 million
requested by Lockyer to more thoroughly investigate the gas prices
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the solutions are legislative, Lockyer did say he
is still considering pursuing a civil action accusing oil companies
of excessive profit taking.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that while he personally believes the oil companies
have been ripping off consumers, he is not sure there is enough
evidence to convince a jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to take it on unless there is a serious chance
that we will prevail,'' said Lockyer, adding that without a budget
supplement some other program would have to be cut to pursue the
case.
</P>
<P>
   If a jury did find oil companies guilty of taking excessive
profit, they would probably order a disgorgement of the money
through refunds or dramatically reduced prices, Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But oil companies argue that a wide variety of factors
contribute to California's spiking prices, including high taxes and
a special formula of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is essentially an island of petroleum,'' industry
spokeswoman Mangels said. ``We have the cleanest gasoline in the
world, and it costs more.''  &LR;

 ANALYSIS: CHRONICLE TRIAL, AT ROOT, ABOUT ANTITRUST LAW  &HT;     By REYNOLDS HOLDING 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With juicy revelations emerging almost daily
from the trial of Clint Reilly's antitrust case against The
Chronicle sale, it's easy to forget that the battle in Judge Vaughn
Walker's courtroom concerns the law rather than just politics and
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago Monday, the Examiner publisher admitted a willingness
to ``horse trade'' editorial-page coverage for the mayor's support.
On Tuesday, The Chronicle CEO joked about being ``a perjurer.'' On
Friday, a Hearst Corp. executive testified about receiving
``intelligence'' from The Chronicle's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   What does any of this have to do with antitrust law?
</P>
<P>
   It may sound like mudslinging, but the evidence introduced so
far outlines Reilly's plans for showing that Hearst's purchase of
The Chronicle _ and giveaway of the Examiner to the Fang family _
will create an illegal newspaper monopoly in the city.
</P>
<P>
   How Walker will eventually rule is anyone's guess. The judge
could do anything from dismiss Reilly's suit to permanently block
Hearst from buying The Chronicle, at least as the deal is now
structured. Whether Hearst would then get the opportunity to
restructure the deal would depend on the basis for Walker's
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Reilly contends the Examiner is a viable newspaper
that Hearst is scheming to kill so the New York media conglomerate
can own and operate The Chronicle unfettered by competition in San
Francisco. He says the Fang deal _ which includes a $66 million
subsidy from Hearst over three years _ is designed to insure
 &LR; ensure the Examiner's demise.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, meanwhile, argues that the Examiner is a failing
business whose absence cannot possibly harm media competition in
the Bay Area, the relevant market for antitrust purposes. In any
case, Hearst officials say, the Examiner's best shot at survival is
the deal with the Fangs, publishers of the free, thrice-weekly
Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Examiner Publisher Tim White's testimony about his discussions
with Mayor Willie Brown offended journalists and may have cost
White his job, but Reilly's attorney, Joseph M. Alioto, said it
goes straight to the heart of his client's case.
</P>
<P>
   Walker apparently agrees.
</P>
<P>
   When a Hearst attorney objected that White's testimony was
irrelevant, Walker told him that it ``does have a bearing on the
issues in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   In Alioto's view, the testimony essentially shows that Hearst's
purchase of The Chronicle was rigged. Alioto contends the U.S.
Department of Justice approved the deal because of political
pressure from Brown and other public figures lobbied by Hearst _
rather than because the deal made sense under antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   But White's testimony has other implications. Antitrust laws are
designed to protect consumer choice as well as price competition.
If consumers are left with one newspaper _ and that newspaper is
willing to trade editorial coverage for political favors _ one
argument would be that they have suffered clear harm by not having
a second and perhaps more objective newspaper to read.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher's statements also undermine Hearst's credibility
with the judge. Hearst officials claim that The Chronicle _ with a
fourfold advantage in circulation _ subsidizes the failing Examiner
under the two papers' joint operating agreement, which allows them
to combine printing and other business operations while maintaining
editorial independence. The papers also share profits equally under
the JOA.
</P>
<P>
   But Alioto says there is no hard evidence that The Chronicle
subsidizes the Examiner, meaning the judge must essentially trust
Hearst, which may be difficult if Hearst executives were trying to
cut clandestine deals with the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece of controversial testimony also casts doubt on the
claim that the Examiner cannot survive without the JOA.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Alioto forced Chronicle Publishing Company CEO John
Sias to admit that his sworn affidavit saying the JOA requires The
Chronicle to subsidize the Examiner was untrue.
</P>
<P>
   When Alioto insisted that Sias didn't know how much the Examiner
would make operating alone, Sias said he didn't know how to answer,
having ``just been exposed as a perjurer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sias was joking, but as with White's testimony, the implication
is potentially serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearst's defense is, `Trust us, judge, The Chronicle is
subsidizing the Examiner,' '' said attorney Jesse Markham, an
antitrust expert in San Francisco. ``That doesn't work very well
when they (Hearst's and the Chronicle's witnesses) are having a
tough time on the stand.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, another Hearst executive, chief legal officer James
Asher, testified that Hearst received a tip that the company should
make an early offer for The Chronicle before its owners could
change their minds or other purchasers could get involved.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony elicited by Alioto seems to support his argument
that Hearst pre-empted the sale process, an allegedly
anti-competitive act that prevented The Chronicle from being sold
at a market price.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto buttressed this testimony with his earlier
cross-examination of a financial adviser to The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The adviser testified that she had warned The Chronicle's owners
early in the sale process that someone was leaking information to
Hearst. She also confirmed that Hearst offered $565 million for the
paper before any bids had been solicited.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she confirmed that, although three of the nation's
largest newspapers wanted to buy The Chronicle, none was willing to
offer anything close to Hearst's winning $660-million bid. The
reason, says Alioto, is that Hearst's first-right-of-refusal and
other advantages under the JOA made competitive bids virtually
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Barnett, a professor and antitrust expert at Boalt Hall
law school, says this evidence supports Reilly's effort to stop The
Chronicle's sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the problem is,'' Barnett says, ``that if you let everyone
bid next time ... Hearst is likely to be the high bidder,
presenting all over again the question of what to do with the
Examiner.''
</P>
<P>
   How persuasive all this testimony turns out to be is unclear,
because Hearst and The Chronicle have not yet put on their
defenses. Each company is expected to undermine Reilly's contention
that The Chronicle can become a monopoly amid intense competition
from daily and weekly newspapers, national newspapers, radio and
television stations and Web sites in the Bay Area.

EDITORIAL: NEW YORK'S MESSAGE ON CLEAN AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, May 9:
</P>
<P>
   Both houses of the New York state Legislature have approved an
innovative measure aimed at reducing the amount of sulfur dioxide,
the chief cause of acid rain, that drifts into New York from
coal-burning power plants in Midwestern and Southern states. By
itself, the measure may not do much to reduce windblown sulfur
emissions and the acid rain they cause. But New York's effort to
stem this pollution assault from other states sends a timely
message to the White House and to Congress that the federal acid
rain program is not doing the job it was intended to do, and badly
needs strengthening.
</P>
<P>
   One source of New York's troubles is a generally sound piece of
federal legislation, the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, which
sought to harness market forces to reduce air pollution through a
trading system for pollution allowances. Companies that reduce
their sulfur dioxide emissions below federal requirements can sell
their unused pollution allowances to companies that find it cheaper
to buy such credits than to modernize their facilities. Over all,
the system has been a success, resulting in cleaner air nationwide
while reducing the cost of compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, on a regional basis, there have been serious
glitches. For example, New York utilities, which are relatively
clean because of strict state anti-pollution laws enacted in the
1980's, have done a brisk business selling credits to dirty
Midwestern plants, enabling them to avoid cleaning up.
Unfortunately for the lakes and streams in the Adirondacks, as well
as other ecologically sensitive areas of the state, these
Midwestern plants have returned the favor by sending their
pollution back east on the prevailing winds.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, which Gov. George Pataki is almost certain to
sign, any New York state utility that sells its pollution rights to
dirty, coal-fired power plants in 10 designated Midwestern and
Southern states _ plus the neighboring states of New Jersey,
Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware _ would be subject to penalties
that would negate any profit from the sales. Unfortunately,
polluters in the South and Midwest will still be able to buy
credits elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the bill sends an important message. If Congress wishes
to maintain the integrity of the trading system, it will have to
make it work all across the country. The best way to do that is to
tighten the national cap on emissions, which in turn would force
individual plants to lower their emissions. At some point, the
market price for allowances would reach a level where companies
would choose to spend money on actual controls rather than the
credits that give them the right to keep polluting.
</P>
<P>
   There is legislation in Congress that would do just that. A bill
sponsored in the Senate by Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Charles
Schumer, both of New York, and in the House by New York
representatives Sherwood Boehlert and John Sweeney, would require a
nationwide 70 percent cut in sulfur emissions from 1990 levels, as
opposed to the 50 percent cut required by the Clean Air Act. This
week's action in Albany is important symbolically and may yield
modest practical benefits. But the only sure way to get the kind of
reduction needed to protect the Adirondacks is to impose a far
stricter nationwide cap on sulfur emissions.

PACIFIC VENTURE GROUP GETS TWO MAJOR INVESTORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Pacific Venture Group, a healthcare-focused
venture capital firm, said Monday that two of the largest companies
in the health care industry have invested in its second venture
capital fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Encino-based company said WellPoint Health Networks Inc. and
Premier Inc. each invested an undisclosed amount in the PVG II
fund, which supports next-generation health companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means we have some very strong companies investing their
money with us,'' said Eve Kurtin, a managing director with Pacific
Venture. ``It is a positive development for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the second fund has assisted about eight to 10
companies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is health care,'' said Kurtin. ``We fund all stages
of health care companies, from seeding companies to mezzanine
financing.''
</P>
<P>
   The investment in the PVG II fund represents the first
investment in a health care venture capital fund by Thousand
Oaks-based WellPoint, said company spokesman John Cygul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of many opportunities to explore e-business
opportunities,'' said Cygul. WellPoint insures 7.5 million medical
and approximately 31 million specialty members nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Venture Group's PVG II fund invests its clients' money
in e-health, medical device, biotech and health companies, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are actively seeking companies to invest in,'' said Kurtin,
who reviews about 20 business proposals per day.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Postin, senior vice president of planning and communications
with Premier Inc., said Premier is looking for companies with a
bright future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also like to invest in startup companies because it gives
us an early window to emerging technologies that will serve the
health care industry,'' said Postin.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego-based company offers consulting and management
services to member-owned insurance companies and physician practice
management.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1995, Pacific Venture Group currently manages $210
million in all segments of the $1.3 trillion health care industry.

EDITORIAL: WATERY GRAVE FOR A ROMAN RUIN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, May 9:
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, the site of numerous ancient Greek and Roman cities, can
boast of antiquities that are among the finest and most abundant in
the world. But now Turkey is mocking its rich cultural inheritance
by heedlessly flooding what may be one of the world's richest
collections of Roman mosaics before the world has a chance to see
them.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, archaeologists have been urgently
excavating the ruins of an ancient city that flourished in southern
Turkey 2,000 years ago, against the day only weeks from now when it
will be inundated by the rising waters created by a dam project.
The ancient city, Zeugma, was a base for the Roman Legion at the
eastern edge of the Roman Empire. It was a thriving center for the
Silk Road trade on the banks of the Euphrates River, comparable in
size and wealth to Pompeii. Rich traders decorated the floors of
their villas with exquisite mosaics depicting scenes of Greek
mythology. The city is believed to have succumbed to invasion, fire
and an earthquake in the third century A.D., and has been covered
by layers of dirt and rubble ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists began concentrated excavation this past winter,
after belatedly discovering that it was an important site that was
soon to disappear under water. The dam that threatens the site is
part of an ambitious multibillion-dollar economic development plan.
Most of its gates were closed only at the end of last month to
begin creating a large artificial lake to be used for power
generation.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes Turkey's need for electricity. But surely a way
can be found to postpone the destruction of an invaluable
archaeological find. Archaeologists working at the site have said
that in four months they can collect and preserve mosaics
comparable to the region's finest, while in two years they could
surpass even the world's greatest collection, in Tunis. These are
not onerous delays for a long-term energy project.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Turkey has objected to the plundering of its
antiquities by thieves and foreigners, launching an aggressive
campaign to repatriate artifacts that it says were taken out of the
country illegally. In 1993 New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art
agreed to return the so-called Lydian Hoard, a cache of some 200
treasures dating to the sixth century B.C. that had been removed
from Turkey in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Countries like Turkey have a legitimate interest in seeking to
reclaim their cultural patrimony, but they also have an obligation
to protect that patrimony. In this case Turkey is betraying its own
history by allowing a site of priceless value to be destroyed.
Cultural institutions around the world may doubt Turkey's claim to
value its cultural inheritance if it sacrifices so rich a treasure.
It is not too late for Turkey to work with archaeologists to find a
realistic timetable that will save these treasures from extinction.

A BURST OF EXTERMINATION IDEAS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ After much scientific study, which consisted of
reading some e-mails from readers who vaguely remember reading
scientific magazine articles, I can state conclusively that when
rats and cockroaches eat baking soda, they tend to explode
internally.
<P>
   It all started with a story about how the Conservatory of
Flowers is overrun by cockroaches, and how the staff there let
loose a horde of cockroach-eating gecko lizards.
</P>
<P>
   But one reader said the geckoes would attract rats. Another
reader said you can kill rats by putting out pans of baking soda,
which causes gas, and since rats can't burp, they explode.
</P>
<P>
   Other readers pointed out that cockroaches also react to
ingested baking soda by exploding.
</P>
<P>
   Can cars run on tanks filled with baking-soda-stuffed
cockroaches? The internal-belch engine. If you don't have
cockroaches, this almost makes you want to run out and get some,
doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   But if baking soda is so effective, why bother with the geckos?
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING OF rats and cockroaches, I can't wait for a resumption
of testimony in Clint Reilly's stop-the-presses lawsuit to halt the
sale of The Chronicle to Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   I hear rumors that Hollywood wants to put the trial on TV, call
it ``Newspaper Publishers Say the Darnedest Things.''
</P>
<P>
   How about a bumper sticker: ``Honk if you're a Hearst exec who
didn't bother to read that Tim White e-mail outlining his offer to
sell the Examiner's soul for a warm Willie Brown smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Those Hearst execs must be like Woody Allen's dad (yes, another
Woody Allen reference!). Woody said he was kidnapped as a child,
the kidnappers sent his father a ransom note, but his father has
bad reading habits. He took the note to bed, read half of it and
fell asleep.
</P>
<P>
   WONDER IF the big local movie star _ I'll call her Jane Dough,
even though she looks to be fit as a fiddle in movies and in person
_ knows that Spa Radiance in Pacific Heights is using her name
prominently in its promotional literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jane Dough) can't live without her endermologie treatments
and power peels ...'' crows the Spa Radiance press release.
</P>
<P>
   What is endermologie? The study of cockroach explosions? No.
Says the spa brochure, ``Even the slimmest of the slim can harbor a
secret under her pantyhose _ cellulite! Our Endermologie
Therapeutic Message reduces the appearance of Pillsbury Dough
thighs ... turn that cottage cheese into cheesecake.''
</P>
<P>
   And who doesn't dream of having cheesecake thighs?
</P>
<P>
   As for the power peel: ``Sometimes your skin needs a bit of
cosmetic sand-blasting to remove exhausted skin cells,
discolorations and minor impurities.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow, superstar as fixer-upper.
</P>
<P>
   THE NRA HAS kicked in a million bucks to start a firearms-safety
education program for youth.
</P>
<P>
   That's the answer. If kids learn to handle guns safely, it will
cut way down on tragic assault-weapon mishaps among gangbangers on
their way to stickups, robberies and drive-bys.
</P>
<P>
   I DON'T LOVE you, so don't be afraid to download this column.
</P>
<P>
   I do like you a lot, though, and feelings can grow.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Cannata wonders, with the outbreak of the ILOVEYOU virus,
if anyone checked Bill Gates' activities last week. ``He is known
to be the petulant sort and the latest news from the legal front
could have pushed him over the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ultan O Broin was in a Seattle bar just after the Microsoft
breakup judgment and overheard two Microsoft execs discussing the
possibility of half the company moving out of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Exec A: ``San Francisco, South of Market, would be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Exec B: ``Way too expensive for Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Bill: This is San Francisco, amigo! Step into our back
room, we'll cut you a sweet deal.
</P>
<P>
   SAW ``GLADIATOR'' and now I'm afraid to shave or run through the
house carrying a pair of scissors.
</P>
<P>
   So many severed heads and human shish kebabs! What combat!
Picture NHL hockey without pucks, goals, officials or surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as violent as exploding cockroaches, but still messy.
It was as gruesome as Frank Gifford's self-flogging on that TV
interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   The scene where bad guys roar into the arena on speeding
chariots and slaughter innocent gladiators may have been inspired
by the red-light runners at Fifth and Mission.
</P>
<P>
   I was sorry to see that they cut the scene where Al Davis, owner
of the Gladiators, sues the city of Rome for a trillion drachma
because there are four empty seats in the arena.
</P>
<P>
   The major combat takes place in the Roman Colosseum, which I saw
in person a few years ago. It's so different in the movie. I love
what they've done with the place.
</P>
<P>
   We forget how primitive civilization was back then. A stadium
packed with 50,000 people and not one billboard, advertisement or
giant pop bottle. In the crowd scenes, I didn't see any of those
foam ``We're No. 1'' fingers. And the gladiators didn't wear Nike
sandals.
</P>
<P>
   Sport was pure back then. If you had gladiator combat now, even
dead guys would qualify for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But seriously: Good movie. I give it two severed thumbs up.

DISARCINA RETURNS TO LINEUP, FOR NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Shortstop Gary DiSarcina returned to the
Angels lineup Monday for the first time in six days after resting a
sore throwing shoulder. The question is for how long?
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina is suffering from the same type of shoulder stiffness
that bothered him during the final two months of last season.
</P>
<P>
   If he's once again comfortable, he didn't look like it Monday,
twice lollipopping throws in the third inning that landed 10 to 15
feet short of first baseman Mo Vaughn. DiSarcina made two similar
throws in Baltimore last Tuesday, which led to him taking the rest
of the week off.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia said before Monday night's game
that the Angels' medical staff, including Dr. Lewis Yocum, had
examined DiSarcina and that he had ``confidence they've targeted
what the problem is. Obviously we'll watch it very closely.
(DiSarcina's previous problems) raises the level of concern a
little, but with proper treatment and maintenance, he should be
able to play through (any discomfort).''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels record is roughly the same with DiSarcina in the
lineup (6-6) as it is without him (10-11), but they clearly aren't
the same team. He's their most reliable infielder defensively and
he entered Monday's game batting .361.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina doubled to drive in two runs in his first at-bat
Monday and his perfectly placed, two-out, hit-and-run single in the
fourth led to another run.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we might monitor it a little bit,'' Scioscia
said of his shortstop's workload. ``But this guy is such a vital
part of the ballclub, we want him out there as much as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   INJURIES ELSEWHERE: Tim Belcher's recovery from offseason elbow
surgery took another turn for the worse Monday when an MRI revealed
that right-handed pitcher has inflammation in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were hopeful that Belcher, who underwent elbow
surgery in November, would be ready to join the team at the
beginning of this month. But Belcher experienced soreness after his
last minor-league rehabilitation start April 25 and has twice been
scratched from scheduled rehab appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials, in making the announcement Monday night, said
the inflammation is not related to the surgery and that Belcher
won't throw again until it subsides.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Dickson, another pitcher on the mend, threw in the bullpen
before Monday night's game. He is due to come off the 15-day
disabled list Saturday after straining a right hip flexor muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Mercker, who threw five scoreless innings Saturday against
Seattle, will again take Dickson's place in the rotation and pitch
Thursday against Texas. &QL;

ONLINE AUCTION OF POTENTIAL DIEBENKORN HAS ART WORLD ABUZZ
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By JESSE HAMLIN and CHUCK SQUATRIGLIA 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  A ``wild abstract painting,'' initially offered for 25 cents on
a popular online auction site, has for days had art lovers around
the world betting fantastic sums in hopes that it's a lost
masterpiece worth millions.
<P>
   The top bid was placed late Monday by a Dutch art aficionado
willing to shell out $135,805, sight unseen, for a painting that
may _ or may not _ be a 1952 abstraction by the late Bay Area
artist Richard Diebenkorn.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, which looks something like a landscape, was offered
for sale on eBay by a California man known only as ``golfpoorly''
who also unloaded a ball of twine, an uninflated basketball, a
voodoo mask and other junk for $43.75.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got this big abstract art painting at a garage sale in
Berkeley (Calif.) ... back in my bachelor days,'' golfpoorly wrote
in his description of the piece. ``Then I got married, and my wife
has never let me keep it in the house. She says it looks like it
was done by a nutcase.''
</P>
<P>
   That nutcase may be Diebenkorn, the late master who blossomed in
the Bay Area Figurative school of the 1950s. Nowhere in his
description did golfpoorly, who reportedly lives in Sacramento and
could not be reached for comment, call the work a Diebenkorn, but
art experts said the piece bears many of the artist's hallmarks.
</P>
<P>
   The painting's mysterious heritage wasn't enough to dissuade Rob
Keereweer of the Netherlands from ponying up the top bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need time to explain to my wife why I am bidding so much
money on a painting that I have not seen in the flesh,'' Keereweer
wrote in an email to the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether Keereweer thought he was bidding on a
Diebenkorn. But if the picture is the work of the late master, it
could be worth millions, according art dealers. A 1959 Diebenkorn
painting called ``Horizon: Ocean Park'' sold at Sotheby's for $3.9
million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Art experts said Golfpoorly's piece contains elements of the
abstract expressionist mode Diebenkorn was working in 1952 as a
graduate student at the University of New Mexico in Albequrque. And
the untitled work is signed RD, the way Diebenkorn, who died in
1993 in Berkeley at 71, typically signed his paintings. But whether
it's the real deal is anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't say whether it's by him or not,'' said Diebenkorn's
daughter, Gretchen Grant of Berkeley. ``It's a picture (the family)
has never seen before. Nobody has seen it in the flesh; it's only a
photograph on the Internet. It's impossible to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Diebenkorn's family doesn't recall the painting, he
``was a very private painter,'' who created some works they never
saw, Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things surfaced during his lifetime that he had forgotten
about - and maybe in a couple of cases wasn't thrilled about -but
he had to say they were his,'' Grant said. ``One just doesn't know
without him here. I won't even venture a guess. It could be made
out of the wrong kind of materials. There's not enough
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Diebenkorn painted a series of abstract works during the early
1950s in successive locations for which the pieces are named _
Albuquerque, N.M., Urbana, Ill., and Berkeley. The Berkeley series
began around 1953, and art experts said an unknown 1952 work is
possible. They also said the colors in golfpoorly's painting _
predominantly orange, red and green _ match those Diebenkorn used
in the Berkeley series.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the Berkeley series have fetched as much as $1.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   The painting ``has some elements of landscape that fit what he
was doing in 1952,'' said San Francsico art dealer Kim
Eagles-Smith, who has sold several Diebenkorns. ``But based on
looking at it over the Internet, I have serious doubts whether it's
a Diebenkorn. You can't get any sense of the subtlety of the color,
which is really important. There's very little information.
</P>
<P>
   The painting is, according to golfpoorly's description, 2 feet
11 inches by 3 feet 11 inches. It has a small hole, the result of
an run-in with a child's Big Wheel tricycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be easy to fix with duct tape,'' golfpoorly wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that a Diebenkorn was being sold for a song brought
95 bids from people looking for a bargain. The top bid is among the
highest offered in an online art auction, though it is short of the
$168,000 paid for a 1959 watercolor by Lucio Fontana sold on
artnet.com last year.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, golfpoorly's painting could just as easily be a
paint-by-numbers job by someone with the same initials as
Diebenkorn. Online auctions are strictly ``buyer beware''
operations, and eBay _ which has seen people auction body organs,
newborn babies and Elian Gonzales' raft _ doesn't vouch for the
authenticity of items listed for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's either a Diebenkorn or somebody has gone to a great deal
of trouble to make it look like one,'' Eagles-Smith said. ``It's
like rolling the dice.''

WHITE OUT FOR A MONTH, AT LEAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Devon White was able to lift his left arm above his
head for the first time since he partially tore the rotator cuff in
his shoulder. But even if all goes well with his rehabilitation, a
return remains a month away.
</P>
<P>
   White still has inflammation in the shoulder, and he's yet to
begin exercises designed to build the muscle strength around the
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it'll be that long,'' Dodgers general manager
Kevin Malone said. ``I figured three weeks to a month just because
he had surgery on the shoulder in the offseason. We're going to be
very cautious with it. We're going to err on the side of caution.
We'll take that approach.''
</P>
<P>
   There remains uncertainty as to whether White will need surgery.
The Dodgers are waiting for the rehab to be completed before making
a decision.
</P>
<P>
   White, on the 15-day disabled list, said he knows the process of
recovery is going to be slow, and he admitted a month away from
playing is realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my limitations of how far I can push it,'' White said.
``When I get to the point to hitting off a tee, that's big
progress. Why have surgery when you know you can strengthen the
muscles around (the shoulder)? If it's not the throwing shoulder,
then you're not going to damage it more.''
</P>
<P>
   With White out, Todd Hollandsworth will get the majority of the
starts in center field. But for the first time in five games since
White hurt the shoulder trying to make a diving catch,
Hollandsworth wasn't in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, F.P. Santangelo made his third start of the season
Monday against Arizona left-hander Omar Daal, and Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said he plans to get the versatile Santangelo more
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need F.P. to start feeling good offensively,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo was expected to be a major contributor, but he's been
relegated to fifth outfielder and used mostly as a late-inning
substitute. He had one hit in 20 at-bats entering the game.
</P>
<P>
   MILLS MALAISE: If the Dodgers make a trade, they're going to
want to attach right-handed reliever Alan Mills to the deal because
he is owed $5.25 million through the 2001 season, baseball sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mills' market value is extremely limited because he's
performing so poorly. He's been relegated to a mop-up role in the
bullpen, and working his way out of the funk could take some time.
</P>
<P>
   Mills is 0-1 with a 5.93 ERA, and opponents are hitting .345
against him. Pitching coach Claude Osteen said he's thinking about
setting up a program in which Mills throws five minutes every day,
or every other day, before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really trying to whip this syndrome he's in,'' Osteen
said. ``Either the hitters are picking up the ball ... they don't
swing at any of his (nasty) sliders. They let him bury himself in
the count. It's got to have something to do with the way they're
seeing the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows what role he's in right now, and it's not a pleasant
role.''
</P>
<P>
   FUNDING IN FLORIDA: A bill that would provide $7 million to the
city of Vero Beach and Indian River County in their efforts to keep
the Dodgers in Dodgertown for the long haul is now on Gov. Jeb
Bush's desk. It passed through the Senate on Friday, and Bush has
30 days to decide what to do with it. Lawmakers in Florida believe
he will sign it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's enticing to Florida, but we owe it to Las Vegas and we
owe it to ourselves to look at every option,'' Dodgers senior vice
president of communications Derrick Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: Coming off a rehab appearance in Single-A San
Bernardino on Friday, right-hander Gregg Olson experienced
tightness in his right biceps and his time for a return has been
pushed back again. Instead of making another rehab appearance,
Olson is with the team and will throw bullpen sessions until he's
pain-free. He's been on the disabled list with a pinched nerve in
his right forearm since the first week of the season. ...
Right-hander Mike Fetters' inflamed right elbow is progressing, but
he's still not healthy enough to pitch. &QL;

COMIC CREATOR MAKING NEW HEROES OUT OF BACKSTREET

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Stan Lee has hatched a superhero gang likely to
have preteen girls buying flame-broiled hamburgers in huge numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who has created such superheroes as Spider-Man, The X-Men
and The Incredible Hulk, is making superheroes out of an unlikely
bunch: The Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   The boy band's superhero alter-egos will be featured in a Burger
King promotional campaign beginning in August, just after the
launch of their online series of animated episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Paul, co-founder of Stan Lee Media, said the Burger King
campaign is expected to help build interest in ``The Backstreet
Project,'' Stan Lee Media's series of animated Webisodes featuring
the band.
</P>
<P>
   The action figures will be imprinted with the Internet address
of The Backstreet Project: www.backstreetproject.com, Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Encino-based Stan Lee Media is rolling out
additional media properties, its business side is gaining
visibility as well. The company begins trading Tuesday on the
Nasdaq Small Cap market, a national exchange of smaller stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, one Paul said the company hopes to take within 45
days, is to apply for listing on the Nasdaq National Market.
</P>
<P>
   Its move from the over-the-counter electronic bulletin boards to
the Nasdaq Small Cap market represents a planned progression the
company has been following since it became a publicly traded entity
through a reverse merger with an existing company, Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   The move also is likely to bring more investor attention, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financially it means that we are now able to be recommended by
brokerage firms, and that institutions can now invest in the
company who were otherwise prohibited because of the bulletin board
restrictions,'' Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analyst Jeff Pittsburg already has noticed Stan Lee
Media's stock and has placed a ``strong buy'' recommendation on it,
setting a $75 price target.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Stan Lee Media closed at $15.13 Monday, an increase of
88 cents per share. The stock has traded as high as $31 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's approach to the Internet appealed to Pittsburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of converting existing audio and video content for the
Internet, the latest concept is to develop new, unique content
specifically for the Internet audience,'' Pittsburg writes in his
analysis. ``The king of comic book superheroes has developed an
entirely new set of character franchises just for the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Backstreet Boys, Lee is creating Web-based
animated episodes for a reintroduced Mighty Mouse, and Paul said
there is a potential for creating similar properties based on such
DC Comics characters as Superman.
</P>
<P>
   Lee recently signed on with DC Comics _ long the rival to his
Marvel Comics home _ to breathe new life into its characters.

LOS ANGELES TO WORK WITH U.S. ON POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Adding new drama to a growing police corruption
scandal here, police and city officials agreed on Monday with the
nation's top civil rights enforcement officer to begin negotiations
about long-sought changes in police training and procedures in an
effort to avert a federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lann Lee, the acting assistant attorney general for civil
rights, briefed local officials on the results of the Justice
Department's four-year investigation into allegations of abusive
behavior and racial discrimination by Los Angeles officers.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said the inquiry found there was enough evidence of civil
rights violations to file a ``pattern and practice discrimination''
suit contending systemic failings. Such a suit could give the
federal government final say over major policies of the Los Angeles
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour meeting, Lee issued a statement saying the
Justice Department was ``willing to defer filing suit to allow the
city the opportunity to work toward a voluntary settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the city had accepted that offer to begin discussing a
resolution of the matter and had agreed to schedule a meeting next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Such a lawsuit would be a huge political and legal black eye for
the leadership of the nation's second largest city, which is
already reeling from charges of brutality, corruption and evidence
fabrication that have led to the dismissal or suspension of some 30
officers and the overturning of more than 80 convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The case became public after a former police officer confessed
to handcuffing and shooting an unarmed gang member, then planting a
gun near his paralyzed body.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and local officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Lee had arrived in Los Angeles with a letter outlining the
department's findings. One possible outcome, the officials said,
would be for Los Angeles to promise a series of changes, in the
form of a consent decree similar to those the Justice Department
has already reached with police departments in Pittsburgh and
Steubenville, Ohio, and with the New Jersey State Police, where the
aim was to bar racial profiling in traffic stops by troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles would be the biggest city to come under such direct
federal scrutiny, though the U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn has
amassed what officials call evidence of systemwide problems in the
New York Police Department's handling of brutality complaints, and
is pressing New York for changes with the threat of a similar suit.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials said that Lee told them of the meeting only on
Friday, and that it had been arranged with such apparent haste that
Mayor Richard J. Riordan, a Republican, was not even in town. The
city attorney, chief of police, the president of the civilian
police commission and representatives of Riordan did attend the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has conducted its inquiry since 1996,
centering on excessive use of force by officers, under a 1994
federal law that authorized federal prosecutors to go to court to
seek changes in the operations of local departments.
</P>
<P>
   It was inspired by a tumultuous period here that saw the beating
of a black motorist, Rodney King, the subsequent acquittal of
police officers charged in the case and the resulting riots that
tore the city apart in 1992. In the wake of the King case, a
blue-ribbon commission recommended a host of changes in department
policy, including a new system for tracking ``problem'' officers
who amassed large numbers of misconduct complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department allocated money to help finance the
system, but in recent months it has become clear that efforts to
establish it fell victim to bureaucratic errors, infuriating
Justice officials.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, last fall, the police and local district attorney
made public their own sweeping investigations into contentions of
evidence-tampering, false testimony and brutality among officers in
the gritty Rampart division on the western edge of downtown, in the
city's worst corruption case in half a century. As that inquiry has
grown, it has led to bitter infighting between Police Chief Bernard
Parks and District Attorney Gil Garcetti, with Riordan at one point
reduced to accusing them of behaving like children.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's investigation had failed to uncover the
Rampart case, which local officials here said left the federal
government feeling pressure to step up its inquiry. In March, Lee
told local officials that the department was ratcheting up its
civil rights investigation. But according to one city official, Lee
said then that the federal government had ``no interest in running
the department,'' though the Justice Department had a ``role to
play'' in helping introduce reforms that had worked in other police
departments around the country.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
There was a paper trail of evidence to suggest Monday's Enron Field
meeting of the Astros and Colorado Rockies would produce the
offensive fireworks we have become accustomed to seeing on the
other side of the tracks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   What else should you expect when two of the worst pitching
staffs in baseball convene at one of the most hitter-friendly yards
in the league? Certainly not what transpired Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Astacio won a battle of the arms with Chris Holt, pitching
the Rockies to a 3-1 victory before the smallest crowd to watch a
game at Enron Field. The paid crowd of 33,195 watched Astacio drive
the Astros silly with a three-hitter that offered further proof
Enron Field is not immune to well-pitched games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro and Chris both pitched good games,'' Astros first
baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``If that can bring some confidence to
our pitching staff, then maybe something positive can come out of
this loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The four total runs made for the lowest-scoring game at the
Astros' new ballpark. It also broke a string of four consecutive
games when the winning team at Enron Field scored at least 10 runs.
The Rockies' winning score was the lowest at Enron since the
Phillies beat the Astros 3-2 on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three runs usually won't hold up in this ballpark,'' Holt
said. ``You have to tip your hat to Astacio.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker tweaked the lineup and readjusted the
defensive alignment prior to the game in hopes of jump-starting his
struggling club. But considering how good Astacio was, Dierker
might have to wait another day to evaluate the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio struck out 10 batters and allowed only two runners to
reach scoring position. The performance was a clinic on changing
speeds, mixing pitch selections and locating pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the best game we've had pitched against us
this season,'' Bagwell said. ``Pedro had everything going. He had a
good breaking ball, and he certainly had his velocity. Obviously we
wanted to get more hits than we did, but the (opposing pitcher) has
some control over that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros can hold Mother Nature partially responsible for this
one. Astacio was scheduled to pitch Sunday in San Francisco, but a
rainout pushed him back to Monday _ much to the Astros' chagrin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made that breaking ball look like a hittable pitch, and it
really wasn't,'' Astros left fielder Lance Berkman said.
</P>
<P>
   Holt's performance was sufficient to win most games, but he
happened to be unlucky enough to draw Astacio as his mound
opponent. The Astros righthander, who has a 2.82 ERA over his last
three starts, allowed three runs (all in the first three innings)
on six hits in 7 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the ballgame when I left, and as a pitcher that's
all you can ask for,'' Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   Yorkis Perez, Jay Powell and Joe Slusarski combined for 1
scoreless innings in relief.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio ranks among the National League leaders in run support,
but he didn't need much Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies had gone 21 innings without scoring before they hit
town, but it took only two innings to snap that spell Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-up, three-down inning in the first, Holt walked
the leadoff hitter, setting up Todd Helton's two-run homer off the
left-field foul pole _ 315 feet away from home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Helton leads the NL with 34 RBIs, and his 10 home runs also rank
among the league leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty cheap,'' Holt said of Helton's opposite-field
homer. ``If that pole had been 316 feet away, the ball goes foul.
But it wasn't a good pitch on my part. I got a fastball up; he hit
it and got lucky. A few more inches and that ball is going foul.''
</P>
<P>
   But when a team is struggling like the Astros are _ five losses
in their last seven games and 14 in their last 21 _ the breaks are
few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies pushed the lead to 3-0 in the third when Mike
Lansing doubled and scored on Jeff Cirillo's fly ball into the
no-man's land in short center field.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Craig Biggio got a glove on the ball but couldn't
make the catch, drawing an error. Center fielder Richard Hidalgo
was able to throw to shortstop Bill Spiers for a force play at
second as Lansing scored.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo put the Astros on the scoreboard with his team-leading
10th home run, a bases-empty monster shot that landed on the
railroad tracks atop the left-center-field wall and bounced onto
Crawford Street, leading off the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo has six homers and 12 RBIs in the Astros' last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio pitched four hitless innings prior to Hidalgo's homer,
and Spiers' bloop single in the eighth and Hidalgo's ninth-inning
hit off Cirillo's glove at third base were the Astros' only other
hits.

DISNEY'S EISNER A NO-SHOW AT TIME WARNER CHIEF'S BASH
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Despite their well-publicized corporate
feud, Walt Disney Co. boss Michael Eisner honored Time Warner chief
Gerald Levin at a black-tie dinner Monday night _ but he canceled a
personal appearance and sent a videotape.
</P>
<P>
   The no-show by Eisner, co-chairman of the Larry King Cardiac
Foundation benefit at the Regent Beverly Wilshire, and the feud
between Disney and Time Warner over cable broadcast rights set an
unusual backdrop to the gala.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, he's honoring Jeffrey Katzenberg,'' comedian Al
Franken quipped, in reference to Eisner's public dispute with
another media mogul, the K in DreamWorks SKG, who previously worked
for Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's giving him an organ donor card.''
</P>
<P>
   King introduced the video, saying, ``We have Michael Eisner on
tape, if Time Warner will let us show it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the video Eisner congratulated Levin on the honor, saying,
``I'm sorry that my own stress-filled life, as you can relate to
Gerry, has taken me to the East Coast when I'd rather be on the
West Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Levin said, ``You know what I'm doing when this
evening is over _ I'm going to Disney World.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin was diplomatic about the news that Eisner could not attend
the dinner, saying he was sure last week's dispute, in which Time
Warner Cable cut off the broadcast of Disney's ABC network for 39
hours, wasn't responsible for Eisner canceling his appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael actually is a good friend I've known for many years. I
was looking forward to seeing him,'' Levin said. ``But no, there's
no connection to current discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner wasn't the only no-show. The event's other co-chairwoman
_ former first lady Nancy Reagan _ also couldn't attend, according
to King Foundation spokeswoman Linda Roth, because she stayed home
with former President Reagan, who is suffering from Alzheimer's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of the corporate rivals was to be the centerpiece to
a testimonial dinner featuring other odd pairings _ conservative
columnist Arianna Huffington sharing the stage with Franken, the
left-leaning comedian, and feminist attorney Gloria Allred sampling
her dinner not far from Hustler publisher Larry Flynt.
</P>
<P>
   The $1,000-a-plate dinner raised money for the King Foundation,
which helps fund cardiac operations for patients who either can't
afford them or have inadequate insurance to pay for the lifesaving
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   King, whose CNN network is a division of Time Warner, created
the foundation in 1988 after he had quintuple bypass heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner pulled the plug on ABC's signal for a day-and-a-half
last week in a dispute over how much Time Warner would pay Disney
for the right to carry its cable programming. By law, the cable
company must carry the local affiliate, KABC (Channel 7), for free.
</P>
<P>
   The spat between the corporate behemoths went embarrassingly
public at 12:01 a.m. May 1, when ABC transmissions turned to static
for 3.5 million Time Warner customers nationwide. Shortly,
afterward a vivid blue and yellow slide appeared, in which Time
Warner told its subscribers to blame its rival: ``Disney has taken
ABC away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   And the bitterest pill for ABC was that the shutoff came during
a ratings sweeps period, when advertising rates are determined, and
when ABC had a chance to be the highest-rated TV network for the
first time in five years.
</P>
<P>
   After a 39-hour staring contest, Time Warner blinked when its
officials saw the fight was giving their company a black eye and
public opinion turned against them. They reached an agreement on
the morning of May 2 to extend negotiations between the two, and
ABC was coursing through the cables once again. The next day, the
Federal Communications Commission ruled that Time Warner had broken
the law by taking ABC off the air during a ratings sweeps period.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, speaking earlier Monday at the National Cable Television
Association meeting in New Orleans, continued defending his
company's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law should never have permitted this,'' he said of the
showdown. The system is ``just bad public policy, and we aim to
change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night after Eisner's video, Levin mentioned that he had
been at the New Orleans conference and jokes, ``We auctioned off
two of the Disney Channels while we were there.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Astros continuing to sputter and the season nearly 20
percent complete, they made a series of changes to their pitching
rotation, batting order and defensive alignment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After the dust settled, the Astros had a new look. Among the
changes:
</P>
<P>
   Jose Lima is temporarily out of the starting rotation and will
miss his next scheduled start after going 1-5 with a 9.53 ERA in
seven games.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the end of the 1996 season, Craig
Biggio was not in the leadoff spot Monday. Roger Cedeno and Biggio
flip-flopped, with Cedeno hitting first and Biggio moving to No. 2
in the order.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, who has been spotty defensively in center field, was
shifted to right field, trading places with Richard Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Tim Bogar, hitting .135, was told he will not start
for at least this week. Bill Spiers and Russ Johnson will play
short.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Gerry Hunsicker, manager Larry Dierker and the
Astros' coaching staff met Monday to discuss ways to improve the
club. The immediate result was more of the same. The Astros lost
3-1 to Colorado to fall to 12-19 overall and 3-10 at Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker said the moves were not a sign of panic, but he did
admit he was growing more concerned with the way the club was
performing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly alarmed because we haven't put together one good
week,'' said Hunsicker. ``It starts with pitching. If the pitching
doesn't get better, we've got problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker stressed the move involving Lima was not permanent.
Lima, who won 37 games the last two seasons, has allowed 16 home
runs in 39 innings this year. In his last three starts, he has
given up 29 runs and 11 homers in 13 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Astros have a day off Thursday, they will be able to
skip Lima's turn in the rotation. Hunsicker said Lima will make his
next start May 16 in Milwaukee. Lima will be available to pitch out
of the bullpen later this week, but Hunsicker said he would rather
have Lima concentrate on working out his problems with pitching
coach Vern Ruhle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give Jose a chance to take a deep breath and reflect
on what's happened,'' said Hunsicker. ``He can work with Vern and
try to correct some things we've noticed he's doing. Jose took it
well. He knows we're in his corner. Plus, it's not like we're
banishing him to Siberia.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruhle said he and Lima will work on improving Lima's changeup,
his money pitch the last two seasons. Lima's changeup has been up
in the strike zone this season, one of the main reasons for his
inflated ERA and the eye-popping number of home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pitch he's always had success with, and he's been
inconsistent with it,'' said Ruhle. ``Right now, he's probably got
about 15 things going through his head, and I want him to
concentrate on one or two things to get some clarity.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dierker: ``We need to get him straightened out. He's
obviously in a rut. What we need for him to do better is relatively
easy, but it's been hard for him to do, and that's to throw the
ball overhand more. He's not that far off. We're not giving up on
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima said he was not pleased with missing a start, but he
understood why the Astros are skipping him to work out his
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy, but there's nothing I can do about it,'' said
Lima. ``They're trying to help me get going again. Maybe it's a
good idea to step back and take a couple of days to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing because I never thought it would come to
this point where I would skip a start, but they can do whatever
they want to do. They're the boss. I hope it helps. I didn't win 21
games (in 1999) by being lucky. Now everyone is turning on me. Not
management, not my teammates, but the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker called the switch involving Biggio and Cedeno ``more of
a psychological move than anything else.'' Cedeno is hitting .210
after going 0-for-4 Monday; Biggio is hitting .252 with one home
run and seven RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think Biggio is the superior leadoff man, and he has
been the best for the past few years,'' said Dierker. ``Both of
them are struggling right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio had been the Astros' leadoff hitter since the start of
the 1997 season, hitting first for 497 consecutive starts before
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a guy (Cedeno) who can steal 80 bases, so
I think it's a good move,'' said Biggio. ``I'm only going to run in
certain situations; Roger's going to run all the time. Whatever is
best for the team, that's all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me hitting leadoff and Roger hitting second is not the reason
we're losing. Hitting leadoff is probably what's best for Roger,
and I know I can handle hitting second because I've done it
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said moving Cedeno from center to right was ``not
punishment or a demotion. Right now, we feel our best defensive
outfield has Richard in center field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros will have another decision to make when Moises Alou
comes off the disabled list, likely Friday. Alou had been playing
right field before suffering a calf injury. Dierker said he would
talk to Alou and see if Alou wanted to stay in right field or would
be agreeable to playing left. If Alou stays in right, Dierker said,
Cedeno would move to left field.
</P>
<P>
   At shortstop, Bogar was benched after going 10-for-74 in 26
games. He will take extra batting practice during the homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I understand, they want me to take some time to get
more confidence in hitting and to get my swing back,'' said Bogar.
``I think it's temporary. Obviously, we're not doing very well as a
team, and some changes needed to be made. There are some big red
flags on the team, and I'm one of them. They're just doing what
they think is best for the team, and I don't have a problem with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dierker: ``We're going to try to give Bogey a little break
and let him start over. Generally speaking, I prefer to go with
defense at that position, but he's lost right now.''

A BAD DAY ALL OVER DOOMS DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Matt Herges allowed seven earned runs. That's how bad
a night it was for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Until a fourth-inning double by Arizona's Travis Lee, Herges
hadn't given up an earned run this season. He then gave up another,
then two more on a homer by Steve Finley and so on and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers began a 12-game, four-city road trip in the worst
possible way. They were absolutely bamboozled 15-7 by the
first-place Diamondbacks at Back One Ballpark on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona wracked starter Chan Ho Park (3-3) for nine hits and
eight runs, then pelted the previously untouchable Herges for seven
runs. Arizona tied a club record with 20 hits in an nine-inning
game, batted around three times in the first five innings and
flat-out put a whuppin' on the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I missed many pitches,'' said Park, who has a
12.66 ERA at BOB. ``They were swinging the bats good. A great day
for them. I have no idea (what went wrong).''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers yielded season highs in runs and hits for the second
straight night. They allowed 14 runs on 17 hits Sunday to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fun,'' Dodgers third baseman Adrian Beltre said.
``It's not fun getting your (butt) kicked.''
</P>
<P>
   It began in disgusting fashion for the Dodgers as Park regressed
to points of last season. About the only thing that went well for
Park was he didn't walk seven batters, which he did in each of his
last two starts.
</P>
<P>
   The first four Arizona batters reached base and scored, the
final two coming on Lee's double. But the Diamondbacks weren't
finished in the inning. Pitcher Omar Daal had the first of his two
hits to drive in Lee for a 5-0 lead. It was the first of three
times Arizona scored five runs in an inning.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Park's problems, the Dodgers pulled within 5-4 on a
pair of two-run homers. Beltre's came in the second, his third of
the season and first since April 18. In the fourth, Todd Hundley
hit his seventh of the season, and his second right-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Park melted again, and this time he didn't survive the inning.
Tony Womack homered to lead off the fourth, Jay Bell doubled and
Luis Gonzalez singled to put runners on the corners. Second baseman
Mark Grudzielanek momentarily stemmed the ambush when he made a
diving stop of Erubiel Durazo's sharp grounder through the middle.
Bell scored, Durazo was out and manager Davey Johnson had seen
enough of Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers starter lasted 31/3 innings, his shortest outing
since St. Louis' Fernando Tatis hit a pair of grand slams in one
inning last season to knock Park out after 22/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of ugly,'' Johnson said. ``Early on, Chan Ho
looked like he couldn't get his fastball where he wanted it and he
couldn't get the curveball over.''
</P>
<P>
   Herges continually said that even though he was off to a
remarkable start in which he hadn't allowed an earned run in his
first 19 innings, his good fortune would eventually even out.
</P>
<P>
   It did, and then some.
</P>
<P>
   Herges did nothing to cool the hot bats of Arizona. The first
four Diamondbacks he faced reached base via hit or walk. By the
time the inning was over, Lee had an RBI double, Andy Fox had a
run-scoring single and the Diamondbacks led 10-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it would come to an end, but I just wish it hadn't been
(seven) runs against the Diamondbacks, the team leading the
division,'' said Herges, whose ERA went from 0.00 to 3.00. ``The
floodgates were open and I didn't shut them.''
</P>
<P>
   It also brought on another situation. Arizona started seven
left-handers in the lineup and the Dodgers don't have a lefty in
the bullpen. Because of that, Johnson said he would look closer
into Mike Fetters' elbow injury and also think about recalling left
Onan Masaoka from Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you have a situational lefty and a long lefty,''
Johnson said. ``It's the same place we were a couple of months
ago.'' &QL;

none are Democrats. And much to the chagrin of the Democratic state

out campaigning with none other than George W. Bush, the
second-term Republican governor and soon-to-be GOP presidential
nominee. Few people in Texas would argue that Democrats are
powerless or obsolete, particularly since the party still controls
the congressional delegation and the Texas House of

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THREATENS CIVIL RIGHTS SUIT AGAINST LAPD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT 
and GREG GITTRICH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Federal authorities threatened to file a civil
rights lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department unless the
city implements a wide-ranging series of reforms to stem a pattern
and practice of constitutional violations by the police force.
</P>
<P>
   The threatened legal assault on the LAPD on Monday drastically
raises the stakes for local politicians who attended a two-hour
City Hall East meeting with U.S. Justice Department officials. The
federal accusations of civil rights abuses within the LAPD go far
beyond the corrupt Rampart Division.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles officials who attended the meeting never asked to
hear details of the federal case against the city but repeatedly
sought assurances that they would have time to develop and carry
out reforms locally, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one got in their faces and said, Go ahead, file a
lawsuit,'' a source said.
</P>
<P>
   The local officials _ including Police Chief Bernard C. Parks,
who never spoke; City Attorney James Hahn; and City Council
President John Ferraro _ agreed to work toward a voluntary
settlement with the federal government to avoid the lawsuit.
Discussions are scheduled to begin next week.
</P>
<P>
   If the talks break down, sources said, the civil rights lawsuit
would be filed immediately and federal authorities would then push
the city to enter into a consent decree to avoid the legal
showdown. That would leave oversight of LAPD reforms subject to
scrutiny of the federal court.
</P>
<P>
   If local leaders stall reforms or refuse to implement changes
sought by the U.S. Justice Department, day-to-day control of the
entire Police Department could be seized by the federal government
if a federal court ruled against the city.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lann Lee, acting chief of the U.S. Justice Department's
Civil Rights Division, delivered the ultimatum during the emergency
meeting with city leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we notified officials of the city of Los Angeles, the
Police Commission and the LAPD that the Civil Rights Division has
been authorized to file a police misconduct lawsuit,'' Lee, a
former Los Angeles civil rights attorney, said following the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This suit would allege that the LAPD is engaged in a pattern
or practice of constitutional violations through excessive force,
false arrests, unreasonable searches and seizures, and that
management deficiencies have allowed this misconduct to occur,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A four-year federal review of the LAPD has concluded that civil
rights abuses ``occur on a regular basis,'' Lee said, before adding
that the majority of the city's police officers are ``ethical,
hardworking, and responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan did not attend the meeting because he had
already left for Washington, D.C., to discuss the matter with
members of Congress and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Parks, Hahn, Police Commission President Gerald L. Chaleff,
members of the mayor's staff and council members Mike Feuer and
Cindy Miscikowski were among the 14 local leaders at the afternoon
session.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said the Justice Department has authority from the
highest levels of the federal government to file a lawsuit against
the city. Therefore, it appears little room exists for the city to
maneuver other than to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``A consent decree is their pattern. They are a government
agency, and when they get authority for a lawsuit, they use it as a
greater hammer to get a consent decree,'' a high-ranking source
said.
</P>
<P>
   Following the meeting, Chaleff read a prepared statement to a
throng of reporters but declined to take any questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share the same goal, which is to make certain that the Los
Angeles Police Department is performing its duties professionally
and ethically and that proper management oversight is in place,''
Chaleff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have expressed encouragement about progress the city is
making toward bringing about needed reform in the Police
Department. And they have expressed concern about the need to
continue these reforms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Parks referred all inquiries to the Police
Commission through a department spokesman. The chief is scheduled
to join the mayor Tuesday in Washington to continue talks with
federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has been investigating the LAPD since
1996 to determine whether incidents of excessive force by police
officers fall into a pattern of abuse. The review was recently
broadened to include the alleged crimes of at least 20 officers in
LAPD's Rampart Division, the focal point of the worst police
corruption scandal in city history.
</P>
<P>
   Empowered by a 1994 federal statute, the U.S. attorney general
has the authority to take, in effect, final control of any state or
municipal law enforcement agency away from local authorities if a
pattern or practice of illegal conduct can be proved. The abuse can
fall along any lines, including race, color, national origin,
gender, religion and economic status.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government already has taken such action against
city police departments in Pittsburgh and Steubenville, Ohio, as
well as against the entire New Jersey State Police force.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, local elected leaders agreed to enter into a
consent decree with the Justice Department to avoid a full-blown
civil rights battle in open court.
</P>
<P>
   Based upon the previous actions, a consent decree with Los
Angeles would likely include the appointment of an outside civilian
monitor. In both New Jersey and Pittsburgh, the civilian monitor
has final and nearly ultimate control, including authority to seek
discipline against officers and reopen investigations.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   It is likely any consent decree would require the city to create
a system to track the conduct of officers, which would presumably
allow the department to detect any troubling patterns of abuse like
those that developed in the Rampart Division.
</P>
<P>
   To date, 73 felony convictions have been vacated at the request
of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office because
Rampart officers involved in the arrests violated search and
seizure laws, planted evidence at crime scenes or lied in court.
Hundreds of additional cases are expected to be overturned and
about 30 officers have been fired, suspended, or have quit.
</P>
<P>
   While the LAPD has been troubled by chapter after chapter of
police corruption since the 1940s, local authorities have
consistently tried to portray the force as one of the finest in the
country over the years.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting Monday, the Justice Department's concerns
revolved around two primary issues, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The first was the LAPD's failure to put into place a tracking
system of problem officers after the federal government had
provided more than $100,000 to study its design.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also repeatedly pointed to the recently completed
LAPD Board of Inquiry report, which detailed the department's
failings. Lee told city leaders that the inquiry report, which
included documents such as excessive force and officer-involved
shooting reports, supplemented the federal probe, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials at the meeting peppered Lee with questions and
Chaleff was among those who urged the federal government to allow
local reform measures to be completed before any litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn is expected to make a presentation to the council today on
the legal issues raised by the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department first notified city officials Friday
about its intent to give the city an ultimatum. The first reaction
of Riordan and other city officials was to fight any lawsuit and
resist any attempt by the federal government to control the Police
Department, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Meetings among top city officials were hastily called over the
weekend even as Riordan headed to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than battle the federal government, officials generally
agreed that it made more legal and political sense to avoid a
federal lawsuit by implementing the proposed reforms, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mayor's Office and others moved from anger on Friday, back
more toward the middle,'' said one high-ranking source familiar
with the jockeying. ``There is the prospect that you can lose
litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   As the meeting approached Monday, Parks had not been given an
advance briefing by federal authorities on their case against the
LAPD. But sources said the chief was willing to consider whatever
the federal officials proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's prepared to listen,'' one source said. ``He knows they're
not going to come into town and tell the department it's doing a
good job.''

DISARCINA PLACED ON 15-DAY DISABLED LIST
</HEADLINE>
 
Eds: Updates with DiSarcina going on DL (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Shortstop Gary DiSarcina was placed on the
15-day disabled list after Monday night's game with a sore right
shoulder. Tests will be done today to determine the severity of the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina played his first game in six days Monday but came out
after the fifth inning when, for the second time in the game, he
bounced a throw to first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all concerned,'' said Angels manager Mike Scioscia, who
announced the team will recall middle infielder Trent Durrington
from Triple-A Edmonton. ``Gary's a gamer. I can't overstate what he
means to this team, not only to the infield but the whole makeup of
this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's lingering with him. It's been like hit or miss. He had
three great workouts in Seattle and in the game it went south.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels record is roughly the same with DiSarcina in the
lineup (7-5) as it is without him (10-11), but they clearly aren't
the same team. He's their most reliable infielder and he entered
Monday's game batting .361.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina doubled to drive in two runs in his first at-bat
Monday and his perfectly placed hit-and-run single in the fourth
led to another run.
</P>
<P>
   INJURIES ELSEWHERE: Tim Belcher's recovery from offseason elbow
surgery took another turn for the worse Monday when an MRI revealed
the right-handed pitcher has inflammation in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were hopeful that Belcher, who underwent elbow
surgery in November, would be ready to join the team at the
beginning of this month. But he experienced soreness after his last
minor-league rehabilitation start April 25 and has twice been
scratched from scheduled rehab appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials, in making the announcement Monday night, said
the inflammation is not related to the surgery and that Belcher
won't throw again until it subsides.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Dickson, another pitcher on the mend, threw in the bullpen
before Monday night's game. He is due to come off the 15-day
disabled list Saturday after straining a right hip flexor muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Mercker, who threw five scoreless innings Saturday against
Seattle, will again take Dickson's place in the rotation and pitch
Thursday against Texas. &QL;

VAUGHN LEADS ANGELS TO COMEBACK WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Forget that the Angels, fresh off three games
in Seattle, have already played an AL West rival this season. They
got their first true taste of the wild, wild West on Monday night
when Oakland came to town.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, riding two homers and five RBI from Mo Vaughn and
four hits from Troy Glaus, rallied from a five-run deficit for a
9-8 victory over the Athletics in front of 15,034 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took the lead on Bengie Molina's sacrifice fly in the
seventh, bringing home Glaus, who had doubled and taken third on
T.J. Mathews' wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival capped an outstanding performance by the Angels
bullpen when he struck out Jeremy Giambi with the tying run at
second to end the game. Percival, Mark Petkovsek, Mike Holtz and Al
Levine combined to shut out Oakland over the final 51/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   While Vaughn and Glaus were leading a 17-hit attack, Oakland
relied on the latest incarnation of the Bash Brothers _ Jason
Giambi, the former Long Beach State star, and younger brother
Jeremy _ who each hit one of Oakland's three homers.
</P>
<P>
   The home run is the law of the land in the West where no lead is
safe, no game is in danger of being played under three hours and a
manager's decision isn't whether to play for one run, but whether
to settle for a field goal or go for six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope not,'' said Vaughn when asked if he expected many of
these games against Seattle, Texas and Oakland. ``I hope we can
keep them down and we're doing the hitting, but it's an offensive
division, no doubt about it. Oakland can swing the bat, we can
swing the bat, Texas can swing the bat and Seattle can swing the
bat. Sometimes we're going to have to slug it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia called the victory ``a great win,''
but the clubhouse was noticeably tempered by the news that
shortstop Gary DiSarcina would be placed on the 15-day disabled
list after the game with what team officials described as tightness
in his throwing shoulder. He'll undergo tests today.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams treated the starting pitchers as if they had sore
shoulders, too.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Oakland starter Ariel Prieto, who was making his first
start, nor the Angels' Ramon Ortiz made it through the fifth
inning. For Ortiz, who lasted 3 innings, it was his shortest stint
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia was hoping for more from Ortiz, who has yet to show
much consistency this season.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed eight runs, all on home runs _ a two-run homer in the
first by Jason Giambi, his major-league leading 14th, and three-run
blasts in the fourth by Jeremy Giambi and Terrance Long. And he
didn't help himself by walking four batters in the Athletics'
six-run fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Long staked Oakland to an 8-3 lead and knocked out Ortiz, but
the Angels slowly clawed their way back when Darin Erstad's two-out
RBI single in the fourth and Vaughn's solo homer in the fifth made
it 8-5.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the sixth, after Adam Kennedy struck out for the second
out with runners at first and second, Vaughn ripped a 2-2 inside
fastball from Luis Vizcaino over the wall in right-center field to
tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a fastball in and got through it the right way,'' Vaughn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino had just blown a fastball up and away past Vaughn and
catcher Ramon Hernandez was setting up outside, but Vizcaino missed
with his location and Vaughn didn't with his, marking the 26th time
in his career that he's homered twice in a game. &QL;

 &HT;    HOUSE PASSES BILL TO CRACK DOWN ON SEXUAL SLAVERY
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid a growing trend of trafficking in women for
forced prostitution, the U.S. House of Representatives voted
Tuesday to step up prosecutions and increase penalties to a maximum
of life in prison for what has become a global sexual slavery
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the legislation, which had languished on Capitol Hill
for several years, gives prosecutors new tools to combat the
problem and gives the U.S. State Department $95 million to prevent
its spreading by warning women in poor countries about the danger.
</P>
<P>
   According to recent CIA estimates, 2 million women and girls
from Asia, Latin America and the former Soviet Union every year are
lured by traffickers by promises of plane tickets and good jobs
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Once these women arrive in wealthier countries, they are kept as
prisoners in brothels and frequently ``bought'' and ``sold.'' Some
50,000 women and girls are thought to be brought into the United
States each year for involuntary prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, perpetrators would
receive punishment ``commensurate with the penalties for kidnapping
and forcible rape,'' said Rep. Christopher H. Smith, R-N.J., a
chief sponsor of the measure, which passed on a voice vote without
dissent.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also offers protection to victims, including an offer
of temporary legal residence in the United States for illegal
immigrants who are willing to cooperate with prosecutors in
pressing charges against the pimps and traffickers. Currently, the
victims are frequently deported and the traffickers are not
punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation will put these offenders behind bars while
protecting the victim,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation has been introduced by a bipartisan effort
in the Senate led by Sens. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., and Sam
Brownback, R-Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Under current laws, prosecutions have been rare, both in the
United States and abroad. Some prosecutors say they have been
hampered by sentences that are too short. In cases brought recently
in Georgia and Florida, most of the penalties were no more than six
years, and some were less than two years.

   NEW YORK _ A few weeks ago, I walked into Al Forno in
Providence, R.I., expecting a good meal. I got something else. I
left the lean, cool evening air and stepped into the restaurant's
foyer.
</P>
<P>
   It felt like I had stepped into another world.
</P>
<P>
   The earthy aromas of burning wood, yeast, roasting chicken and
herbs enveloped me. The restaurant smelled like food, and it
stopped me. I could not think of a single New York restaurant that
smelled so good. Or for that matter, one that smelled like anything
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few decades, aroma, especially in better
restaurants, has slowly disappeared. And now as more ambitious
restaurants open by the minute, an aroma-free environment has
become something of a norm. Powerful new ventilation systems in the
kitchen are partly responsible. But more than anything else, it's
because restaurateurs do not want the scents of food and cooking
swirling around diners, even if they have an open kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally you don't want odors out in the dining room,'' said
Tom Colicchio, the chef at Gramercy Tavern. ``When eating food and
enjoying food, your olfactory senses play a big part,'' he said.
``If you start to smell other things, it gets in the way _ it
detracts from the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Crispness'' is the word many restaurateurs and designers use
to describe the kind of air they are after. And to get it, they
avoid absorptive fabrics, opting for gauzy curtains rather than
heavy, dense ones and hard-surfaced floors rather than rugs. Dining
rooms use neutral-smelling chemicals for cleaning, often at night
so any odors fade before the next service. A crisp room may not
evoke home, but it can make all the flavors in a meal easier to
comprehend, as each course announces its arrival to the diner's
nose.
</P>
<P>
   Modern ventilation systems help that along too. Fan-driven
kitchen exhausts have been around since the 1960s, but they have
become increasingly efficient over the years. Now, the fans above
the stoves are so forceful &UR;  &LR; that they pull air from the dining room
through the kitchen, actually creating a small amount of negative
air pressure between the two. Peter Bentel, an owner of Bentel &AMP;
Bentel Architects/Planners in Locust Valley, said that ``with
appropriate engineering, putting smells back into the dining room
is actually difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventilation must be powerful enough to suck airborne grease,
heat and cooking odors up ducts above the tenant spaces in the
building, at which point it is released into the air. With a New
York restaurant like Tabla, that means a 29-story climb. The
velocity of the air in the duct must also be powerful enough to
keep the grease airborne so that it does not stick to the duct and
become a fire hazard. Ideally, said Dominick DePinto, an owner of
Ambrosino, DePinto &AMP; Schmieder Consulting Engineers, a Manhattan
firm that has designed kitchen exhaust systems at the Royalton and
Caroline's Comedy Club, that velocity should be 100 feet of air per
minute.
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly the romantic image of the hearth. But it may be why
the city itself has such a varied bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen aromas have changed, too. Before modern ventilation came
along, kitchens were hot, greasy, pungent dens. Jacques Pepin said
that when he was a chef in the 1950s and '60s, aromas distinguished
parts of the kitchen. ``When you went through the different areas,
you knew what people were cooking,'' he said. Cooking then employed
all the senses. Cooks, he said, could tell that a chicken was done
by the way it sounded in the oven. When the fat clarified and it
was nearly done, the sound of it roasting would change. It was said
to sing. Today's sterile, lab-like kitchens, Pepin lamented,
disassociate cooks from the food. Air conditioning cools kitchens
off, and exhausts remove the smell of food.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to enter many dining rooms blindfolded, though, you
would be more likely to guess that you were in a library or a
florist shop. And sometimes this is intentional. Some restaurants
go to great expense to import aromas.
</P>
<P>
   At Chanterelle, arrangements of flowers around the room are like
oversize atomizers. With them, said Karen Waltuck, an owner, they
want to bring an airiness, and a cool, clean quality inside. ``It's
almost a spa feeling,'' she said. ``It should make you relax but
feel pampered.''
</P>
<P>
   At Gramercy Tavern, which was designed by Bentel's firm, the
walls are coated with beeswax and there is a great deal of wood in
the furnishings, all so that there would be a ``wholesome'' aroma.
The intention, Bentel said, was to make diners feel as comfortable
as they would in the home of a good friend.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years the Monell Chemical Senses Center in
Philadelphia began studying more explicitly the relationship
between odor and appetite. Fifteen years ago, Dr. Marcia Levin
Pelchat, a sensory psychologist at the center, said taste and smell
were considered the minor senses. Today, scientists think that they
may be much more powerful and have much more influence on mood and
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   An aroma like beeswax, Levin Pelchat said, ``is associated with
craft and nature, and it does smell a little bit like honey, so my
guess would be that it would evoke an impression of naturalness,
the outdoors, or memories of natural things.'' Flowers, she said,
teeter between a good association, if it's mild enough, and a
distraction, like heavy perfume. ``If they evoke the memory of a
garden they can give the same feeling of freshness,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A controversial hypothesis, Levin Pelchat said, is that food
aromas may cause a release of insulin into the bloodstream,
resulting in a drop in blood sugar and possibly feelings of hunger.
Some responses to food, like salivation, are biological. But
reactions to most aromas are believed to be learned responses.
``You have to learn what is a food odor and what isn't, and you
have to learn what odors have to do with Mom and which ones have to
do with Grandmom,'' Levin Pelchat said.
</P>
<P>
   Aroma and memory are undeniably powerful. When I think of the
months I spent in Paris, I do not so much remember images of the
place I lived and the streets I walked. I recall the smells. There
was the sharp winy odor of the cafe in the morning that I noticed
from the street as I passed its open door. When I think of the
bakery where I worked, I think of the yeast and butter, tile and
apples, a confluence so distinct I can taste the pain au levain in
my head and I can smell the cool street air that came in with the
delivery man. Ask me the color of the tile, and my memory fails.
</P>
<P>
   When I returned from Providence, I began paying more attention
to what restaurants smelled like. The most aromatic place I found
was a street cart that offered chicken curry. The further up I went
on the restaurant scale, the more aromas diminished. Small bistros
tended to be heady blurs of herbs, meat and cigarette smoke. Some
had more specific bouquets. A stop at Le Gigot in Greenwich Village
one evening was like walking into a pool of caramelized onions. Woo
Lae Oak in Soho was a dense whiff of beef, vinegar and spices.
Daniel smelled of fabric; and I could smell the gin in my drink.
</P>
<P>
   What formal restaurants want to avoid, Bentel said, are
lingering aromas, which can cling to fabrics. This is often
controlled through design. In the banquet room at Eleven Madison
Park, for instance, metallic curtains were chosen for a glass wall,
so that aromas from one party would not linger to the next.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, chefs do not want to eliminate aroma from the
experience entirely. A few years ago, chefs began serving soup at
the table, ladling it into a warm bowl in front of the diner. It
looked impressive, but it also allowed the aroma of the soup to
blossom right under the diner's nose.
</P>
<P>
   Wylie Dufresne, the chef at 71 Clinton Fresh Food, once worked
at a restaurant in Paris where the chef would put a sprig of dried
thyme on a plate and light it on fire before it was sent out so
that the aroma would fill the dining room. The dish was nothing
more than roasted chicken with mashed potatoes, but, Dufresne said,
the effect could be seen on diners' faces as they followed the
waiter crossing the room like a tennis ball sailing across the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Such control turns the experience of dining into a slow sequence
of condensed sensual frames. The dining room at Peacock Alley,
which is sunk deep in the core of the Waldorf Astoria, is like a
secluded, aroma-free sanctuary. It is so neutral that when, on a
recent visit, the waiter set down a piece of bread on the plate, I
could smell the yeast in it. Subtlety has never seen such extremes.
Every dish thereafter had the same kind of spotlighted entrance.
</P>
<P>
   I had a similar experience at Jean Georges, where the minimalist
room is a perfect expression of that ``crispness.'' It makes a fine
environment for focused wine tasting. And somehow eases the
prospect of eating so many courses.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also something deadening and hollow about it. A
restaurant that does not smell of food or cooking cannot spark and
enliven all the senses the way a restaurant brimming with the
aromas of a kitchen can.
</P>
<P>
   Peasant, a new restaurant in Soho, has no electrical wiring in
its kitchen. All the cooking is done on a wood stove and in a
wood-fired oven in full view from the dining room. A ventilation
duct is also directed into the dining room, piping in garlic and
oil, new brick and young wood. The aromas echo from wall to wall.
With the kitchen showered in natural light from a glass roof, the
place has a soft blue glow and dark shadows. It could be cold and
austere. But the aroma of food gives it warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner is Lombardi's, a 95-year-old pizza shop with
coal-fired ovens. The aroma of the place is like worn leather,
something that can't be fabricated. It always smells the same,
always pleasant, of roasted tomatoes and sweet dough.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants with powerful ventilation systems do not harbor such
complex, aged blends. But many do still smell. And not always good.
While most aromas are sucked out, some linger. At Beacon in
Midtown, a wood-burning oven is the centerpiece of the kitchen. But
wood is not what you smell. When you walk in the door, you first
pass the bar. It smells like stale beer and a college dormitory. In
the back, by the kitchen, there is the aroma of grease. At Blue
Ribbon, a sushi restaurant in Greenwich Village, seaweed and old
fish meet you before you even enter the place.
</P>
<P>
   The aroma of food, in most cases, is pleasurable. It is what
seduces people as they cook. And for many people it is what spells
home. When I arrive at my door in the hallway and smell the cooking
of the woman who lives next to me, she doesn't know it, but it
always makes me feel like I am being welcomed home. Perhaps, as the
Monell scientists suspect, it is all learned. But it took me until
now to appreciate its importance.
</P>
<P>
   My dinner at Al Forno changed me. I can remember how the red
wine we drank smelled of spice and berries. I can still taste the
ricotta tart, redolent of almonds. I was not distracted by the
other aromas. I was embraced by them. They gave the place soul and
a deep, thrumming vitality.
</P>
<P>
   When I got home and took off my coat, I could still smell the
wood and smoke. I couldn't think of a better reminder of the
experience. &QL;

DISCOVERING SPANISH CHEESES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Recipes in 2nd take.) By FRANK J. PRIAL   c.2000 N.Y. Times
News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain _ Since Elena Arzak took over the kitchen
at the family's Michelin three-star restaurant here from her
father, there have naturally been a few changes. But one tradition
remains the same at Arzak: a dedication to fine Spanish cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Charles de Gaulle once remarked on the difficulty of governing a
country with some 240 different kinds of cheese. By that standard,
Spain's leaders have little to complain about since their country
has only about 100.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably an exaggeration, but Arzak's cheese cart seemed to
have most of them. At a dinner there recently, Arzak saved us the
trouble of having to choose; she simply served four of the most
renowned.
</P>
<P>
   We had queso de cabra de Vizcaya, a goat's milk cheese with
mineral nuances in its flavor from Vizcaya province, where Bilbao
is located. We had Idiazabal ahumado, a sharp, nutty-tasting and
almost buttery smoked sheep's milk cheese from a village south of
here, on the road to Navarre. We had Cabrales con manzana, a sharp
blue cheese from Asturias that she blends with a compote of apples
from the same region.
</P>
<P>
   If that were not indulgence enough, we also had torta del Casar,
a soft young sheep's milk cheese from Extremadura that at its peak
at this time of year, is soft and runny enough to eat with a spoon
like a French Vacherin.
</P>
<P>
   The cheeses were served with the ceremony and sensibly small
portions of a fine restaurant, and they were nicely matched with a
1990 Grand Reserva from Chivite. But I encountered the same
reverence at little tapas bars and in country stores. Whether
served with beer or the best sherry, on fine china or a toothpick,
cheese in Spain is essential as bread itself.
</P>
<P>
   A two-week ramble through northern Spain served as a delightful
primer to a little-known but spectacular part of Europe and a
treasure trove of fine cheeses that are finally beginning to be
appreciated in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Spain is sometimes called Green Spain, because its
forests, lush valleys and snow-capped peaks belie the tourist image
of oranges, flamenco and sun-baked villages. The region produces
more than half of all Spain's best cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   Two mountain ranges, the Pyrenees and the Cantabrian cordillera,
which stretch from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, protect and
nurture a culture more like Switzerland's than Southern Europe's.
The massif of the Picos de Europa, in the center of the cordillera,
has been called Spain's National Park of Cheeses because some 20
varieties are produced from the milk of the sheep, goats and cows
that graze, often side by side, on its slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Driving from one town to another, from the mountains to the
seaside and back to the mountains, we picked up the habit of
stopping in late morning for tapas. Lunch in Spain, like dinner, is
notoriously late in the day. No midday meal begins at midday; 2
p.m. is more the norm, and many restaurants are still busy serving
lunch at 4.
</P>
<P>
   This means the long morning hours are best broken up with a few
tapas, the delightful appetizers that are an integral part of
Spanish life. Here in San Sebastian, which is Spain's unofficial
capital of gastronomy, there are dozens of tapas bars, many of them
clustered in the old part of the city between the harbor and the
Central Market.
</P>
<P>
   Cheese, usually Manchego, is an important tapas, served in small
slices bathed in olive oil and in chunks on toothpicks, alone or
paired with serrano ham or chorizo. We soon learned to plunge into
the noisy crowd at the bar, pick out what we wanted and back away,
returning later to pay up. It's on the honor system, so you must
save your toothpicks or little plates to keep count.
</P>
<P>
   Beer is the best drink with cheese tapas, although in Guernica
we had good cider and in Logrono's tapas bars we drank simple red
wine. Here in Basque country, txokoli (pronounced choc-o-LI), the
local white wine, goes well with both cheese and the seemingly
endless array of seafood tapas on offer _ octopus, hake, small
crabs, anchovies and more.
</P>
<P>
   As with fine wines, the names of the best Spanish cheeses are
controlled by the government to prevent the proliferation of cheap
imitations. There are 12 denominacion de origen cheeses in Spain,
almost all of them from the north. Two of the four we had at Arzak,
the Cabrales and the Idiazabal. The Manchego of the tapas bars is
another.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrales comes from Asturias, which nestles between Galicia and
Cantabria along Spain's northern coast. The coastline is
alternately rocky and sandy and is battered by strong winds and
rain in winter. The interior, mountainous and rugged, is the source
of the region's best cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrales resembles Roquefort but is creamier, its veining is a
deeper blue and the flavor less salty. Both are usually aged in
caves for three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   Idiazabal is from northwest Navarre and the Basque country. The
name comes from a Basque village, where it is supposed to have
originated. Traditionally, the cheese was made by Basque shepherds
from the milk of Latxa sheep in communal shepherds' huts high in
the Pyrenees, where all summer and into the fall they absorbed
fireplace smoke. Today, the cheeses are smoked over hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Idiazabal is smoked, but all of it is made from
unpasteurized sheep's milk. The raw milk is what gives Idiazabal
its buttery texture and rich nutty taste. Smoking Idiazabal adds a
delicious, dark aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   The queso cabra de Vizcayo is a firm but spreadable goat's milk
cheese from a region that specializes in sheep's milk cheeses. To
me, it tasted a bit chalky but very flavorful.
</P>
<P>
   One of Elena Arzak's favorites _ and now one of mine, the torta
del Casar, comes from Extremadura and is made from unpasteurized
sheep's milk. The texture is creamy, so much so that the cheese can
be scooped from the rind with a spoon, and the flavor is rich and
nutty.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best cheese stories I came across in Spain _ the
cheese is pretty good, too _ concerns Garrotxa (pronounced
ga-RO-cha) from the town of the same name in the Mediterranean part
of the Pyrenees. About 20 years ago, a small cooperative of goat
farmers in that town decided to bring back a cheese that had been
made in their region a hundred years earlier but had all but
disappeared. The farmers were part of a ``neo-rural'' movement of
young people who have decided to quit professional careers and
return to the land.
</P>
<P>
   Farmhouse-style cheeses, made from goat's, sheep's and cow's
milk, are a favorite project of the group. Garrotxa is one of these
cheeses. It is soft and buttery, and is usually covered with a
natural mold induced by the humid climate in the high pastures.

   The spell of spring heat that has gripped much of the Midwest
and Northeast in the past several days will end Wednesday as a cold
front sweeps toward the Eastern seaboard. Thundershowers will
accompany the front as it moves from the west slopes of the
Appalachians early Wednesday to the East coast Wednesday night. A
few potent thunderstorms will erupt in the lingering warmth and
humidity from New York to North Carolina in the afternoon and
evening. Farther east, cool ocean air and patchy light rain will
cling to the east coast of New England. In the wake of the front,
breezes from the northwest will deliver seasonably cool air to the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Hot weather with little chance for rain will exacerbate drought
conditions from Texas to the lower Mississippi Valley. Meanwhile,
unseasonably cool air will spread across much of the West.
Scattered showers and mountain snow will linger in the Northwest.
Gusty winds will accompany the cooler air in California and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HEAT WAVE
</P>
<P>
   An official heat wave was declared in parts of the Northeast on
Tuesday where readings climbed to 90 degrees or more for the third
consecutive day. Reaching 90 for three straight days or more was
proposed in 1900 as a universal criterion for a heat wave, but the
definition ignores the typical summer heat in many areas. For
example, the average daily high in Dallas reaches 90 on June 6 and
stays at 90 or above until Sept. 12.

AMERICAN BALLET THEATER: MEMORIES, BALLOONS AND SURPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It may be hard to believe but American Ballet Theater
is 60 years old, a milestone celebrated at the anniversary gala
that opened the company's two-month season on Monday night. It was
an event that married past and present and looked to the future.
``Variations on a Theme by Haydn,'' a subtle, formal and rich
ballet that Twyla Tharp has set to music by Brahms, received its
New York premiere.
</P>
<P>
   This look toward new creativity was balanced during the evening
at the Metropolitan Opera House by excerpts from the repertory and
some surprise guests, notably Alicia Alonso, the Cuban ballerina
who was one of Ballet Theater's earliest stars in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, who was honorary chairman of the gala with Vice
President Al Gore (not present), was introduced by Caroline Kennedy
and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who were introduced at the start
by Hamilton James, chairman of the company's board.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kennedy, Schumer urged strong support for the arts. Gore
offered her variation on the theme, broadening it into an
appreciation of ``the arts as part of our national heritage.''
``Swan Lake,'' in a new staging by Kevin McKenzie, the company's
artistic director, was represented by an excerpt from Act 2 and
started the dancing on the program.
</P>
<P>
   Company alumni made their appearance at the first intermission:
Donald Saddler, Miriam Golden and Annabelle Lyon had all danced at
Ballet Theater's debut in New York on Jan. 11, 1940, and took a
bow. Saddler, a choreographer and director in ballet and on
Broadway, paid tribute to Richard Pleasant, Ballet Theater's
founding director, and to Lucia Chase, the company's founding
patron and later co-director with Oliver Smith from 1945 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In her remarks, Alonso said, ``This was the first big classical
company in the United States and it was wonderful, we were all
together.'' Speaking of pioneering years for both the dancers and
the audience, she concluded, ``The most beautiful way to unite
people is through art.''
</P>
<P>
   Unity of a new sort was signaled when McKenzie stepped on stage
at the end of the evening to read a message from Mikhail
Baryshnikov, who withdrew all his productions from the company
after he resigned as its artistic director in 1989. Baryshnikov,
who has kept his distance from the troupe, sent his best wishes
``in honor of Lucia Chase and Oliver Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own remarks, McKenzie said, ``Sixty is too young to be
old and too old to be young.'' By past standards, it was a sober
and simple gala, keeping reminiscences and alumni to the minimum.
Nonetheless there was a festive close in a mass curtain call. Gold
and silver balloons rained down on the entire company and on the
guests, who included the British-born star Frederic Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   Tharp's ballet deserves special attention not only because of
its novelty but also because the rest of the familiar program was
unevenly danced. Terrific is the word for the men, who blended
style, artistry and virtuosity. With a few exceptions the women
were atypically off form.
</P>
<P>
   With 30 dancers, ``Variations on a Theme by Haydn'' is a big
ballet despite its relative brevity. Tharp keeps to the classical
vocabulary more than usual, with only a few quirky weight shifts
playing off ballet's centered positions.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, she has added her own sophisticated dimension to the
music, reflecting its emotional essence and classical form. This is
a ballet that perpetually retracts and expands, swelling into an
intense and frontal advance by the dancers that corresponds to
Brahms' grand finale.
</P>
<P>
   The changing patterns reflect the musical theme's celebrated
structure (AABB) and counterpoint, but there is too much going on
at once to view the ballet as a literal visualization of the score.
</P>
<P>
   Tharp tends to sacrifice details to a larger pattern. But strict
clarity is not the issue. The choreography makes each of the nine
variations an adventure: Each is unpredictable, impelled by the
energy that drives the entire ballet.
</P>
<P>
   It is a plotless work with dance as its subject and yet there
are episodes that imply courtships and a chase scene. The big lifts
are obvious, and the counterpoint in the choreography is present in
the contrasts among the five main couples and two pairs of
soloists, not just in the interaction of the principals and the
ensemble, often divided into units of four or eight pairs.
</P>
<P>
   Santo Loquasto's tunics and tights nonetheless color code the
corps in light green and the principals in tan. Jennifer Tipton's
lighting design is as fine as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Three couples stand out in the beginning, but it isn't long
before Susan Jaffe and Marcelo Gomes stand out as more equal among
equals. Julie Kent with Angel Corella and Paloma Herrera with
Vladimir Malakhov introduce the athletic partnering, and Jaffe
introduces the diamond motif in a lift that will recur. Irina
Dvorovenko and Maxim Belotserkovsky stood out in brief, fast solos
woven into the choreography's texture, and Sandra Brown and Herman
Cornejo darted in and out.
</P>
<P>
   Oksana Konobeyeva and Gennadi Saveliev as well as Ekaterina
Shelkanova with a brilliantly dancing Carlos Molina occupied the
middle ground between the ensemble and the principals. But Corella
and Kent had the stage alone for a playful courtship, full of
slides and swoons. Jaffe and Gomes, whose duets had a flourish, led
the finale, which somehow seemed disconnected from the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Ermanno Florio's conducting nonetheless could not be faulted
during the evening. Corella and Kent flowed elegantly through part
of Act 2 in ``Swan Lake.'' Malakhov and Amanda McKerrow seemed to
be dancing ``Giselle'' instead of George Balanchine's ``Tchaikovsky
Pas de Deux.'' Corella's bravura rightly wowed all in the
``Corsaire'' pas de deux with Jaffe, and Jose Manuel Carreno was
equally magnificent in ``Diana and Acteon'' with Herrera.
</P>
<P>
   Kent and Julio Boca led the finale of ``Theme and Variations,''
and Boca and Alessandra Ferri acted their way lustily through the
bedroom duet from Kenneth MacMillan's ``Manon.'' Nina Ananiashvili
brought down the house with her arm-rippling and idiosyncratic
``Dying Swan.''

&HT;     CONTINENTAL AND TWA FLY FRIENDLIER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Continental Airlines ranked highest among major
domestic carriers in overall customer satisfaction for both short
and long flights, according to a new study of consumer attitudes
released Tuesday. Houston-based Continental has finished first or
second in the survey five years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Trans World Airlines (TWA) finished a close second in the survey
of frequent flyers that was compiled by Frequent Flyer Magazine, an
Oakbrook, Ill.-based independent magazine covering the airline
industry, and J.D. Power and Associates, a marketing information
firm in Agoura Hills, Calif., near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines, which finished No. 1 among domestic carriers
in a recent academic study, was a distant third in the Tuesday
survey.
</P>
<P>
   In January the magazine, in a random mailing, sent
questionnaires to 25,500 of its 200,000 subscribers, asking them to
rate the last three flights they had taken. The results from the
6,079 who responded will be published in the magazine's June issue.
</P>
<P>
   The study ranked carriers on nine types of service _ on-time
performance, airport check-in convenience, quality of flight
attendants, size of seats including leg room, quality of boarding
gate personnel, convenience of scheduling flights, interior of the
aircraft including bathrooms and overhead bins, frequent flyer
program and quality of food.
</P>
<P>
   Rankings were determined for long-haul flights of 500 miles or
more and short flights under 500 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Continental's overall top ranking, Gordon Bethune,
the company's chairman and chief executive officer, said at a news
conference here, ``We've become the most consistent, dependable,
reliable airline because of (our) people.'' And ``we are
competitive in our fares,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   On long flights, Continental ranked first in food service,
aircraft interior and check-in. It finished second in five other
service categories and third in on-time performance.
</P>
<P>
   TWA finished first in on-time performance, seating area,
scheduling and frequent flyer program.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest's flight attendants ranked at the top by a large
margin among survey respondents. Continental's came in second.
</P>
<P>
   On short flights, Continental finished first in six categories _
aircraft interior, food service, check-in, boarding gate staffers,
frequent flyer program and flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   In the flight-attendant category, Southwest tied Continental and
the Dallas-based carrier also had the best on-time performance.
</P>
<P>
   The study found more complaints about service this year than
last year, a result similar to that in the study released April 10
by researchers at Wichita (Kan.) State University and the
University of Nebraska at Omaha. That study showed a 130 percent
jump in airline customer complaints to the Department of
Transportation in 1999 over 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Taylor, director of travel services for J.D. Power,
said the industry was ``doing pretty well'' considering the recent
boost in numbers of passengers. For instance, he noted that
Continental flights now are about 75 percent full, compared with 50
to 60 percent a few years ago. He said the increase in passengers
and the resulting jump in the number of flights had also created
more delays.

&HT;     GENERAL OPTIMISTIC ABOUT TEST OF U.S. MISSILE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Air Force general in charge of the
controversial U.S. missile defense project expressed confidence
Tuesday that a critical test next month will be a success, setting
the stage for President Clinton to approve the weapon's deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish said he was ``increasingly confident that
we'll be able to do this (score a direct hit) on our next flight
test'' scheduled for June 26 over the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has set its own goal of achieving two successful
intercepts of a mock warhead before concluding that the system is
technically feasible. If that goal is met, the Pentagon then is
expected to recommend to Clinton that he give the go-ahead for the
Pentagon to deploy the system, beginning in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The system _ a complex network of sensors, radars and missiles _
scored a direct hit last October but missed in a January test.
Defense Department officials blamed malfunctioning plumbing on the
interceptor rocket for the failure of the interceptor to hit the
mock warhead.
</P>
<P>
   Kadish, who heads the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization, said the problems dogging the weapon have been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That particular problem, I think _ barring a real stupid
mistake _ is under control,'' Kadish told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't have one of those glitches, we think the design we
have will be successful on the next flight test,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the June test is a failure, the Pentagon has scheduled
another for October, Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have sharply criticized plans for a U.S.
anti-missile system, claiming it leaves them vulnerable by
neutralizing their nuclear deterrent. Moscow and some U.S. allies
in Europe have warned that a new arms race could be ignited if the
Clinton administration orders the system to be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have responded that the planned missile defense
system is meant to shoot down only 20 to 30 missiles and,
therefore, could never defeat the thousands of warheads in the
Russian arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will travel to Moscow in June to meet with Russian
President Vladimir Putin in an effort to smooth over Moscow's
concerns. While there, Clinton hopes to negotiate changes to the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to allow for the deployment of
the U.S. system.
</P>
<P>
   That treaty prohibits the United States from building any system
designed to shoot down intercontinental ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks following the June test, the Pentagon is scheduled
to make a recommendation to Clinton about whether the weapon is
ready to move from the laboratory to the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton in turn is to decide in the fall whether to give
approval for deploying the weapon in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton must give his approval no later than November or
December if the Pentagon is to meet the 2005 deployment goal,
Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule is compounded by the need to build a new radar on a
remote Alaskan island in the Aleutians.
</P>
<P>
   Construction contracts must be signed in November so that the
radar could be completed in time to meet the 2005 date.
</P>
<P>
   According to current Pentagon plans, the $30 billion-plus
program will be constructed in several phases. At first the
anti-missile system will use 20 interceptors based in Alaska. But
by 2007, the Pentagon plans to add another 80 interceptor missiles.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials maintain that the missile defense system is being
designed to provide protection for U.S. cities against a ballistic
missile attack from so-called ``rogue'' countries such as North
Korea or Iran, which are developing long-range weapons. The system
also is being designed to protect against an accidental nuclear
missile launch in Russia, sparked by decaying Soviet-era equipment
or a weapon that falls into the hands of a terrorist.

ALL THE BEST FOR ABT'S 60TH BIRTHDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By OCTAVIO ROCA  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK &LR;   &LR; _ Sometimes miracles happen, and there was certainly
something miraculous about the American Ballet Theatre's 60th
anniversary gala at the Metropolitan Opera House on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia mingled with exuberance, and respect for a glorious
past turned to excitement over a resplendent present. There were
memories recalled with deep affection, but most of all there was
dancing so magical that the future of American dance seemed as
bright and joyful as dance itself.
</P>
<P>
   There were short speeches at the start, including gala
chairwoman Tipper Gore's praise for the melting-pot diversity that
ABT has always boasted. Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the evening's
co-chair, spoke movingly of continuing her late mother's work on
behalf of this ballet troupe. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called
ABT ``America's company.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the dancing began with the Act 2 pas de deux from Kevin
McKenzie's new ``Swan Lake,'' with Julie Kent, Angel Corella and
the full corps de ballet. It was a breathtaking glimpse at a
production that is possibly the finest anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Kent's Swan Queen was a majestic, ineffable creature, with
Corella an impetuous Prince Siegfried. ABT's corps were stunning,
assured in their steps and sublime in their eloquent upper bodies.
Best of all, this was no meaningless dance out of context: An
entire emotional world came alive with dance and gestures that
always rang true.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda McKerrow and Vladimir Malakhov followed in George
Balanchine's ``Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux.'' There was immense charm
here, with Malakhov tossing off his pirouettes and almost casually
presenting, caressing and lifting into orbit the playful ballerina.
For her part, McKerrow managed to find the serenity at the heart of
Balanchine's whirlwind. It was a gorgeous sight.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures really rose, though, with the pas de deux from ``Le
Corsaire.'' Corella was the slave Ali, worshiping at Susan Jaffe's
feet. She was a model of Maryinsky  &LR; e &LR; paulement, all opulent line
and generous smiles. He was possessed: Not since Rudolf Nureyev's
prime have I witnessed such demonic speed, such seductive presence.
Corella is an incandescent, electrifying dancer who drove the
audience to a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   The program indicated that ``Theme and Variations'' was next,
but instead the Met's golden curtain parted to reveal Alicia Alonso
alone onstage, and the cheers were deafening. A trio of fellow
alumni from ABT's first season in 1940 _ Annabelle Lyon, Miriam
Golden and Donald Saddler _ had preceded her in a touching tribute
earlier, but it fell to the legendary Alonso to recall the
company's mission, its optimism and sense of adventure, its eternal
youth. ``We were so full of illusions,'' she said. ``We had the
beginnings of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, before the tears and cheers abated at the end of Alonso's
speech, familiar strains of Tchaikovsky rose from the orchestra
pit, and the company appeared in the extended finale from ``Theme
and Variations.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Balanchine ever create a more stirring ballet than this
masterpiece he choreographed for Alonso and Igor Youskevitch at
ABT? The ballet has gained speed over the years but has lost none
of its mesmerizing appeal. It looked stunning Monday night as Julie
Kent and a reckless, brilliant Julio Bocca led an ensemble that
could not be bettered in the world today.
</P>
<P>
   And that was just Act 1. The rest of the gala, save for a big
and unlovely Twyla Tharp ballet, continued with the mix of
exquisite technique and unabashed theatricality that is the mark of
ABT. Paloma Herrera, an unruly treasure of a classical ballerina,
was Diana to Jos &LR; e &LR;  Manuel Carre &LR; n &LR; o's Acteon in Nureyev's staging
of Vaganova's pas de deux. There was delicious spring in her step,
ecstatic musicality in his bravura. This was a ``Diana and Acteon''
that both brought back memories and made one see the dance anew.
</P>
<P>
   Bocca and Alessandra Ferri brought Latin passion and wild
abandon to the Act 1 pas de deux from Kenneth MacMillan's
``Manon.'' Nina Ananiashvili next brought out Michel Fokine's
devastating ``Dying Swan.'' It was very much a Soviet take, though
Ananiashvili's line was softer than Maya Plisetskaya was in this
ballet, and her arms rivaled Natalia Makarova's. Her phrasing was
seamless, her torso eloquent. Most of all, for all the superhuman
technique Ananiashvili showed, hers was a heartbreaking portrayal
of a ravishing creature facing the end.
</P>
<P>
   It was a miscalculation to close the gala with Tharp's
``Variations on a Theme by Haydn,'' a New York premiere but not a
great ballet. Still, McKenzie buoyed spirits by appearing before
the curtain. ABT's dynamic director thanked his predecessors, his
audience, his dancers. He then let the curtain rise on the entire
company. ``How lucky I feel,'' McKenzie said, speaking for ballet
lovers everywhere. It is a lucky age that boasts an American Ballet
Theatre.

A POWERHOUSE OF ART IN LONDON 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH BAKER  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON &LR;   &LR; _ ``Danger: 650,000 volts'' reads a sign on the south
side of the Tate Modern, Britain's first true museum of 20th
century art, which opens Friday. That sign gives a fair idea of the
impact this London institution will have, both as architecture and
in its exhibition style.
</P>
<P>
   The colossal structure that houses the Tate Modern has been a
London landmark since it was built as an electrical power station
in 1947 by Giles Gilbert Scott, who is known most as designer of
the classic red British telephone box.
</P>
<P>
   The building is a great, grimy symmetrical hulk on the south
bank of the Thames, minimally striated with brickwork and vertical
windows, a towering square chimney at the center of its north
facade. Its style is best described as brutalist Art Deco.
</P>
<P>
   Turning this relic of heavy industry into a major international
art institution, which it is instantly recognizable as, has taken
five years and more than $220 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a building people knew,'' said Swiss architect Jacques
Herzog, who masterminded its conversion into a museum, ``but with
good reason it was not known as a people building.''
</P>
<P>
   To make the Tate Modern a grand meeting place, not just an
exhibition space, was part of the task given the firm of Herzog &AMP;
de Meuron, which is designing the new M.H. de Young Memorial Museum
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The de Young project is very, very different,'' Herzog said.
``With that lovely park site, it's the most beautiful project on
our drawing board at the moment. The Tate Modern building by
contrast is a tough, urban site that could be approached only by
yielding to its energy and trying to turn that to advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Herzog &AMP; de Meuron has succeeded to a degree that should give
visiting San Franciscans new confidence in the firm's
less-than-popular design for the de Young.
</P>
<P>
   Entrance to the Tate Modern building is down a wide ramp that
descends to the bottom of the Turbine Hall, a gargantuan interior
space _ 500 feet long, 115 feet high _ that housed the generators
of the long-decommissioned powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The industrial character of the architecture is immediately
apparent in a grid-work of massive steel beams, painted charcoal
brown, and high walls of brick, painted putty gray.
</P>
<P>
   Steel truss-work beneath the long skylight overhead, the slot
windows in the end walls and the illuminated ``light boxes'' the
architects have attached to the Turbine Hall's north wall cleanse
the enormous interior's factory-like, almost prison-like air,
rather than deny it.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is a little like looking into Piranesi's famous
etched fantasies of prisons: The imagination is somehow liberated,
despite the forebodings.
</P>
<P>
   The virtue of Herzog &AMP; de Meuron's approach here is its very
lack of preciousness. Steel looks like steel, wood like wood,
concrete like concrete. The wood gallery floors have been coarsely
sanded and left unvarnished. Hardware is minimal and starkly
functional throughout.
</P>
<P>
   The gantry crane that once served the power station remains high
overhead in the Turbine Hall as a tool for moving large-scale
sculpture such as the commissioned works by Louise Bourgeois that
now fill the east end of this space.
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeois is showing three huge rusted steel towers _ each about
70 feet high _ fitted with giant distorting mirrors and spiral
staircases inside and out. They are places intended as analogies to
the emotional outcome of different styles of mothering.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, in view of their prominence, they are the least
convincing facet of the Tate Modern's extensive opening
presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeois's one effective piece here is an enormous bronze
spider that looms, seemingly on tiptoe, on the central pedestrian
bridge across the Turbine Hall. Monstrously imposing when one is on
its level, the spider looks almost dainty when viewed from three
levels above, through the transparent wall that divides the
exhibition spaces from the Turbine Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The Tate Modern has 84 gallery spaces in its current
configuration. ``Not one of the spaces in the original building was
suitable for use as a gallery,'' Herzog said. ``Every space needed
to be designed.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum is divided into seven levels, the top two of which
offer magnificent views of London from within the two-story light
box the architects added to the roof of the building.
</P>
<P>
   By day, the building wears the light box like thick translucent
epaulets. Illuminated at night, the light box frees the building of
some of its mass and remakes the local skyline.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition rooms could not be more cleverly used than in
this opening set of shows. Four suites of galleries display the
Tate's permanent collection of 20th century art to an extent never
possible before. It is a startlingly rich collection, weighted
toward the art of the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than chronology, four themes have dictated the choice and
layout of objects in the yearlong opening presentation. They are
``Landscape, Matter, Environment,'' ``Still Life, Object, Real
Life,'' ``History, Memory, Society'' and ``Nude, Action, Body.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to lose one's thematic place in the network of
galleries. Entering a large roomful of works by Tony Cragg or
Joseph Beuys, for example, one finds the works on view so absorbing
in themselves that their curatorial purpose fades. This is
especially true of the grand, softly lit room displaying Mark
Rothko's somber ``Seagram Building'' mural paintings. But then,
Rothko's work seems never to want contextualizing.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, one roomful of minimal sculpture makes almost as
much sense in ``Still Life, Object, Real Life'' as another does in
``Nude, Action, Body.''
</P>
<P>
   What seem like redundancies or mistaken choices at first glance
almost always turn out to suggest a deeper, initially unnoticed
level of connection.
</P>
<P>
   A room containing three large abstract sculptures by Anthony
Caro makes an improbable but finally convincing hinge between
``Still Life, Object, Real Life'' and ``Landscape, Matter,
Environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're quite consciously trying to move away from the hierarchy
between classic modernism and contemporary work,'' said Tate Modern
director Lars Nittve. ``There has to be some relevance in our
handling of the classic stuff to what artists are doing now and
what life is like now.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening ensemble of exhibitions, capped by a more enigmatic
one titled ``Between Cinema and a Hard Place,'' succeed brilliantly
in productively shaking up even the professional critic's
expectations and prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying both to create a museum of modern art and
rethink what a museum of modern art is,'' said Nittve.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate success of these ambitions is a challenge to other
museums of 20th century and contemporary art around the world, even
New York's Museum of Modern Art, which for so long seemed to define
the 20th century canon.
</P>
<P>
   The only embarrassment of the grand Tate Modern vision is that
the Millennium Bridge connecting the museum with St. Paul's
Cathedral _ the first new Thames bridge since 1894 _ is not
finished. Queen Elizabeth dedicated the fragmentary span Tuesday
just the same.

PILOT ERROR POSSIBLE, BUT NOT CONFIRMED, IN OSPREY CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ariz.) (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The crash of a V-22 Osprey on a training mission in
Arizona on April 8 appears to have been caused by the pilot
bringing the aircraft down so fast that its helicopter rotors
encountered the turbulence they create beneath themselves, and one
of the rotors lost lift as a result, the Marine Corps said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the possibility that the pilot's actions caused the
crash, Lt. Gen. Fred McCorkle said it was too soon to declare that
the crash had been caused by pilot error. The general said that
investigators ``have found no mechanical or software failures,''
and that the tilt-wing aircraft, which takes off and lands like a
helicopter but cruises like a fixed-wing airplane, would resume
flight soon, probably on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're rock-solid on that now,'' said McCorkle. The Pentagon,
which was unusually prompt in giving information on the crash, is
eager to resume flights to prepare for full-scale production of the
craft this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The crash, at a small airport in Marana near Tucson, killed all
19 Marines aboard. The crash was the third for the Osprey, but the
first two were traced to mechanical problems. This one, the Marines
say, was not related to the hybrid nature of the Osprey, and could
have happened in any helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   On this flight, a training mission for evacuations, a pair of
Ospreys were to land at Marana. Investigators are still looking
into whether turbulence from the first could have interfered with
the second. For the time being, the Marines have ordered that
Ospreys stay at least 200 feet from each other horizontally, and
that one not descend within 50 feet in front of another.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators believe that the pilot was flying the craft
``outside the flight envelope,'' said McCorkle, which limits
descents to 800 feet per minute when the forward speed is less than
40 knots. Lift is reduced as forward speed declines.

SUBSTITUTING SPANISH CHEESES FOR PARMESAN, GRUYERE AND CHEDDAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SPAIN-CHEESE) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cheeses from Spain were once a rarity in American
shops. Now, even supermarkets are selling mild, ivory Manchego, and
the more powerful Cabrales and Mahon are becoming easier to find,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving it at that would be like representing Italy only with
Parmesan, pecorino and fontina. Or just being able to buy Brie,
Roquefort and Montrachet from France.
</P>
<P>
   Like those countries, Spain produces scores of distinctive
cheeses. But in Spain, many are still made in tiny batches,
sometimes on farms with just a single herd of sheep or goats. These
mom-and-pop producers make just enough to supply their villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are very local, just farmers who made traditional
cheeses for their area,'' said Jose Guerra, the marketing manager
for Foods From Spain in New York, a government trade group. In
fact, Guerra said, until recently you could not even find these
regional cheeses in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   It seems something of a miracle that over the last few years so
many of these assertive, richly nutty cheeses have begun making
their way to America, thanks in part to the Spanish government's
promotion and also because of the growing interest among cheese
connoisseurs here. More than 1.5 million pounds of Spanish cheese
were imported last year, up from just over 650,000 pounds in 1995,
according to the U.S. Commerce Department. But even now, some
varieties, like the smoky Idiazabal, are available only
sporadically.
</P>
<P>
   They are worth seeking out _ in some respects, even more than
many of the imported French varieties. Many of the best traditional
French cheeses are made from unpasteurized milk and aged less than
60 days, so they don't comply with U.S. government regulations.
(Many Bries and Camemberts are modified for export and made with
pasteurized milk.) But with Spanish cheese, it's possible to sample
the best here: Though most are made from unpasteurized milk, a
great many traditional Spanish cheeses have always been aged more
than 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``French cheeses have become more compromised by
industrialization and demand,'' said Max McCalman, the cheese
expert at Picholine in Manhattan. ``Now is a good time to get
Spanish cheese, before it is industrialized.''
</P>
<P>
   More Spanish cheeses are made from sheep's milk or goat's milk
than from cow's milk. Many are made from a mixture of the three,
which varies depending on the season. Though many people may think
of sharp pecorino as typical of sheep's milk cheeses, in Spain they
vary from buttery to strongly assertive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spanish cheeses are more artisinal and look less
factory-made,'' said Kevin Tyldesley, the cheese buyer at Gramercy
Tavern. ``But there's a lot less diversity of style. For example, I
haven't come across really soft, soft cheeses like Camemberts or
triple creams from France.
</P>
<P>
   Gramercy Tavern is on a growing list of restaurants serving
Spanish cheese. Picholine, Hell's Kitchen and Acquario also buy
them, as do places that serve Spanish food, including Solera,
Placido Domingo's, Meigas and Bolo. Most of the time, they're on
the cheese tray or the tapas menu, although Bolo routinely makes
salads with Cabrales, Spain's great blue cheese, and Hell's Kitchen
uses Manchego and Idiazabal in its quesadillas.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to begin a love affair with Spanish cheese is to
taste. Visit a good cheese shop _ one that is well stocked and has
a high turnover _ and ask for sample slivers of three or four. Then
buy two to take home and nibble with some cured ham or olives at
cocktail time, the way the Spaniards do. Or serve them with fresh
or dried fruit, or a drizzle of honey at the end of dinner. Some
cheese shops sell membrillo, winy Spanish quince paste, which often
accompanies wedges of cheese for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Manchego, Spain's most popular cheese, is good for novices. For
one thing, the cheese has eye appeal: dark rinds of the thick
cylinders are beautifully patterned with close crosshatching from
the molds in which they are made. Manchego is a sheep's milk cheese
usually aged three months to a year, during which time its pale
off-white interior gradually deepens to ivory. It has a relatively
mild flavor, especially when young, and hints of walnuts as it
ages. Chunks of aged manchego are delicious steeped for an hour or
so in fruity olive oil. Two other cheeses, Zamorano and Castellano,
are similar to Manchego, and many people prefer their somewhat more
complex flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Iberico, unlike the others, is a factory-made cheese that has
less character than the traditional varieties; cheese exporters
expected it would have more appeal and began promoting it about
nine years ago, Guerra said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahon, a cow's milk cheese from the island of Minorca, with an
orange rind, has the kind of nuttiness with buttery overtones you
might associate with aged Monterey Jack and is good used just the
same way.
</P>
<P>
   Roncal, a classic firm-textured sheep's milk cheese from
Navarre, in northern Spain, has been made for more than 1,000 years
and was the first of about a dozen cheeses to be given an official
appellation, or denominacion de origen. A deep ivory cheese with
saltiness tempered with a touch of sweet, it is excellent when used
like Parmigiano-Reggiano. Torta del Casar is an aromatic satiny
sheep's milk cheese that can become as fluently lush and full
flavored as Vacherin.
</P>
<P>
   Idiazabal, a smoked sheep's milk cheese from the Basque country,
has a pale interior and firm, supple texture similar to provolone.
``The smoked flavor is well balanced and doesn't have a plastic
quality of many smoked cheeses,'' Tyldsley said. Try it in a
stuffing for baked chicken breasts, or in a grilled portobello
mushroom sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Another intriguing smoked cheese is San Simon, which is almost
egg shaped and resembles scamorza, the Italian smoked mozzarella.
Tetilla, the mildest and among the least distinctive tasting of
Spanish cheeses, is cow's milk cheese similar to San Simon but not
smoked.
</P>
<P>
   Garroxta (pronounced gah-ROACH-ah), from Catalonia, is a goat's
milk cheese with a sturdy gray rind, a white interior and
delightfully herbal overtones. It is less crumbly than French or
American goat cheeses, and though it has a certain sharpness it
doesn't have a strong goaty flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Queso de Murcia al Vino, or Drunken Goat, has become one of the
most popular Spanish cheeses in the United States. It is a smooth,
mild white goat cheese with a faintly winy aroma.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrales, Spain's famous blue-veined cheese from Asturias, can
be difficult to find in good condition. In some American shops, it
is too strong and almost gummy _ the result of inconsistent
temperature or humidity. The cheese should be on the soft side with
clearly defined veining, a grassy aroma and a pungent, complex, but
not overly salty flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Picon, made in the neighboring province of Cantabria, is almost
identical. If the Cabrales doesn't pass muster, try the Picon.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish cooks make relatively little use of cheese. Paella, for
example, is not routinely dusted with grated cheese the way Italian
risotto is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Italian cheeses are used in cooking,'' McCalman said,
``whereas in Spain, cheese is a food, often consumed as an
appetizer course.'' Steak with a creamy sauce of Cabrales is a rare
example of a Spanish dish made with cheese.
</P>
<P>
   But Spanish cheeses make excellent substitutes for Italian,
French or American ones in many dishes, especially when the
ingredients owe allegiance to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   I shredded Roncal over asparagus for baking, much the way
Parmigiano-Reggiano is used in northern Italy. Thin shavings of
mild young Manchego glazed individual pizzas made with a
saffron-scented dough, roasted red peppers and chorizo. And little
nuggets of Idiazabal folded in at the last minute imparted a subtle
smokiness to a rice pilaf colored and seasoned with fresh herbs and
garlic.
</P>
<P>
   After just a little experimenting, I could see Manchego,
Garroxta and Idiazabal becoming as essential in my kitchen as
Parmesan, Gruyere and Cheddar. &QL;

SOME EUROPEAN UNION MEMBERS READY TO EASE SANCTIONS ON AUSTRIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ At least six of the 15 members of the European
Union have expressed a readiness to work toward suspending
sanctions imposed on Austria, raising hopes here that the measures
may be lifted within the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian officials identified the countries as Spain, Italy,
Ireland, Greece, Finland and Denmark. Hubert Vedrine, the French
foreign minister, confirmed that ``six or seven countries'' now
wanted to ``think over'' the sanctions imposed three months ago in
protest at the inclusion of Joerg Haider's rightist Freedom Party
in the government.
</P>
<P>
   France is not among those countries, and the determination to
set a moral standard for the European Union by making clear that
parties such as Haider's are not welcome in government remains
strong in Paris, Brussels and Berlin. But a less confrontational
approach to Austria now seems apparent.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph widely published here of a smiling Joschka Fischer,
the German foreign minister, holding an umbrella over the Austrian
foreign minister, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, as she stood beside
Vedrine at a European Union meeting on Sunday summed up the change
of mood. Only recently, French and German ministers had shunned
their Austrian counterparts at such gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions, which consist of downgrading relations with
Austria and crimp the activities of Austrian ambassadors, have
prompted heated debate in Europe because they represent an
unprecedented intrusion into the internal affairs of a member
state. Austria was punished despite the fact that Haider's
intermittent revisionist views and his party's anti-immigrant
bigotry have remained at the level of words rather than deeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe is listening to us again, and that is the first, and
extremely positive step,'' Ferrero-Waldner, who is a member of the
conservative People's Party, said here Monday. At the same time,
she warned against ``over-optimism'' with respect to lifting the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium, facing its own problems with the rising rightist Vlaams
Blok party, remains the most vehement in its insistence that the
sanctions not be eased until the Freedom Party leaves government,
European Union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Chirac, the French president whom Haider has referred to
as ``a pocket Napoleon,'' is also reluctant to seek a compromise.
The German government of Gerhard Schroeder would certainly not be
the first to take a conciliatory step that might appear to condone
the rise of a rightist party in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 governments that have imposed the sanctions acted
individually but in unison, and it is likely they will continue to
do so. If they do retreat from their position while the Freedom
Party remains in government, they face the prospect that their
decision will be portrayed by Haider as a vindication and a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But maintaining the measures also has a growing price. Internal
opposition to the measures is increasing in some member states,
particularly Germany, and Central European candidates for
membership in the union, traumatized by long subservience to
Moscow, are not happy that a member state's sovereignty has been so
reduced.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Germany, the opposition Christian Democrats, who have been
vehement in their denunciation of the measures, have recently been
joined by some members of Schroeder's coalition partner, the
Greens. Christian Sterzing, a spokesman on foreign affairs for the
Greens, said the measures had been ``too hasty'' and that France
and Belgium had ``overreacted.''
</P>
<P>
   Joschka Fischer, the Green foreign minister, does not share
these views, officials said. But his ministry is deeply divided
over sanctions that were imposed with unusual speed and without any
clear idea of the circumstances in which they might be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Austria's proposal is that the sanctions, which include a
refusal to receive Austrian ambassadors at anything above
``official level,'' could be ``temporarily suspended'' while
international monitors, perhaps drawn from the European Commission,
kept an eye on the government.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said this idea would be studied before a summit
meeting of EU leaders on June 19. But Rudolf Scharping, the German
defense minister, said there was ``no plan'' to lift the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma over the sanctions has been accentuated by the
recent behavior of Haider. After stepping down from the leadership
of his party and adopting a quieter tone for a few weeks, he has
roared back throwing punches left and right. He has called
Schroeder an ``opportunist,'' restated his desire to become
chancellor and vowed to make his party, now the second force in
Austria, ``number one.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same times, party members have sharpened their tones. The
finance minister, Karl-Heinz Grasser, has said that if the
sanctions are maintained beyond the summer, Austria could block
reforms of the European Union needed to prepare the way for the
entry of new members. The party also appears to have persuaded the
coalition government to call a referendum on the sanctions in the
fall if the measures persist.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what such a referendum might achieve beyond
demonstrating that a large majority of Austrians, whatever their
opinion of Haider, think that the sanctions are unfair.

<P>
   YAROSLAVL, Russia _ When Aleksandr Petrov returned to his home
here from Hollywood last month with an Oscar tucked in his
suitcase, he was almost crushed on the platform at the Yaroslavl
train station by a crowd of friends, fans, television cameras and
flower-wielding officials.
</P>
<P>
   Taken aback, Petrov, a soft-spoken man of 42, referred all
questions to his wife, Natasha. It fell to her to make an obvious
point which, according to reporters present, went something like
this: ``Now you are falling all over us, but where were you before
when we needed you?''
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar ceremonies in March were held the same night that
Vladimir Putin was elected as Russia's second president. So it took
a day or so for the Russian press to turn its attention to Petrov
and his 22-minute film, ``The Old Man and the Sea,'' a strikingly
beautiful adaptation of the Hemingway book, literally hand-painted
on glass, which won the Oscar for best short animated film.
</P>
<P>
   Then the floodgates opened and Petrov was swept up in a backwash
of pent-up emotions as Russians seized on his Oscar as a victory
for a culture, a tradition and a pool of artistic talent that has
managed to survive despite the difficulties and setbacks of the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, thank you,'' said a woman with tears running down
her cheeks, as she clutched Petrov's arm after a special showing of
his films in Moscow at the House of Cinema, the epicenter of the
Russian film world. ``At last someone has shown that we are still
here, still working.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Yaroslavl, brushing the dust off equipment in his
tiny studio at the back of a dilapidated amateur film club, Petrov
is still trying to puzzle out how he ended up as a national hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the eyes of simple people, it is a victory for all of
Russia, something like a prize for football, or a sports prize,''
he said. ``Russia has gone through a long period when its authority
was weakened, and people feel bad about that. That's why any prize,
any victory revives them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me this was all unexpected,'' he went on. ``I accept the
Oscars with irony _ no, that's the wrong word; with understanding.
It is an exceptional prize, but it is not something on a state
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Petrov's Oscar reflects what is good and bad in Russian culture
today. On the one hand Petrov, widely acknowledged as the world
master of a rare and difficult animation technique and a filmmaker
who has been nominated for an Oscar three times, did finally win
the industry's top award, an honor that has eluded previous
generations of Russian animators.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand he received no financial support, public or
private, in Russia. The film, which took three years to make and
cost an extravagant $2.2 million because of its 70-millimeter Imax
format, was made in Canada, produced by Productions Pascal Blais, a
Montreal company, and sponsored by Japanese backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A prophet without honor in his own land,'' said Yulian F.
Nadezhdin, the cultural affairs reporter for Northern Region, the
main newspaper of Yaroslavl, an ancient Volga River city.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in Yaroslavl had never even heard of Petrov, even
though his earlier films _ ``The Cow,'' ``The Mermaid'' and ``The
Dream of a Ridiculous Man'' _ had won awards in Russia. These films
have been shown in a local theater over the years, but the seats
were filled mostly with Petrov's friends. When he returned eight
years ago to the city of his childhood _ he was born in a village
outside of Yaroslavl _ city officials listened coolly to his
requests for assistance and turned him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it wasn't the right time; the country then was really in
a bad way,'' Petrov said. ``Even the big movie studios were
collapsing, so I can understand the reasoning of the city fathers.
For them, my requests were just empty noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the tune has changed. In Moscow a hesitant and clearly
nervous Petrov was applauded and feted by the capital's cultural
elite at the House of Cinema, introduced triumphantly by Russia's
other Oscar winner, Nikita Mikhalkov (``Burnt by the Sun,'' best
foreign-language film, 1995) and heralded with a telegram from
Putin, then the president-elect.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Petrov's hometown, acknowledging their neglect,
said they would try to help. ``They didn't promise any golden
mountains,'' Petrov said. ``But they said they would support me. We
shall see.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not need much room to make his films, just enough to
paint on backlit plates of glass that are wiped clean after each
painting is committed to film. Trained as a classical artist at the
Voronezh Arts School and later as a filmmaker at a Moscow
institute, Petrov long ago forsook brushes for his own hands: with
a few deft movements of his fingers, thumbs or even the heel of his
palm, he creates faces, hands, legs, trees, sky and the shifting
moods of a Russian lake during the spring thaw or a Caribbean sea
at sunset.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is fluid, lyrical, almost magical. ``It is like
sitting in a museum looking at a painting, and suddenly the
painting tells a story,'' said Bernard Lajoie, the Montreal
producer who decided in 1996 to back Petrov's production of ``The
Old Man and the Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Canadians finance the film, but they decided _
together with their Japanese backers _ to film it in a large format
that they thought would lend itself to the marine scenes that make
up most of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Man and the Sea,'' scheduled for release in the United
States in September, is the first animated film to be produced for
Imax theaters, an experiment that initially made everyone involved
in the project uneasy. ``I was nervous and my producers were
nervous, although we didn't tell each other until the end,'' Petrov
said. ``I was worried that my fingerprints would show on the
gigantic screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Shooting the film for a large format added to the cost and
complexity of the project; laboratory expenses alone came to
$500,000, Lajoie said. Petrov _ with his wife; his 20-year-old son
and assistant, Dmitri; and his cameraman, Sergei Rechetnikov _
spent two and a half years in Montreal devoting themselves to the
agonizing process of producing the painted film frame by frame.
</P>
<P>
   To ease his task, Petrov's Canadian producers provided the
filmmaker with a specially designed computerized animation stand
that allowed him to see previous frames as he worked. But
otherwise, the rest of the work was done painstakingly by hand,
more than 29,000 frames _ or more accurately, complete paintings _
about 8 to 12 frames for each second of film. The sequencing was
first mapped out in pencil sketches, but the frame-to-frame
continuity is something Petrov kept in his head, or rather, in his
mind's eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a very professional approach,'' he said. ``If I
worked for Disney they would have thrown me out a long time ago.
There is no discipline in my approach; I make the changes as I go
along.''

YAROSLAVL, Russia: I go along.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an industry addicted to hype and self-publicity, Petrov comes
across as a kind of antihero, all modesty and self-deprecation. At
the Oscars he spoke a few words of English before lapsing
apologetically into Russian. Once back in Russia, he seemed
literally stunned by the press attention and has been loath to use
his sudden celebrity to toot any horn, let alone his own.
</P>
<P>
   His hopes, like his complaints, are low key. He would like to
open a studio for local animators, although he is not sure who
would use it, except perhaps some of the children who attend
classes at the Sea Gull film club. He is taking his time before
committing himself to his next project, but he knows this much:
next time, he wants to stay in Yaroslavl.
</P>
<P>
   When he was working in Canada, some of his friends predicted
that he would end up staying abroad, like so many other Russian
artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to come home,'' he said. ``And I did. That
seems to mean something to people, that I returned because it means
there is something to return to. I hope it was the right
decision.''

ADVERTISING: WINNERS AND LOSERS IN DOT-COM BRANDING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLISON FASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much has been made of the need for dot-coms to generate
awareness of their names among computer users. Internet companies
are spending billions of dollars online, in print and on television
to establish their brands. Now comes a study that tries to identify
the winners and losers in the big branding struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which was conducted in October and released in
mid-April by Greenfield Online, an Internet market research company
based in Wilton, Conn., surveyed about 3,400 computer users. Among
100 Internet names placed before the respondents, Microsoft.com has
the highest ``brand power,'' defined as a combination of rankings
in three categories: brand familiarity, the brand's ability to
affect the Internet landscape and the brand's perceived financial
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Following Microsoft.com in the survey were four well-known
dot-coms. In descending order, they were: Amazon.com, Netscape.com,
AOL.com and eBay.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of branding efforts, it's important to know if a site
is having a personal effect on an Internet user,'' said Mara
Shelby, vice president for client development at Greenfield, adding
that sites perceived by computer users as being fun and frequently
updated are more likely to be visited regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, as Shelby puts it, is to ``keep people coming back for
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The brands ranked No. 6 through 10 on the survey were more of a
mixture of old and new: IBM.com; Barnesandnoble.com; MSN.com, the
Microsoft Network; MSNBC.com; and Hotmail.com.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high overall brand-power rankings for Internet-based
companies, in the category of financial strength, the survey
respondents said they were more likely to invest in traditional
companies that have Web sites or sell products online than in pure
dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   The question the survey asked was, ``Assuming you had the money
to invest and are currently investing, how likely would you be to
invest in each brand at any time, for any reason?'' The only
Internet-based company to rank in the top five was Amazon.com. The
top five were: Microsoft.com, Amazon.com, IBM.com, WalMart.com,
Intel.com and Coke.com. (Intel.com and Coke.com tied for fifth.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have expected more offbeat dot-coms would be up
there,'' Shelby said. Internet-based brands fared better in the
other two categories in the survey. In fact, the same five
companies that topped the overall brand-power rankings were also
deemed the most powerful in familiarity and ability to affect the
Internet environment.
</P>
<P>
   The top five in familiarity were: Amazon.com, Microsoft.com,
AOL.com, Netscape.com and eBay.com. The top five in the other
category were: Microsoft.com, Netscape.com, AOL.com, Amazon.com and
eBay.com.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield sorted the data to prepare rankings of brands that
compete against each other in fields like books, credit cards, fast
food and content aimed at women.
</P>
<P>
   For example, among online booksellers, the Amazon.com brand
ranked highest, followed by Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com.
</P>
<P>
   For credit card brands, survey respondents listed Visa.com
first, then Mastercard.com and AmericanExpress.com. In fast food,
McDonalds.com beat out Wendys.com, which led BurgerKing.com.
IVillage.com was ahead of Women.com in the women's lifestyle
category.
</P>
<P>
   Tying for the lowest ranking of the 100 brands were Haggle.com,
an online auction site, and Hillspet.com, which offers nutritional
advice and products for dogs and cats. The rest of the finishers on
the bottom were: Petopia.com; Virgin.com; Wingspanbank.com;
Sixdegrees.com; Furniture.com; Peapod.com; Fatbrain.com; and
PG.com, the Web site of Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to just be well known,'' said Mike Mulligan,
chairman and chief executive at Mapquest.com in New York, the Web
site that ranked 20th for overall brand power. ``It's also
important to have a brand that's readily understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a large extent,'' he added, ``your Web site is your
brand.''

&HT;     SENIOR CITIZENS TRY NEW HOBBY: HANG GLIDING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It is poetically appealing that Pat Calvert and
Barbara Sedgley hail from a town called Alta. As in altitude.
</P>
<P>
   A while back they were down at the hair parlor for their regular
Wednesday visit. Calvert was imagining how she might celebrate her
upcoming 75th birthday. Hang gliding, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara said, `Well, I'd like to do it, too,' but I didn't
think she would,'' Calvert recalls as the two old friends stand
atop a ridge of Mount Tamalpais 2,000 feet above Stinson Beach,
Calif. The distant strand would be their landing zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a husband and two sons, and they think we're insane,''
says Sedgley, 74. The pair have driven 150 miles from their homes
in Placer County hill country in hopes that the weather would
permit a takeoff. They had been canceled once by high winds.
</P>
<P>
   Calvert, the widowed mother of three, says one of her sons _
Robin Calvert, an actor living in San Francisco _ had facilitated
their aerial folly by arranging things with the San Francisco Hang
Gliding Center, which offers tandem flight instruction on Mount
Tam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a real good ride,'' she tells chief instructor and
flight coordinator Eric Mies. ``I don't want a grandma ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Mies says customers the ages of Calvert and Sedgley are rather
rare, though he once took up an 83-year-old man who was an
experienced aviator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical age group is the 40s and 50s,'' said Mies. He
figured most younger people can't afford the $175 fee for the 10-
to 12-minute ride.
</P>
<P>
   Mies and fellow instructor Andrew Whitehill set out to choose
their passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take the best-looking girl, and that's hard to decide,''
says Whitehill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which one of you weighs the most?'' asks Mies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why she does, of course,'' quipps Calvert.
</P>
<P>
   Neither woman seems intimidated by the adventure ahead, nor new
to the world of recreational aviation. Sedgley had ridden a hot-air
balloon in Napa and a sailplane north of Reno over Pyramid Lake.
Calvert, too, had gone gliding. Two years ago she soared in a
parasail, pulled by a boat over the waves of the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Sedgley figures that even if something were to go awry, she
wouldn't experience fear in her final moments. She hadn't been
scared when she wrecked her motorcycle 10 years back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flew up and over the handlebars, and that's the last thing I
remember,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehill asks if either woman has had recurring dreams about
flying. Sedgley says she did. Hang gliding is ``like that only much
better,'' he promised. With the help of enthusiastic assistant
Stephan Spano, the women are methodically inserted into their
harnesses. Sedgley, the first to be outfitted, looks like a
rubber-clad gladiator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flying off a mountain? Why not?'' she says. ``It's better than
sitting around the house. . . . I don't knit. I don't do crochet.
So I go out and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvert, who is being suited up nearby, mutteres, ``I had no
idea Barbara was so adventurous.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitehill assures the women that his 63-year-old mother ``is
going to be jealous. She's been wanting to do this for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mies, who will be flying first with Sedgley, says he didn't know
if she would get a sled ride _ a straight coast to the beach _ or a
bit of a bouncier, longer coast to the coast. It will depend, he
says, on the wind and on how much stunt flying she could endure.
Plenty, it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   The pair make a run down a steep slope and, in very few steps,
are airborne. Lifted by generous winds, they promptly pop upward
and drift out across the green trees and brown grass of Mount Tam's
flanks and hollows. After coasting to a lower altitude, the hang
glider begins to make turns, dips and gentle spins.
</P>
<P>
   Spano, beside himself with the beauty of it all, has a ``When
Harry Met Sally'' moment. ``Oh, he's DOING stuff!'' he exclaimes.
``Oh, he's having FUN! Oh YES! Oh, THAT'S GREAT!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stephan, could you help me?'' asks Whitehill, standing alone
and ignored with a hang glider on his back.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Whitehill and Calvert launch themselves into
Marin County airspace. ``Oh wow!,'' she exclaims as they rush away
from the ridge.
</P>
<P>
   In too little time both women are walking off the beach, still
wearing their flight harnesses and delighting in their shared
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful. It was flying like a bird,'' says Calvert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the red-tail hawks flying with us,'' says Sedgley. ``We
soared, and then he took some swoops and he dived. We hit a little
bit of turbulence a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I liked that feeling,'' Calvert replies.
</P>
<P>
   Would they do it again?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' says Calvert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do some of the other things first,'' says
Sedgley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skydiving next,'' says Calvert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skydiving and bungee jumping,'' says Sedgley.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to be our age, you don't want to wait too long to
do things,'' says Calvert with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you get to this age and people are dying. People you
know. And you decide to go out and do something that will let you
know you're alive,'' says Sedgley.
</P>
<P>
   Bragging to their friends is one of the payoffs, she says.
``That's what makes you giggle inside,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   As they ride back up the hill, Calvert thanks Mies and Whitehill
for the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll remember this when we're old,'' she says.

 &HT;    GLENN COMMISSION BEGINS TO DRAFT REPORT
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Commission on Mathematics and Science
Teaching for the 21st Century began Tuesday to sort out suggestions
proposed by experts, advocates and the public on how to improve
teaching of those subjects in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Among the approaches rejected was a tongue-in-cheek proposal
that the final report begin, ``Americans are just too dumb to know
how bad they are'' at science and math.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a real vote-getter,'' drawled one of the 32
commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will end up discarding about 30 percent of the
suggestions it has received in the past year, its chairman, John
Glenn, said.
</P>
<P>
   The former astronaut and Democratic senator from Ohio said that
the suggestions formed ``a classic bell-shaped curve,'' in which
moderate suggestions piled up in the middle and about one-third
represented either very liberal or conservative views.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll throw out the extremes and what we're left with are the
common-sense ideas,'' Glenn said. ``Sixty or 70 percent of the
comments have been right on target.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. Jim Geringer of Wyoming, a former aerospace
engineer on the Glenn commission who is also chair-elect of the
Education Commission of the States, said he too expects a moderate
document to emerge in the final report, which is due in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our role to gather information and knit it all together,
not to invent math and science education all new,'' Geringer said.
</P>
<P>
   Commission members, who range from teachers to corporate
executives, struggled Tuesday to figure out how they could package
moderate suggestions in a report with enough sizzle to get read.
</P>
<P>
   Holding his hand at belt level, Glenn said, ``When I was a
senator I had a stack of reports on education reforms that was, no
kidding, this high.'' He said an aide would read each report and
give him a one- or two-sentence summary.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next four months the commission hopes to find a way
to sound the alarm about the poor quality of teaching and learning
in science and math and to suggest what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Its members have agreed on their diagnosis. Glenn put it this
way: ``When we see comparison after comparison that shows our
students dropping seriously behind other nations in math and
science, we know that eventually would mean that our people won't
have the best jobs in the world and we'd depend on other nations to
determine our standard of living.''
</P>
<P>
   But they haven't agreed on what to suggest as a cure.
</P>
<P>
   In groping toward a consensus on solutions, the commissioners
explored the benefits and drawbacks of several options this week.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many liked the idea of offering financial
incentives to 1 million teachers _ about a third of the public
school teaching force _ each summer to attend institutes or
academies at which they would study math, science and methods of
teaching those subjects.
</P>
<P>
   But other commissioners said that research shows that a
three-week or five-week summer course doesn't improve teaching
unless a district follows up by giving the teachers time to consult
weekly or even daily with each other during the regular school year
.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those countries where the kids learn more math and science
have national curriculums, but here we have 15,000 school
districts, each with its own curriculum,'' said Glenn. He noted
that his commission cannot issue orders to school boards.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Glenn said, ``One of our biggest challenges will be
convincing school board members to read our report.''

BRITNEY SPEARS FROM SCHOOL GIRL TO COQUETTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, May 14) By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Britney Spears is a tease. That's the gist of the title song
from her second album, ``Oops ... I Did It Again,'' due to be
released on Tuesday. After some introductory moans, the song tells
some poor sap that she didn't mean to make him think ``we're more
than just friends''; she temporarily lost her senses, but she
wasn't serious. The song is by no means an apology. It's a
near-boast punched home by the last line of the chorus: ``I'm not
that innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 18-year-old Spears it's also a carefully hedged bet, at
once knowing and deliberately vague. As the current queen of
teen-age pop, she's eager to grow up a little bit, yet she's not
about to alienate fans who are still in grade school. She's taking
her calculated step at a time when, across pop culture, the image
of the teen-age girl is up for grabs, drifting between girlish
innocence and adult desires.
</P>
<P>
   Things have moved fast in the mass-marketed portion of Spears'
adolescence. Her first album, ``... Baby One More Time,'' was
released last January; it ended with her singing ``The Beat Goes
on,'' declaring, ``We still dream of sharing our first kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, she always mentions how close she is to her
mother, with whom she has just collaborated on a book, ``Britney
Spears' Heart to Heart'' (Three Rivers Press/Random House). Sample
gush: ``I wanted to write this book so people could understand what
a special bond we have between us.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the album was shipping 12 million copies and Spears
was logging thousands of miles on tour, she quickly metamorphosed
from the pert parochial-school girl of her first video, ``... Baby
One More Time,'' into a coquette in hot pants and halter tops.
``Oops ...'' is a musical clone of ``... Baby One More Time,'' but
its video clip leaves high school behind. Spears makes her entrance
in three come-hither closeups: her unblinking eye, her glossy lips
and a pan up her torso, from thighs to chest, in a skintight red
suit. The clip ends with her on her back, writhing under the
camera's gaze.
</P>
<P>
   Spears is hoping to smoothly traverse a pop career's equivalent
of puberty: the no-fans'-land between the G-rated love songs of
teenypop and the sexually aware songs that could hold the attention
of an older, more lasting audience. Puberty is tough on everyone,
but in careers based on teenypop, maturation used to be the grim
reaper. Trying to have things both ways, Spears flaunts her body,
then insists she's only posing. In an interview in the current
issue of Rolling Stone, she says: ``I don't want to be part of
someone's `Lolita' thing. It kind of freaks me out.''
</P>
<P>
   If her actions contradict her words, she's not the only one
confused. Right now, there are no clear-cut expectations for a
teen-age girl coming of age. Sexual activity arrives early.
</P>
<P>
   A December 1999 study by the National Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse at Columbia University found that among
15-year-olds, 38 percent of girls and 45 percent of boys reported
they had engaged in sexual intercourse. For some junior-high-school
students, doctors report, oral sex takes place as casually as a
good-night kiss. Yet young girls, experienced or not, still show
soft hearts; they flock to soft-focus romantic movies and squeal
for the unthreatening blandishments of the Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Pop culture is as divided on girls' roles as any other
indicator. It dispenses a range of images from sticky-sweet to
coyly flirtatious to lethal. Yet the majority of young women's pop
hits, which were once feared as recruiting jingles for vice, are
now far tamer than television and movies.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Spears looks downright prissy by comparison to
television's most vivid teen-age character, Buffy the Vampire
Slayer. Buffy, now a college freshman, is petite but intrepid as
she protects all of humanity from an endless menagerie of demonic
forces. She also has an acknowledged sex life, despite its tendency
to lead to apocalyptic consequences. Sarah Michelle Gellar, who
plays Buffy, turned foul-mouthed for ``Cruel Intentions,'' the
teen-age remake of ``Dangerous Liaisons''; the results were
ludicrous, but the film showed that Hollywood isn't afraid to
portray teen-agers like sleazy adults. In films like ``American
Beauty'' and ``Election,'' Hollywood also shows baby boomers
lusting after high-schoolers; moaning and swiveling, Spears comes
across like Angela Hayes (played by Mena Suvari) in ``American
Beauty.'' She acts like she's been around but in the clinch, she's
still virginal.
</P>
<P>
   Recording companies have been restoring stereotypes from the
1950s and finding that they sell. There's a renewed racial divide;
while young black women like Lil' Kim or Aaliyah are allowed to be
salacious or openly lewd, white ones are, at most, mildly
suggestive (like Christina Aguilera soliciting foreplay in ``Genie
in a Bottle'').
</P>
<P>
   While boys can be as decorous or punky as they choose _ even
N'Sync, on its new album, sings about cybersex _ teen-age girls are
expected to be mannerly again. Recording companies have been
scouring the talent contests, kiddie shows and hinterlands for
girls who'll seem like sisters or pals to their prospective
audience.
</P>
<P>
   They have come up with singers like Hoku, the 18-year-old
daughter of Don Ho, whose hit, ``Another Dumb Blonde,'' is pure
bubblegum gone feisty: she tells a boy who's ``not really
interested in my heart or mind'' that she's seen through him and he
can go find another pushover. Then she spends the rest of her album
promising to give the guy she loves anything he needs.
</P>
<P>
   M2M, the duo of the 15-year-old Marion E. Ravn and the
16-year-old Marit E. Larsen, are no less dulcet but slightly more
revealing. In their native Norway, they used to sing children's
music; on ``Shades of Purple,'' they wrote their own songs (in
English) with some professional help, and their vignettes of puppy
love hint at real junior-high-school ups and downs. They tell a
grabby date, ``Don't say you love me/ You don't even know me'';
they confront a friend who's trying to steal a boyfriend in ``Don't
Mess With My Love''; they reveal insecurity about their looks and
choices in ``Girl of Your Dreams'' and ``Mirror Mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   Spears reveals glimmers of ambition on ``Oops ...'' She and her
producers clearly realized that her tight little voice is in the
same register as Michael Jackson's. Hoping to stir up ancestral
memories of blockbusters, they came up with freeze-dried versions
of the synthesizer orchestras on ``Thriller,'' and Spears clips
words like Jackson. (She has stopped trying to make her voice swoop
like Mariah Carey; that franchise has been taken over by Aguilera.)
Where Spears spent most of her debut album pining for a boyfriend,
``Oops ...'' starts with her acting a little tougher, fending
someone off in the title song, ``Stronger'' and ``Don't Go Knockin'
on My Door.''
</P>
<P>
   The older, more seasoned Spears is chafing _ mildly and with
premeditation _ against the constraints of being a nice girl. She
has a pierced navel now, and a little tattoo, and she talks back to
anyone who'd criticize her new wardrobe. In ``What U See (Is What U
Get),'' she tells someone, ``Now you think I'm wearing too much
makeup and my dress is too tight,'' then concludes, ``I can't be
nobody else and I like the way I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Her remake of the Rolling Stones' ``Satisfaction'' (with a
synthesizer arrangement out of Jackson's ``Billie Jean'') has new
lyrics that make it not an attack on commercialism or a sneer of
adolescent disgust, but the complaints of a picky shopper. ``When a
girl comes on and tells me how tight my skirt should be,'' Spears
chirps, ``she can't tell me who to be/ I've got my own identity.''
</P>
<P>
   With her crisply catchy, hitbound songs, Spears is seizing her
identity the way pop entrepreneurs want her to: as a consumer. She
can choose her skirt length and mascara; she can bump and grind and
pout. The freedom she wants is the freedom to package herself as
both a pop product and an object of desire. She'll have to grow up
some more to realize how many other ways a girl can assert herself.

<P>
   UNDATED _ The Texas Historical Commission says that Texas _ not
surprisingly, with 254 counties _ has more historic courthouses
than any other state. ``Today, more than 225 courthouses still
stand that are at least 50 years old,'' the commission says.
``About 80 were built before the turn of the century. Most of these
structures have deteriorated significantly due to either
abandonment, inadequate maintenance, insensitive modifications or a
combination of those problems.'' This month, the commission took a
major step in improving those conditions by awarding 19 grants to
counties for courthouse improvements. By ART CHAPMAN. Story has

   With `Friends' Like These . . .
</P>
<P>
   The names have changed on both sides, but the negotiations
between NBC and the stars of its top comedy show are definitely
moving into Yogi Berra territory: deja vu all over again.
</P>
<P>
   The network has less than a week to set its fall prime-time
schedule, and every prospective list of shows being drawn up this
week includes one Thursday night headed by ``Friends'' and another
in which that sitcom has gone away.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what NBC was forced to do four Mays ago, when
three co-stars of ``Seinfeld'' were holding out for $1 million an
episode. Now it's the six stars of ``Friends'' who are asking for
that price. The studio making the show is also the same, Warner
Bros., though every program executive from both the network and
studio has changed.
</P>
<P>
   One other factor is the same: NBC knows that even if it does not
conclude a successful negotiation with the stars, ``Friends'' will
not be going to another network. That was the case with
``Seinfeld'' too, because the network had a deal with Jerry
Seinfeld. In this case the network already has a deal with Warner
Bros. that ensures that no other network can buy the show out from
under NBC.
</P>
<P>
   So is there a real risk that ``Friends'' will not be back next
season? Few of those involved in the negotiations seem to think to.
As one senior executive put it, ``Nobody's walking around in a
panic over this.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees this is all about money, and money does not
usually kill deals when all sides have a vested interest in a
show's continuing. ``Friends,'' if not quite a ``Seinfeld,''
remains the strongest comedy on network television, both in terms
of ratings and critical appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, which had seen its ratings slide this season, clearly needs
the show. And Warner Bros., which would share the salary costs,
wants more episodes because it is making a fortune on syndication.
But perhaps neither network nor studio is desperate enough to pay
each of the six principal cast members $1 million an episode.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and Warner Bros. have reportedly pushed their offer into the
range of $600,000 each (the figure that the three ``Seinfeld''
co-stars ultimately accepted). The ``Friends'' actors, using the
leverage they know they have as the deadline of a new season
schedule draws near, are sticking to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The justification for the stars _ Lisa Kudrow, Courteney
Cox-Arquette, Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry and
Matt LeBlanc _ is that NBC was willing to play $1 million an
episode two season ago for the stars of ``Mad About You,'' perhaps
the biggest overpayment in television history. That series had one
disastrous season left.
</P>
<P>
   Far from making NBC more willing to pay however, the ``Mad About
You'' deal has left it gun-shy about paying so much. NBC would much
rather cite the ``Seinfeld'' precedent: the stars took the $600,000
an episode, and the show had one more year of huge ratings.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Seinfeld,'' there was some genuine concern from
NBC that a deal might collapse. But in this case the studio and
network seem convinced that the stars, who have not exactly lit up
Hollywood with their film work, cannot possibly turn down more than
$16 million each for a season's work.
</P>
<P>
   One senior executive predicted that the figure would reach
$700,000 each (that translates to a total of $16.8 million for each
actor for a 24-episode season) and that a deal would be reached,
possibly by Friday. NBC officially presents its schedule to
advertisers in New York on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is less clear for that other hit show held up in
negotiations with its star, Fox's ``X-Files.'' David Duchovny is
not holding out simply for money, but he has made clear that he is
less than thrilled about continuing with the show.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny also has a lawsuit over payment for reruns pending
against Fox, which complicates any deal. Fox is in the same
position as NBC in trying to plan a new schedule without knowing
what to put in on Sunday nights at 9.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome is truly uncertain. The show's other star, Gillian
Anderson, is signed for another year. Duchovny may opt to work only
a partial season.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely outcome now: ``The X-Files'' will be back but
not for a full season. Anderson's character, Scully, may have a
different partner for much of the season.

   Who Wants to Return?
</P>
<P>
   Looking to finish its season with yet another surge, ABC's ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' will stage a contest among past
big-money winners in the final week of the current sweep month.
Winners who took in at least $250,000 will be back in a tournament
starting on May 21. This time each contestant will split his
winnings with a charity.
</P>
<P>
   All three millionaire winners will be back, along with four of
the five who won $500,000. The rest of the spots will be filled
with $250,000 winners.

   For Graying Rock Fans
</P>
<P>
   As people move on with their lives, they tend to cling to the
musical tastes they had around age 30. Even as aging dogs learn new
tricks, they perform them to the same old score.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, VH1 has started a spinoff called VH1 Classic,
which features the videos of musical acts that appeal to an (ahem)
older audience: acts like the Rolling Stones, Michael Bolton and
Bruce Springsteen. The channel, whose debut was on Monday, is
currently available in only the 1 million homes that subscribe to
digital cable services. That number is expected to grow appreciably
in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   John Sykes, VH1's president, said that as popular music has
progressed, there has been less room for these baby-boomer acts on
VH1, which was conceived as a mellower, older sibling to the
brasher and louder MTV. But the definition of ``mellow'' has
changed considerably over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Where VH1 used to feature singers like Smokey Robinson and
Bolton, it is now a regular outlet for Metallica, the heavy-metal
group, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who have been known to
perform in the nude, save for strategically placed socks. Meanwhile
MTV is now a haven for the so-called boy bands _ teen-age idol
groups like 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys _ and the harder, new
rock acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at MTV now, they've had to make room for a lot of
young bands,'' Sykes said. ``So a lot have moved on to VH1's
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Sykes said that VH1 Classic was essentially taking over VH1's
original mission and was intended to serve its original audience,
which, Sykes said, has grown underserved as it has grown gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge audience out there of Americans raised on rock
'n' roll and R&AMP;B who we think are ready and waiting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But can they still dance?

HOW I CURED MY BOREDOM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (Eds: Sunny Vanderbeck is chief executive of Data Return, which
runs Web software. ) By SUNNY VANDERBECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm 27, and I spent the first years of my life on a farm outside
Fort Worth, Texas. I've always been curious. One time, when I was
4, I wanted to get into a locked room. So I got a screwdriver and
took the doorknob off.
</P>
<P>
   As I reached third grade, it became clear it was time for me to
go live with my dad. Dads tend to be a little bit more structured,
a little less touchy-feely. Still, school bored me. I'd get
discounted on a paper because I didn't follow the procedure. And
I'd say to the teachers, ``But I got to the answer faster.'' They
didn't care. My attitude was, ``whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   To satisfy my curiosity, I'd try things out. My freshman year in
high school, I was a member of ROTC. My sophomore year, I had a
mohawk. Later, I got early admission to the University of Texas at
Arlington. There were things I missed, like senior prom, but those
functions never held a lot of interest for me.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did college, it turned out. I remember writing PASCAL
computer programs that told you how much change _ pennies, nickels,
dimes _ you should return after a transaction. I was bored out of
my mind. So, like that Monty Python skit, I started thinking, ``And
now for something completely different.''
</P>
<P>
   I went to talk to the military recruiters. But none of the jobs
looked interesting except counterintelligence, and until you're
pretty senior in counterintelligence, you're basically a gofer. The
next day I realized I wanted to try to become an Airborne Ranger in
the Army. There aren't that many Rangers, and the washout rate is
tremendous. It sounded like an amazing challenge.
</P>
<P>
   After we had learned how to jump out of airplanes, we went into
the Ranger indoctrination program. These are basically three weeks
to see if you really want to be a Ranger or if you thought it
sounded cool. We crawled through the mud in the middle of the
night. We did push-ups until we couldn't push anymore and then
rolled over and did flutter kicks until we couldn't do any more and
then rolled back over and did push-ups.
</P>
<P>
   It was constant, incessant physical, mental and emotional
harassment. I wasn't bored anymore, that's for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Because I had done hunting as a kid, they made me a sniper.
Sometimes we'd get on a plane at dusk, go do something in another
country and be back at dawn. I never shot anyone, though. It was
almost all training exercises. You get this mindset that ``I'm a
Ranger.'' Everything else becomes irrelevant. But by the end of my
time, I would look at my bunkmate and think, ``Is his life worth a
mission that may not affect the quality of life in the United
States?'' I wasn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   Ranger school prepared me more than anything else for what I do
now _ managing in the controlled chaos of the Internet. If you can
execute a mission under stress and motivate people who are worn
down, then getting a group of people _ who did eat today and did
sleep last night _ aligned around a common vision is not that
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   After the Army, I went back to college, but I dropped out again
to take a job at Microsoft. Then, Microsoft made a hard left to
respond to the Internet. That drove me and two colleagues to start
our company. Our venture capitalists were our American Express and
Visa cards.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft taught us to focus on the long term. Our stock is
worth about a third of what it was in March. But we know we're
building something. A stock price is like climbing up a ladder with
a yo-yo. If you watch the yo-yo, you'll miss the big picture.

ONLINE AUCTIONS, EXHIBITS REDEFINE HOW AFICIONADOS APPRECIATE AND
BUY ART
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by ART-HOW TO and ART-WEB SITES) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW MARTON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The august auction house Sotheby's is all but giddy with
anticipation at the prospect of putting up for sale one of the 25
surviving first printings of the Declaration of Independence. The
estimated value of this rare bit of parchment is between $4 million
and $6 million dollars, and the auction house has already set its
sights on June 29 as the auction day. But don't expect Sotheby's
Manhattan bidding room to be buzzing with potential buyers.
Instead, the company will conduct the entire sale in pristine
silence via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online, we are about to auction off the single most important
printed piece of paper in the history of the world,'' says David
Redden, vice chairman of Sotheby's. ``I would say that is quite a
significant vote of confidence in the arrival of the Internet to
the art market.''
</P>
<P>
   From New York's largest museums and toniest galleries on Madison
Avenue to the cubbyholes of local art on Main Street, U.S.A., the
Internet has become one of the art market's most important channels
of communication and commerce to a diverse audience of museums,
dealers, collectors, private sellers, teachers, curators and
patrons. Though no one has the temerity to predict that the Net
will replace the physical interaction between artwork and art
admirer, many see it as the art world's fastest-rising lieutenant
in its battle to democratize an elitist field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's thanks to the Internet that art is available to anyone
who can get to a computer,'' says William Bartman, executive
director of Art Resources Transfer, a not-for-profit gallery in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   This past year was crucial in crystallizing the art market's
arrival online, as dozens of Web sites sprang up, covering nearly
all the major players in the art scene. Now it's pro forma that
major museums and galleries, museum shops, art suppliers,
appraisers and auction houses have ``dot-com'' affixed to their
name. Even framers carry the cybertattoo _ FrameYourArt.com, for
example, runs a special giveaway of a $300 ``antique reproduction
serigraph'' just for sampling its site.
</P>
<P>
   The entire gamut, from mass-generated posters to priceless
Picassos, is up for grabs online. Ever since San Diego-based The
Art Cellar Exchange went online in 1994 as the country's first
fine-art brokerage house, a steady flow of paintings, prints,
photographs, drawings and ceramics has been sold through
cyberspace. Now the growth has advanced to warp speed. Visualize
just reported doubling its revenue, number of customers, and pieces
of art sold, all in just a three-month period.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is that for people with money who are
addicted to buying art at galleries or at auction but who might
live in Silicon Valley or someplace where their choices are
limited, the Internet has become their medium,'' says Uta Scharf,
vice president of auction sales of artnet.com. ``And the anonymity
of it doesn't hurt either.''
</P>
<P>
   In this new exploding virtual art market, Web sites mimic
real-life events with their attendant hype. Artnet.com, one of the
more important online art sales and auction sites, staged an
``Icons of the 20th Century'' Net show last fall. Gathering works
from numerous leading galleries, artnet.com put on display iconic
works by Picasso, Rothko, Dali and Warhol, along with pop-cultural
touchstone images of Marilyn Monroe, Muhammad Ali and Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became quite a big candy store for online buyers,'' recalls
Scharf.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no firm has taken advantage of recent technological
breakthroughs in transmission speed as much as the Intel Corp.. The
high-tech chip manufacturer launched ArtMuseum.net, one of the
Net's most true-to-life ``blockbuster'' exhibitions of fine art,
basing its virtual exhibitions on the holdings of three museums:
Amsterdam's Van Gogh, New York's Whitney Museum of American Art,
and San Francisco's Museum of Modern Art. For ArtMuseum.net's ``Van
Gogh's Van Goghs'' 72-painting exhibit, it produced a 3-D effect
that created the illusion of the viewer moving through and around a
Van Gogh work.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every major museum has an Internet presence through its
proprietary Web site. In one of the splashiest endorsements, New
York's Museum of Modern Art and The Tate Gallery in London will
come together to start a commercial e-business. But commercial
transactions are but one need the Net is providing. It's also
serving as a cheap and convenient source of information for
potential museum visitors. The Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth's
Web site, for example, averages 3,700 hits per day and acts as one
of the museum's primary information vehicles to new and old
patrons.

<P>
   Lilly has also aggressively sought to discredit researchers who
published data linking its product to suicide. One of its early
targets was Dr. Martin Teicher, an associate professor of
psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a McLean Hospital
researcher, who wrote a crucial paper on the link between suicide
and Prozac in 1990; he found that 3.5 percent of patients put on
Prozac either attempt or commit suicide due to severe agitation
from akathisia. As a result of Lilly's campaign, many in the
psychiatric community say they believe Teicher has distanced
himself from his original work. But in a rare interview with the
Globe, Teicher said that he stood by his work, and that the ability
of Prozac to induce suicide in a minority of patients ``is a real
phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Teicher, Barberich, and Young filed their patent for the new
Prozac in August 1993, the same year Teicher published another
report, this one in the journal Drug Safety titled ``Antidepressant
Drugs and the Emergence of Suicidal Tendencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper was a direct challenge to data reported in the March
1991 issue of the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry by Drs. Maurizio
Fava and Jerrold Rosenbaum of Massachusetts General Hospital. Their
study found no significant difference in ``suicidal ideation'' in
patients treated with fluoxetine compared to those receiving other
antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   Teicher wrote in his 1993 paper that Fava and Rosenbaum's
statistics were flawed. Using Fava and Rosenbaum's data, Teicher
came to the opposite conclusion: namely, that patients on Prozac
were at least three times more likely to become suicidal than those
on older antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA came up with similar results even before Teicher
published his 1993 data. Dr. David Graham, chief of the FDA's
Epidemiology Branch, wrote on Sept. 11, 1990, that Lilly's data on
suicide and Prozac, as well as the Fava and Rosenbaum study, were
insufficient to prove that Prozac was safe. In an internal FDA
memo, Graham wrote: ``Because of apparent large-scale
underreporting, the firm's analysis cannot be considered as proving
that fluoxetine and violent behavior are unrelated.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Prozac Backlash''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now a decade later, Lilly has targeted Dr. Joseph Glenmullen,
whose book ``Prozac Backlash'' has apparently incensed Lilly
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Glenmullen, a clinical instructor in psychiatry at Harvard
Medical School and a clinician at the Harvard University Health
Services, says he wrote the book because he was alarmed by the
number of patients who were reporting severe side effects from the
serotonin-boosting antidepressants including Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft,
and Luvox. ``The two most upsetting side effects were patients
becoming suicidal on the drugs, and the development of disfiguring
facial tics,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   After obtaining hundreds of pages of FDA documents through the
Freedom of Information Act, as well as internal Lilly memos that
are part of the public record in lawsuits filed against the drug
company, Glenmullen wrote that Lilly had tried to downplay side
effects of Prozac for years.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly alerted newspapers and TV stations to the book and began a
campaign to discredit the author, saying that Harvard Medical
School professors were unfamiliar with his work and didn't
recognize his name. Glenmullen, a graduate of Harvard Medical
School, is one of 415 clinical instructors in medicine at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blast from a critic
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chief among Glenmullen's critics is Mass. General's Rosenbaum, a
professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who, in a
written statement sent to the Globe calls ``Prozac Backlash'' a
``dishonest book'' that is `` manipulative'' and ``mischievous.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rosenbaum's objectivity has also been questioned. Not only
was his 1991 study on Prozac and suicide criticized by at least two
sets of researchers as well as the FDA, documents obtained by the
Globe show that Rosenbaum's relationship to Lilly is a cozy one: he
has served as a Prozac researcher and sat on a marketing advisory
panel for Lilly before Prozac was launched.
</P>
<P>
   When asked in an interview why he was speaking out against
Glenmullen's book, Rosenbaum said that the suicide controversy was
``old news'' and that the book presents the information as new
research. He noted that akathisia is ``pretty rare'' and that ``it
doesn't occur more than in people given a placebo.''
</P>
<P>
   But because there is no official reporting system for drug side
effects, no one knows how common drug side effects are, said Larry
Sasich, a research analyst at Public Citizen in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no active surveillance system to look at adverse
events,'' he said. ``Unless something very unfortunate happens and
a large number of people are harmed in a unique way, no one is
going to look at it; nobody ever puts two and two together.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sepracor's patent
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, the Federal Trade Commission opened the way for
Lilly to market Teicher's, Barberich's, and Young's new Prozac, for
which Sepracor holds the patent. The new Prozac, R-fluoxetine, is a
modified form of an ingredient found in Prozac, which, according to
Sepracor, not only has fewer side effects but more potential uses
and benefits than the original.
</P>
<P>
   In making the decision, the FTC rejected arguments from its
lawyers and the generic drug industry that the agreement unfairly
limits generic Prozac competition.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Sepracor press release dated April 13, the
company will receive an upfront payment and license fee of $20
million from Lilly and an additional $70 million based on the
progression of the drug. Sepracor will receive royalties, and in
exchange, Lilly will get the exclusive world rights to R-fluoxetine
for all indications and uses. Lilly will be responsible for the
development of the drug, regulatory submissions, product
manufacturing, marketing and sales, according to the release.
</P>
<P>
   Glenmullen wonders whether the new Prozac will, in fact, be
little more than an effort to prolong the life of a product with a
soon-to-expire patent. Although it is touted as having fewer side
effects, no one knows what effects may surface once large numbers
of people begin taking it for months or years. In the epilogue to
his book, he simply says: ``Like any new drug, it too will be an
ongoing experiment.''

   &UR;  &LR; BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ With scores of pinstriped businessmen
milling about the hotel ballroom, it looked like any other
shareholders' meeting.

   Auditors from Arthur Andersen hovered in the background, while
stockholders called brokers on mobile phones and scrutinized the
figures in the glossy annual report.
</P>
<P>
   But when the meeting was called to order, the first piece of
business was a song. A sheet of lyrics in Arabic was distributed
for the few who did not already know the words. Everyone rose, and
with swelling emotion sang every verse of ``My Homeland,'' the
unofficial Palestinian national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our first annual meeting on Palestinian soil, and I
tell you, it is giving me goose bumps,'' whispered Munib Masri, the
dapper chairman of Padico, the fastest-growing Palestinian business
conglomerate, before the assembly began.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel ballroom opened onto the elegantly reconstructed rear
plaza of an Ottoman merchant's villa, which in its century-long
life has also served as a school, a hospital, and a tear-gassed
battleground between Israeli security forces and rock-throwing
Palestinian youths. The building long known to Bethlehemites as the
Jasir Palace has now been transformed by Padico into an
Intercontinental hotel, the first five-star hotel owned and
operated by Palestinians on Palestinian-governed territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hotel is not just for this company, but for all of our
people,'' Ahmed Krei, the former Palestine Liberation Organization
guerrilla leader better known as Abu Ala, proclaimed to the Padico
stockholders. Now the speaker of the Palestinian Legislative
Council and one of Yasser Arafat's closest confidants, Krei joined
the board members on the dais, and praised Padico for ``imposing
its private sector style on the development of Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the company's endeavors was everywhere around him.
The ubiquitous cell phones operated on a network run by Paltel, a
private telecommunications monopoly that is 25 percent owned by
Padico. The investors assembled in their new hotel were a
cross-section of the emerging Palestinian business elite, some of
whom had traveled from Jordan and the United States and the Persian
Gulf. (Padico's biggest stockholder, Prince Waleed bin Talal, the
Saudi mega-billonaire, who didn't show, is one of the few
non-Palestinians.) They have made Padico and Paltel the largest
companies on the nascent Palestinian stock exchange _ which itself
is one of Padico's several subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   This was perhaps not the Palestine of the future envisioned by
either critics or champions of the PLO when the Palestinian
National Authority came into being six years ago. But in what Masri
proudly described to shareholders as ``a partnership'' with
Arafat's state-in-waiting, he and his colleagues have turned the
autonomous Palestinian territory into the most privatized economy
in the Middle East. The phone company, the airline, the new power
company, the banking and insurance industry _ all are privately
owned, and most have some connection to Padico.
</P>
<P>
   Despite flat profits, it was been a good year for Padico. Share
prices climbed steadily after a stock split. The number of
shareholders doubled, to 1,700. New enterprises got underway,
ranging from housing projects to factories to a Gaza Strip power
plant. But when executives reported on these ventures they stressed
not profits and losses but their contribution to the creation of a
Palestinian state. And while shareholders quizzed board members on
what they saw as the peculiarities of Padico's dividends policy,
discussions dealt as much with politics and national aspirations as
with finances and investment.
</P>
<P>
   Krei particularly congratulated Padico on its expanding network
of industrial parks, noting that they have been built as close as
possible to the green line _ the boundary between Israel and the
then-Jordanian West Bank before the 1967 war. ``Putting industrial
zones on the borders of the green line creates political and
economic facts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bethlehem Intercontinental, just minutes from Israeli West
Jerusalem, is the company's latest showcase. Previous stockholder
meetings were held in Amman _ in part because of Israeli visa
difficulties for some Palestinian investors, and in part because
the company didn't believe it had an adequate local venue. This
year's meeting was the first chance to show off the new hotel to
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the cool interior plaza, with a new fountain burbling
beneath ancient shade trees and waiters serving Middle Eastern
sweets, the memory of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule
seemed almost impossibly distant. But immediately behind the hotel
_ within full view of its $200-a-night rooms _ are the rutted roads
and ramshackle dwellings of the Ayda refugee camp, long a locus of
Palestinian unrest. Just down the street is Rachel's Tomb, a Jewish
pilgrimage site heavily guarded by Israeli soldiers in one of their
few remaining enclaves in Palestinian-ruled Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   This combustible combination still occasionally erupts into
confrontation, sending wafts of pepper spray past the Jasir
Palace's sand-blasted stone facade.
</P>
<P>
   The classic Third World contrast of a deluxe hotel abutting an
impoverished and militant neighborhood seems not to faze local
residents, for whom the project provided construction jobs, or the
Palestinian leadership, who laud it as a symbol of national
achievement. A bit behind schedule _ Arafat once hoped to play host
to the pope here _ the partly opened hotel was the scene of a
reception last month for Jiang Zemin, the president of China.
``This creates a good impression for Palestine among world
leaders,'' Krei said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's next luxury hotel project is a beachfront resort
in the Gaza Strip, not normally thought of as a tourist
destination. As in Bethlehem, the hotel will rise next to a United
Nations-administered Palestinian refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to welcome you all there in two years,'' Masri told his
shareholders.

<P>
   Just as the 14-year patent on Prozac is about to expire and the
drug's maker, Eli Lilly and Co., is preparing to launch a new
version, a body of evidence has come to light revealing the
antidepressant's dark side.
</P>
<P>
   The company's internal documents, some dating to the mid-1980s,
as well as government applications and patents, indicate that the
pharmaceutical giant has known for years that its best-selling drug
could cause suicidal reactions in a small but significant number of
patients. The reports could become critical as Lilly seeks
government approval for its new Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   --Internal documents show that in 1990, Lilly scientists were
pressured by corporate executives to alter records on physician
experiences with Prozac, changing mentions of suicide attempt to
``overdose'' and suicidal thoughts to ``depression.''
</P>
<P>
   --Three years before Prozac received approval by the US Food and
Drug Administration in late 1987, the German BGA, that country's
FDA equivalent, had such serious reservations about Prozac's safety
that it refused to approve the antidepressant based on Lilly's
studies showing that previously nonsuicidal patients who took the
drug had a fivefold higher rate of suicides and suicide attempts
than those on older antidepressants, and a threefold higher rate
than those taking placebos.
</P>
<P>
   --Lilly's own figures, in reports made available to the Globe,
indicate that 1 in 100 previously nonsuicidal patients who took the
drug in early clinical trials developed a severe form of anxiety
and agitation called akathisia, causing them to attempt or commit
suicide during the studies.
</P>
<P>
   --Though Lilly has steadfastly defended the drug's safety and
downplayed studies linking Prozac to suicide, the patent for the
new Prozac, R-fluoxetine, expected to be marketed by Lilly
beginning in 2002, notes that the new version will not produce
several existing side effects including ``akathisia, suicidal
thoughts, and self-mutilation,'' which the patent calls ``one of
its more significant side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   --A McLean Hospital researcher and associate professor at
Harvard Medical School, Dr. Martin Teicher, whose early 1990s
studies linked Prozac to akathisia and suicide, is a co-inventor of
the new Prozac, which Lilly plans to market, along with Timothy J.
Barberich, the CEO of Sepracor Inc., a Marlborough, Mass. drug
company, and James W. Young.
</P>
<P>
   --A just-published book, ``Prozac Backlash,'' by a Cambridge
psychiatrist, Dr. Joseph Glenmullen, has drawn Lilly's ire for
discussing Prozac's link to suicide, tics, withdrawal symptoms, and
other side effects of Prozac and similar antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly officials continue to defend the drug's effectiveness,
saying its track record is borne out by the fact it is still the
most widely prescribed drug of its kind. In a written statement,
Jeff Newton, a Lilly spokesman, said: ``There is no credible
evidence that establishes a causal link between Prozac and violent
or suicidal behavior. There is, to the contrary, scientific
evidence showing that Prozac and medicines like it actually protect
against such behaviors.''
</P>
<P>
   Using figures on Prozac both from Lilly and independent
research, however, Dr. David Healy, an expert on the brain's
serotonin system and director of the North Wales Department of
Psychological Medicine at the University of Wales, estimated that
``probably 50,000 people have committed suicide on Prozac since its
launch, over and above the number who would have done so if left
untreated.''
</P>
<P>
   Healy, meanwhile, is conducting a new study that he says is the
first of its kind, giving antidepressants to healthy people to
study possible links to suicide. The results are expected to be
published in June.
</P>
<P>
   Prozac's success is certainly unquestioned. The introduction of
the drug to the US market in the late 1980s changed the way
Americans viewed their most intimate emotions and limitations.
Billed as a wonder drug to combat depression by boosting levels of
the brain chemical serotonin, Prozac and others like it were also
said to remedy a host of human frailties from poor self-esteem and
concentration to fear of rejection.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last year, more than 35 million people worldwide
were using the drug, which provided Lilly with more than 25 percent
of its $10 billion in 1999 revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the problems with Prozac were known even before it was
introduced to the US market. Figures in a 1984 Lilly document
indicated that akathisia, the severe agitation that can lead to
suicide, occurs in at least 1 percent of patients, a level
considered a ``frequent'' event, and as such must be disclosed in a
company's product literature and package inserts. But there is no
such disclosure in Prozac's US literature, and it is not clear
whether the FDA panel charged with approving Prozac simply
overlooked or did not have access to certain critical data of
Lilly's.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, researchers say that most US doctors do not know to
warn patients of the potentially dangerous effect which, according
to published literature on the topic, can be alleviated with
sedatives or by going off the drug.
</P>
<P>
   German regulators, who eventually approved Prozac for use in
that country, require a warning label about the risk of suicide and
suggest the concurrent use of sedatives when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Akathisia is listed in Lilly's US product literature, but as an
infrequent event in Prozac users. No mention is made of its
potential relationship to suicide.
</P>
<P>
   A relationship, however, was found in a Globe search of US
patents. The patent for the new Prozac or R-fluoxetine (US Patent
no. 5,708,035), which Lilly will market after the existing patent
expires in 2001, contains a wealth of information about the
original Prozac. According to the patent, the new Prozac will
decrease side effects of the existing Prozac such as headaches,
nervousness, anxiety, and insomnia, as well as ``inner restlessness
(akathisia), suicidal thoughts and self-mutilation'' _ the same
effect Lilly has contended has not occurred in any substantial way
in some 200 lawsuits against it over the past decade. Most of the
suits were settled out of court and the terms kept confidential.

A 1990 communique
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an electronic communique obtained by author Glenmullen dated
Nov. 13, 1990, from Claude Bouchy, a Lilly employee in Germany, to
three Lilly corporate executives at the company's Indianapolis
headquarters, Bouchy says he and a colleague ``have problems with
the directions our safety people are getting from the corporate
group (Drug Epidemiology Unit) and requesting that we change the
identification of events as they are reported by the physicians. .
. . Our safety staff is requested to change the event term `suicide
attempt' (as reported by the physician) to `overdose.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bouchy continued that ``. . . it is requested that we change . .
. `suicidal ideation' to `depression.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And then Bouchy makes an appeal to his US Lilly colleagues: ``I
do not think I could explain to the BGA, to a judge, to a reporter
or even to my family why we would do this especially on the
sensitive issue of suicide and suicide ideation. At least not with
the explanations that have been given to our staff so far.''

   BUSH-MCCAIN (Pittsburgh) _ Citing common goals and shared values
that transcended any of the bitterness between them, Sen. John
McCain at last endorsed Gov. George W. Bush on Tuesday and pledged
to help the de facto Republican presidential nominee achieve what
he had wanted so badly for himself: a seat behind the desk in the
Oval Office. His announcement, which came immediately on the heels
of a 90-minute private meeting with Bush, heralded a new phase in a
rocky political relationship that went from remarkable amity in
December to extraordinary animosity in March and a tense, delicate
dance of reconciliation over the last month and a half. By Frank

   EBAY-AUCTION (Undated) _ Developments in the bidding on eBay for
a painting many speculate may be by Richard Diebenkorn, a
California painter known for his sublime use of color in abstract
and representational works. Plus a talk with the seller, known on
the Internet as ``golfpoorly.'' By Judith H. Dobrynski.

   SIERRA-LEONE (Freetown, Sierra Leone) _ After a night of
looting, the abandoned house of Foday Sankoh, the rebel leader
whose whereabouts remained a mystery Tuesday, had been stripped of
almost everything Tuesday morning. Looters had left gaping holes in
the brick walls where air-conditioners had kept out West Africa's
stifling heat, and they had absconded with every piece of
furniture, clothes and item of value. What the looters had chosen
to leave behind was perhaps a suitable metaphor for Sierra Leone's
present sad state. By Norimitsu Onishi.

   RUSSIA-IRAN-MISSILES (St. Petersberg, Russia) _ As concerns
mount in the United States and Israel that Iran's secretive missile
and nuclear weapons programs could pose new threats in the region,
the case of Yuri P. Savelyev, a leading Russian missile scientist
who persisted in his efforts to aid the Iranians in the face of
official sanction, illustrates the behind-the-scenes cooperation
between the Russian and American governments to stem the flow of
missile technologies to Iran. But at the same time, it also reveals
the deep-seated resistance within the Russian military and security
establishment against abandoning Russia's ``strategic`` role in
cultivating clients and lucrative contracts for transferring
military science and technology. By Patrick Tyler.

   INTERNET-BATTLEGROUND (Undated) _ Today the fight is over
digital music, but tomorrow the legal battle over copying
information via the Internet is certain to shift to video and
software. At stake in the coming information war is the power and
perhaps the very business of some of the world's largest media
companies. The software underlying the ability to copy information
via the Internet is evolving rapidly, setting the stage for a much
larger confrontation over the ability to freely and almost
instantly copy any kind of digital information _ music, video,
software or documents _ to any location on the globe. And the new
technology will make it more difficult, perhaps impossible, to stop
the worldwide sharing of data. By John Markoff.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ELAZIG, Turkey _ Groves of mulberry trees at lakeside resorts
are about all that remains from the days when this region was a
center of Armenian life.
</P>
<P>
   One of the gnarled trees used to stand beside a long-gone
Armenian Orthodox church. Now it shades Tahire Cakirbay, 66, as she
looks out over her fields and shimmering Lake Hazar below.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took the Armenians up there and killed them,'' Cakirbay
said, pointing to a hill above her. ``They dug a hole for the
bodies. My parents told me.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million Armenians lived in what is now eastern
Turkey until their community was shattered in an orgy of ethnic
violence that exploded 85 years ago this spring. Many aspects of
what happened then are still hotly debated, but here where the
killings took place, few people doubt they occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't teach it in school, but if you're interested there
are plenty of ways you can find out,'' said Yasemin Orhan, a native
of Elazig who graduated from the local university last year. ``Many
Armenians were killed. It's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Orhan said she had learned about the killings from her
grandmother. Here in eastern Turkey, the passage of several
generations has not been enough to wipe them from memory.
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of the country, however, most people know little
about the killings of 1915. Turkish textbooks refer to them only
indirectly. They stress that Armenian militants were rebelling
against the crumbling Ottoman Empire, and discount or ignore the
killing of hundreds of thousands of civilians after the abortive
revolt.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts over how to deal with this episode have provoked a
worldwide propaganda war between Armenia and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Armenian lobbyists want foreign governments to declare that what
happened in 1915 was genocide. Some Armenian nationalists say that
if Turkey can be forced to concede this, their next step might be
to claim reparations or demand the return of land once owned by
Armenians.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish diplomats resolutely resist these efforts. They assert
that Muslims as well as Christians were killed here in 1915, and
that it is unfair to blame only one side.
</P>
<P>
   To most Turks, the events of 1915 seem distant, but in the
Armenian consciousness, they are a vivid and constant presence.
Awareness of what is simply called ``the genocide'' is acute in
Armenian communities around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Often it is accompanied by fierce anger at Turkey's
recalcitrance.
</P>
<P>
   This anger boiled over into violence during the 1970s and '80s,
when a group calling itself Commandos of the Armenian Genocide
mounted a campaign against representatives of the Turkish
government. It killed Turkish diplomats in the United States and
elsewhere, and bombed targets including the Turkish Airlines
counter at Orly Airport in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the battle has shifted back to the diplomatic arena.
Each spring, foreign leaders issue carefully worded commemorations
of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Last month President Clinton issued a proclamation recalling ``a
great tragedy of the twentieth century: the deportations and
massacres of roughly one and a half million Armenians in the final
years of the Ottoman Empire.'' He did not use the word
``genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year Turkey has greatly improved its relations with
Greece, but there has been little progress with Armenia. The two
countries feud over a variety of political issues, but the wound
that 1915 has cut into the Armenian psyche also plays an emotional
role in keeping them apart.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, some of the first efforts toward
reconciliation between Turks and Armenians have begun. One was a
conference of Turkish, Armenian and American scholars who met at
the University of Chicago to begin a joint inquiry into the events
of 1915.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the most difficult paper I have ever written in my
life,'' one of the participants, Selim Deringil, a historian at
Bosporus University in Istanbul, said before presenting his
analysis of Turkish-Armenian relations. ``Venturing into the
Armenian crisis is like wandering into a minefield.''
</P>
<P>
   The scholars who gathered at Chicago plan to meet again. Another
group plans to open a series of conferences later this spring in
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   In a different kind of gesture, seven Turkish and Armenian
women, all in their 20s, have joined to plan a civic campaign aimed
at improving relations between their peoples. The group's first
project will be raising money to restore an Armenian church near
Van, a city in eastern Turkey that was once an Armenian capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of thing has never been tried before,'' said one of
the organizers, Safak Pavey, a Turkish journalist. ``We want to
give an example of unity between two peoples who lived together for
a long time but became alienated from each other. It's about
restoring a church as a way of restoring souls.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The area around Elazig is just one of the places where Armenians
were killed by Ottoman soldiers and Kurdish tribesmen during the
spring and summer of 1915. But because several foreigners were
living in the area and recorded what they saw, the killings here
are unusually well documented.
</P>
<P>
   One of the foreigners was a U.S. consul, Leslie Davis, who took
a trip around Lake Hazar, then known as Lake Golcuk, after the
massacres. ``Thousands and thousands of Armenians, mostly helpless
women and children, were butchered on its shores and barbarously
mutilated,'' he later wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Armenian houses, churches and schools in this area have long
since been destroyed or allowed to collapse. New villages have
sprung up along the lake. Residents picnic under the mulberry trees
that Armenians planted around their summer homes a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is still possible to find artifacts of Armenian life here. At
one antique shop near Elazig, $250 will buy a heavy copper serving
tray inscribed with the name of its former owner in distinctive
Armenian script.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, a couple of men were discovered digging at what
they believed to be a former Armenian cemetery. They were
apparently looking for gold that, according to local lore, was
often interred with wealthy Armenians.
</P>
<P>
   Nevzat Gonultas, manager of a telephone substation on the
lakeshore, is considered a local historian because his father spent
many hours telling him stories from the past. Like most people
around here _ although unlike their brethren in other parts of
Turkey _ he knows what happened in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other people don't know because they don't live here,''
Gonultas said as he sipped tea on a recent evening. ``My father
told me that Turkey was weak at that time and the Armenians decided
to stage an uprising. Then the order came to kill them. Almost all
were killed. It wasn't a war, it was a massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish authorities do not accept this version, and many
Turks never hear it. A historical atlas issued by a leading Turkish
newspaper does not show that much of this region was under Armenian
rule for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   At historical sites in this region, signs and brochures often
discount or omit facts about the earlier Armenian presence.
According to one new travel book, ``guards are under instruction to
eavesdrop on tourist guides who might be tempted to tell another
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who seeks to learn about the events in 1915, however,
need only come here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This used to be an Armenian area, but now they're gone,'' said
a factory worker named Selhattin Cinar. ``Dead, killed, chased
away. Our government doesn't want to admit it. Why would you want
to say, `My yogurt is sour'?''

TECHNOLOGY MADE MIKE FIGGIS' ANTI-TECH FILM POSSIBLE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Figgis has never made easy, accessible films. Even his
best-known work, ``Leaving Las Vegas,'' centered on a suicidal
alcoholic and a prostitute. But with his just-released
``Timecode,'' Figgis uses state-of-the art digital technology to
play with our notions of storytelling, indeed, our idea of how a
film is created.
</P>
<P>
   Where events in most films unfold linearly on a single screen,
Figgis splits it into four quadrants, each devoted to one of four
cameras that simultaneously filmed an interlocking story from four
different perspectives in one improvised, uncut 93-minute shoot.
</P>
<P>
   To direct the audience's attention from quadrant to quadrant,
Figgis uses sound as a pointer, emphasizing the audio from one or
more of the screens at a time. It could drive you crazy, but in a
multitasking world, a multitasking movie seems logical.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the great things about the movie,'' said actor
Julian Sands, a long-time Figgis collaborator who plays a masseur
in the film. ``Your brain can handle multiple views much more than
you suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   Figgis says he took a most unusual path in creating the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Its unusual structure started with his frustration over the
repeated, rapid obsolescence of so many of the software programs
and pieces of technology that he was using in making movies, music,
photography and writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of years ago, I realized I couldn't keep
reprogramming myself,'' Figgis said. ``You work your way through
some project, then go to use the program on a new project and they
tell you it doesn't work anymore, but they have a newer, better
program over here that you can use instead,'' Figgis said.
</P>
<P>
   That reality belies what he calls ``the fantasy of digital
perfection,'' and only by seeing through the fantasy, he said, was
he able to create ``Timecode.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a short period where I crossed a line in my own head of
understanding digital technology,'' Figgis said. ''One becomes
addicted to the idea that they have to be using software across the
board. My realization was that that was bull.''
</P>
<P>
   So Figgis went back to some of the analog tools that had served
him well before he became a techno-addict. He was already half
there, given his affection for such well-made analog possessions as
his wristwatch, fountain pen collection and Leica camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Photoshop (the powerful photo-editing software from
Adobe), but I wouldn't want to get rid of my Leica,'' said Figgis.
``These things function beautifully and don't have to be
continually updated. Functional equipment is fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   So he resurrected a most functional piece of equipment, the
sprawling artist portfolios that he calls his notebooks, and on
which he scribbles bits of dialogue, storyboards, musical
fragments, script ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Those notebooks are more accommodating of his polymathic
creative urges than a computer screen and, unlike most computer
programs, will still be easily accessible 10 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   He also began thinking about the capabilities of another beloved
old tool, a Super 16mm movie camera.
</P>
<P>
   Initially he thought about using two of those cameras to follow
a couple, telling their story through extended shots of as long as
20 minutes. Over time, his idea grew, to four cameras, four people
and unedited shots as long as an entire feature.
</P>
<P>
   But such a choice in artistic structure dictated other choices,
such as what camera he would use. Only one camera, a Sony digital
video model typically used for industrial videos, could run the
90-minute-plus shots needed for Figgis' idea.
</P>
<P>
   The structure also dictated Figgis' choice of scriptwriting
tools, because scriptwriting programs couldn't handle what Figgis
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you have to invent a system of tablature that lets you
write in quadraphonic,'' Figgis said. He dug out another very old
tool, musical staff paper, pasted sheets of it together, and broke
it into 95 bars, roughly one bar per minute of running time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the highest devices man ever came up with,''
Figgis said of the staff paper.
</P>
<P>
   Only staff paper could be broken up into four staves,
synchronized in time, just as the movie's structure demanded,
Figgis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I mapped out all the big beats,'' Figgis said, using different
colored pens to show what each main character was doing, and before
which camera. To Figgis, the result was more like a musical
composition than a movie screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   The actors then improvised their lines off that general
composition in a way that Sands said ''was like a jazz performance.
It was very loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen times over nine days, the very big band of cast and crew
riffed through that composition in tightly synchronized
performances. Eventually, Figgis settled on one performance, the
last, for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   None of this would have been possible without his digital tools.
But just as important were the non-digital tools, and a different
relationship with technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it a liberation that you don't have to do it all the
digital way,'' said Figgis. ``Why put your energy into competing
against something that's not broken? Why not put the energy into
something that's never been done before, like the little camera
that can be used to shoot an entire film?''
</P>
<P>
   Technology has many uses, Figgis said, but a creative person has
to keep it in its place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone over 30 has to deal with the paranoia of never feeling
like they're able to keep up,'' Figgis said. ``The train keeps
going faster. But I'm still going to write a script on paper. I
love it. I also have a really interesting relationship of equality
now (with technology). I deeply respect it. I'm so charmed by it
now.''!end!

 &HT;     McCAIN POSITIONS HIMSELF FOR 2004   
 &HT;     A News Analysis   
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican John McCain positioned himself for a
possible presidential bid in 2004 with his belated and begrudging
endorsement of presumptive GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The defeated Republican challenger embraced the two-term Texas
governor just warmly enough to escape blame if Bush loses to Vice
President Al Gore in the presidential election in November.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain signaled that his hard-hitting populist insurgency is
merely sidelined _ and not scuttled _ by his defeat at the hands of
Bush's privately funded $68 million juggernaut in the GOP
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Senior McCain campaign aides say that they expect the three-term
senator from Arizona to seek the White House four years from now if
Bush loses the race in November.
</P>
<P>
   McCain promised to campaign ``enthusiastically'' for Bush to
help ``restore integrity and honor to the White House'' _ a task
that he said Bush ``can do that more than adequately.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain offered his arms' length endorsement with the reluctance
and pained body language of an ailing schoolboy ordered to swallow
a bitter tasting remedy. He agreed with a reporter's
characterization that making the endorsement was like ``taking
medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain rejected in advance any invitation to join Bush's ticket
as the vice presidential running mate who could rally the fractious
Republican party and broaden the ticket's appeal to the
middle-of-the-road independents and conservative Democrats who
flocked to McCain's candidacy in the early presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked that I not be considered for vice president of the
United States,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush replied: ``I take him for his word.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a reporter's question at a Bush-McCain news conference
during their fence-mending summit in Pittsburgh to elicit the word
``endorse'' from McCain, a 63-year-old former Navy pilot and
Vietnam prisoner of war who waged a hard-hitting challenge against
Bush, the 53-year-old son of former President George H.W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Only when asked why he had ``difficulty'' using the word
endorsement did McCain actually declare that he was endorsing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I endorse Gov. Bush,'' McCain repeated seven times in
rapid-fire succession, triggering laughter across his audience of
campaign staffers and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Bush quickly seized the elusive political trophy, nonetheless
with the quip: ``By the way, I enthusiastically accept.''
</P>
<P>
   At their joint news conference, McCain and Bush said they agreed
on the need to overhaul education, the armed forces, the
health-care system and the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   As McCain put it: ``We're in agreement on a lot more issues than
which we are in disagreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet disagreements abound. Bush favors a larger tax cut than does
McCain, who says he wants to use the federal budget surplus to
paying down the national debt and strengthening Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes and McCain favors banning the unregulated,
unlimited soft money contributions that corporations, unions,
special interest groups and wealthy individuals give to political
parties to help get the message out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not give up on the reform agenda,'' McCain vowed with a
tone of defiance in his voice. ``I want to emphasize one more time
_ and I made it very clear to Gov. Bush _ I will continue to pursue
the issues of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest nationwide survey, a Gallup Poll for CNN and USA
Today, showed Tuesday that Bush leads Gore 35 percent to 28
percent, with 26 percent saying they had ``no opinion'' on the
candidates at this point in the race.
</P>
<P>
   William Schneider, a political scientist at the American
Enterprise Institute, says that McCain had to join forces with Bush
``to show Republicans that he is a team player so that if George
Bush loses, McCain can be the one that Republicans turn to.''
</P>
<P>
   Were McCain to continue to spurn appeals for party unity, he
would remain ``an anathema to Republicans _ an invader from Mars _
with no hope of ever becoming president,'' Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of
Virginia, says McCain's post primaries' defiance had already gone
too far.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is ``the worst loser'' since Sen. Eugene McCarthy,
D-Minn., carried his unyielding anti-Vietnam war crusade into the
tumultuous Democratic convention in Chicago in 1968, Sabato said.
The furor sullied the Democratic nomination won by Vice President
Hubert Humphrey and contributed to Humphrey's subsequent defeat by
Republican Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``With McCain we'll have to watch what he does _ not listen to
what he says,'' Sabato says. McCain must ``go all out for Bush'' or
he will bear some blame for any Bush defeat, Sabato warned, adding:
``If McCain is held accountable for Bush's loss in November, he's
toast in 2004.''

   ``There are a number of international visitors who certainly
wouldn't make a trip here without doing some advance research about
us, and these days they are doing that kind of research on the
Net,'' says Carri Ann Wantuchowicz, public information officer at
the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The individual Web sites for smaller galleries constitute yet
another tentacle reaching out to the art community, emitting a
snowballing amount of information. Fort Worth's William Campbell
Contemporary Art gallery has a link with artnet.com. After shelling
out a start-up fee of $3,500 and a $100 monthly maintenance cost,
Campbell is represented with a five-page site among artnet.com's
other galleries.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Flatbed Press and Galleries, which specializes in
fine art prints, etchings and woodcuts, has joined Guild.com, a
sprawling fine arts Web site. Flatbed discovered that if an
Internet customer is seeking, for example, the etching
``Self-portrait'' by Luis Jimenez and it is in Flatbed's
collection, that client can click on the Flatbed gallery link from
Guild.com or search out the Jimenez print by entering the artist's
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is most common is that someone will be looking for a
particular artist but never have heard of Flatbed, and they come to
Guild.com, ... and we will hopefully have a stock of that work,''
says Katherine Brimberry, co-owner of Flatbed Press and Galleries.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hype of Net boosters about the Internet's potential
to broaden appreciation for art, the Web's greatest impact on the
fine-art world has been strictly commercial. From the very low end
where eBay resides to the world of high-end auctions, covering a
price range of $500 to $10,000, hawkers of art all but smack their
lips at the selling possibilities online.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the sites catering to the middle ground, like
Visualize.com, seem to be making the most impact online. Visualize
makes available, for between $100 and $1,100, lithographs, silk
screens, photographs and engravings, all in original
limited-edition formats. ``We felt that for someone who wanted to
get something of enduring value, something more than a poster, but
wouldn't spend $10,000 _ and knowing how intimidating a gallery can
be _ well, there just wasn't any source for real quality (work)
that was affordable,'' says Abby Adlerman, president and CEO of
Visualize.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Net art market hasn't come close to rendering
obsolete the gavel-banging auction rooms, it has constructed its
own parallel bidding universe for newcomers to the auction world.
</P>
<P>
   Populist eBay was motivated to add the auction house Butterfield
&AMP; Butterfield to its corporate mix, in addition to staging online
fine-art auctions under the rubric of ``Great Collections.'' And
despite its 256-year, tradition-steeped history, Sotheby's has held
nothing back in its pursuit of the Internet, investing a reported
$40 million in two Web sites: sothebys.amazon.com, selling art
valued at up to $10,000, and sothebys.com for the ritzier market.
As early as 1997, Sotheby's was dabbling in the Internet to
advertise the future auction of the world's best-preserved
``Tyrannosaurus rex,'' nicknamed ``Sue.'' ``Sue'' ended up being
auctioned for $8.4 million to the Field Museum of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the T. rex wasn't actually sold on the Web site, the
mere fact that it was presented there brought more and more people
to Sotheby's.com,'' says Sotheby's Redden.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, and completely isolated from a traditional live
auction, Sotheby's first Internet auction offered various books and
manuscripts, some of which sold for $13,500 each, a landmark price
for an Internet sale. Sure enough, the Net auction sold a stunning
$90,000 worth of books and manuscripts. Emboldened by this success,
Sotheby's began conducting online auctions of items with values
ranging from $200 to as high as $100,000. In January, Sotheby's
registered its most successful sale with a rare, 16th-century,
illustrated edition fetching $88,000. On sothebys.amazon.com, its
leading item was a 1930s Lou Gehrig Yankees cap which, in April,
went for $56,650.
</P>
<P>
   Artists gain different rewards when their works circulate on the
Net. Boris Bally is a 39-year-old metalsmith whose most
commercially successful works are his furniture pieces made from
recycled traffic signs. He is currently one of the more than 1,600
artists affiliated with Guild.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love it,'' gushes Bally. ``It's such a great new way to
do business, allowing me both to be anonymous and a virtual
businessperson.'' Bally has added $20,000 worth of Internet sales
to his regular gallery-based business.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Bally's work had to be officially selected by
Guild.com's top juror. Bally then received a one-page placement on
the Guild.com site. Bally signed a one-year exclusive contract with
Guild, which took a 35 percent commission from every Bally work
sold through the site, a contrast to the 50 percent cut most
galleries charge.
</P>
<P>
   Bally discovered that what was paramount to Guild.com was that
in offering his works for sale online, he needed a healthy
inventory to turn around the orders quickly. ``I quickly learned to
be one of the people who could ship an item within a week as
opposed to my normal delivery time of four to eight weeks,'' says
Bally, whose ``transit chairs,'' composed of recycled ``stop'' and
``yield'' signs, have received enormous Guild.com-generated
publicity. The bottom line: Bally has averaged, during certain
holiday selling periods, at least one order a day of the $975
chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most artists don't spend money on magazine ads, but we can act
as a catalog for them, a sales tool for their own site, helping the
artists to get their name out there, beyond the gallery market,''
says Reed McMillian, director of artists' marketing at Guild.com.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the obvious rewards, the Web revolution isn't an
unmitigated success. Not everything sells equally well on the Net.
Sculpture, furniture and large-ticket art items haven't generated
boffo business. And since very fine line-drawings don't reproduce
well on-screen, tremendous expertise is needed just to discern
their value.
</P>
<P>
   And the Internet does induce some artistic soul-searching, as it
suddenly becomes less a matter of artistic integrity than of mass
production and entrepreneurial savvy. ``It does make for a more
dramatic workday, as I could have a major order of six chairs that
has to be turned around in a month,'' says Bally.
</P>
<P>
   California-based artist Tim Schaible admits that selling his
work online could potentially influence the direction his art moves
in. ``It might curb my thinking in what kind of art I might
produce, perhaps steering me towards what is found to be very
popular, but I've always been comfortable merchandising my art
anyway,'' says Schaible, who derives a quarter of his annual income
from online sales.

UNDATED: online sales. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And perhaps because the art is sold from a faraway site, there
are always questions about quality and authenticity. Visualize
engages in an expensive process of inspecting every art piece,
making sure a certificate of authenticity is included with the
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, if a person is going to bid $30,000 for a work of art,
he will need to have someone look at it, and if it's a rare gold
brooch sitting in someone's collection in Irkutsk, then it becomes
expensive and time-consuming to verify authenticity,'' says Kenneth
Linsner, a director of content for artstar.com.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the matter of physically examining a piece of art
on-screen. No matter how sophisticated the image, it can appear too
jarringly unreal for buyers already wary of investing thousands of
dollars in something not seen in person. ``When you look at
anything visual on the screen and you say `Wow, I really like
that,' and when you read that it measures 48 by 60 by 98, you can't
really grasp that on the Net,'' says William Campbell, owner of
William Campbell Contemporary Art gallery.
</P>
<P>
   As for Internet auctions threatening the viability of the
standard live auction for the upper echelons of great works of art,
nothing duplicates being in the same room, witnessing the
masterpiece up close and very personal. ``Yes, when it comes to the
terribly expensive paintings, they must be presented properly in a
darkened room with a strong light gazing down on this glorious work
_ all the conditions that a client relishes, and that will not
happen with the Internet,'' says Redden.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such limitations, the Internet's encroachment into all
aspects of the art world seems a foregone conclusion. Ever on the
cutting edge, the Net helped ring in this past Black History Month
by staging a first-ever online sale of 100 works by
African-American artists through artnet.com. Sotheby's talks
confidently about assembling a combined live and virtual auction,
while Visualize predicts that soon a live salesperson will be able
to walk a customer through a site, completing a sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down the road, you might have photographs of a
three-dimensional object _ like a piece of furniture _ and have it
revolve in space, seeing its insides, back and front, helping one
buy with an enormous amount of real knowledge,'' says Redden.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than presenting three dimensions, though, the Internet
also has the ability to allow patrons of an artist to engage the
painter or sculptor online while he or she is creating a work. The
French Web site nart.com (already the self-proclaimed record holder
for selling $1.2 million worth of fine art at the largest online
auction ever) already offers the opportunity to throw oneself into
a virtual gallery realm where artists are witnessed creating in
their musty workspaces.
</P>
<P>
   But after this whiz-bang tour of an artist's garret is over, one
is still left to absorb the Internet art market's newly created
commercial art ethos. Virtually overnight, the Net has altered ever
so slightly that hoary idea that the ``where'' of art display
directly affects how deeply art is appreciated and whether it is
purchased. Perhaps inevitably, the exploding abundance of art on
the Internet, while serving as a great leveler of price, also
serves as a trivializer of some quality. Though such concerns, say
Internet art champions, are more than offset by the Net's
underlying populist influence that is making art available and
affordable for almost everybody.

<P>
   It only takes a modicum of Web savvy to join the burgeoning
world of art auctions once reserved almost exclusively for
millionaire jet setters.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to get started. Log onto, let's say, artnet.com, a
popular site that, twice a week, has two sales (or batches of art
``lots'') opening and closing. Click onto the online auctions home
page, which will show on any given day four images representing the
auction site's recommendations of the day. To track down a specific
kind of item within these groupings of auctionable items, enter the
artist, medium, title or a key word to bring up the appropriate
item.
</P>
<P>
   Once you find the image of the desired art work, click on it to
enlarge it and also to receive any relevant information. Also
included is the auction house's price estimate of what the object
will command. What is not published is the ``reserve price,'' or
the minimum price the seller will accept.
</P>
<P>
   To the right of the image of the desired artwork is a clock
showing how many days, hours, minutes and seconds are left in the
auction. Also shown is the lot number for the object, its starting
bid and the dollar increments in which the bids must be made. To
sign up to bid, a participant must fill out a bidder registration
form, which includes all basic information plus, most importantly,
a valid credit card number. In filling out this registration, the
participant picks a user name or handle (say, ``artfreak''), and a
password. The participant will then receive a bidder ID number.
</P>
<P>
   So armed, you are ready to make a bid. Return to the lot page
containing the image of the work and, on the right-hand side of the
clock, in a bidding bar area, you then enter the user name, bidder
number and password followed by the prescribed bid indicated or an
``auto-bid'' _ a bidder's maximum amount. A pop-up window will
appear acknowledging the successful bid.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you have the option of enrolling in artnet.com's
``lot watch,'' which allows you to monitor the bidding progress on
as many as 100 different lots at a time. It is also wise to
remember that for many online auctions, much of the action takes
place in the frenzied final five minutes, because veteran bidders
don't want to drive up the price against themselves throughout the
course of the auction.
</P>
<P>
   If yours is the winning bid, you'll be notified by e-mail. Once
artnet.com receives your money, the item will be shipped out from
the seller. You then have 48 hours to compare it to the description

THE GREATEST MOMENT IN HOCKEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It happened 30 years ago today. That's the amazing part
for Bobby Orr.
</P>
<P>
   He was a 22-year-old hockey prodigy when he flew through the
rare air at the old Boston Garden after sliding the puck between
the pads of Glenn Hall to deliver Boston's first Stanley Cup in 29
years. It was Sunday, May 10, 1970. Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later the moment survives, frozen in time _ the
single greatest hockey play ever. Along with Carlton Fisk's
midnight moonshot off the foul pole and the final day of the 1967
pennant race, it's one of the happiest and most indelible memories
of the last half-century of Boston sports. We can talk about Larry
Bird, Pedro Martinez, Bill Russell, and the rest, but if you lived
here in 1970, you know the context of hockey and Orr during that
time. The Bruins were Boston hockey's Beatles and the apostolic Orr
had Paul's talent and John's soul.
</P>
<P>
   Orr gets teased about it now. Video of the goal gets more air
play than Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon, and casual fans might
not know that he accomplished a few other things on ice. When Orr
appeared on WBZ-TV with Bird and Ted Williams years ago, Ted asked
him, ``Is that the only goal you ever scored?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good line,'' laughs Orr. ``Glenn Hall says that to me
every time he sees me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, ESPN airs a commemorative special, and Orr has been
buried by requests to talk about The Goal. Bobby Thomson has The
Homer, Bob Beamon has The Jump, and Orr has The Goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell can you say new about it?,'' he says with a
chuckle. ``The thing that amazes me is that it was 30 years ago.
It's gone by so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr won't be around for any celebrations. The Bruins might
revisit the moment next fall, but today Orr is flying to San
Francisco to fulfill a charity golf commitment for Tony La Russa.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't forgotten much about the day or the moment. The Bruins
led the St. Louis Blues, three games to none, when they played Game
4 at the Garden on a warm Sunday afternoon. It was 3-3 at the end
of regulation, and 40 seconds into the first sudden-death overtime,
Orr slid a pass to Derek Sanderson behind the net. Sanderson
feathered the puck back to Orr as he crossed in front of Hall and
Orr one-timed it between Hall's pads to clinch the Cup. Classic
give-and-go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derek had a huge hand in the goal,'' says Orr. ``In fact, he
professes to have made my career.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I was trying to do was get it on goal. As I skated across,
Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a
little. When I shot it, I saw it got in, so I jumped. Then Noel
Picard helped a little by lifting his stick under my skate.''
</P>
<P>
   Picard's chippy move served only to add to the drama and made
for the greatest photograph in hockey history. The late Ray Lussier
of the late Record-American was one of his paper's three
photographers for the big game and arrived at the Garden with no
credential and no seat. He found a corner in which to work and made
the definitive photo _ Orr in the air, mouth open, stick high,
skate being lifted by Picard's blade. In the photo, Hall is
starting to fall backward and the puck has already bounced off the
back of the goal and out in front of the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Today Orr is part-owner of Woolf Associates in Boston and he
keeps a stack of Lussier reprints handy for signing purposes. He
has signed the photo thousands of times. Perhaps Ted Turner could
colorize it for him.
</P>
<P>
   Orr's mother was home in Ontario on Mother's Day 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really didn't like to watch me play,'' he says. ``But my
dad was there. We were staying at the Colonial in Lynnfield. The
whole team. The morning after the game I met my dad for breakfast
and that was the first time I saw that picture of me flying through
the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was special. We hadn't won the Cup in all those years.
Growing up in Canada, laying in bed at night, that was something
I'd dreamed about. There I was, following Chief (John Bucyk) around
the ice with him hoisting the Cup over his head. It was cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Orr scored more than one goal for the Bruins. He ranks on
anyone's list of the top NHL players of all time and forever will
be No. 1 in Boston. Rival Bobby Clarke, commenting on Orr, said,
``It wasn't fair that he was made to play with us. There should
have been a higher league for him to go to.''
</P>
<P>
   But 30 years after the fact, it remains the signature play of
Orr's career, and fathers of Bruins Nation still recite the moment
the way they recall the birth of their first child.
</P>
<P>
   Childe Bobby is 52. The Goal is 30. Today.

JAPAN'S NTT DOCOMO BUYS STAKE IN DUTCH MOBILE PHONE COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest mobile phone company,
agreed Tuesday to acquire a 15 percent stake in the Dutch mobile
phone operator KPN Mobile for about $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is NTT DoCoMo's first move into Europe as part of an
expansion beyond Japan by its parent company, Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone. It also gives KPN Mobile, a unit of Royal KPN, a
powerful ally in the intense competition for Europe's mobile phone
market. NTT DoComo was the first to give customers the ability to
browse on the Internet using mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies are likely to team up to bid for Orange PLC,
Britain's third-largest telephone operator. Orange is expected to
be put up for sale by Vodafone AirTouch PLC, which must divest
itself of Orange as a condition of its $183 billion acquisition of
Mannesmann AG, the German telecommunications company that it bought
a few months ago. Analysts expect a fierce bidding war for Orange,
which is expected to cost about $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that we've become much more attractive for Orange,''
said Joop Dreschel, a board member of KPN.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes less than a week after merger talks between Royal
KPN and Telefonica of Spain collapsed, leading the Dutch telephone
company to reach an agreement with NTT DoCoMo.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the stake NTT DoCoMo is buying in KPN Mobile, the two
companies will become strategic partners, developing a team to
create next-generation mobile Internet services in Europe based on
NTT DoCoMo's i-mode technology, which creates a continuous mobile
Internet connection. The i-mode service became so popular in Japan
that NTT DoCoMo has curtailed new users from signing up.
</P>
<P>
   Keiji Tachikawa, the president and chief executive of NTT
DoCoMo, said that buying a stake in KPN is part of a larger overall
strategy to enter Europe. ``We have closely followed developments
in the exciting European mobile communications market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NTT DoCoMo's foreign alliance is part of a broader strategy by
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone to expand internationally. On
Monday, its NTT Communications Corp. subsidiary purchased Verio, a
leading Web site manager in the United States, for $5.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For Royal KPN, which has an alliance with Qwest Communications
International of the United States and which is partly owned by
BellSouth, the agreement with NTT DoCoMo will give the company an
advantage in bringing mobile interactive services to Europe that
are far more advanced than the current offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of KPN, which had risen close to 8 percent last week
after it confirmed it was negotiating with Telefonica, fell Tuesday
to 109.93 euros or $99.875 because of investor anxiety that KPN
will be forced to do several smaller deals rather than one
pan-European merger.
</P>
<P>
   KPN and KPN Mobile were advised by ABN AMRO and J.P. Morgan. NTT
DoCoMo was advised by HSBC.

PUTIN'S PLATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin's gaudy inauguration Sunday as Russia's second
elected president offered a lesson about the speed and completeness
of the counter-revolution that doomed the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The symbols as well as the substance of Russia's first electoral
transfer of power represent an antithesis to the old Soviet ways.
The pomp and ceremony of Sunday's spectacle evoked the czarist
past. Vanished were the drab Leninist rituals of the Bolshevik
tradition. In their place, Russians witnessed a carefully
choreographed pastiche of a coronation. The legitimating rationale
of the new Russian state was on display in evocations of imperial
Russian power and appeals to national pride.
</P>
<P>
   The reality of the sprawling, confused country Putin must govern
is as different from the czarist past, however, as from the Soviet
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Most Russians realize that Putin was brought to power by
powerful financial and media oligarchs. If he is to create a viable
capitalist economy, he will have to establish and implement rules
that are the same for all players. Sad to say, there have been
credible reports that Putin has personally intervened to punish a
rival of the oligarchs who were his original backers and to allow
members of his inner circle to bend regulatory agencies to their
will.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the invisible hand of the marketplace will have to
compel Putin to abandon the rigged system of crony capitalism he
inherits. Nonetheless, when President Clinton arrives in Moscow for
a summit encounter June 4 and 5, he would do well to nag Putin on
the need to make Russia a place where both Russians and foreigners
feel their investments will be properly protected.
</P>
<P>
   Another reality obscured by the operatic staging of Putin's
inauguration is Russia's weakness in the world. The Kremlin has no
allies and cannot afford the price of being a world power _ or of
frightening would-be friends in the West.
</P>
<P>
   At their summit, Clinton should heed Russian anxieties about any
scuttling of the 1972 ABM treaty, but he should also warn Putin
that the West cannot embrace a Russian leader who is covered with
the blood of noncombatant Chechen civilians.

HOW U.S. TEAMED WITH RUSSIA TO DISMISS MISSILE CLASS FOR IRANIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ One of Russia's leading missile
scientists, Yuri P. Savelyev, was always more than willing to teach
advanced rocket-building to Iranian engineers, who are said to be
working on missiles that will be able to reach most Middle Eastern
capitals, and even Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   When Russian government officials tried to stop him four years
ago because Russia had signed an international agreement to control
the spread of ballistic missile technology, Savelyev persisted.
</P>
<P>
   As the rector of the famous Baltic State Technical University,
he developed a program to teach students from a leading Iranian
university courses in advanced physics, metallurgy and the behavior
of gases and fluids under high pressure and temperature _ all
disciplines essential to building rockets.
</P>
<P>
   This was done, he said, with the full knowledge of Russia's
Defense Ministry and the national intelligence agency, the Federal
Security Service, of which Savelyev's deputy is a member.
</P>
<P>
   Then in February, after complaints from the Clinton
administration, Savelyev was ordered to shut down the program. He
was summoned to Moscow by Russia's Ministry of Education, where he
was reprimanded and threatened with dismissal for concealing the
educational program that was under way both here and in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have big problems,'' he said, seated near a display
cabinet where he keeps a portrait of Iran's late spiritual leader,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. ``I now have as my antagonists the
Russian government and the American government and I think one way
or the other, they will find a way to fire me from the post of
rector.''
</P>
<P>
   As concerns mount in the United States and Israel that Iran's
secretive missile and nuclear weapons programs could pose new
threats in the region, the case of Savelyev illustrates the
behind-the-scenes cooperation between the Russian and American
governments to stem the flow of missile technologies to Iran. But
at the same time, it also reveals the deep-seated resistance within
the Russian military and security establishment against abandoning
Russia's ``strategic'' role in cultivating clients and lucrative
contracts for transferring military science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell you honestly that I wanted to work with them,''
Savelyev said of his Iranian contacts, ``and I would be teaching
Iranians rocket technology today if I could because otherwise I
would have my professors going to the market to sell fruits and
vegetables to earn a living.''
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy interview, Savelyev defended his activities, saying
he was unfairly disciplined because of his hard-line nationalistic
views and because he has become a vocal critic of President
Vladimir V. Putin's cooperation with the United States on arms
control initiatives. Savelyev contends that such cooperation will
weaken Russia's own rocket forces and will alienate Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there is nothing more important than having Iran as
our ally,'' he said, ``because if we fell into a state of animosity
with Iran, the whole of Central Asia could be lost to the influence
of the Islamic world.'' He also argues that if Russia does not help
Iran build medium range ballistic missiles, ``North Korea and China
are ready to offer Iran help with new rocket programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month in Washington, State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin singled out Savelyev as a threat to U.S. security interests.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing that the United States was lifting the sanctions
it had applied to several Russian organizations suspected of
providing assistance to Iran's ballistic missile program, including
Baltic State, Rubin said a ban on all contact or educational
exchanges with Savelyev ``personally'' would remain in force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rector is believed to have violated Russian export
controls and attempted to export goods or services that could
contribute to missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass
destruction,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Savelyev denied this allegation, saying he never transferred
more than a good education in basic science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can Newton's law of gravity be taught to Iranian students?''
he asked with a defiant tone. ``Because if you don't know the laws
of gravity, you cannot build rockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Savelyev, 62, is still in the rector's office at Baltic
State, one of Russia's most prestigious scientific centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been a rocket builder all my life,'' he said, ``and
many of the leading Russian rocket builders have graduated from
this university,'' whose laboratories were shrouded in secrecy
until 1991 and, even today, remain off limits to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of the most famous graduates of Baltic State was the late
Vladimir F. Utkin, who designed Russia's most fearsome land-based
strategic rocket, the SS-18 ``Satan,'' whose payload of 10
independently targetable warheads spawned fears in the West that
Moscow would mount a pre-emptive nuclear strike to wipe out
American missile fields and then try to force an American surrender
or ride out a nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Savelyev's relationship with Iran began in mid-1996, when he
received a telephone call from an Iranian diplomat in Moscow who
wanted to discuss an educational proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say that at that time, they were more concerned with
preparing specialists in rocket construction'' than any general
education, he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Days later Savelyev greeted an Iranian delegation here that
included two rocket experts from Iran's Ministry of Defense, as
well as an Iranian intelligence officer.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting resulted in a handwritten agreement to train Iranian
scientists in rocketry, but when Savelyev forwarded the document to
the Education Ministry in Moscow, the program was rejected because
only a year before Russia had signed the Missile Technology Control
Regime, an agreement by more than two dozen nations to control the
spread of missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless, the Iranians still wanted to have their students
study here,'' he said, and by the fall of 1996, Savelyev said, ``we
welcomed 26 Iranian students,'' to study for undergraduate degrees
in mechanical engineering and general science courses.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, Israeli officials warned the Clinton
administration that a number of Russian organizations were
assisting Iran's missile program and American intelligence agencies
confirmed that as many as 20 such firms and institutes, including
Baltic State, were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Savelyev denies the charge, but he added that he believed that
the original handwritten agreement he signed with Iran in 1996,
though never carried out, fell into the hands of Western
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the initial group of Iranian students graduated
from Baltic State in April 1998, new concerns arose in the United
States. A special panel headed by former Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld estimated that Iran's missile program had made significant
strides and might be able to develop an ICBM capable of reaching
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late July that year, Iran created a sensation in the
Middle East by test-firing a medium range ballistic missile
prototype, the Shahab-3, that could carry a 1,500-pound warhead 800
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, under pressure from Washington, announced that it was
investigating Baltic State and eight other organizations for
exporting technologies that could have military uses. Throughout
the spring of 1998, Savelyev said, Baltic State's undergraduate
program for Iranian students was thoroughly investigated by a
commission that included representatives of the Ministries of
Defense and Education and the general staff of the armed forces,
military prosecutors and the Federal Security Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``They reached the conclusion that Baltic State was not teaching
anything related to rocket construction,'' Savelyev said. But he
was told that if he wanted to continue teaching Iranian students he
would have to draw up a detailed course list and submit it to
Moscow for approval.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, he and his staff drew up a course list of 111
specialized subjects that Baltic State wanted to offer to foreign
students as a means to earn income for the university. Each course
outline ran more than 40 pages, and the government commission spent
nine months reviewing it before approving all but 12 subjects that
could have military applications, Savelyev said. Among the rejected
courses were the study of ``fuse technology,'' the design of
``anti-tank rockets'' and ``ignition and explosives.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with this approval, Savelyev sent out advertisements to
universities in Iran, China, Syria, India and Vietnam offering to
train graduate students in advanced sciences of metallurgy, gas and
fluid dynamics in conditions of high-temperature and pressure and
other disciplines that could be considered the basics of rocket
science.
</P>
<P>
   Three Iranian universities responded, but Savelyev said that two
of them were on a secret list of 305 organizations in Iran with
whom Russian universities are forbidden to have contact.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The government sent this list to our university, but I had the
feeling that this list was prepared by the CIA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   What was not on the list was K.N. Toosi University of Technology
in Tehran, Iran, whose dean, S.N. Mousavi, was eager to have his
graduate students in mechanical engineering study under Russian
professors.
</P>
<P>
   Without informing the Russian government, Savelyev flew to
Tehran in September 1999 and signed an agreement with Mousavi to
begin training the first 17 Iranian students immediately.
Throughout last fall and up until February of this year, about two
dozen Russian professors shuttled to Iran to teach courses in
three-week segments, for which they were paid $1,000 each trip.
</P>
<P>
   But a month into the program, the United States again
intervened.
</P>
<P>
   In an October 1999 letter from Vice President Al Gore to Putin,
who was then the prime minister, the Clinton administration
complained that Russia was failing to take action against Russian
institutions that were still assisting Iran's missile program.
Savelyev said the letter was read to him by a member of Putin's
staff.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 20, Russia's Federal Service for Currency and Export
Control opened an investigation that concluded two months later
that Baltic State was indeed transferring expertise that could be
useful to Iran's missile program and, therefore, was contrary to
Russian national interests.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy director of the export control agency, Sergei F.
Yakimov, issued an order to Baltic State on Feb. 11 to shut down
the program. Now, three months later, the professors who worked on
the Iran program are back teaching Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Russia's education minister , Vladimir M. Filippov,
publicly rebuked Savelyev, saying he ``was given a severe reprimand
and a warning'' for violating a ``whole series'' of secret orders
from the ministry pertaining to educational services to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Savelyev was being disciplined, Russia's Ministry of
Defense was defending the program for Iranian students. A top
Russian defense official argued that the investigation of Savelyev
did ``not contain evidence of violation of Russian legislation on
military-technical cooperation and export control.''
</P>
<P>
   First Deputy Minister of Defense Nikolai V. Mikhailov stated, in
a letter to the export control ministry, ``The Ministry of Defense
does not see danger to the security of the Russian Federation in
education of foreign citizens including the citizens of Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   The university's program of courses for Iranian students was
carefully screened by the Ministry of Defense and other experts, he
said, and added, ``On the whole, the higher education of foreign
citizens in Russian language and Russian technical standards is
extremely useful for Russia in strategic terms.''

&HT;     WITNESS: REILLY `HAPPY AS A FOX' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A newspaper consultant for Clint Reilly, who has
brought an antitrust suit to block the Hearst Corp. from buying the
San Francisco Chronicle, acknowledged Tuesday that when he filed a
sworn declaration saying that local publisher Ted Fang would need a
$50 million a year subsidy to successfully publish the San
Francisco Examiner, he included only the papers' costs and no
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Ingram also admitted that his declaration should have
said the Fangs would need a subsidy of ``up to'' $50 million per
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram, a former vice president of operations for the San
Francisco Newspaper Agency, which provides business operations such
as circulation, advertising, printing for the Examiner and
Chronicle, also testified that Reilly was ``happy as a fox in a hen
house'' when he learned that Hearst would offer a subsidy to the
Examiner's buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram's testimony opened the second week of trial before U.S.
District Judge Vaughn R. Walker on real estate investor and former
mayoral candidate Reilly's suit.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hockett, a lawyer for the Fang family, the
publishers of the San Francisco Independent who are seeking to buy
Hearst's Examiner, sought to show that the Fangs could successfully
publish The Examiner with a subsidy from Hearst of up to $66
million over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly was an unsuccessful bidder for The Examiner. A Hearst
executive testified last week that Reilly had requested a subsidy
larger than the one offered to the Fangs.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph M. Alioto, Reilly's attorney, indicated in his trial
brief that Reilly offered March 7 to buy The Examiner, seeking a
$200 million subsidy from Hearst during a six-year period.
</P>
<P>
   In cross-examination, Hockett asked Ingram about a Feb. 13
e-mail Ingram wrote after speaking with Reilly, who was then
negotiating with Hearst and had just learned that Hearst was
willing to give a subsidy to the Examiner's buyer.
</P>
<P>
   In the e-mail, Ingram said: ``I talked with Clint late last
night. He was happy as a fox in a hen house.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockett asked Ingram why was Reilly was happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know much about foxes,'' Ingram replied.
</P>
<P>
   Hockett shot back, ``It's not because they're about to do
something good for the public, is it?''
</P>
<P>
   Walker interjected that the question was argumentative, and
Hockett withdrew it.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which will decide the future of San Francisco's daily
newspapers, is scheduled to run through the end of this week.
Witnesses are expected to include Hearst President Frank Bennack,
Fang and Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst was expected to begin putting its defense case on
Tuesday, a Hearst lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly contends Hearst's plan to buy the morning Chronicle for
$660
</P>
<P>
   million and to sell its smaller afternoon Examiner to the Fang
family will
</P>
<P>
   give Hearst the only metropolitan daily newspaper based in San
Francisco, which he says would be an illegal monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly claims Hearst's proposal to sell The Examiner to the
Fangs for $100 and give them a subsidy of up to $66 million to
defray publishing costs is a ``sham,'' because the subsidy is
insufficient and The Examiner will fail.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto claims Hearst's purchase violates federal antitrust laws
and the 1970 Newspaper Preservation Act.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Halling, a lawyer for Hearst, has argued that The Examiner
could not survive outside its profit-sharing agreement with the
Chronicle, and that because it is an economically failing
enterprise Hearst legally may shut it or sell it and buy the
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Halling also has denied that Hearst's sale of The Examiner to
the Fangs is a sham, and says Hearst is not required to give any
buyer a subsidy. Halling has said Hearst gave the Fangs a subsidy
to satisfy concerns of local politicians, who have said San
Francisco should have at least two daily papers.
</P>
<P>
   The Fangs, who publish the free, three-times-a week Independent,
also have denied The Examiner deal is a sham.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony last week, Examiner publisher Timothy O. White said
he had offered San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown favorable editorial
treatment in return for Brown's support of Hearst's plan to buy the
Chronicle. Hearst put White on indefinite leave and is
investigating whether White violated journalistic ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Other testimony showed that The Examiner earned a $20.5 million
profit last year under its profit-splitting agreement with the
Chronicle. Hearst executives, however, testified that if Hearst had
to carry its full publishing costs outside the agreement it would
lose money.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, Hearst and the Chronicle Publishing Co. have had a
joint operating agreement under which they share printing,
circulation and marketing and all revenue from both papers. After
paying shared costs, they split the remainder, and each paper pays
the costs of its independent editorial staffs.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements are allowed under the Newspaper Preservation Act,
which was meant to keep alive newspapers that otherwise might fail
so communities could benefit from multiple editorial voices.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, representatives of both Hearst and the Chronicle said
that one of the papers would likely fold if they were forced to
economically compete against each other.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was set to expire in 2005, but the Chronicle's
owners decided to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto has argued that Hearst abused its position in the joint
operating agreement to ward off other potential bidders for the
Chronicle and gain an unfair advantage buying the paper. Both
Hearst and the Chronicle have denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
   The trial on Reilly's suit is the nation's first on a challenge
to the breakup of a joint operating agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle is the nation's 12th largest daily newspaper, with
a circulation of 465,535. The Examiner's circulation is 108,986.

Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two months after their bitter primary battle, John McCain
endorsed George W. Bush today and said he looked forward to
``enthusiastically campaigning'' for him. McCain, however, asked
not to be considered as a running mate. The Arizonan gave his
formal endorsement to Bush after a 90-minute private meeting in
Pittsburgh that ended with a public handshake. ``I endorse Governor
Bush,'' McCain said half a dozen times with a smile. ``By the way,
I enthusiastically accept,'' Bush said. The pair acknowledged they
still have differences, primarily over campaign finance reform.
But, said McCain, ``We are in agreement on more issues than we are
in disagreement.'' When a reporter asked McCain about aides'
remarks that the timing of the endorsement was like taking medicine
now rather than later, McCain replied, ``I think your
`take-the-medicine-now' is probably a good description.'' Behind
the scenes, McCain's aides were chafing at Bush's refusal in the
news conference to repudiate conservative broadcaster Pat
Robertson's statement last weekend that a McCain vice presidency
would be ``very dangerous.'' Asked about that, Bush simply said
that McCain is ``a friend of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   PROMOTING HARMONY _ AND HIMSELF
</P>
<P>
   The real story behind the John McCain-George W. Bush meeting,
according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, is the work done by
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican vice presidential
hopeful, to bring the two sides together in his home state. Elsie
Hillman, an ex-Republican National Committee member and longtime
Bush family friend, was among those pressing for the event, but
says Ridge did the heavy lifting. Though he has taken heat from
Christian conservatives for being pro-choice on abortion, Ridge
could get a V.P. boost from the summit's success.
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARY DAY IN TWO STATES
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska Attorney General Don Stenberg was trying to take the
first step today toward reclaiming Sen. Bob Kerrey's seat for the
Republicans, facing Secretary of State Scott Moore and two others
in the GOP prilmary. The winner is likely to take on popular
ex-Gov. Ben Nelson. Retired Nebraska Cornhusker football coach Tom
Osborne was expected to rout two opponents in a GOP congressional
primary. In West Virginia Gov. Cecil Underwood, who was elected to
his first term as governor in 1956 and to his second term in 1996,
was expected to easily win the GOP nomination for his third term.
At 77, Underwood is the nation's oldest governor. And in case
anyone's paying attention, there are presidential primaries in both
states. Al Gore and George W. Bush don't seem too worried.
</P>
<P>
   LIKE A POLITICAL ECUMENICAL COUNCIL
</P>
<P>
   Politicians of many stripes and faiths sat elbow-to-elbow in St.
Patrick's Cathedral for Cardinal John O'Connor's funeral. Some of
those present had differed with O'Connor's strong opposition to
abortion or his views on other issues. But differences disappeared
in a turnout by the Washington and New York political elite that
seemed almost like a state funeral. President Clinton and Al Gore,
a couple of Baptists, sat near the two George Bushes, the elder
Episcopalian, the younger Methodist. New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani,
a Catholic, was a row behind Hillary Clinton, a Methodist herself.
Also attending were New York Gov. George Pataki and nearly 40
percent of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A LITTLE SECOND-SPOT PROBING
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is heading up Al
Gore's search for a running mate, has met with Sens. John Kerry of
Massachusetts and Richard Durbin of Illinois, according to the
Boston Globe. The newspaper also quoted Gore spokesman Chris Lehane
as saying: ``I can't confirm or deny anything. ... I have no
comment on the process at all.''
</P>
<P>
   FEC SOCKED WITH LAWSUIT OVER DEBATES
</P>
<P>
   Third-party and other groups sued the Federal Election
Commission, contending it was allowing a partisan commission to
limit the presidential debates to the two major parties. Among
those suing in federal court in New York were the Libertarian Party
and the Committee for a Unified Independence Party as well as
voters from the Democratic, Republican and Green parties. The
Commission on Presidential Debates limits access to its nationally
televised debates to candidates with at least 15 percent support in
five national polls.This latest lawsuit is different from previous
ones because it's against the FEC, not just the debate commission,
said Steve Dasbach, national director of the Libertarian Party.
</P>
<P>
   129,000 TEXASN SIGN UP FOR BUCHANAN
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan turned in an estimated 129,000 signatures to state
election officials in a bid to secure his place as an independent
candidate on Texas' November ballot. He said he's still seeking the
Reform Party's presidential nomination, but sought ballot status as
an independent as an ``insurance policy'' in case the party taps
someone else. In order to qualify as an independent, Buchanan needs
about 58,000 signatures from registered voters who did not
participate in either major party primary. Election officials must
verify the signatures' authenticity. Buchanan listed Houston
term-limits activist Clymer Wright as his Texas running mate.
Buchanan said Wright, an old friend, agreed to be listed on the
petitions as a ``stand-in.'' Buchanan gave no indication whom he
ultimately might pick as a vice presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   PEROT SEEN SITTING THIS ONE OUT
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party founder Ross Perot is not expected to address the
party's August convention in Long Beach, Calif., where lapsed
Republican Pat Buchanan is likely to become the third party's
presidential nominee. Perot's lop lieutenant, Russell Verney, said
Perot ``has a very tight travel schedule for business this
summer,'' but the Associated Press reported that senior party
officials say Perot has indicated he won't attend the convention or
make a statement in support of the nominee. That would be a first
since he founded the party in 1992. His absence could further
demoralize a party riven by fierce infighting for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   GOP GIVING INDIANA DEMOCRAT A SMOOTH RIDE
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had an unusual reaction to a recent primary election
in Indiana: They basically surrendered in their effort to knock out
first term Democratic Rep. Baron Hill. ``This is a not a targeted
race we're now looking at for the fall,'' said Jim Wilkinson, a
spokesman for the GOP campaign committee. As if to underscore the
point, the GOP issued a written statement that spoke
enthusiastically of its chances for victory in other Indiana
contests. It omitted mention of Hill's seat. The GOP had long
touted Hill as a potential victim, but congressional party leaders'
hopes soured when Kevin Kellems, a former aide to Sen. Richard
Lugar, lost the nomination. Some GOP strategists view the winner in
the primary, Michael Bailey, a longtime anti-abortion crusader, as
too much a one-note candidate to defeat Hill.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS DEMOCRATS JUST BEATING AROUND THE BUSH
</P>
<P>
   The once-mighty Texas Democratic Party, whose fabled leaders
Lyndon Johnson and Sam Rayburn once dominated not just the state
but the nation, has fallen on very hard times. Of today's 29
officials elected statewide in Texas, none are Democrats.
Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison faces only token Democratic
opposition in her re-election campaign this year, which is more
opposition than the party is providing in most statewide races. But
other than the most partisan Republicans, few Texans would argue
that Democrats are powerless or obsolete, particularly since the
party still controls the congressional delegation and the Texas
House. But as George W. Bush campaigns for the White House,
Democrats are consumed by a parochial, less glamorous agenda, such
as legislative races and preparing for the 2002 gubernatorial race.
And few elected Democrats are willing to make trouble for their
popular governor.
</P>
<P>
   GET TING THEM INTO THE VOTING HABIT EARLY
</P>
<P>
   A new group called Youth-e-Vote announced it'll offer
schoolchildren across the country a chance to take part in online
mock balloting for president, governor and members of Congress this
fall. ``By exposing students to the political process at a young
age Youth-e-Vote (will help) turn the tide of the so-called voter
apathy in this country,'' said Joseph Mohen, CEO of Election.com a
Long Island-based online voting company. Youth-e-Vote will mail all
U.S. schools information seeking to encourage them to register for
the student vote on its Web site, www.youthevote.net. Youngsters
can ballot on the Youth-e-Vote Web site between Oct. 23 and Nov. 2.
Results will be available the day voting ends.
</P>
<P>
   THE OUTER LIMITS OF SUPPORT
</P>

   Throughout the Republican primaries, the George W. Bush campaign
trumpeted seemingly any and every endorsement, whether from the
governor of a large state or the secretary of a small sewing
circle. But last week, the Bush campaign took it to the outer
limits. Bush showed reporters a recent copy of the Weekly World
News supermarket tabloid. The front page featured a photo of Bush
standing beside an oblong, hairless space alien. The tabloid noted
that this same extraterrestrial had backed Bill Clinton in 1992.
And as Bush noted, his alien encounter was further proof of his
commitment to expanding the Republican Party's appeal. ``New faces,
new voices,'' he said as he held the front page high. ``It goes to
show I'm willing to reach across certain demographic lines.''

   CHUCKLE WITH GORE, BUT JUST A LITTLE BIT

   Al Gore as the Terminator? In his dreams _ or in his cartoon
collection. Gore's official White House Web site now boasts some
favorite jabs from his personal collection of editorial cartoons.
In one, there's Gore, post-makeover, with wild new hair and a pair
of lungs in hand _ a reference to an interview in which he said
that to win a candidate has to ``rip your opponent's lungs out and
move on.'' ``Hasta la vista, baby,'' says a Terminator-esque Gore.
But the collection includes only five of the more gentle digs;
absent are the more-biting ones, including claims about inventing
the Internet or inspiring, along with wife Tipper, the book and
movie ``Love Story.'' Rival George W. Bush doesn't boast a similar
cyber-collection, but spokesman Scott McClellan said there are
about 30 Bush cartoons framed at the Governor's Mansion. The Gore

 BEST WAY: Cooking Bacon   By Andy Lax  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  For better or worse, there are few foods that more
typify the hearty American breakfast than bacon. Despite _ or
perhaps because of _ its high fat content and savory smoky
qualities bacon retains a special place on the breakfast table.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But what is the best way to cook bacon to have it turn out both
crispy and meaty? We tested Applewood Farms Sunday Bacon five ways
to determine the best cooking method _ on the stovetop in a
non-stick skillet, in a cast iron skillet, baked on a wire rack,
baked directly on a rimmed cookie sheet, and microwaved.
</P>
<P>
   To microwave the bacon, we sandwiched it between layers of paper
towels. The paper towels absorbed most of the grease so the bacon
did not need to be drained after cooking. It remained flat and did
not shrink. However, both the microwaved bacon and the bacon cooked
in a nonstick skillet came out dry and didn't much please the
tasters.
</P>
<P>
   The oven-cooked bacon was baked in the middle of the oven at 500
degrees for 7 to 10 minutes. The bacon placed on a wire rack (set
over a rimmed cookie sheet to catch the grease) looked the best but
was limp and lacked the crispness needed for perfect bacon. The
bacon baked on the cookie sheet was the Food department's favorite.
It struck a good balance between crisp and meaty and did not shrink
substantially.
</P>
<P>
   The bacon cooked in a cast iron skillet was a close second.
Although it cooked somewhat unevenly due to curling and shrinkage,
it gained points for nostalgia value and tradition.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   We found that baking bacon on a rimmed cookie sheet is best.
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Arrange the bacon on the cookie
sheet and place it in the middle of the oven. Bake for 7-10
minutes, or until cooked to the desired crispness. Transfer the
bacon to paper towels to drain.

&HT;     AS MOMS PREPARE SUNDAY MARCH,FEINSTEIN UNVEILS GUN LICENSING
BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Surrounded by organizers of Sunday's so-called
Million Mom March for tougher gun laws, Sen. Dianne Feinstein
introduced a bill Tuesday to require buyers of handguns and certain
semiautomatic weapons to get licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you want to hunt, you get a hunting license; when you
want to fish, you get a fishing license, but when you want a gun,
no license is required,'' the California Democrat said at a news
conference announcing her proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said the legislation is needed because each day 80
people, including 12 children, are killed by guns in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   She said she does not expect her measure to pass this year but
predicted it will be buoyed by the tens of thousands of mothers who
plan to demonstrate on Mother's Day in the nation's capital and 67
other cities against gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Under Feinstein's proposal current owners of handguns and
semiautomatic firearms that can use detachable ammunition clips
would have up to 10 years to get licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers of new guns would pay a $25 fee to a firearms dealer or a
state-certified entity to get licenses. Applicants would have to
provide their date and place of birth. They would also have to pass
a background check and a written firearm-safety test and sign a
pledge to keep weapons safely stored.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J., the chief co-sponsor of the
measure, said the Senate ``does not have enough votes to pass
sensible gun control legislation'' because of the power of the
National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   But he asked, ``What could be a better fight? A mother has to
know that her kids are safe. Why shouldn't we be able to get some
action in this place?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said gun control advocates
``cannot allow those people who are against what we're trying to do
to paralyze us, to freeze us in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said only one lobby can stand up to the NRA _ women.
She said the Million Mom March is just ``the beginning of an effort
to mobilize women.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator said that ``for years we've been hearing from gun
owners who say they have rights.'' She added, `We have rights to
walk down the street and not get shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Dees-Thomases of Short Falls, N.J., founder of the Million
Mom March, said Feinstein's gun-licensing legislation is her top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put that on our agenda since day one,'' she said. The
organization also favors gun registration.
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases said she expects at least 150,000 mothers to
demonstrate in Washington, D.C. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   She also predicted that tens of thousands of women, including
large numbers of ``stroller-moms'' with young children, will turn
out to protest in Denver, Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   She said the main objective of the march is to urge women to
find out how their lawmakers are voting on gun control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about mothers taking responsibility for themselves,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The march organizers are also pushing for passage of gun control
measures in the so-called juvenile justice bill, passed in
different forms by both houses of Congress last year. The
legislation has been stalled in a conference committee for more
than 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial part of the stalled bill is a measure
that would require that private dealers at gun shows check the
backgrounds of would-be firearm buyers. The legislation would also
require safety locks on handguns, ban the sale of assault weapons
to minors and stop the import of high capacity ammunition clips.

 STAR SEARCH: Bay Area Chefs Reach for New Heights   &HT;     By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
It's a long road from being an assistant kindergarten teacher to
being a chef at a hot Bay Area restaurant. But what an interesting
road it's been for 30-year-old Laurence Jossel of Chez Nous in San
Francisco.
<P>
   The South African native had less than auspicious teenage years.
He moved to the U.S. with his family when he was 10, eventually
settling in Los Angeles. To his parents' dismay, he quit high
school to manage a bar. He worked a number of other jobs _
including the stint as a kindergarten teacher _ until he finally
decided to go to cooking school. He admits that he agreed to go
just to make his parents happy.
</P>
<P>
   But when he went to the California Culinary Academy at age 19,
he found his passion. ``When school was done for the day, I felt I
hadn't done enough,'' he remembers. So he'd sneak into additional
classes just so he could learn more.
</P>
<P>
   It's that enthusiasm for learning that makes his food so
exciting. Three-month-old Chez Nous, where Jossel is also
part-owner, serves small plates like pommes frites, gnocchi and
roasted quail. He keeps a strict emphasis on simplicity,
authenticity and seasonality in his dishes.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10 years since he graduated from CCA, he has worked in a
number of restaurants in San Francisco and traveled extensively,
absorbing all of the experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Jossel credits a number of people with having a strong impact on
his cooking style. He worked with Gary Danko at the Dining Room in
the Ritz-Carlton San Francisco, appreciating what he called Danko's
``cerebral approach.'' He says Danko also introduced him to others
who influenced his style, like cookbook author Joanne Weir and
cooking instructor Madeleine Kamman.
</P>
<P>
   But it was when he was researching Greek food for the opening of
Kokkari that Jossel really saw his style begin to take shape. He
traveled to Turkey _ he couldn't get into Greece because of his
South African citizenship _ where he fell in love with the street
food.
</P>
<P>
   After eating what he describes as the best lamb, the best
yogurt, the best vegetables, he had an epiphany. ``Food has to be
honest,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That honesty is what he brought to Kokkari in the year he worked
there as sous chef, and it's the focal point of his straightforward
food at Chez Nous.
</P>
<P>
   He chooses dishes from a variety of cuisines because he likes to
change the menu all the time to keep himself interested. The
ever-changing menu also means he can offer his customers the best
of the season, like strawberry sangria.
</P>
<P>
   Jossel says it's too early to talk about what his next project
might be, but he thinks whatever it is would have the same
neighborhood appeal of Chez Nous.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place was built for the neighborhood,'' he says. ``I like
it best when it's filled with the eclectic people.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
STRAWBERRY SANGRIA
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Jossel at Chez Nous changes his menu frequently, but
this simple drink is one of his current favorites. Try to use the
ripest berries you can find for superior flavor. If they're a
little under-ripe, add more sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 (750 ml) bottle soft-tannin red wine (Jossel uses an Italian
rosso)
</P>
<P>
   1 pound strawberries (about 2 pints), hulled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fresh apple juice
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup Triple Sec
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar (more or less depending on ripeness of berries)
</P>
<P>
   2 whole cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine all ingredients in a large pitcher. Stir until the sugar
dissolves. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or up to one day.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the sangria into glasses, being sure to include some of the
strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with a fork to eat the fruit.

<P>
   &UR; By Miriam Morgan &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
On a recent sunny spring morning, an elderly gentleman walked in
the door of Pisces, the new seafood restaurant in Burlingame, and
asked where he could buy a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ticket?'' asked the hostess near the door, getting ready for
the day's lunch service. ``Oh,'' she replied, ``this isn't the
train station any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The man's confusion was easy to understand. Pisces is located
right at the Broadway Avenue CalTrain stop _ and, in fact, was the
train station for decades. But now ticket vendors have departed and
the small historic building is where Victor Scargle is starting to
make some history of his own.
</P>
<P>
   In a space smaller than many home kitchens, he's turning out
stunning dishes like scallop foie gras salad, seared halibut with
morels, artichoke and eggplant puree, and ancho pepper grilled
corvina. His first tasting menu, which debuted at the end of last
month, features English pea soup with lobster fritter and white
truffle oil, and sauteed curried skate wing with boniato puree,
watercress and tamarind orange reduction, among other courses.
</P>
<P>
   At 27 years of age, Scargle is the youngest of this year's
Rising Stars, yet is already the executive chef of a destination
restaurant. A protege of Michael Mina, chef of Aqua in San
Francisco, Scargle helped open Aqua's sister restaurant in Las
Vegas before opening Pisces _ which is part of the Aqua group _
last year.
</P>
<P>
   He began his culinary career in his hometown of Aptos, making
cookies, taking children's cooking classes at the local community
college, then working in a restaurant to earn extra money while in
high school. He went on to the University of California at Santa
Barbara, majoring in economics, but found he'd rather be in the
kitchen than the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed the intensity of restaurant cooking, and I missed
watching people enjoy the food. That's really what I like,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   So Scargle returned to a kitchen, earning an apprenticeship with
Brian Bird at Fess Parker's Red Lion Resort in Santa Barbara. After
completing the year, he went to work with Robin Haas in Miami.
``That's where I learned all about tropical seafood and produce,
and Cuban influences,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He further honed his Nuevo Latino techniques by moving to New
York City and working with the renowned chef Douglas Rodriguez at
the ground-breaking Patria. From there, it was back to the West
Coast, and Aqua.
</P>
<P>
   Aqua's style, described as French/Californian seafood, has also
taken on Mediterranean and Asian influences under Mina's direction
_ which impressed Scargle. ``I learned how to take the best quality
products from different countries and use them to balance and
support the main ingredient,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   After three years at Aqua, Scargle returned briefly to New York
_ ``sort of on loan,'' Scargle says _ to work at various
restaurants. At TriBeCa Grill, he presented daily American cuisine
specials, and learned about an entirely different style of food. He
also gained experience in the kitchens of the renowned Lespinasse,
Le Bernardin, Aureole, Gramercy Tavern Oceana and Park Avenue Cafe
_ and learned how to handle high-volume dining rooms. He also began
to realize how much diners appreciate a personal touch.
</P>
<P>
   At Pisces, he says, ``I like to go out and serve customers and
see their faces. The most important thing is making people happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings him back to pleasing customers with his cooking.
``I get inspired by what other chefs are doing, then I add my own
twist. Plus I look at what's in season, the weather, what feels
right.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DUNGENESS CRAB CIOPPINO
</P>
<P>
   The stock may be made one day ahead and refrigerated until ready
to use. At Pisces, Victor Scargle adds the crushed shells from
three lobsters to the stock, which enhances its complexity. He
serves the cioppino with crostini spread with roasted garlic
butter.

   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Make the stock:  &LR; Heat the oil in a large stockpot over
medium-high heat. Add the shrimp shells and sear them until they
turn red. Add the brandy and stir until it just evaporates.
</P>
<P>
   Add the tomato paste. Reduce the heat to medium and cook,
stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the fennel, celery, carrots, onion,
leek, parsley, thyme, coriander, peppercorns and bay leaves. Cook,
stirring, until the vegetables begin to soften and turn glassy. Add
the white wine, turn the heat to high, and cook until the wine
nearly evaporates.
</P>
<P>
   Add the water, bring to a boil, and cook over medium-low heat

 &UR; JEFFREY AMBER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Tilde Herrera &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager growing up in the Midwest, Jeffrey Amber would
never have imagined that his destiny would lie in a West Coast
kitchen. He saw himself as a poet so he went to the University of
Oregon as an English major.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991 he left his academic life behind, landing in San
Francisco because he thought the city would be a more conducive
environment to develop his writing. To earn some money, he turned
toward the restaurant work that had always sustained him and
ironically, found it to be his true calling.
</P>
<P>
   Amber did not get much culinary inspiration growing up in Iowa.
His father, retired from the Air Force, was the ``king of the
barbecue,'' he says, and his mother, an administrative assistant,
was ``queen of Stouffer's frozen meals.''
</P>
<P>
   He supported himself by working in restaurants because he needed
an income while in school, beginning in a small family-run Italian
restaurant where he learned to make ravioli and sausage as an
eighth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, his natural ease in the kitchen allowed him to
drift in and out of many. ``I sort of goofed off for a long time,
cooking all kinds of different things. I never went to school for
it, it was just something that I could do. I could walk into any
kitchen and I could cook.''
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in San Francisco, he added more restaurants to
his resume, which reads like a laundry list. ``I've been everywhere
but nowhere,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In his early 20s, he took stock of his natural culinary talent,
his love for the intensity and instant gratification of cooking and
decided to get serious about it. He set goals for himself and got
in contact with some of the very best in the industry, ``people who
knew how to make art.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Alfred (Schilling) who was making chocolates and I had
never done pastry. His stuff is very architecturally based. He was
doing wedding cakes when I met him, using live plants in the
wedding cakes which I had never seen before. I thought it was very
unique, very artistic. Really beautiful stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling taught him composition and presentation but it was his
next mentor who taught him discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to the point in San Francisco where I felt like I could
be a sous chef somewhere but I didn't have the resume,'' he says.
``So I went from restaurant to restaurant, putting myself out
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd stay here for a month and there for a month, each time
thinking, `I don't want to be a sous chef here,' until I met Denis
(Soriano) at the Grand Cafe. He said, `You work here and I'll make
you a sous chef.''' Amber realized his resume was built on smaller
restaurants and he needed the experience and connections working at
a place the size of Grand Cafe would bring.
</P>
<P>
   While attending the opening of the W hotel's restaurant, XYZ, he
met Alison Richman, the opening chef. She asked him to join her
crew to strengthen their dinner service and he accepted even though
the food that was being served ``wasn't really my style.'' He was
getting ready to leave XYZ when he was offered the executive chef
position.
</P>
<P>
   He decribes his food as fun, a little flashy but sophisticated,
``colorful, very alive-looking food, very defined, composed,
architecturally based. Where you just knock it down before you eat
it but when it hits your table, you turn it around to show your
friends. That's the food I like to serve, little works of art.''
</P>
<P>
   Amber says he aspires ``to be someone like Gary Danko or George
Morrone, people who do extreme fine dining, where people come for
the food, to be wowed, there for the experience. That's what I'd
like to see _ dinner-only, fine dining. It's something I'd like to
evolve to. But you need to prove yourself.

</P>
<P>
   1 cup whole milk
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   7 tablespoons roasted pumpkin seeds
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   2 eight-ounce monkfish fillets
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To prepare the squash:  &LR; Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Slice
the acorn squash in half, remove seeds and place the halves
cut-side up on a baking sheet. In the cavity of each squash half,
place 1 tablespoon butter, 1 tablespoon sugar and 4 tablespoons
orange juice. Season with salt and pepper. Bake for 30 to 40
minutes, until the squash is tender. Slice each half into 4
lengthwise sections.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To prepare the garlic:  &LR; Trim the leaf end of each garlic,
leaving 3 inches of green top, then trim 1/4 inch off the root
ends. Remove the first layer of skin. Bring the milk to a gentle
boil in a saucepan; season with salt and pepper. Add the spring
garlic and cook until it is tender.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To prepare the sauce:  &LR; Bring the stock and 3 tablespoons of the
pumpkin seeds to a boil in a saucepan; boil until reduced by half.

garlic and cherry tomatoes, remove from heat. Season with salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To cook the fish: &LR;  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Coarsely

cinnamon. Season the monkfish fillets with salt and pepper. Heat
the olive oil in an ovenproof saute pan until almost smoking. Add
the monkfish and sear until light brown on both sides, turning
once.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle the seed mixture on top of the fish to form a crust.
Place in the oven and bake for approximately 7 minutes, or until
the fish is just done.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To serve:  &LR; Divide the squash slices between 2 large, shallow
serving bowls. Top each with a spring garlic bulb. Divide the sauce
and tomatoes between bowls and top with the monkfish fillets.

 AT THE SOURCE: Seasonal Scent: Eatwell Farms' lavender crop 
 caters to a passionate market   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 WINTERS, Calif. _  Lavender, says Nigel Walker, is a wonderful mood
enhancer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He won't go quite as far as a friend who asked rhetorically,
``Who needs Prozac if there is lavender around?'' But he has
observed that ``these big, burly field workers sing more when they
tend the lavender.''
</P>
<P>
   There must be a lot of singing these days at Eatwell Farms, the
82-acre spread Walker and his wife, Frances Andrews, work in
Winters near Davis. On the farm, a full five acres are devoted to
the fragrant herb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lavender,'' admits Walker, ``is a passion of ours,'' and
despite friends' pessimistic warnings, the couple has found a
lively market for this, the most esoteric of their crops. (Diverse
fruits and vegetables, especially tomatoes, occupy most of
Eatwell's acreage.)
</P>
<P>
   Both husband and wife have farm blood in their ancestries. He
has a grandfather who farmed in the English Midlands, her's grew
peaches in Virginia, ``but both our parents had more sense than to
be farmers,'' Walker says with a chuckle. ``We both had proper
jobs, too.'' He worked for the BBC in his native Britain; Andrews
started her working life at Morgan Stanley in New York. She moved
west and took a job at Alice Waters' Cafe Fanny in Berkeley, then
at Full Belly Farms near her current home. The two met,
appropriately, at the Marin County farmers' market.
</P>
<P>
   Walker returned to college for a degree in horticulture, so
botanical names roll off his tongue with ease.
</P>
<P>
   He needs it to explain his lavender. There are early-blooming
Provence and Grosso, which are being harvested now _ the second and
third week of May is their peak season. Other lavenders come in
later, stretching the season into early summer _ Hidcote Giants,
Grapenhall, Seal, Super and more. All are fragrant, but each has
its own characteristics. Grosso produces the darkest purple
flowers; Super has the bushiest heads; short-stemmed Lavandula
angustifolia produces the most oil.
</P>
<P>
   Walker and Andrews hope to process some of the crop by drying or
using it in infused oils. For now, Eatwell's lavender is fresh,
sold at the Ferry Plaza Farmers' Market on Saturdays and tucked
into the 240 baskets of produce delivered weekly to subscribers in
San Francisco and the East Bay under a Community Supported
Agriculture program. ``It's a freebie,'' Walker says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   They have been surprised how many recipes use lavender as a
flavoring _ flans, custards, cookies, salads and savory dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Between the demands of the farm and their nearly three-year-old
twins, Andrew and Eric, cooking has not been a priority for the
farm couple. ``I don't spend much time in the kitchen,'' Walker
admits, and his wife chimes in, ``I certainly didn't marry you for
your cooking, darling; I married you for your accent.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Eatwell Farms is located in Winters (Yolo County). The &LR; 
 &LR; farm's products are sold Saturdays at the Ferry Plaza Farmers' &LR; 
 &LR; Market in San Francisco. The farm's phone number is (530) &LR; 
 &LR; 759-8221. &LR;

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Paper-Thin Layers of Vegetables Make Milhojas 
 Pintxos' Signature Dish   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Spanish cuisine isn't necessarily known for its
vegetarian specialties, but any successful restaurant in San
Francisco _ especially one that attracts a young crowd _ has to
offer more than a basic plate of grilled vegetables.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So chef Bernat Dones uses his imagination. He's created one of
the most enticing vegetable main courses I remember eating. It's
paper-thin layers of celery root, squash, eggplant and zucchini.
The vegetables are moistened with a drizzling of basil oil and
topped with tomatoes and a creamy crumble of goat cheese.
</P>
<P>
   It's a perfect dish for this trendy Mission District urban-chic
restaurant, which incorporates new and old elements. Modern blue
and yellow glass pendant lights hang over the tiled bar and
kitchen, and rustic pine floors provide a visual contrast to the
sleek molded wood chairs and the cool blue and yellow color scheme.
</P>
<P>
   With its sophisticated interior and innovative recipes, Pintxos
(pronounced PEEN-chos) does for Spanish/Basque food what the
groundbreaking Slanted Door _ just down the street _ did for
Vietnamese.
</P>

   &UR; _ Slicing the vegetables. &LR;  It's important to cut them as thinly
as possible to get their distinct flavor. If not, the flavors don't
merge correctly.

first cooked in a dry skillet to soften and brown them and
intensify the flavors.

VEGETABLE MILHOJAS WITH BASIL, TOMATO &AMP; GOAT CHEESE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound tomatoes, peeled, seeded and diced
</P>
<P>
   6 garlic cloves, smashed
</P>
<P>
   5 fresh basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound eggplant
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound zucchini
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound kabocha or other autumn squash, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound celery root, peeled
</P>
<P>
   About 4 tablespoons Basil Oil (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound soft, fresh goat cheese (such as Montrachet), crumbled
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add
the tomatoes, garlic and basil leaves. Season with salt and pepper.
Saute for 1 minute. Remove the garlic and basil. Refrigerate the
tomato sauce for at least 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Using a mandoline, cut the eggplant into thin circles about
1/8-inch thick. Cut the zucchini into long strips, about 1/8-inch
thick. Cut the squash and celery root into 1/16-inch-thick slices.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Do not add
any oil. Sprinkle the zucchini with salt and pepper. Add to the
skillet and saute until just soft, about 2 minutes per side.
Transfer to a platter.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat with the seasoning and sauteing about 2 minutes per side
with the eggplant. Transfer eggplant to the platter.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle the celery root with salt and pepper. Add to the
skillet and saute until barely soft, about 3 minutes per side.
Transfer to the platter.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat with the squash, seasoning it with salt and pepper and
sauteing 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the platter.
</P>
<P>
   Using an 8 x 8-inch oven-proof glass pan, layer the vegetables,
beginning with enough of the celery root to cover the bottom of the

TASTER'S CHOICE:

 CHRON  
EDITORS NOTE: Each week, The San Francisco Chronicle's panel of
professional tasters tries a different product available in
supermarkets.   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  With spring comes parties, picnic and barbecues.
And with all those get-togethers comes chips and dip.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week we gave you the results of a full-fat potato chip
tasting. This week, we've tasted onion dip to go with them.
</P>
<P>
   The panel sampled eight onion dips, two pre-made and six made
from mixes according to package directions. Overall, those made
from mixes ranked far higher than the pre-made versions found in
the refrigerator case. But only two dips had decent rankings. The
others had little onion flavor, off-putting colors or artificial
notes.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming favorite was  &UR; Mrs. Grass &LR;  (1.5 ounces, 89 cents
at Andronico's), which is made from a mix. It ranked very well.
Panelists described it as classic and just what they expected from
an onion dip. One panelist particularly liked the plump onion
pieces. All would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Safeway &LR;  (2 ounces, 99 cents at Safeway).
Panelists liked the flavor for the most part, but thought it was
too mild. One panelist described it as tangy; another thought it
was bland. All might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Campbell's &LR;  (2 ounces, $1.59 at Cala) came in third. Two
panelists thought it was too salty. One noticed the texture of
onions, but couldn't taste them. Others thought the onion flavor
was stale and artificial. One might buy it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Granny Goose &LR;  (.375 ounces, 79 cents at Draeger's) came in
fourth. One panelist liked the flavor, but others described it as
too sweet, powdery, bitter and gummy. One would buy it; four would
not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lipton &LR;  (2 ounces, $1.49-$1.59 at many supermarkets) scored
fifth, just one point lower than Granny Goose. Panelists disliked
the oily mouthfeel and said it tasted more like mayonnaise than
anything (the dip is made with sour cream). None would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Knorr, Marie's and Kraft but they scored
too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were Shelley Handler, consultant and food writer;
Patricia Hart, nutritionist and dietician; Julia McClaskey, chef,
Dine in San Francisco; Kim Severson, Chronicle staff writer; and
Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San Francisco. All products are
tasted blind.

 WINE POTPOURRI: Frozen North Produces Gold-Medal Ice Wines  Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; When your life revolves around eating and
drinking, there are some food and wine events you try never to
miss, like the Old Ebbitt Grill International Wines for Oysters
Competition. Nevertheless, the fourth annual matching of oysters
with white wine took place in November at the historic Old Ebbitt
Grill in Washington, D.C., without me.
<P>
   If you plan to be in the nation's capital this November, I
recommend the event. In fact, the competition is such a good way to
learn about pairing wine and oysters that it alone is worth a trip
to D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is simple. A gathering of wine and food
professionals narrows a field of 423 white wines from nine
countries down to a manageable 45 semifinalists. Then, a panel of
16 judges, most of whom profess an intimate knowledge of bivalves,
slurps and sips its way through the wines, accompanied by tiny
Olympic oysters, awarding 10 gold, 10 silver and 25 bronze medals.
For the true oyster lover, it's like dying and going to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever pried open a dozen fresh oysters while waiting
for the wine to chill, it comes as no surprise that Sauvignon Blanc
was the most oyster-friendly wine at the Old Ebbitt Grill taste
off. In fact, 9 of the 10 winners were Sauvignon Blancs, three of
them from New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   The grand champion medal went to Villa Maria 1999 Marlborough
Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc. First runner-up was Nautilus 1999
Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc; and second runner-up was Alan Scott
1999 Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. New Zealand Sauvignons scored two
more golds for Grove Mill 1999 Marlborough and Giesen 1998
Marlborough.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top gold-medal winners were three California
Sauvignons, including Husch Vineyards 1998, Amador Foothill Winery
1998 Fume Blanc, Cakebread Cellars 1998 and _ for the first time in
the competition _ a sparkling wine, Domaine Carneros 1995 Brut.
</P>
<P>
   Why did New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs score big as
oyster-friendly wines? The natural bracing acidity of Sauvignons
from the Marlborough region and the flavors of fresh lime juice and
passion fruit perfectly complement the briny flavors of fresh
oysters.
</P>
<P>
   But Sauvignon Blanc was not the only wine to win medals at the
Old Ebbitt Grill. Winning wines were also made from Chardonnay,
Chenin Blanc, Pinot Gris, Pinot Blanc, Riesling and Viognier.
</P>
<P>
   All of the winning wines were served with 25 varieties of
oysters at the Oyster Riot, an annual event held at the Old Ebbitt
Grill.
</P>
<P>
   If you would like more information about the Old Ebbitt Grill
International Wines for Oysters Competition, call Tom Meyer or
Maureen Mavin at (202) 333-9180.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Internet Wine News &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest news for wine fans who shop online is the new
partnership between WineShopper.com and Amazon.com. Through the
partnership, California wine shoppers can access 1,400 wines
through WineShopper, the Napa-based Internet start-up, or discover
the expanding world of wine through Amazon, a leading e-commerce
retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Besides taking on Amazon as a strategic partner, WineShopper has
formed exclusive partnerships with some of the country's leading
wine and food publications, including Wine Spectator, Connoisseur's
Guide to California Wine and WineToday.com. Links are planned from
the partner's web sites to WineShopper.com.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wine.com, another Napa-based wine e-tailer, announces
that Tapestry, a line of wines from Australia's McLaren Vale, has
re-entered the U.S. market and will be available only on Wine.com.
Tapestry, from McLaren Vale's Merrivale Winery, was first
introduced to U.S. wine drinkers in 1993. Available through
Wine.com are Tapestry Cabernet Sauvignon 1996 and Shiraz 1997, both
priced at $25, and Chardonnay 1998, $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Vintage 2000 Bud Break &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 wine grape growing season seems to be off to a good
start. Newly opened buds are out along California's coastal regions
from Napa Valley to Santa Barbara and in Washington state and
Oregon. Chalone Wine Group reports that a normal bud break follows
an overall mild winter with adequate rainfall. Chalone Wine Group
includes Canoe Ridge Vineyards in Washington and Carmenet, Echelon,
Acacia, Chalone Vineyards and Edna Valley Vineyard in California.
New to the Chalone Wine Group is Jade Mountain, a specialist in
Rhone-style wines in the Napa Valley.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Q &AMP; A &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Red wine gives me a nasty headache,'' says Vickie Hindershot
of Santa Cruz. ``Can you suggest some reds that won't?''
</P>
<P>
   The likely evidence that links headaches with red wine are the
phenolics found in all wine, but in larger quantities in red wine.
Histamines are another culprit in red wines that can cause
headaches in some people. You might try taking an antihistamine
before drinking red wine, but for some people, antihistamines are
known to interact with alcohol. The lighter the red wine, like
Gamay or French Beaujolais, the lower the histamines, since skin
contact through maceration is less.

 &HT;    CLINTON BRINGS IN FORD, CARTER TO HELP PRESS FOR OPENING UP
CHINA TRADE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton brought together the architects
of half a century of tortured U.S.-Chinese relations Tuesday to
endorse a controversial proposal to make China a fully credentialed
member of the global trading order.
</P>
<P>
   With former presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford at his side
_ and dozens of former diplomats and cabinet members looking on _
Clinton called on Congress to approve legislation that would grant
permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) to China.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would end the annual congressional debate over whether
to extend low tariff and other favorable trading benefits to the
world's most populous nation, and would compliment a landmark White
House agreement over the terms of China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who put human rights near the center of his
administration's foreign policy, said granting PNTR to China would
help promote democratization and wider freedoms in a country that
takes in one-fifth of the world's people.
</P>
<P>
   ``China still has not measured up to the human rights and
democracy standards and labor standards of America,'' Carter said,
speaking in the ornate East Room where he once held press
conferences and entertained fellow heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's no doubt in my mind that a negative vote on this
issue in the Congress will be a serious setback and impediment for
the further democratization, freedom and human rights in China,''
Carter said. ``And I hope the members of Congress will vote
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   With both houses of Congress expected to take up the PNTR
proposal in two weeks Clinton fired off a broadside against its
opponents, saying they had aligned themselves with conservative
hardliners and military leaders resisting economic and civil
reforms in China.
</P>
<P>
   Although observers expect that Clinton will win the crucial
House vote, it is still likely to be close. Enough so, that the
president was determined no to let up on the bill's opponents _
many of whom are Democrats _ on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's against it in China? The people that run the state-owned
industries, and don't want to give up their control; the more
conservative elements of the military, who would like to have
greater tensions between ourselves and them, and between themselves
and the people of Taiwan,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is truly ironic, when you look at who's against this in
China, to see that some of the most progressive people in the
United States are basically doing what they want them to do in
opposing this agreement,'' Clinton said. ``For me, it is very
painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Those remarks prompted return fire from those who oppose PNTR
with China, either out of concern for that country's poor human
rights record, its potential as a U.S. military adversary or
because U.S.-China trade is already badly out of kilter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that somehow there are two sides to the Chinese
government and that the pro-American side will be damaged and that
the other side will now come to predominance is ridiculous,'' said
Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who joined several of his colleagues
for a Capitol Hill news conference to oppose the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be real clear about this: the hardliners on this are in
the United States. The hardliners are the corporate bosses that are
in league with the political leadership in China so that they can
both make money,'' said Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't care about this country. They care about whether or
not their international corporate interests are going to advance,''
said Norwood, who is working to defeat PNTR. ``Both of these
hardliners will exploit labor. They will exploit labor in the
United States, and they'll exploit labor in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton countered such opposition Tuesday with an array of
seasoned firepower _ several dozen statesmen who played central
roles in the crafting of U.S. policy toward China.
</P>
<P>
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger _ whose secret
meetings with Communist Party head Mao Zedong led to U.S.-China
detente during the Nixon administration _ spoke in favor of PNTR,
as did James Baker, who served as Secretary of State when President
Bush visited Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in 1989, several months
before Chinese troops opened fire on unarmed demonstrators near
Beijing's Tiananmen Square, killing hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the audience was former National Security Adviser, Ret.
Gen. Brent Scowcroft, who made his own secret visit to Beijing in
the weeks following the Tiananmen massacre, at a time when Bush had
officially suspended top-level U.S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
   Also attending were former Secretary of State Warren Christopher
_ whose own human rights overtures drew a frosty snub from
officials in Beijing several years after the Tiananmen killings _
and former Secretary of State Alexander Haig, who defied U.S.
Ambassador to China James Liley and attended a Chinese anniversary
celebration in Tiananmen just four months after the bloody
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the lives of the people in this room, the last 50
years of America has unfolded,'' said Clinton. ``We want the voice
of this meeting to echo across the country, and to embrace the
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cast the issue in national security terms, saying that
to reject PNTR with China could strengthen the hand of hardliners
and militarists, perhaps increasing the likelihood of a U.S.-China
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's by far the most important national security vote that
will be cast this year,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   At is essence, though, the vote concerns trade.
</P>
<P>
   Last year China exported nearly $70 billion more worth of goods
and services to this country than it bought from American factories
and farms. Clinton claims that passing PNTR _ and endorsing China's
entry into the WTO _ would help level the playing field for U.S.
exporters to China. That, Clinton contends, would help to narrow
the trade gap and create new jobs for American workers.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that PNTR and WTO membership would have the
opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here because I want the Chinese to know the joy of Texas
products made by Texas workers,'' former Democratic Texas Gov. Ann
Richards told reporters at the White House immediately following
the event. ``From computers to agricultural products, we make the
best, and we want that billion-people market opened up.''

EDITORS NOTE: Here's a plan for getting quick meals on the table in
a hurry. Now &AMP; Later is a recipe cooked on the weekend in batches _
enough to serve 12 _ and functions as dinner on the night it's
prepared; freeze the rest for two future meals. The 30-Minute Main
Dish takes a half-hour or less of preparation and Fast &AMP; Fresh
gives you dinner in about 20 minutes. 
 
 THE WORKING COOK: Salmon or Pork Loin Could Win Points With Mom   By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  You might remember poached salmon from wedding
buffets of days gone by. The poor fish was skinned, poached whole,
then rearranged on a huge platter with cucumber ``scales'' to try
to make him look like his former self, when he once got to roam the
open seas or his fish farm.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It might be out of fashion, but poaching still is a very easy
and low-fat way to cook fish or poultry. All the fish needs is a
dip in a flavorful simmering broth or court bouillon; no oil is
used. It's also hard to dry out anything cooked in liquid, though
you still should avoid overcooking.
</P>
<P>
   In the 30-Minute Main Dish, Poached Salmon with Asparagus Rice
Pilaf, the fish is accompanied by a pilaf seasoned with lemon juice
and golden shallots. Asparagus pieces are folded into the pilaf
halfway through the cooking process to steam along with the rice.
</P>
<P>
   The Fast &AMP; Fresh recipe, Mushroom Marsala with Polenta, calls on
pregrated Parmesan cheese, preminced garlic and dried thyme for an
ultra-quick preparation. The creamy, vegetarian ragout is enlivened
with Marsala, which contrasts well with the crisp rounds of
polenta. If you like, serve it alongside wilted red chard or other
greens.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't get a reservation for Mother's Day, impress your
mom with an old-fashioned homemade roast, like the Roast Pork Loin
with Gingered Carrots &AMP; Watercress. This dish has lots of clean,
bright flavors and makes a nice presentation with its springy
orange and green color scheme. The gingered carrots are both sweet
and spicy, a good complement for the juicy roast tenderloin.

30-MINUTE MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   POACHED SALMON WITH ASPARAGUS RICE PILAF
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 quart chicken or vegetable stock
</P>
<P>
   2 large shallots
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups basmati rice
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons salt + salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 pound thin asparagus
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   4 salmon fillets (you can leave skin on), about 8 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   5 to 10 parsley sprigs or a few green onions
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat the stock in a large, wide pot. Mince the shallots.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven. Add the shallots and saute
until tender, about 2 minutes. Add the rice and stir until all the
grains are coated with oil. Add 21/2 cups of the heated stock, the
lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grindings of black pepper.
Stir and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add 4 cups of water to the remaining stock and bring to a boil.
Keep at a low simmer.
</P>
<P>
   Snap the tough ends off the asparagus and discard. Cut the
asparagus spears into 1-inch lengths, but leave the tips whole.
Zest the lemon and mince the zest (you should have 2 to 3
teaspoons). Reserve the rest of this lemon.
</P>
<P>
   After the rice has cooked 10 minutes, stir in the lemon zest and
asparagus. Return to a simmer, cover and cook until the rice is
tender, about 10 minutes longer. (Let stand, covered, for a few
minutes before serving.)
</P>
<P>
   Squeeze the juice from the reserved lemon into the heated stock
and add the vinegar, bay leaf and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil.
Submerge the salmon fillets in the liquid and poach until flaky but
still pink in the center of the thickest part, about 5 to 6
minutes. (If the fillets are not completely covered in liquid,
cover the pan.)
</P>
<P>
   Finely chop the parsley or thinly slice the green part of the
onions as garnish.
</P>
<P>
   When done, carefully lift the fillets from the broth. Place the
fillets over a bed of rice pilaf. Sprinkle with the parsley or
green onions.
</P>

   MUSHROOM MARSALA WITH POLENTA
</P>
<P>
   You can find prepared polenta in a refrigerated case in the
supermarket. I used Santini brand polenta with good results.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound white or crimini mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound shiitake mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   3 portobello mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   3 teaspoons prepared minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 (35-ounce) roll prepared polenta
</P>
<P>
   About 1/2 cup pregrated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bunch chives
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup Marsala
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup vegetable or chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cream
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Position oven rack at top of oven.
</P>
<P>
   Clean and trim the mushrooms. Cut into medium dice.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the
garlic and thyme and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the
mushrooms and season with salt and pepper. Saute until tender,
about 6 to 8 minutes, stirring often.
</P>
<P>
   Slice the polenta into eight 1/2-inch-thick rounds (you will
have one third of the roll left). Arrange on a small buttered
baking sheet and place on the top rack of the oven. Bake 5 minutes,
then sprinkle about 1/2 tablespoon Parmesan on top of each slice
and return to the oven until brown and crisp, about 2 minutes
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the chives into 1/2-inch lengths. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Increase the heat to high under the mushrooms and stir in the
Marsala. When the mixture is almost dry, add the stock. Bring to a
simmer, then reduce heat and stir in the cream. Heat through, then
adjust sauce for seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the polenta slices to shallow soup bowls. Ladle the
ragout over the polenta; top with more Parmesan and the chives.

   ROAST PORK LOIN WITH GINGERED CARROTS &AMP; WATERCRESS
</P>
<P>
   If you would like to save part of this recipe for later,
marinate as directed, then seal, uncooked, in a plastic freezer bag
with some of the marinade. Defrost the meat overnight in the
refrigerator, then cook according to directions. Purchase fresh
watercress and cook more carrots to serve with the leftover roast.
</P>
<P>
   The Marinade
</P>
<P>
   4 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons orange marmalade
</P>
<P>
   21/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup warm water
</P>
<P>
   The Pork
</P>
<P>
   2 (31/2-pound) pork tenderloins, trimmed
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   2 bunches watercress
</P>
<P>
   2 bunches medium-size carrots
</P>
<P>
   1 large shallot
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   About 11/2 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   Pinch cayenne
</P>
<P>
   Pinch allspice
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon honey
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Stir together the marinade ingredients, then add the pork and
refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the tenderloins from the marinade, pat dry. Season well
on all sides with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Place a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add enough oil to
cover the bottom of the pan completely, then heat until almost
smoking. Add the tenderloins and brown on all sides, but be careful
because the residual marinade burns easily.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the tenderloins to a large roasting pan, allowing
plenty of room between them. Fold under the thin end of each
tenderloin so the pieces are uniform in thickness. Roast for 30
minutes, or until the meat reaches at least 137 degrees
(medium/medium-rare) on an instant-read thermometer, inserted into
the thickest part of the pork. Remove from oven and let rest 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the pork roasts, cut the watercress stalks roughly in half
and arrange on a large serving platter.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the carrots and cut on the diagonal into 2-inch lengths.
Mince the shallot and ginger.
</P>
<P>
   Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium pot; add the ginger and
shallot and saute until tender, about 8 minutes. Add the carrots
and enough stock to just cover them, the cayenne, allspice and salt
to taste. Bring to a simmer and braise until the carrots are
tender, about 12 minutes. Discard all but 1/3 cup of the liquid,
then stir in the honey and the remaining tablespoon butter. Adjust
seasoning. Keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, place the tenderloins on the bed of watercress and
surround with carrots, leaving a frame of watercress around the
outside of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12.
</P>

 &LR; The calories and other nutrients absorbed from marinades vary &LR; 
 &LR; and are difficult to estimate. Variables include the type of &LR; 
 &LR; food, marinating time and amount of surface area. Therefore, &LR;   &LR; the
marinade is not included in this analysis. &LR;

 FOOD IN THE NEWS: California Says No to Biotech Labels  By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; The blossoming movement to label genetically
altered food sold in California restaurants and grocery stores took
some recent hits in Sacramento, but activists say their battle is
far from over.
<P>
   In late April, the state Senate's powerful agricultural
committee voted down a proposal by Sen. Tom Hayden, a Los Angeles
Democrat, that would have required labels on all food products that
had genetically modified ingredients. The proposed law would have
carried a 30-day jail sentence or a $2,500 fine for violators.
</P>
<P>
   Food producers and other groups, including the California
Restaurant Association, argued that it would be almost impossible
to track the origin of ingredients in many food products.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns ranged from problems tracking the feed given to cows to
how to label dishes on restaurant menus. Because restaurants often
change suppliers and create dishes based on available products, the
pressure to verify every ingredient would force chefs to limit
their menus and add excessive costs to restaurant meals, says John
Dunlap, president of the restaurant association.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise of sorts was reached last week,(MAY 2), &LR;  when the
agriculture committee approved a version of the bill that requires
the state to simply  &LR; consider &LR;  whether the labels are needed and
how to best do it. The issue now heads to the other side of the
floor, where supporters will try to get it through the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been shifted from `you should do it' to `maybe you should
do it,''' says a disappointed Marc Lappe, director of the Center
for Ethics and Toxics, the advocacy group leading the fight. ``It's
a defeat for the principle of labeling our food.''
</P>
<P>
   He concedes the battle to get the labels will be a long one, and
the fact that the committee even agreed to ask the Department of
Food and Agriculture and Department of Health Services to study it
is progress, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Clinton administration announced several steps
meant to assure the public that genetically engineered food is
safe, including a more formal process for reviewing new products
and more testing to determine their effects. But it said mandatory
labeling for food containing genetically engineered products was
not necessary. The food industry, which argued that labels would
unfairly stigmatize biotech food, applauded the plan. Consumer
advocates criticized it and plan to fight for the labels through
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Drop That Mussel &LR;
</P>
<P>
   As sure as asparagus and artichokes signal the arrival of
spring, so does the annual Department of Health Services quarantine
on mussels.
</P>
<P>
   The quarantine, aimed at preventing paralytic shellfish
poisoning, bans the consumption of any mussels harvested by the
public on California's beaches. It does not apply to commercially
harvested mussels. Shellfish gathered for grocery stores and
restaurants must be certified safe by the state and are taken from
waters regularly tested for the toxin that causes PSP.
</P>
<P>
   The quarantine began May 1 and lasts until Oct. 31. Although it
does not apply to sport-harvested clams or scallops, people who
gather those types of shellfish are advised to eat only the white
meat and to throw away dark-colored organs or viscera before
cooking. And, the health department reminds us, don't harvest those
types of shellfish from beaches close to sources of sewage or
chemical contamination.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call the health department's shellfish
information line at (510) 540-2605 or (800) 553-4133.

 STAR SEARCH: In the sea of young chefs, we've found five who
will  make a mark on the Bay Area dining scene  By Karola Saekel, Kim Severson, Robin Davis, Miriam Morgan and 
 Tilde Herrera  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; The past year has been an amazing one for
restaurants in the Bay Area, with exciting new places opening all
over the map. Small neighborhood spots have become destinations,
and splashier high-profile places have attracted diners in ever
increasing numbers.
<P>
   But what's made this explosion of restaurants even more
significant is the talent behind them _ the people in the kitchen
who turn out food that wows our palates and keeps us coming back
for more.
</P>
<P>
   They're not just the big names. Peeking behind the stoves, the
Food staff has uncovered five especially talented young chefs who
we bet will soon emerge as stars in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   Some have formal training; some don't. Their styles range from
straightforward and subtle to inventive and cross-cultural. But all
of them infuse their cooking with a love for what they do, and the
skills to excel at it.
</P>
<P>
   Their passion is on the plate _ and we're all the luckier for
it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ALEXANDER ONG &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Karola Saekel &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If Alexander Ong's classic culinary training needed to be honed
to a razor's edge, he got his chance in Florida, when the
Ritz-Carlton organization made him a 911 chef.
</P>
<P>
   Like a paramedic, the 911 chef rushes off at a moment's notice
to rescue a kitchen in dire need: When a sous chef is hospitalized
with bleeding ulcers, another is thrown in the slammer after an
altercation in a bar, or yet another walks out in a huff on the eve
of a convention. Pinch-hitting in these situations is a challenge,
Ong admits.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a life Ong would have liked to live forever, but ``it
was a chance to learn a lot about how America works and see a good
part of the country for a single guy.'' (He has since married
Kimberly Norton, whom he met in Florida and who is now his pastry
chef.)
</P>
<P>
   Ong already had a handle on how hotel kitchens work in other
parts of the world. The son of a professional couple in Malaysia,
he wasn't interested in an academic career. After graduating from a
Catholic high school, he headed for Kuala Lumpur and a job as a
banquet server at the huge Shangri-La Hotel. His ambition was to
get into the ``controlled chaos'' of the 600-cook kitchen. The chef
finally gave in to his pleadings and told the 17-year-old to report
to the kitchen the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got myself properly outfitted in chef's whites,'' Ong
recallstells &LR;  with a grin. ``The chef took one look at me and said,
`Now get out of that uniform and put on a dishwasher's shirt.' It
was humbling, but I wasn't about to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers couldn't understand why a son of the middle class
would want to be a menial laborer. `` `You could work in a nice
office,' they used to tell me.'' But he persisted. Three months
later, when a prep cook left, he got his chance.
</P>
<P>
   From then on Ong's career has spiraled ever upwards. Wanting to
work in the United States but not being able to obtain a visa _
``it's not like high-tech workers; cooks are a dime a dozen'' _ he
settled for a position in Bermuda. It wasn't a bad life _ good pay
undiminished by taxes, no rent and free food. With a British
Commonwealth passport, ``We could fly to New York in the morning,
shop in Chinatown, have two lunches and be back in our dormitory by
night.''
</P>
<P>
   But the work was uninspiring _ ``three-bean salad straight from
the can,'' he explains with a comic little shudder _ so he jumped
at an offer from the Atlanta Ritz-Carlton, later transferring to
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Always looking for new challenges, there followed stints at
Caesar's Tahoe, Orocco East-West Supper Club in San Francisco's
Richmond District, in friend Chris Yeo's Straits Cafe, at Stars and
briefly as opening chef at Le Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   When longtime acquaintance, restaurant entrepreneur George Chen
(who owns Betelnut, Shanghai 1930, Long Life Noodle Co.), invited
him into a new venture, Xanadu, he saw new opportunities. He helped
design the place and, with Chen, took a nonstop eating jaunt across
Asia, gathering ideas for the menu they call RestorAsian.
</P>
<P>
   Like the master of the mythical Xanadu (in historic reality,
Shang-tu), the restaurant embraces all the regions of Kublai Khan's
far-flung empire.
</P>
<P>
   Between these pan-Asian inspirations and Ong's classic French
training and Malaysian sensibilities, creating a fusion menu
slanted toward restorative combinations was a natural. But Ong
doesn't strive for an Asian version of a healthy-crunchy approach.
He doesn't get into Chinese herbalism and he asserts that yin and
yang are all very well _ up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food,'' he says, ``has to taste good.''

<P>
   1/2 cup apricot preserves
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup whole-grain mustard
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups unsweetened coconut milk
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   12 spears grilled or blanched asparagus
</P>
<P>
   Mango Salsa (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the marinade:  &LR; Stir the sugar into the warm water until
completely dissolved. Add the soy sauce, star anise and cardamom.
Let cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   Add the duck breasts and let marinate for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the sauce:  &LR; Meanwhile, combine the cranberries, apricot
preserves, mustard and coconut milk in a saucepan. Bring to a boil,
reduce heat and simmer slowly for a few minutes until the sauce
thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Let cool for about 8
minutes, then puree in a blender. Season with lime juice and salt.
Keep the sauce warm.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To cook the duck:  &LR; Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Remove the
duck breasts from the marinade and dry on paper towels. Heat the
vegetable oil in a heavy pan until almost smoking. Sear the breasts
skin-side down for about 1 minute over high heat. Turn and sear the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the duck breasts to a roasting pan and roast until done
to your liking: about 10 minutes for rare meat, 13 minutes for
medium. Let rest 8 minutes before slicing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To serve:  &LR; Place 3 asparagus spears on each serving plate.
Spoon equal portions of the sauce over the asparagus. Slice the
duck breasts on the diagonal and fan out over the asparagus. Place
a spoonful of Mango Salsa on each serving of duck. Pass the
remaining salsa at the table.

 &UR; MARK ZEITOUNI &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Kim Severson &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Some chefs are driven to nourish people. Others simply love food.
For Mark Zeitouni, it's all about art.
</P>
<P>
   That makes sense, since the 29-year-old protege of Fifth Floor
chef George Morrone spent much of his time in college studying fine
art.
</P>
<P>
   Zeitouni fell into cooking as a way to make a living while he
was doing something else. He started working in kitchens in high
school and continued while an art student at the University of
Florida. He eventually dropped out and decided to attend the
culinary arts program at Johnson &AMP; Wales University, graduating
magna cum laude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to see food as artistic medium,'' he says. ``You can
put a lot of creative energy into one day of being a chef. You
don't have to wait three months to sell a painting to get that
satisfaction of pleasing someone with your art. There's immediate
gratification.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of April, Zeitouni left his job as the opening chef
at Berkeley's French-styled Bistro Viola. This month finds him
helping his friend Philip Kaufman open Soleil in Palo Alto's Westin
Hotel and spending two weeks filling in for a vacationing Morrone
at Fifth Floor.
</P>
<P>
   Morrone has played a central role in Zeitouni's development as a
chef. Zeitouni worked under Morrone for three years, first at the
Delano Hotel in Miami Beach and later at One Market in San
Francisco. Zeitouni then spent a year in the executive chef slot at
Reed Hearon's Black Cat in North Beach before moving across the
bay.
</P>
<P>
   Zeitouni and Bistro Viola's owner, Pat Bryant agree that they
parted ways on good terms. The restaurant is changing to a more
neighborhood-style bistro, and Zeitouni wants a chance to further
develop and showcase his style.
</P>
<P>
   His food is subtle, allowing the focus to stay on the
ingredients rather than cooking style or cunning combinations. His
dishes are light on starch and highlight one or two elements _ the
broth in a baby vegetable pot-au-feu is not much more than lightly
seasoned stock perfumed with vegetables; grilled salmon is dressed
in the barest of outfits _ lemon vinaigrette, parsnip puree and
grilled asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've used the word feminine before,'' he says. ``I don't use
brash flavors. It's very French with interesting twists.''
</P>
<P>
   He loves cooking in the Bay Area because the emphasis is on
top-drawer ingredients. Vegetables' quality, for example, allows
them to be the highlight of a dish, rather than a supporting
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be just a carrot,'' he says, ``but it's this
beautiful, round, perfect baby carrot.''
</P>

BLEU DE CHEVRE &AMP; WATERCRESS PAN SOUFFLE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch watercress
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup + 1 teaspoon butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   11/4 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   8 egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   8 egg whites
</P>
<P>
   1 cup crumbled blue de chevre, or other blue cheese
</P>
<P>
   3 ripe tomatoes, cut into wedges
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Trim off any yellowed leaves
and tough stems from watercress. Chop half of the watercress
(you'll need approximately 1 cup); set the remainder aside for
garnish.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the 1/2 cup butter in a heavy-gauge saucepan. Add the
flour, cornstarch and salt and cook over medium-low heat, stirring
constantly, until the mixture forms a paste. Transfer to the bowl
of an electric mixer, and with the mixer on low speed, slowly add
the milk and egg yolks. Mix until well blended.
</P>
<P>
   Beat the egg whites until they hold stiff peaks. Fold the whites
into the batter, then fold in the chopped watercress.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the 1 teaspoon butter in a nonstick 6- or 8-inch saute pan.
Add the batter and cook over medium heat until the souffle is
slightly colored on the edges, similar to a pancake. Scatter the
crumbled cheese over the top, then place the pan in the oven for a
couple of minutes until the eggs set up and the cheese softens.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer to a serving plate; garnish with tomato wedges and
watercress sprigs.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

&HT;     WITNESS: REILLY `HAPPY AS A FOX' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: FIXES lede, changing papers' to paper's)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A newspaper consultant for Clint Reilly, who has
brought an antitrust suit to block the Hearst Corp. from buying the
San Francisco Chronicle, acknowledged Tuesday that when he filed a
sworn declaration saying that local publisher Ted Fang would need a
$50 million a year subsidy to successfully publish the San
Francisco Examiner, he included only the paper's costs and no
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Ingram also admitted that his declaration should have
said the Fangs would need a subsidy of ``up to'' $50 million per
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram, a former vice president of operations for the San
Francisco Newspaper Agency, which provides business operations such
as circulation, advertising, printing for the Examiner and
Chronicle, also testified that Reilly was ``happy as a fox in a hen
house'' when he learned that Hearst would offer a subsidy to the
Examiner's buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram's testimony opened the second week of trial before U.S.
District Judge Vaughn R. Walker on real estate investor and former
mayoral candidate Reilly's suit.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hockett, a lawyer for the Fang family, the
publishers of the San Francisco Independent who are seeking to buy
Hearst's Examiner, sought to show that the Fangs could successfully
publish The Examiner with a subsidy from Hearst of up to $66
million over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly was an unsuccessful bidder for The Examiner. A Hearst
executive testified last week that Reilly had requested a subsidy
larger than the one offered to the Fangs.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph M. Alioto, Reilly's attorney, indicated in his trial
brief that Reilly offered March 7 to buy The Examiner, seeking a
$200 million subsidy from Hearst during a six-year period.
</P>
<P>
   In cross-examination, Hockett asked Ingram about a Feb. 13
e-mail Ingram wrote after speaking with Reilly, who was then
negotiating with Hearst and had just learned that Hearst was
willing to give a subsidy to the Examiner's buyer.
</P>
<P>
   In the e-mail, Ingram said: ``I talked with Clint late last
night. He was happy as a fox in a hen house.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockett asked Ingram why was Reilly was happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know much about foxes,'' Ingram replied.
</P>
<P>
   Hockett shot back, ``It's not because they're about to do
something good for the public, is it?''
</P>
<P>
   Walker interjected that the question was argumentative, and
Hockett withdrew it.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which will decide the future of San Francisco's daily
newspapers, is scheduled to run through the end of this week.
Witnesses are expected to include Hearst President Frank Bennack,
Fang and Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst was expected to begin putting its defense case on
Tuesday, a Hearst lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly contends Hearst's plan to buy the morning Chronicle for
$660
</P>
<P>
   million and to sell its smaller afternoon Examiner to the Fang
family will
</P>
<P>
   give Hearst the only metropolitan daily newspaper based in San
Francisco, which he says would be an illegal monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly claims Hearst's proposal to sell The Examiner to the
Fangs for $100 and give them a subsidy of up to $66 million to
defray publishing costs is a ``sham,'' because the subsidy is
insufficient and The Examiner will fail.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto claims Hearst's purchase violates federal antitrust laws
and the 1970 Newspaper Preservation Act.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Halling, a lawyer for Hearst, has argued that The Examiner
could not survive outside its profit-sharing agreement with the
Chronicle, and that because it is an economically failing
enterprise Hearst legally may shut it or sell it and buy the
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Halling also has denied that Hearst's sale of The Examiner to
the Fangs is a sham, and says Hearst is not required to give any
buyer a subsidy. Halling has said Hearst gave the Fangs a subsidy
to satisfy concerns of local politicians, who have said San
Francisco should have at least two daily papers.
</P>
<P>
   The Fangs, who publish the free, three-times-a week Independent,
also have denied The Examiner deal is a sham.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony last week, Examiner publisher Timothy O. White said
he had offered San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown favorable editorial
treatment in return for Brown's support of Hearst's plan to buy the
Chronicle. Hearst put White on indefinite leave and is
investigating whether White violated journalistic ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Other testimony showed that The Examiner earned a $20.5 million
profit last year under its profit-splitting agreement with the
Chronicle. Hearst executives, however, testified that if Hearst had
to carry its full publishing costs outside the agreement it would
lose money.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, Hearst and the Chronicle Publishing Co. have had a
joint operating agreement under which they share printing,
circulation and marketing and all revenue from both papers. After
paying shared costs, they split the remainder, and each paper pays
the costs of its independent editorial staffs.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements are allowed under the Newspaper Preservation Act,
which was meant to keep alive newspapers that otherwise might fail
so communities could benefit from multiple editorial voices.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, representatives of both Hearst and the Chronicle said
that one of the papers would likely fold if they were forced to
economically compete against each other.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was set to expire in 2005, but the Chronicle's
owners decided to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto has argued that Hearst abused its position in the joint
operating agreement to ward off other potential bidders for the
Chronicle and gain an unfair advantage buying the paper. Both
Hearst and the Chronicle have denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
   The trial on Reilly's suit is the nation's first on a challenge
to the breakup of a joint operating agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle is the nation's 12th largest daily newspaper, with
a circulation of 465,535. The Examiner's circulation is 108,986.

THINGS GET INTERESTING, UGLY IN CROWDED HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
With BIGBRO 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's the good news that hit Spain's incarnation of the TV
sensation ``Big Brother,'' currently entering its third week on the
air: Within two weeks, two of the participants _ who had agreed to
spend 100 days locked in a house with eight other strangers under
the watchful eyes of a battery of cameras for the amusement of the
entire country _ had already begun a sizzling romance.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the bad news: The female half of that couple was voted
out by viewers in that second week.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more good news: Her departure earned a
whopping 46 share, outdone only by its repeat on the weekly
highlights episode, which drew a staggering 75 percent of all
viewers watching TV. This was in no small part because her exit met
with a tearful farewell from her partner _ ``The man stood in the
doorway, crying, shouting, 'I want to marry you when I get out! I
love you so much!''' exults ``Big Brother'' executive producer Paul
Romer, who created the original series for Netherlands television.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how big a phenomenon ``Big Brother'' _ which will make
its American debut on CBS in July _ is in Spain: It beat out the
European soccer tournament in the ratings, something never before
achieved or even thought conceivable. It was a huge hit last year
in the Netherlands, and has been so far as well in Germany, where
the contestants are about two-thirds of the way through their run.
Given American audiences' fervor for reality programming, it could
well ace out ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' as the water-cooler
discussion topic of choice.
</P>
<P>
   America's ``Big Brother'' house is currently under construction
on the CBS Radford lot in Studio City. When it's up and running, 10
contestants selected from across the United States will enter the
house and commence being the subject of non-stop scrutiny for 100
days. Unlike ``MTV's The Real World,'' participants cannot leave
their premises to interact with the outside world. Every week or
so, one contestant (of two selected by a secret vote of the house's
inhabitants) will be voted out by viewers.
</P>
<P>
   It'll pay to be popular: The last surviving home dweller wins
$500,000; the runner-up $100,000. And, of course, individual
members can parlay as much fame and wealth from their participation
in the project as they can muster. When the Dutch series ended, the
winner went on to a part in a movie and numerous commercial
endorsements. The runner-up released his own CD; two women appeared
in Dutch Playboy magazine and another now co-hosts a weekly
entertainment program.
</P>
<P>
   When it premieres in July, ``Big Brother'' will be stripped
across the network's prime time schedule: A half-hour at 8 p.m.
every Monday, Tuesday and Friday; a live, hourlong broadcast in
which psychologists and participants' family members offer their
observations airs 8 p.m. Thursdays, along with an hourlong recap of
the week's events at 8 p.m. Saturdays. (CBS's other reality series,
``Survivor,'' will air on Wednesdays.) In addition, four different
Internet sites will stream non-stop material from the home 24 hours
a day. Though cameras will be set up in the house's bathroom,
that's simply for security reasons, Romer says (in case, say, a
participant has a heart attack); none of that material will air on
TV or the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Creator Romer admits the producers require a super-human
contribution from the participants, and says they emphasize to the
contestants how difficult life may be for them in the weeks leading
up to the broadcast date.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very easy,'' he says. ``We made sure we prepared our
house guests as well as we could, psychologically as well as
physically. We told them everything they could expect for those
three months, and everything they could expect after. They were
aware of what was waiting for them. We didn't want to hide that
from them, we didn't want to give them a surprise. They were aware
of what they'd be facing. It's like preparing astronauts for a trip
to the moon _ we told them everything.''
</P>
<P>
   As for romantic encounters, Romer says, ``We don't really
encourage that, but they will be there. This show is about human
behavior, and relationships are part of that. We told married
people and people with partners _ we made them aware that over 100
days, people would fall in love, and that could affect their
private life. But when we were selecting the contestants, we were
looking for people who were open to possibilities, and counting on
the fact that some relationships will appear.'' To date, Romer
says, no marriages have been broken up by ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   If it isn't already, ``Big Brother'' is on the verge of becoming
a global phenomenon: After the U.S. start-up in July, nearly a
dozen more countries will begin similar programs in September,
including Italy, Switzerland and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   And those interested in applying for the American series can
still do so through May 12: Application forms and information are
available at CBS.com.

TV REVIEWER TRIES OUT FOR ``BIG BROTHER''
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
With BIGBRO 
(Undated: TV news media.))
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lisa Nowicki, who was ``doing the usual receptionist/temp
routine'' until her break at stardom comes (she has her own 24/7
Web site at !bold!aspiringactresses.com!off!), said she showed up
even though members of actors unions were specifically discouraged
from auditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to come no matter what they say,'' Nowicki
reasoned. ``I've already been interviewed by Channel 2 and now, by
you that only helps actors. Any crazy thing that an actor can do,
they !ital!will!off!.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of privacy did concern her, she admitted: ``Where would
I do my yoga? In the mornings, I need to be very quiet and light my
candles and be able to do my yoga.'' She added that the fact that
she has her own intrusive Web site demonstrates she could handle
``Big Brother's'' demands; if she won the $500,000 prize for being
the last contestant standing (after viewer votes eliminate
contestants that fall from their favor), she said, she'd ``make a
film with all my unemployed friends to help us get a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aspiring performer was waiter Andrew Moran, who said the
close living quarters didn't faze him: ``I'm living with five
people in a two-bedroom apartment now, and that's not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Moran described the show as ``a three-month powwow the people
who do this will have to be smart. The people who were on `MTV's
Real World' were really stupid. This show is the most interesting
thing I've ever heard of it's like a piece of real life is being
taken out and put on a pedestal for audiences to view.''
</P>
<P>
   Moran said he responded to the question ``What types of people
would you choose to have living with you in the house?'' with:
``nine women.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Matthews, a student attending culinary school, and Felicia
Walker, a leasing consultant and writer, applied together. Walker
said being holed up for three months with utter strangers couldn't
be any worse than the past year of her life. ``I have nothing to
lose I was nearly paralyzed in an accident and almost had to file
for bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews declared that if selected, he wouldn't provide any sort
of sensationalist confrontations. He said, ``Take away the hype,
and what's left? Yourself. I'm not gonna give 'em what they want
I'm gonna get what I want out of it for me.'' The $350-per-week pay
for contestants, he said, is better than he's done in other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalyn Earl, a student at California State University, Long
Beach, said she would hate to sacrifice the ability to hang with
her boyfriend, but admitted that L.A. Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant
figured prominently in answers on her questionnaire. What would
Earl bring with her to the ``Big Brother'' house? Kobe. How would
she use any fame she got from ``Big Brother''? To meet celebrities
like Kobe.
</P>
<P>
   (Unwittingly, Earl may have hit on a dirty little secret
</P>
<P>
   celebrities have created an American caste system, since they
only seem to commune with other celebrities; the rest of us dregs
have to consort with other dregs.)
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the house would likely be populated with some
antagonistic personalities, Earl said, ``I'm usually a nice person,
but if people act like a-holes, I'd be an a-hole back. They (the
show's producers) would get their confrontation.'' I admit I agree.
</P>
<P>
   I answered the question ``List three (3) items you would take
with you into the Big Brother House if allowed and why'' thusly:
</P>
<P>
   ``1.) Books, so I wouldn't have to interact with those other
bozos. 2.) A pamphlet of inspirational verse, so that I can comfort
others in an irksomely superficial fashion in times of woe. 3.) A
garrote: Just in case.''
</P>
<P>
   But I made, to my mind, a convincing pitch as to why I belonged
on the show in my audition tape. I explained the dramatic concept
of the ``Greek chorus'' (coming, I explained, from ancient theater
from some ancient land Greece, I believed) and, since I was
addressing illiterate TV executives, explained the literary conceit
of meta-fiction (roughly, a narrator's own self-consciousness while
telling a story).
</P>
<P>
   I further declared that, as a TV critic, I could review the show
as it took place and thereby create a new genre
</P>
<P>
   meta-non-fiction. And, since the show's creative conceits tended
to drag it from the narrow definition of ``reality,'' my commentary
on the series' very ``irreality'' would restore its truthfulness
and integrity. Plus, there'd be one at least nominally good review
they'd be assured.
</P>
<P>
   If I get called back for the next round of auditions
</P>
<P>
   and, heavens, given such compelling answers and arguments, don't
you think I will? we'll keep you posted.

TV REVIEWER TRIES OUT FOR ``BIG BROTHER''
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
With sidebar slugged BROSIDE 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For CBS' upcoming summer program ``Big Brother'' (tagline: ``TV
has never been so real''), 10 guinea pigs _ er, sorry,
!ital!contestants _ will be chosen largely on the basis of their
ability to irritate one another.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, they will be stranded in a house with but two
bedrooms and one bathroom, in which hot water (and, no doubt,
toilet paper) will be strictly rationed.
</P>
<P>
   They'll have to grow their own vegetables and slaughter their
own chickens if they want to eat. They'll not be allowed to speak
to friends and family or, even, leave their narrow environs.
</P>
<P>
   They won't be allowed access to newspapers or TV or anything
that might give them an idea of what's going on elsewhere on their
planet (should global-nuclear warfare occur, they'll be the last to
know they're dead meat). They'll have their every embarrassing
behavior, their every idiotic utterance, captured by cameras and
disseminated to America via network television and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They'll become symbols of a land's narcissism and an emerging
national hunch that one's life doesn't count unless it takes place
before TV cameras. They'll become regular jokes on Leno and
Letterman, and once their travails have concluded, they are likely
to slouch back into obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   All this begs the question: Just what kind of freaking moron
would even consider participating in this legalized torture?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, I showed up at the auditions at KCBS, application
in hand, a little after 7 p.m. last Wednesday. Since I had my
application already filled out, I immediately jumped to the front
of the line of 25 or so people. I spoke to some of the other
hopefuls as they exited the process.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lenchner, a clinical psychologist/disc
jockey/professional street dancer (honest!), explained his
rationale for wanting to be on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to putting other people under scrutiny. I watch
people on my couch _ it's only fair to let people on their couches
watch me.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his varied careers, he added, ``I'm great at meeting
strangers _ I thought that my life is so interesting, it'd be good
for TV. How many other doctors do you know who are also hip-hop
performers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Dre?'' I offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a licensed medical doctor,'' Lenchner pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a two-minute taped audition, aspirants must
contribute two photos and fill out an 11-page questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   The questions run the gamut, from ``Have you ever been to a nude
beach?'' to ``Have you ever had a restraining order issued against
you? If so, tell us about it (include dates).''
</P>
<P>
   That one, of course, comes in the wake of Fox's abject
humiliation over the whole ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' snafu, where the moneyed man in question had
apparently caused some grief to a former girlfriend. I offered as
my answer, ``Let's just say I've never been handed one.'' I figure,
they've hired some private investigators; let `em earn their keep.
</P>
<P>
   Other queries:
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Have you ever had an interesting job?''
</P>
<P>
   A: ``TV critic; hence, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``What is your favorite movie?''
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Network.'' (For those with a limited sense of film history,
``Network'' is an Oscar-winning satire from 1976 decrying media
excesses which have all, in the quarter-century since the film's
release, become tame by TV2K standards. In other words, it was
simultaneously anticipating a show like ``Big Brother'' and finding
it absolutely reprehensible.)
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Q: ``Who is your hero and why?''
</P>
<P>
   !folo!A: ``Edgar Allan Poe, because he freed the slaves.''
(Note: I know, I know, but the one other time I was up to be on TV,
I was turned down because the producer said I was ``too erudite,''
and I didn't want that to be an issue here).
</P>
<P>
   !folo! Q: ``Describe your perfect day.''
</P>
<P>
   !folo!A: ``Waking up amidst nine other strangers under heavy,
virtually insane surveillance and exchanging superficial
pleasantries as these chuckleheads irritate me with their inane
chatter and doing a slow boil until about 7 p.m., when I reach for
my AK47 and silence the nattering brood. Why 7 p.m.? So the folks
at the local TV news can make it for their 11 p.m. broadcast.'' (I
concede it might give them pause for concern, but I think I prove
I'm a team player with my thoughtful gesture toward the TV news
media.)

<P>
   Pure cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually nothing redeemable for the majority of viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours of your life you will never, ever get back.
</P>
<P>
   What we're saying is, don't miss ``Growing Up Brady'' (9 p.m.
Sunday, May 21, WNYT Ch. 13), the behind-the-scenes drama about the
actors who made up that bunch of Bradys.
</P>
<P>
   The continued interest in and passion for ``The Brady Bunch''
serves as a perfect metaphor for the longings of baby boomers, as
fortysomethings ache to cleanse the unsavory memories of their
youths in the timeless fountain of wholesome, family-friendly
values.
</P>
<P>
   That's one possibility. More likely, ``The Brady Bunch'' adds up
to nothing more than a stupid sitcom that's managed to run ad
nauseam for the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a cynical time in the '70s,'' said Barry Williams,
still known today simply as Greg. ``The Bradys was out of step with
all of that. What we're experiencing now is a nostalgic look at a
time in people's lives that was nicer, more innocent, less
complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia, that is, not for the lives we led, but the lives we
watched on TV. Williams, in a conference call with reporters,
cautions that ``The Brady Bunch'' isn't meant to be a philisophical
touchstone. Thanks for the heads-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important with `The Brady Bunch' ... to not make
it more than it is,'' Williams said. The actor _ who often referred
to the 1969-'74 show in the present tense _ said it was an
unpretentious, idealistic family sitcom with a light moral flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Embrace the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   If you have no experience growing up with ``The Brady Bunch''
(once part of ABC's tremendous Friday-night lineup that for a time
included ``The Partridge Family,'' ``Room 222,'' ``The Odd Couple''
and ``Love, American Style''), there's no reason to watch this
behind-the-scenes biofilm.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're of the right age group, or have seen the endless
reruns _ or the Saturday morning cartoon, or the television movies,
or the lesser spinoff series ``The Brady Wives'' and ``The Bradys''
_ this biopic is worth watching just to see:
</P>
<P>
   _ Greg make out with Marcia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan and Peter go on a date.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cindy and Bobby get married (calm down; it was during the
show's first year).
</P>
<P>
   _ Greg go on a date with his mother, Carol. (You da man!)
</P>
<P>
   _ What happened to Tiger _ and it's not good.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cousin Oliver _ that insufferable late addition to the cast _
not mentioned for the whole two hours.
</P>
<P>
   _ Greg make out with Marcia.
</P>
<P>
   Admit it: Your first reaction to the Greg-Marcia liaison is
``Iiicck _ they're brother and sister.'' (While some chronology and
minor facts were changed, Williams said the one piece of history he
really wanted to rewrite was the details of his relationship with
Maureen McCormick.) We just saw the characters, never bothering
with the actors playing them; this film breaks down the walls we've
erected between the Bradys and the real people.
</P>
<P>
   Williams served as co-executive producer on ``Growing Up
Brady,'' which is based on his 1992 book (subtitled ``I was a
Teenage Greg''). He calls the treatment affectionate yet honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a point of speaking to each of the cast members ...
about the nature of the project,'' Williams said. ``We're not
dealing with the characters in this movie; we're dealing with the
people. My movie picks up when the (TV show's) director yells
`Cut.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the movie is about as deep as the show, and makes no
attempt to slash and burn anyone. Some of the other main actors
cooperated on the project; McCormick, however, was notably absent.
</P>
<P>
   And after the two theatrical ``Brady Bunch'' movies that ripped
this eminently rippable show, you can understand the reluctance of
the original cast to being involved with any ``Brady'' project.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been so much goofing on `The Brady Bunch,' so much
spoofing ... I wanted to reassure (the cast) that was not this
story,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Notables in the cast-playing-the-cast include Michael Tucker
(``L.A. Law'') as the eminently patient executive producer Sherwood
Schwartz (the real Schwartz makes a cameo at the end of the film)
and Scott Lookalind, who plays his look-alike dad Michael Lookalind
(Bobby).
</P>
<P>
   The other original cast members are portrayed, although it was
disappointing not to see more screen time for the actress playing
Schenectady's Ann B. Davis (the maid Alice Nelson). As Robert Reed,
Daniel Hugh Kelly (``Oh Baby'') gets the most dramatic role: Reed
was a serious actor who was constantly upset by the series'
juvenile scripts, a gay man uncomfortable with kissing Henderson,
but a performer who always showed a genuine paternal affection for
his fellow cast members.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Growing Up Brady'' we don't see the actors playing the
actors; we finally see the actors who played Greg and Marcia and
Jan, Peter, Bobby and Cindy as people. While ``certain members are
intent on distancing themselves from the show,'' Williams said, he
embraces his fate. He will always be Greg Brady _ so why not make
some money off of it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grateful,'' Williams said. ``It would be looking the gift
horse in the mouth to say, `Gee, I had this great hit record, but I
don't want to sing it anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   After not one but two ``Partridge Family'' movies this season,
plus another ``Brady Bunch'' behind-the-scenes drama slated for Fox
on May 16, we don't want to hear the song of the '70s sitcoms too
much longer.
</P>
<P>
   But like ``Stairway to Heaven'' _ and those Kraft individual
slices in the back of the fridge _ it's comforting to know they're
there.

   WASHINGTON, May 9 - A key House vote over whether to ease
sanctions on food and medicine trade to to Cuba and other terrorist
countries is expected to ignite ideological tensions today.
</P>
<P>
   The case against the 40-year-old sanctions against Cuba gained
momentum yesterday as the Senate Appropriations Committee passed an
amendment to exempt food and medicine from the embargo that bars
U.S. businesses from trading with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A House version passed subcommittee last week, sending it to the
full Appropriations committee for what is expected to be a divisive
debate and a close vote. If it passes, it would go to the House
floor for a vote late next week.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of easing sanctions, including Representative J.
Joseph Moakley, Democrat of South Boston, argue a change is needed
in a policy, they say, harms Cuban people by denying them basic
agricultural goods and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 40 years, it is clear it hasn't worked,'' said the
bill's Senate sponsor, Senator Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota
Democrat. ``This embargo only hurts poor people and sick people.''
</P>
<P>
   The push among U.S. businesses eager to tap unopened markets to
ease sanctions against Cuba, Libya, Iran and other nations where
trade is probibited has intensified since a similar bill to the one
before the Congress was introduced last year.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill fell three votes short of passage in a
House-Senate conference last year when House Republicans removed
Cuba from the measure, despite heavy lobbying from the American
Farm Bureau and the United States Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders in the House Appropriations Committee said they
intended to kill the measure again, saying they opposed granting
concessions to Cuban leader Fidel Castro along ideological - rather
than economic -- grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone thinks poor people of Cuba will benefit from lifted
sanctions they are totally wrong,'' said the committee's chair,
Representative C.W. Young, a Florida Republican. ``I'm not prepared
to give Castro one inch.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas and the House
Majority Whip, sent letters yesterday urging other yesterday to
vote against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Appropriations Committee is the wrong venue for debating
this issue,'' DeLay said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   The provision, introduced by Representative George Nethercutt,
Republican of Washington, lifts restrictions on trade between U.S.
business and Cuba, Iran, Libya, Sudan and North Korea. It includes
a provision allowing the president to unilaterally cut off food and
medicine sales in areas where hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with Cuba?,'' said Moakley, who led a
fact-finding delegation of academics and cultural organizations to
Cuba last month and supports lifting the entire embargo. ``We trade
with China _ When you see every country trading with Cuba, that
kind of waters down your embargo.''
</P>
<P>
   Moakley, who is the ranking Democrat on the Rules committee that
would receive the bill before it goes to the floor for a vote, said
he would defend the bill from what he said would be a ``hard
fight'' there from Cuban-American Representative Lincoln
Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican who is against easing sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsor, Representative George Nethercutt, Republican
of Washington is counting on at least 24 supporters from last
year's vote to vote for the measure. The committee's ranking
Democrat, Representative David Obey of Wisconsin, who voted against
last year's bill, would support the bill today, said spokeswoman
Kori Hardin.

<TEXT>
<P>
   To literate Europeans of the 19th century, the poet, playwright
and historian Friedrich Schiller (1759-1805) ranked right up with
Shakespeare, an idol he honored not only by conscious imitation but
also in a translation of ``Macbeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, even in his native Germany, Schiller's works for the
stage survive mostly as refracted through operas by Rossini, Verdi
and Tchaikovsky _ a mere handful of the dozens their revolutionary
idealism inspired. Over the last half century, ``Don Carlos,''
formerly a pillar of the classical German canon, has gone into
eclipse, even as the majestically flawed Franco-Italian epic by
Verdi has moved from the fringe of the repertory very nearly into
the center.
</P>
<P>
   Once a classic, now a footnote. And tomorrow?
</P>
<P>
   From May 16 through May 20 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, a
brief run of the play by the Royal Shakespeare Company provides a
rare chance to take our Schiller straight. Straight, that is,
within the parameters of a production that Gale Edwards has
directed in modern dress, and a verse translation by Robert David
MacDonald that was described by one London critic as ``fleet,
colloquial but often remarkably resonant'' _ phrases of limited
application to Schiller's original. (Resonant his language is,
fleet it can be, colloquial it is not.)
</P>
<P>
   The production could prove a revelation for theater fans and
opera buffs alike. The case, it bears noting, resembles that of
Verdi's late Shakespearean masterpieces not at all. To know
``Otello'' and ``Falstaff'' is in some sense to know their
Shakespearean prototypes. To know ``Don Carlos'' through Verdi is
hardly to know the play.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the five principal characters in the stage version form the
constellation familiar from the opera. The icy, tyrannical King
Philip II of Spain, old enough to be the father or grandfather of
his historical counterpart and gnawed by private griefs and doubts.
Elizabeth of Valois, his virtuous queen, the pawn of royal
matrimonial politics, once betrothed (as in truth she was) to
Philip's high-strung son, Don Carlos, whose feelings for her remain
those of a desperate lover. The Marquis of Posa, the prince's close
friend, drawn fatally into the gravitational field of the king.
Princess Eboli, the king's mistress, enamored of the prince.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the action are the prince's deranged attempts to
recapture the queen's heart, and Posa's effort to win the prince
for his own, no less dangerous, cause: religious independence for
the Spanish-occupied Low Countries.
</P>
<P>
   The big political picture _ the thought police of the
reactionary church and state ranged against the upstart
libertarians of faraway Flanders _ is another constant carried over
from the play to the opera. But in the overall plotting, general
matters of style and tone and strategic use of spectacle, not to
mention countless minute particulars, the libretto Joseph Mery and
Camille du Locle fashioned for Verdi takes lordly liberties.
</P>
<P>
   With transparently ``operatic'' intent, they introduced a new
opening act, furnishing a brief idyll of bliss for Don Carlos and
Elizabeth before destiny tears them apart. They punctuated the
play's succession of mainly private scenes with big public episodes
(including a brutal auto-da-fe) and major opportunities for the
chorus. Cutting and pasting with abandon, they eliminated lesser
roles, not always improving the dramatic logic. Nor did they spare
the principal figures, either.
</P>
<P>
   En route to the opera house, Elizabeth (who to the prince's
chagrin is forever being referred to as his mother) lost the
children she has in Schiller's play, which perhaps renders her a
more plausible object of romantic devotion but no longer sharpens
the terms of her conflict between desire and duty. Less usefully,
they excised cloak-and-dagger absurdities in the final scene (Don
Carlos dresses up as his grandfather's ghost) in favor of a botched
trick ending of their own.
</P>
<P>
   We have yet to factor in the music, which paints a succession of
powerfully contrasting frescoes in an inexhaustible palette of
ravishing colors. Not only that. Verdi's genius for melody and
cadence means that each character has a personal voice _ a trait
foreign to the play, in which, by design, everyone speaks (as it
were) the same language.
</P>
<P>
   The consistency of tone in the play ``Don Carlos'' (ceremonious,
rhetorical, unsullied by the wit, grit and malapropisms that
energize Shakespeare) is one hint of many that its true home is not
the playhouse but the study. Schiller called ``Don Carlos'' neither
play nor tragedy but ``a dramatic poem,'' thus a medium less for
actors than for the voice of the poet. That voice, and it alone, is
Schiller's ``music.''
</P>
<P>
   The poem's genesis lasted some five years, yielding five acts
totaling 5,370 lines of blank verse _ the equivalent of three
full-length plays of Racine. (A prose version prepared by the
playwright exists.) The world premiere, in 1787 when Schiller was
not yet 30, was a triumph. Still, the advance publication of
drafted scenes (some with stage directions of all but novelistic
density), as well as a series of 12 open letters by the playwright
in response to criticism, are ample evidence that ``Don Carlos''
was a literary _ even philosophical _ phenomenon at least as much
as it was a theatrical one.
</P>
<P>
   A true son of the Enlightenment, Schiller abominated absolutism
and deified civil liberty. Virtually all he wrote _ ``Don Carlos''
emphatically included _ forms part of his lifelong manifesto
against tyranny in all its forms: personal, social, political and
ecclesiastical.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to perform the full text have been few. Huge cuts were
a necessity from the start, and while salvaging the plot is quite
easy, crucial qualities of the dialogue inevitably suffer.
Schiller's polished blank verse (often indistinguishable from his
friend Goethe's) sits curiously with the stuttering, jumpy movement
of the characters' thought. When speeches run long (and they often
do), it is not because a person has complicated new information to
impart but because that person is at a loss to seize a clear
thought from a blur of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   A spectator, or even a reader pedantically parsing the
ambiguities on the printed page, may well encounter the same
difficulty, further aggravated by mechanics of the plot. A flurry
of highly sensitive letters, amorous and political (anonymous,
misinterpreted, deliberately deceptive) generate no end of smoke.
The players' myriad naive or optimistic misreadings of others'
temperament or motives add that much more. Within the gloomy cloud
of unknowing, a simple, declarative sentence shines like a beacon.
``I need love.'' &QC; ``He thinks 'tis proven.'' ``She is false.'' ``The
king has wept.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of these lines is spoken by the prince early on, the
third by his father, deep into the drama. The second, summing up
the problem with Posa, belongs to Domingo, the king's Machiavellian
father-confessor, the last to Count Lerma, head of the royal
bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller's debts to Shakespeare take many forms _ literary
allusion, outright quotation and patterns of metaphor among them.
But most Shakespearean of all is his attention to subsidiary
players. In ``Don Carlos,'' the most imposing of them is the Grand
Inquisitor, an evil deus ex machina, 90 years old, blind and yet
still capable of crushing the proud Philip by superior intellect
and brute force of will.
</P>
<P>
   Two lesser dignitaries are the subjects of master portraits: the
military commander the Duke of Alba, whose iron-fisted rule of
Flanders the prince in his starry-eyed delusions proposes to
supplant with a tolerant regime of his own; and Lerma, captain of
the royal bodyguard, who finds ways to reconcile his loyalty to the
king with dangerous, unsolicited confidences to the prince.

NEW YORK: the prince.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of others, Schiller offers quicker, still brilliant sketches:
the Duke of Medina Sidonia, the undisgraced admiral of the lost
armada; Don Raimond of Taxis, postmaster in chief, under whose
eagle eye no private correspondence is secure; the Marquesa of
Mondecar, who loves her bullfights and burning heretics. Eboli's
popinjay of a page comes in for a brilliant miniature.
</P>
<P>
   These are characters who leap off the printed page. From the
perspective of the study, the principals' jobs look much harder.
Don Carlos, Schiller's answer to Hamlet, caroms from self-pity to
mad elation, his heart forever on his sleeve; what triggers Eboli's
infatuation and Posa's self-sacrificial devotion is hard to fathom.
King Philip, whose emotional world collapses not quite as painfully
as Lear's, weathers his storms and knuckles under to the
Inquisition, sacrificing love to power.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen's impressive integrity does more to put others in
their place (the aged Philip among them) than to win admiration or
sympathy for herself. Spurned by the prince, Schiller's Eboli
negotiates the surrender of her virginity to the king with the
sangfroid of a geisha. Verdi's more formidable Eboli is Philip's
mistress from the start _ and has Arab-scented songs to sing that
make her much more alluring.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Posa, who has reminded some of Hamlet's schoolmate
Horatio, the beloved friend to whom the prince can bare his soul.
The resemblance, if granted, is rather strained. Horatio is a
witness, Posa a provocateur _ one, moreover, who to his own
astonishment captures the eye and heart of his friend's mortal
enemy, the king. The position is, of course, untenable.
</P>
<P>
   Verdi reconfigures Posa as the exemplar of friendship, virtue
and selfless tolerance. The character starts out that way in the
play, but royal favor goes to his head, and soon he is spinning out
of control, play-acting a betrayal of the prince in a suicidal
attempt to save him. In truth, though even the prince is fooled for
a while, the one Posa betrays is the king. Philip and Don Carlos
carry on over his corpse like rival widows.
</P>
<P>
   To the bitter end, Posa's mantra is humanity. Never does he
surrender the dream of a future when thought will be free _ a
future of which he elects his self-centered, undisciplined friend,
of all people, as architect. A German wit once called the character
``ein Prinzip im Trikot,'' a doctrine in tights.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been in the days of old-fashioned costume drama.
Can an actor in modern clothes turn him into flesh and blood? Soon
we will know.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, this ``Don Carlos'' could open the door for a later
and greater dramatic poem of Schiller's: ``Wallenstein,'' his epic
trilogy of the Thirty Years' War, a more challenging and more
purposefully chaotic proposition. Tim Albery staged the work's
belated, drastically cut professional British premiere (some three
hours out of seven), at the Pit, the Royal Shakespeare Company's
second London stage, seven years ago. ``In every sense a great
occasion,'' said The Guardian. ``A long slog,'' countered The Times
of London.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps now it is time for a full treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Do it, England. You have the actors, and Germany lacks the will.

FINDING A SURPRISE HIT IN 18TH-CENTURY GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, May 14) 
 (Editors: See also SCHILLER-THEATER) 
 By MATT WOLF    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When Rupert Penry-Jones first started reading ``Don
Carlos,'' the Friedrich Schiller play that brings him to New York
this week, he was only three pages into it before he thought:
``This is too long, too wordy.''
</P>
<P>
   But after another 10 pages or so, as Penry-Jones, a 29-year-old
English actor, recollects it: ``I couldn't put it down. I thought:
`It's like a medieval soap opera. There's nothing frightening about
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The result has been the best reviews to date of Penry-Jones'
career, as well as a surprise hit for the Royal Shakespeare Company
in a realm _ 18th-century German expressionism _ not often explored
by Britain's heavyweight theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don Carlos'' will be presented by the RSC at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music's Harvey Lichtenstein Theater for five
performances beginning May 16, as part of the troupe's residency
this month at BAM. (The final offering, ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream,'' opens there May 21.)
</P>
<P>
   As the title character, Penry-Jones plays a young Spanish prince
during the Inquisition who is smitten to the point of Hamlet-like
derangement with Elizabeth of Valois, his father the king's third
wife. Cast as the queen is Josette Simon, the willowy English
actress who first gained attention in London about a decade ago as
the first black Maggie in Arthur Miller's play ``After the Fall.''
</P>
<P>
   History tells us that the real Don Carlos died in questionable
circumstances in 1568 at the age of 23. More to the point, the
actual Spanish prince was known for being not just mentally
unstable but physically deformed, in marked contrast to
Penry-Jones' good looks. ``Don Carlos is always played by a
handsome boy,'' said the play's director, Gale Edwards, laughing.
``That's the terrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards has an extensive resume in musical theater and opera.
She is currently represented on Broadway by the new revival of
Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' at the Ford Center
for the Performing Arts, while her London version of the same
composer's ``Whistle Down the Wind'' starts its third year on the
West End in July. Neither production received great reviews, to put
it mildly.
</P>
<P>
   According to Edwards, a 45-year-old Australian who has lived for
the last six years in London, ``Don Carlos'' illustrates far better
``where my heart is'' than do the Lloyd Webber shows. That
affiliation, she said, ``has been relatively recent and, in
percentage terms, is quite small compared with other work.'' She
has also directed Lord Lloyd-Webber's ``Aspects of Love'' in
Australia and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a classical director first and foremost,'' Edwards said.
``The gravity of most of my work has been classical theater; the
musical stuff is the flotation in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, why Schiller, a writer whose work, as Edwards
acknowledges, ``is obscure enough at the best of times''?
</P>
<P>
   She came to the play, she said, through opera, directing
Donizetti's ``Maria Stuarda'' for the English National Opera in
London in 1998. Edwards found herself steeped in Schiller _ and not
just ``Mary Stuart,'' on which Donizetti's 1834 opera is based.
(``Don Carlos,'' of course, has inspired its own opera, the Verdi
treatment of 1867.)
</P>
<P>
   Edwards read ``Don Carlos'' and reacted strongly to it. ``God,
this is a great play,'' she recalled thinking to herself. ``But
it's about 5{ hours long and very dense. There's probably a rather
brilliant three-hour play here.'' She ultimately took her proposal
to the Royal Shakespeare Company. Several years before, she had
worked there, directing a well-regarded production of ``The White
Devil,'' Webster's 1612 Jacobean classic. In choosing an
English-language text for Schiller's play, Edwards opted for an
existing translation _ by Robert David MacDonald, a Scottish writer
and director _ which she has trimmed.
</P>
<P>
   The Webster and Schiller plays, Edwards said, have much in
common, starting with a similar density, not to mention a shared
focus on bloodletting as well as issues of tyranny and injustice.
In the fall, she will return to the RSC to direct a third play,
Webster's ``Duchess of Malfi,'' in what Edwards regards as an
informal but identifiable theatrical triptych.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the three plays is concerned with a system threatened
by a free thinker, a free spirit,'' she said. ``And in each case,
the system wins. They are dark, bloody political stories _ as well
as three of the most difficult plays ever written, in terms of
carrying an audience through a labyrinthine plot and an incredibly
bleak view of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was with something approaching delighted surprise that
critics and audiences alike responded to ``Don Carlos,'' first in
Stratford last June and then in London in January. ``Theater at its
most theatrical,'' said Michael Billington in The Guardian. The
performances led Charles Spencer in The Daily Telegraph to praise
``the RSC at the very top of its form.'' Penry-Jones, he said,
possessed ``the brooding intensity of a heart-throb star.''
</P>
<P>
   Penry-Jones' portrait of the distraught prince follows
celebrated appearances at the National Theater in 1997 in Arnold
Wesker's ``Chips With Everything'' and at the Almeida Theater in
1998 as the tearful, anxious father in Edward Albee's ``Play About
the Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schiller production has also helped remind London audiences
of the authority of John Woodvine, the British stage veteran who
plays the unyielding Philip II of Spain .
</P>
<P>
   ``The narrative drive is certainly fantastic,'' said Woodvine
about Schiller's story, especially, he added, given that Schiller
``is probably known no more in England than in America.'' Beethoven
lovers, of course, know Schiller's ``Ode to Joy'' from the last
movement of the Ninth Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   So here he is, at 70, returning to a city in which he last
appeared on Broadway in 1981 in ``Nicholas Nickleby'' as Uncle
Ralph. ( Woodvine's wife, Lynn Farleigh, was seen earlier this
month in the first RSC production of its season at BAM, T.S.
Eliot's ``Family Reunion.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been wonderful for me,'' said Woodvine of his latest
role. ``There aren't too many parts this good for an elderly
gentleman.''

<P>
   &UR; BY LUCAS MILLER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About a week ago, I stopped by my girlfriend's apartment to pick
her up for dinner. Her roommate, a nice girl from Long Island who
works in advertising, was uncharacteristically unhappy to see me at
the door. She gestured me inside but shot a tense look at the
friend with whom she had been watching television.
</P>
<P>
   I figured that it was just because I was interrupting their lazy
Sunday afternoon. My girlfriend was still picking out her clothes
for the evening, so I plopped down on the couch with the other two
and started watching television. Soon the doorbell rang and the
roommate jumped up, a look of horror on her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's that?'' I asked with friendly curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, we ordered Chinese food,'' she said to me. Then to her
friend, ``Come on, let's go eat it on the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Off they went. It was a chilly day, but good detective that I
am, I tend to believe everything people tell me. What I should have
known but didn't guess is that they had just received a little
package from one of the many marijuana delivery services that bring
pot directly to New Yorkers' doors.
</P>
<P>
   This is far from the first party I've spoiled. I was once told
that my presence at a gathering ruined it, since the guest of honor
couldn't get high while I was there. At other times, I've been
forced to act as a sort of unofficial review board for complaints
about my profession.
</P>
<P>
   And the most frequent gripe I've heard _ well, up until the cops
who shot Amadou Diallo were acquitted _ is that someone's buddy,
sweetheart, or uncle got locked up for smoking a little harmless
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   What pot users may find interesting, if not entirely satisfying,
is that the opinions of cops vary almost as much as those of
civilians when it comes to drugs and particularly marijuana. Some
cops are staunch law-and-order types who believe that laws are made
by the legislature and interpreted by the courts, not the police,
and that no law is too small and no violation too trivial to take
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Other cops believe that the use of drugs, including marijuana,
is tied directly to the use of more drugs and the commission of
other crimes. Some narcotics officers are embarrassed that they
must spend time pursuing violators of laws about which society is
ambivalent and whose consequences are so light.
</P>
<P>
   And there are those, like myself, who see the virtue of
enforcing quality-of-life laws but can't help but feel bad putting
a guy in handcuffs for smoking pot.
</P>
<P>
   My father is a jazz musician, and he and I sometimes joke about
the popular image of jazzmen spending a lot of time stoned. Viper,
my father told me, was old-time slang for pot smoker; tea referred
to pot. Legend has it that Louis Armstrong was a big viper.
</P>
<P>
   One day not long ago, my father was telling me that once he'd
quit smoking cigarettes, he never smoked again for fear that he'd
fall off the wagon entirely. Same for smoking pot, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a moment, I thought. My dad smoked pot? I thought we were
talking about other musicians. Can I put a guy through the system
for something my own father has done?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, I can.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that I think that you, smoking a little marijuana in
the privacy of your own living room, are committing a wrong against
society that must be righted. In fact, in New York state,
possession of small amounts of marijuana in your home is a
``violation,'' which is less serious than a misdemeanor and not
legally a crime. It is on the order of urinating in public or
drinking from an open beer in public. Since you're at home,
invisible to anyone outside, and since violations are not grounds
for a search warrant, you are almost definitely going to get away
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Buying that pot on a street corner is a different story. The
possession of marijuana in public in New York as well as in most
states is a misdemeanor; if we catch you, we are supposed to arrest
you. Police do have some discretion when it comes to making arrests
for minor infractions, but aggressive enforcement of
quality-of-life violations has simply become the normal way we do
business.
</P>
<P>
   And I believe this is the way we should do business. One of the
lessons we have learned in the last few years is that narcotics
enforcement is an effective way to drive down almost all kinds of
crime. We've also seen that successful drug enforcement targets
buyers as well as dealers. Given the proliferation of marijuana
dealers and users in public spaces such as Washington Square Park a
few years ago, aggressive enforcement doesn't seem so out of line.
And this is where most marijuana enforcement is being conducted _
not in anyone's living room.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, although pot smokers are usually peaceable citizens,
their dealers can be dangerous criminals. In 1993, a detective
working in Manhattan South Narcotics named Luis Lopez was shot
through the heart by dealers while making a marijuana buy. He left
a family behind. He was 36.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I don't go in for the idea that everyone who buys illegal
drugs gets a little of the blood of the policemen killed by dealers
on their hands. But Luis' death makes me see marijuana as more
sinister, a little less harmless.
</P>
<P>
   That said, I won't be hauling my girlfriend's roommate off
anytime soon. My department, like many, frowns on off-duty arrests
for all but the most serious crimes. Were I to interrupt my dinner
dates to make arrests for unlawful possession of marijuana, I would
probably get laughed out of my office.
</P>
<P>
   But nor could I sit idle while Ms. Roommate toked up. A cop is a
cop 24 hours a day, and even when I'm off duty, I find it difficult
to observe drug use nonchalantly. That's why, as my girlfriend
dressed and her roommate consumed her ``Chinese food'' on the roof,
I found myself hitting the redial button on their phone pad, trying
to get the number of the delivery service.

   NEW YORK _ After the discovery was made in February, John C.
Waddell, a New York collector and retired businessman, said it was
like finding ``Tut's tomb beyond the attic door of a little
Monopoly house in Queens.'' It happened when a dealer came to the
house in New Hyde Park to buy valuables and, finding none, was told
to inspect the attic.
</P>
<P>
   There he discovered a long-lost American Modern treasure from
1938: the first plastic shell chair ever made. Actually, there were
two of them. The shimmering chairs with curvy clear-plastic seats
framed in tubular steel were handmade prototypes of Gilbert Rohde's
least-well-known and most innovative design. The chairs represented
a futuristic approach to furniture design, using Plexiglas, a new
acrylic plastic made by the chemical company Rohm and Haas, for
whom Rohde worked as a consultant. The chairs were publicized
during the 1939 World's Fair in New York but were never
manufactured because Plexiglas was taken out of commercial use by
the federal government and diverted for windshields of military
aircraft when war broke out in Europe that year.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell and other American Modern enthusiasts had known of the
existence of the chair for decades, but only from photographs. ``No
one knew whether the chair had been produced or whether the
prototypes had survived,'' Waddell said. No one realized that two
such chairs were hidden away in an attic of a sister-in-law of
Rohde, probably since he died in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell was among the first to be told of the discovery and
within days bought one of the chairs. The other was bought by Mark
McDonald, a New York dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Now both chairs are on view in New York. Waddell's in ``American
Modern, 1925-1940: Design for a New Age,'' an exhibition of 175
objects at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 120 of which are gifts
Waddell has made to the museum or has promised to make in the
future. The show, which remains through Jan. 7, 2001, was organized
by the museum and the American Federation of Arts and will travel
nationally through 2002. McDonald's chair is on display at his
Gansevoort Gallery in the West Village.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell's gifts to the Metropolitan Museum have left many empty
spaces in his New York apartment. But this will not end his
collecting of American Modern objects. ``I intend to keep buying as
long as I can afford it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he would sorely miss the Rohde chair because ``my
favorite is always the last piece I bought.'' But there are many
other rare pieces that will also be missed: a 1927 desk with a
stepped form, inspired by a skyscraper, by Paul Frankl; a 1934
stainless steel and Bakelite triangular coffee pot and creamer from
a service by Helen A. Hughes Dulany; a boldly graphic 1928
``Step-On-It'' penny scale by Joseph Sinel and a sleek cone-shaded
floor lamp by Walter von Nessen, also from 1928.
</P>
<P>
   The lamp was Waddell's first American Modern acquisition 25
years ago, when he had no idea he would start a collection of that
genre. ``I don't think anyone has a fully formed agenda when they
begin buying in a new category,'' he said. The American Modern
appealed to him because he had tired of the French Art Deco
furnishings he owned. ``Everything seemed a bit over the top,'' he
said. At the time, he was also buying American and European
photography of the 1920s and 1930s. The 500 images he collected
were valued at $2.7 million when they were acquired by the
Metropolitan Museum in 1989 from Waddell. The Ford Motor Co. paid
$1.8 million toward the purchase and Waddell donated the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell concentrated intensely on the American Modern collection
in the 1990s, especially after he retired in 1994 as president and
chairman of Arrow Electronics, the world's largest distributor of
electronic components. Two years ago he began talking with J.
Stewart Johnson, a consultant on design and architecture to the
Department of Modern Art at the Metropolitan Museum. ``I decided
that the collection belonged there,'' Waddell said. ``It was the
Metropolitan Museum that did the industrial shows in the '20s and
'30s. Those landmark exhibitions dignified the material,
popularized it and encouraged designers to work with American
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Industrial designers are well represented in Waddell's
collection, beginning with the European-born Americans Frankl and
von Nessen, who led the way in the 1920s. By 1930, American-born
designers had moved into high gear in Manhattan, streamlining,
chroming and glamorizing the newly colorful vacuum clearers,
radios, dinnerware and furniture. Norman Bel Geddes produced the
show's most iconic object, the red-white-and-blue-striped
``Patriot'' radio, manufactured by Emerson in 1940. Donald Deskey
made the black Formica and aluminum tables in the exhibition, which
were designed in 1932 for Radio City Music Hall and look elegant
enough for a palace.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he had always appreciated the urban character of
American Modern but had decided to focus on how New York was
reflected in the objects after he saw Waddell's collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I became more aware of his objects, the exhibition became
more and more a show about Astaire and Rogers,'' Johnson said.
``The people who lived in those Manhattan penthouses, they had made
it; they had arrived. That was the wonderful mystique of Manhattan,
its towers and its skyline. And John Waddell's objects bore that
out.''

AT REAGAN'S ALMA MATER, HIS ROLE IN ENDING COLD WAR IS
COMMEMORATED

<P>
   EUREKA, Ill. _ Before ``The Gipper'' and the Oval Office, Ronald
Reagan washed dishes in a women's dormitory at the small college
here.
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, from his childhood home in Dixon, the 17-year-old
future president followed the pastor's daughter, on whom he'd had a
crush, and made his way to Eureka College, situated amid the
cornfields of central Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Depression, Reagan spent four of the best years of
his life at Eureka, according to both local legend and his daughter
Maureen Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, thousands on this campus of 500 students gathered here
under white and yellow tents to dedicate a new garden commemorating
a visit Reagan made here in 1982, when he proposed that the United
States and the Soviet Union begin reducing their nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The Ronald Reagan Peace Garden, which commemorates the end of
the Cold War, contains a bronze bust of the former president and a
five-by-four-foot piece of the Berlin Wall. The garden is planted
with tall, white tulips called ``Maureen'' tulips, specially chosen
to honor the former president's daughter, who has become her
father's representative here in the six years since he was
diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This school was the first love of his life,'' Ms. Reagan said
recently as she walked across the campus.
</P>
<P>
   In the years following his graduation in 1932, Reagan, first as
a movie star, then as California governor, and finally as
president, visited the campus 14 times, attracting thousands of
people for events as ordinary as library dedications and the annual
Pumpkin Festival Parade.
</P>
<P>
   By making the disarmament proposal as part of a commencement
speech here in 1982, ``he gave them a presidential legacy,'' said
Ms. Reagan. ``He knew that's what he was doing. It was a gift only
a president could give.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan supposedly modeled the speech, which many say marked the
beginning of the end of the Cold War, after the famous ``Iron
Curtain'' speech Winston Churchill gave in 1946 at Westminster
College in Fulton, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   But critics such as Frances FitzGerald, author of the recent
book ``Way Out There in the Blue: Reagan, Star Wars, and the End of
the Cold War,'' discount the importance of the Eureka speech,
saying that Reagan's goals were far from noble, and that he was
basically forced into the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks by
anti-nuclear activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was a wonderful speech,'' FitzGerald said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it would seem almost impossible to tarnish the 41st
president's image at Eureka College, where his presence is felt not
just in the Ronald Reagan Museum, replete with mementos such as his
college diploma, movie posters and jelly beans; or in the imposing
Ronald and Neil Reagan Physical Education Center (named for Reagan
and his older brother, who also attended the school).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one senses Reagan's stamp on the student body, from the
buzzing campus chapter of the Young Republicans club to the
well-groomed students who stroll the campus in button-down shirts
and ties. The former president finds his way into the curriculum,
as well; recently, a group of students on a school-sponsored trip
to Ireland visited Reagan's ancestral home in County Tipperary.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's name also brings in healthy endowments; 20 students
here are Ronald Reagan Fellows, who attend Eureka on full four-year
scholarships and participate in all-expenses-paid internships all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, over iced tea, Ms. Reagan regaled some of
those students with stories of horseback riding with her father at
Camp David and her own trips to Africa as an ambassador for her
father.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Ronald Reagan fellows is Jared Hansen, a 20-year-old
junior who first learned of Eureka College in the eighth grade,
while writing a history paper about Reagan. This summer he will
intern for a former Reagan Supreme Court nominee, Robert Bork, a
former federal judge who is now a legal scholar with the American
Enterprise Institute, a public policy research think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so fond of this school, he came back so many times, and
that weighs so much on people's minds,'' Hansen said of Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Other students mentioned Reagan's reputation as a campus rebel;
during his freshman year, he gave a rousing speech in the college
chapel that eventually led to the resignation of the college
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people feel that it was here he first discovered his
political voice,'' said Dr. Junius Rodriguez, an associate
professor of history at the college.
</P>
<P>
   His presence in the town is felt in subtler ways. Reagan Drive
cuts through a neighborhood near the college, and the public
library contains nearly a dozen biographies on him and his wife,
Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez likes to joke that the telephone prefix in heavily
Republican Eureka _ 467 _ spells out ``GOP'' on the phone pad.
</P>
<P>
   On her way across campus, Ms. Reagan said she could understand
her father's affinity for the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel just like dear old Dad, I don't ever want to leave.''

THE PROSTATE: WHY THE GLAND IS SO FAMOUS

</P>
<P>
   Just three years ago, newspapers were declaring prostate cancer
the ``hush-hush man-killer,'' ``the silent enemy,'' and ``the
disease that dare not speak its name.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani held a press
conference to announce his prostate cancer. Intel CEO Andy Grove
took the cover of Fortune to chronicle his struggle against the
disease. Joe Torre's prostate helped spur the New York Yankees to a
World Series title. Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf can't stop talking
about his gland.
</P>
<P>
   On April 27, Larry King devoted an entire show to Giuliani's
prostate _ an hour that included Sam Donaldson describing how he
examined his groin in the shower and King urging his male viewers
to get a prostate exam, the ``old-fashioned digital, the finger in
the rectum.''
</P>
<P>
   The disease that dare not speak its name has become the disease
that won't shut up.
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer remains a cause celebre, and the colon _ sponsored
by Katie Couric _ is making headlines, but prostate cancer has
become America's favorite malignancy, Cancer Enemy No. 1. The
number of articles about the prostate has quintupled in the past
five years. Research funding has quadrupled. You can't turn around
without bumping into a famous prostate cancer survivor (Marion
Barry, Sidney Poitier, Bob Dole...)
</P>
<P>
   But why should the nasty little gland be so trendy now? The
prostate, after all, has always been with us, and it's still doing
the same tedious work. A gland the size of a walnut wrapped around
the urethra, it hangs just below the bladder, in front of the
rectum, and above the penis. It has one important job: It produces
seminal fluid ejaculated during orgasm. That fluid nourishes sperm
on their journey to the egg.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because its cells divide frequently, the prostate is
prone to malignancy. About 180,000 American men are diagnosed with
prostate cancer every year, and more than 30,000 die of it. After
lung cancer, it is the deadliest cancer for American men, killing
three out of 100.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer is capturing the popular imagination partly
because there is more of it. Prostate cancer diagnoses doubled in
the United States from the mid-'70s to the mid-'90s. The graying of
the population explains some of this increase. American men are
living longer, and almost every man who lives long enough develops
prostate problems.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming majority of American men who reach 80 suffer
from benign prostatic hyperplasia, an expansion of the prostate
that causes urinary discomfort. And most men who live long enough
also suffer from prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   According to an American Cancer Society book, one-third of men
in their 40s have prostate cancer _ usually too small and too
slow-growing to notice _ while 80 percent of men in their 80s have
it.
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive screening also helps explain the increase. The key
diagnostic test, the PSA, has been commonly used only since the
late '80s. The American Cancer Society recommends that men begin
annual prostate tests at age 50. African-Americans, whose prostate
cancer rate is double that of whites, should begin at 40 or 45, as
should men with a family history of prostate cancer. (Men in the
United States, perhaps because of diet, have the highest prostate
cancer rates in the world. Men in Asia have the lowest.)
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer is a satisfying target because it is eminently
curable. Prostate cancer death rates have dropped 16 percent this
decade. If cancer has not spread beyond the prostate, surgical
removal of the prostate is nearly 100 percent successful. Radiation
therapy is almost as effective, curing more than 80 percent of
patients and causing fewer side effects.
</P>
<P>
   When cancer has spread beyond the prostate, treatment is more
drastic. Doctors must reduce testosterone levels to starve the
tumors. This requires either anti-androgen drugs or surgical
castration, both of which destroy the sex drive.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their success fighting prostate cancer, doctors disagree
vehemently about whether men should be tested routinely. Prostate
cancer is generally slow-moving and dimwitted. Even left untreated,
it does not kill most of the people who have it: In most cases, the
malignancy confines itself to the prostate and causes few if any
symptoms. (Oncologists like to say that you are more likely to die
with prostate cancer than of prostate cancer.) The slow growth of
most prostate tumors means that many patients diagnosed with
prostate cancer will never be bothered by the disease. But,
understandably, few patients risk refusing treatment once they know
they have cancer.
</P>
<P>
   This poses a dilemma, because prostate cancer treatment has
terrible side effects. Surgery leaves most patients impotent and a
significant percentage incontinent. Radiation frequently causes
impotence and bowel problems. As a result, some medical
organizations, including the National Cancer Institute, do not
recommend routine prostate testing. They argue that it leads to
harmful treatment of many men who would otherwise never be bothered
by their slow-growing cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society, which does favor testing, counters
that not testing endangers men with fast-growing cancer. Their
tumors may not be discovered till too late. The ACS also notes that
improved surgical techniques are making side effects less heinous:
Some surgeons claim that less than 20 percent of their patients
suffer impotence and less than 5 percent suffer incontinence.
</P>
<P>
   Most oncologists and surgeons agree that men whose life
expectancy is less than 10 years should not undergo surgery or
radiation. The therapies are too destructive, and the patients are
more likely to die from other causes than from their untreated
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer is also benefiting from a vigorous
public-relations campaign spearheaded by Michael Milken. The former
junk-bond dealer was diagnosed with serious prostate cancer as soon
as he came out of prison in 1993. After successful treatment, he
threw himself into prostate promotion, doing for prostate cancer
what breast cancer victims did for their disease. He endowed a
foundation, CapCURE, to fund research. (It has distributed more
than $50 million in grants.)
</P>
<P>
   He and other prostate cancer victims have lobbied Congress and
the National Cancer Institute to boost government funding for
prostate research. The NCI has hiked prostate funding to more than
$130 million annually, up from $31 million in 1992, but that lags
far behind the nearly $400 million the NCI doles out for breast
cancer, which kills about the same number of people.
</P>
<P>
   The prostate campaigners have persuaded famous men to go public
about the prostate, enlisting Arnold Palmer and Harry Belafonte to
discuss their glands and George Foreman to pose for ``Real men get
it checked'' ads.
</P>
<P>
   The psycho-sexual anxiety of boomers fuels prostate-mania.
Boomer men are entering their peak prostate cancer years. Many have
just passed the 50-year mark, and the rest are rapidly approaching
it. They're already paranoid about preserving their health and
vitality. Prostate cancer terrifies boomers because it so threatens
sexual potency.
</P>
<P>
   We are living in a hypermasculine age. Guns, pro-wrestling,
gangster rap saturate the pop culture. Testosterone has become a
hot drug, with The New York Times Magazine and Time singing cover
hymns to its magical, machoizing properties. But prostate cancer
negates masculinity. It leaves healthy men impotent and
incontinent. It unmans. Is it any wonder boomers obsess over it?
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators argue that Giuliani's prostate cancer makes
him a better candidate exactly because it strips his hard edge and
makes him seem vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the prostate craze represents a rare triumph for
America's culture of shamelessness. Men didn't talk about their
prostates a generation ago: It was unseemly and embarrassing.
Thousands of men avoided treatment and probably died because of it.
But now reticence is passe.
</P>
<P>
   The president's sex organs are analyzed in public, sex therapy
occurs in prime time, no one blinks at nudity, profanity, or
violence. This culture of blab and revelation _ otherwise so icky _
mercifully airs out the prostate closet. Not talking about the
prostate killed people. It stopped men from thinking about it.
Talking about it _ in the most graphic terms _ scares men, sends
them to the doctor, and gets them treated.
</P>
<P>
   It is surely awkward to watch Larry King rapture over his rectal
exams. Just remember that his ass may be saving someone else's.

cancer rates in the world. Men in Asia have the lowest.)
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer is a satisfying target because it is eminently
curable. Prostate cancer death rates have dropped 16 percent this
decade. If cancer has not spread beyond the prostate, surgical
removal of the prostate is nearly 100 percent successful. Radiation
therapy is almost as effective, curing more than 80 percent of
patients and causing fewer side effects.
</P>
<P>
   When cancer has spread beyond the prostate, treatment is more
drastic. Doctors must reduce testosterone levels to starve the
tumors. This requires either anti-androgen drugs or surgical
castration, both of which destroy the sex drive.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their success fighting prostate cancer, doctors disagree
vehemently about whether men should be tested routinely. Prostate
cancer is generally slow-moving and dimwitted. Even left untreated,
it does not kill most of the people who have it: In most cases, the
malignancy confines itself to the prostate and causes few if any
symptoms. (Oncologists like to say that you are more likely to die
with prostate cancer than of prostate cancer.) The slow growth of
most prostate tumors means that many patients diagnosed with
prostate cancer will never be bothered by the disease. But,
understandably, few patients risk refusing treatment once they know
they have cancer.
</P>
<P>
   This poses a dilemma, because prostate cancer treatment has
terrible side effects. Surgery leaves most patients impotent and a
significant percentage incontinent. Radiation frequently causes
impotence and bowel problems. As a result, some medical
organizations, including the National Cancer Institute, do not
recommend routine prostate testing. They argue that it leads to
harmful treatment of many men who would otherwise never be bothered
by their slow-growing cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society, which does favor testing, counters
that not testing endangers men with fast-growing cancer. Their
tumors may not be discovered till too late. The ACS also notes that
improved surgical techniques are making side effects less heinous:
Some surgeons claim that less than 20 percent of their patients
suffer impotence and less than 5 percent suffer incontinence.
</P>
<P>
   Most oncologists and surgeons agree that men whose life
expectancy is less than 10 years should not undergo surgery or
radiation. The therapies are too destructive, and the patients are
more likely to die from other causes than from their untreated
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer is also benefiting from a vigorous
public-relations campaign spearheaded by Michael Milken. The former
junk-bond dealer was diagnosed with serious prostate cancer as soon
as he came out of prison in 1993. After successful treatment, he
threw himself into prostate promotion, doing for prostate cancer
what breast cancer victims did for their disease. He endowed a
foundation, CapCURE, to fund research. (It has distributed more
than $50 million in grants.)
</P>
<P>
   He and other prostate cancer victims have lobbied Congress and
the National Cancer Institute to boost government funding for
prostate research. The NCI has hiked prostate funding to more than
$130 million annually, up from $31 million in 1992, but that lags
far behind the nearly $400 million the NCI doles out for breast
cancer, which kills about the same number of people.
</P>
<P>
   The prostate campaigners have persuaded famous men to go public
about the prostate, enlisting Arnold Palmer and Harry Belafonte to
discuss their glands and George Foreman to pose for ``Real men get
it checked'' ads.
</P>
<P>
   The psycho-sexual anxiety of boomers fuels prostate-mania.
Boomer men are entering their peak prostate cancer years. Many have
just passed the 50-year mark, and the rest are rapidly approaching
it. They're already paranoid about preserving their health and
vitality. Prostate cancer terrifies boomers because it so threatens
sexual potency.
</P>
<P>
   We are living in a hypermasculine age. Guns, pro-wrestling,
gangster rap saturate the pop culture. Testosterone has become a
hot drug, with The New York Times Magazine and Time singing cover
hymns to its magical, machoizing properties. But prostate cancer
negates masculinity. It leaves healthy men impotent and
incontinent. It unmans. Is it any wonder boomers obsess over it?
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators argue that Giuliani's prostate cancer makes
him a better candidate exactly because it strips his hard edge and
makes him seem vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the prostate craze represents a rare triumph for
America's culture of shamelessness. Men didn't talk about their
prostates a generation ago: It was unseemly and embarrassing.
Thousands of men avoided treatment and probably died because of it.
But now reticence is passe.
</P>
<P>
   The president's sex organs are analyzed in public, sex therapy
occurs in prime time, no one blinks at nudity, profanity, or
violence. This culture of blab and revelation _ otherwise so icky _
mercifully airs out the prostate closet. Not talking about the
prostate killed people. It stopped men from thinking about it.
Talking about it _ in the most graphic terms _ scares men, sends
them to the doctor, and gets them treated.
</P>
<P>
   It is surely awkward to watch Larry King rapture over his rectal
exams. Just remember that his ass may be saving someone else's.

 &HT;    Bush, McCain reach truce, sort of
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH, Pa. _ They huddled for 90 minutes in the opulent
splendor of the 84-year-old Westin William Penn Hotel. Then Gov.
George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain emerged not quite
buddies but straining to prove, publicly at least, that they are
not enemies, either.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the feisty war hero who scared Bush in the early rounds
of the GOP primary with a spirited fight, finally endorsed his
once-bitter rival, but McCain likened it to taking medicine.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush called McCain ``a good man, a man of good
judgment,'' but he declined to repudiate the Rev. Pat Robertson's
recent statement that McCain would be ``very dangerous'' as vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was the most that Republicans anxious for unity could
hope for. Tensions between the Bush and McCain camps have simmered
since the two fought it out during the primaries. Mistrust lingered
right to Tuesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   McCain recently threatened to pull out of the meeting. But,
eager to put hostilities behind him, McCain relented after a Sunday
telephone call from Bush. McCain reportedly considered canceling
again after word of Sunday's phone call leaked out Monday. Before
the weekend, the two had spoken twice by telephone since McCain
suspended his campaign March 9.
</P>
<P>
   To capture the White House, Bush needs the 4.5 million
independents and Democrats attracted to McCain by his dramatic
personal story and his calls for government reform. That political
reality has forced the victor to keep communications open with the
man he vanquished _ to the irritation of Bush loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta pollster Whit Ayers, a Republican not working for either
camp, said the meeting should help both men. He called McCain's
decision to endorse Bush ``the right thing for him to do, for his
political future and for Governor Bush's.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said categorically Tuesday that he has no desire to be
Bush's running mate. Bush said, ``I take him for his word.'' McCain
has not ruled out another bid for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ayers said he thought Bush was planning to reach out on his own
to independents and Democrats. ``Anything he can do to help open
those doors is useful, and that's why a joint appearance is
helpful,'' Ayers said. ``At the same time, there's a limit to the
amount of influence that anyone who did not win the nomination can
have on the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think McCain and his advisers are aware of the danger of
overplaying his hand and seeming to want too much. Governor Bush is
a good politician. Senator McCain is a good politician. My guess
is, after all the bobbing and weaving and maneuvering, it'll all
come out OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men were eager to show that they want to move ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``To look back with anger or any rancor would be a mistake for
me and for Governor Bush,'' McCain said. ``I hold no rancor.''
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by reporters, McCain horsed around a bit, repeating the
word ``endorse'' over and over again to dispel any notion that he
reluctantly backed Bush. But when asked by one reporter whether the
endorsement amounted to taking his medicine now rather than later,
McCain said: ``I think your `take-the-medicine-now' is probably a
good description.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain said he looks forward to ``enthusiastically
campaigning for Governor Bush for the next six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush stressed his own commitment to reform and said he and
McCain agree on issues such as education and overhauling the
military. Bush adopted the ``-- eformer with -- esults'' mantra
after McCain trounced him in the New Hampshire primary. Bush also
said he hopes McCain would ``play a key role'' in this summer's GOP
convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him point blank he made me a better candidate,'' Bush
said. ``He waged a very good campaign. He put me through my paces
and, as a result of the campaign, I stand better prepared to become
president.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain was careful to say that he and Bush still disagree on
some key issues. McCain remains committed to campaign finance
reform and continues to call for a ban on soft money _ the
unlimited, unregulated cash that flows to political parties. Bush
backs banning such contributions from corporations and labor unions
but not from individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The two side-stepped questions about Bush's proposed five-year,
$483 billion tax cut. McCain attacked the plan during the
primaries, saying it wouldn't do enough to pay down the federal
budget deficit or shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans portrayed the McCain endorsement as a big
boost for Bush _ ``Today is a bad day for Al Gore,'' said former
GOP presidential contender Gary Bauer, who had endorsed McCain _
the Democrats tried to downplay it.
</P>
<P>
   At a Pittsburgh news conference after what they called the
Bush-McCain ``peace accord photo op,'' Democratic National
Committee officials handed out compact discs containing bad things
McCain had said about Bush during primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Included among McCain's greatest hits against Bush was this one
from Grand Rapids, Mich., on Feb. 20: ``Governor Bush is a Pat
Robertson Republican who will lose to Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore tried to rain on Bush's big day by reminding a Washington
audience that McCain recently returned to South Carolina to say he
believes the state should no longer fly the Confederate flag over
its Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, McCain, like Bush, said that's a decision
for the state to make. McCain now says his position at the time was
born of political expediency.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking to the Anti-Defamation League, said of the issue
Tuesday, ``It is wrong to remain silent about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore will be in Dallas tonight for two fund-raising events for
the Democratic National Committee.

BUSH RECEIVES MCCAIN BACKING, BUT STRAIN SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Formally ending a protracted rift within the
Republican Party, Senator John McCain of Arizona Tuesday endorsed
George W. Bush for president, saying the Texas governor has the
vision, knowledge, and expertise to maintain the country's place in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their occasional attempts at levity, the body
language between Bush and McCain appeared uncomfortable as they
answered reporters' questions. At times, McCain looked pained to be
praising his former adversary in the race for the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think . . . `take the medicine now' is probably a good
description,'' McCain said with a weak smile, explaining his
decision to offer words of support Tuesday following a private,
90-minute meeting with Bush, rather than wait until later in the
year as he had originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain did not utter the word ``endorse'' until a reporter
asked him about that omission. The senator responded by saying, ``I
endorse Governor Bush'' a half-dozen times, drawing laughter.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere at the grand old William Penn Hotel was like that
of a summit between two world leaders, and it created a media
carnival. There were Secret Service agents slowly checking every
person for weapons, and hangers-on attempting to inject their own
message into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee, for example, distributed a
compact disc called ``McComity Central.'' On each track, McCain can
be heard ridiculing Bush's experience, his credentials as a
reformer, and his plans to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, the Republican National Committee put out its
own brief against Vice President Al Gore using the words of
Democratic Senators Bob Kerrey, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Paul
Wellstone, and Bill Bradley. In addition, Representative J.D.
Hayworth of Arizona, a Republican, crashed the Democrats' press
conference, questioning DNC cochairman Joe Andrew about Gore's
campaign-finance problems.
</P>
<P>
   But the spotlight was reserved for the two Republicans who had
struggled mightily against one another in the primaries. When they
met, it was without aides or entourage, just two men in a hotel
suite talking over coffee and danish. Neither offered an apology
for conduct that occurred or words that were uttered during the
winter, and neither man asked for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward, and not back,'' McCain said. ``I hold no
rancor.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bush: ``I told him point-blank he made me a better
candidate. He waged a really good campaign. And he put me through
my paces. And as a result of the campaign . . . I'm better prepared
to become the president.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain promised to campaign ``enthusiastically'' for Bush and
for Republicans running for the House and Senate in the coming six
months, and Bush said he expects McCain to be featured prominently
at the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he had ``popped the question'' to McCain about the
vice presidency, Bush said he had sought McCain's advice on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I asked that I not be considered for vice president of the
United States,'' McCain quickly interjected.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania would make a good choice,
McCain said, as would the governors of New Jersey, Wisconsin, and
Michigan, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would consider a Cabinet position, McCain joked,
``secretary of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men asserted their independence Tuesday. Bush refused to
express any disapproval of the Rev. Pat Robertson for saying that a
McCain vice presidency would be ``very dangerous.'' Later, McCain
aides said the senator was upset that Bush would not repudiate
Robertson's comments.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain made clear that he still disagrees with
Bush on a variety of topics. His endorsement of Bush would not keep
him from working on the causes he championed during his bid for the
nomination, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say that I will not give up on the reform
agenda,'' McCain said. ``And I want to assure those people that
supported me in the primary that I will continue to pursue this
agenda. They are not contradictory to my support of Governor
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain did say that he and Bush agreed on approaches to
education, health care, and the military. And Bush said they both
think it is time to change Social Security, allowing people to
invest some of their payroll taxes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``John and I both agree we must trust younger workers with some
of their money in the private sector,'' Bush said, citing the
program as a key difference between him and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As late as Monday night, McCain had said he would not decide on
an endorsement until he saw how the meeting in Pittsburgh went.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in the best interests of both men to move beyond their
bruised feelings, despite the obvious strain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials are hoping that independent voters who
flocked to McCain during the primaries will swing to Bush in
November, with a little push from the senator. And because McCain
hopes to run for president again, according to close associates, he
needs to show loyalty to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   During the primaries, McCain repeatedly criticized Bush for
proposing to spend too much of the nation's surplus on a tax cut at
the expense of shoring up Social Security and Medicare and paying
down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not respond to the charge while campaigning in New
Hampshire and subsequently lost the state to McCain by 19 points.
In South Carolina, however, Bush began to fire back, objecting
vociferously when McCain compared Bush to President Clinton. Bush
later suggested that McCain would cut federal funds for breast
cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, McCain blasted Bush in a pitch to Catholic voters
for failing to repudiate the teachings of Bob Jones University in
South Carolina, where interracial dating was banned at the time and
where the pope has been compared to Satan.

RUSSIANS TEARFULLY RECALL VICTORY OVER NAZIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Every other day of the year, Alexander Grigorinsky, 87,
is just another poor old Russian pensioner, living alone and
forgotten in a run-down communal apartment in a Moscow suburb.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, he was a hero one more time, as Russia celebrated
its victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Donning the light blue beret of a Soviet paratrooper and his old
medal-bedecked uniform, Grigorinsky joined 5,000 other veterans in
a parade through Red Square. Then, his hand resting on the cane he
has carried since his second gunshot wound, received one terrible
day in Hungary in 1944, he ambled around Moscow's Gorky Park,
looking for old buddies from his unit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he found two.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there were none.
</P>
<P>
   But it was OK. Tuesday, everyone wanted to greet Grigorinsky,
congratulate him, and listen to his story. Among them: a young
paratrooper with his arm still in a sling from the wound he
received fighting rebels in Chechnya; four tourists from China;
three Russian skateboarders; an exchange student from Ghana; and
finally, several men and women in their 70s and 80s, veterans from
another paratrooper unit, who sat him down at an outdoor cafe where
they all sang old war songs and drank to victory.
</P>
<P>
   This is the magic of Victory Day in Russia, a holiday that more
than any other in this often sad and struggling land brings people
together, and, for a day, makes old people happy. Even the
competing parade of thousands of Communist supporters denouncing
the poverty that has hit Russia since the demise of the Soviet
Union did little to darken the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem an ironic legacy for a war that claimed the lives of
an estimated 27 million Soviet soldiers and civilians; few Russian
families were untouched by the horror, tragedy, and privations. But
the victory in what is known here as the Great Patriotic War is
also remembered as the Soviet people's finest hour, the most
unifying moment of a 20th century otherwise marred by recurrent
hardship, repression, and stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only Russian national holiday with a human note,
because almost every family has something to mourn for,'' said
Sasha Popov, director of the American Studio of the Moscow Art
Theater, whose grandfather was killed in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Day in today's Russia is also a day of reconciliation,
when political battles take a back seat to the festivities, perhaps
the one day in Russia when violent history combines with the
turbulent present to produce a mellow brew.
</P>
<P>
   As watchful snipers surveyed Red Square, President Vladimir V.
Putin took in the parade of veterans, whose rows of medals
glistened on new gray suits provided by the government for anyone
who no longer had a uniform. The veterans were joined by
fresh-faced cadets and units that have fought in Chechnya, as well
as goose-stepping honor guards outfitted with World War II-era
uniforms, weapons, and standards.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was flanked by his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, who in
the early 90s, looking to make a break with the Communist past,
eliminated much of the military pomp of this day, and in 1995 built
a gate to Red Square that made it impossible to repeat the massive
shows of military force that paraded past the Kremlin in Soviet
days.
</P>
<P>
   They stood on a podium under the mausoleum of Soviet founder
Vladimir Lenin, whose name was tastefully covered by a green
banner. Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet president, whose reforms
helped dismantle Communist rule in Russia, stood by, as did Marshal
Dmitry Yazov, one of the men who tried to oust Gorbachev from power
in a failed 1991 coup.
</P>
<P>
   Even Josef Stalin, long discredited in mainstream Russia as a
bloody dictator, made a cameo appearance. Stalin's heroic status as
the mastermind of victory in 1945 has eroded as the reverent Soviet
view of his leadership has given way to a critical assessment. But
Putin, who has played heavily on patriotic themes, started his
address with the words Stalin used 55 years ago: ``Happy holiday,
dear brothers- and sisters-in-arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin leaders since Stalin have always sought to exploit the
victory for their own political message, and Putin Tuesday was no
exception when called on Russians to draw on the spirit of World
War II to ``build a strong and prosperous country, to raise high
the Russian flag of democracy and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the marshals clapped as they watched the veterans dance and
sing. Yeltsin wiped his eyes, and later put on glasses. Putin wiped
his eyes, too, though it could have been because of the very stiff
wind.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m. Moscow time, Russia's three major networks observed a
moment of silence. Across Moscow, red banners hung from buildings
and lampposts, and huge posters honoring the war dead declared
``Remember Them By Name,'' and ``Into the Third Millennium Without
War.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the banners may have seemed out of place for a
country that is bogged down in a war against rebels in Chechnya.
But most people in Russia see Chechnya as a righteous struggle
against bandits and terrorists. Many probably agree with Putin, who
lauded the soldiers who were ``writing new chapters in Russian
military history'' and said the Nazi's defeat will be ``a warning
to those who see terror and violence as their main weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No force can conquer the Russian arms and army,'' Putin said.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DEFENDS MICROSOFT BREAKUP AS GOOD FOR
CONSUMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wash., Calif.)   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding to Microsoft's public criticisms of the
plan to break it in two, the assistant attorney general in charge
of the Justice Department's antitrust division said Tuesday that
the actual result would be ``exciting new products, with more
choices and lower prices for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The official, Joel Klein, added that Microsoft's main argument
against the breakup ``is wrong as a matter of fact, and wrong as a
matter of history as well.'' He was speaking at a forum on the new
economy at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, the Justice Department and 17 state attorneys
general asked a federal judge to break Microsoft into two
companies. One would hold the Windows operating system, the other
everything else, including the Office suite of application programs
like Word and Excel.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 days, Microsoft has responded publicly with
blistering criticism of the plan. On Wednesday, its legal response
is due in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has asserted, among other things, that the integration
of its operating system and applications software divisions into
one company produces efficiencies that bring innovation. Klein said
that argument was ``wrong as a matter of fact, since the two
companies would be free to exchange technical information, as long
as that information was made available to third parties.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Microsoft ``has long claimed that it provided
third-party applications developers all the information about its
operating system that those developers could need'' to write
software programs for Windows. If that is true, he said, ``there is
no real loss of efficiency in the reorganization.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein also said that opponents of the breakup of AT&AMP;T in 1984
``made the very same claim, arguing that the divestiture would
imperil the efficiency of the telephone network.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he added, ``that argument has failed the test of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaborating on the AT&AMP;T comparison, Klein rebutted another
Microsoft argument: that it was not the breakup that freed AT&AMP;T to
compete, but the order to deregulate it.
</P>
<P>
   But Klein noted that AT&AMP;T and the Baby Bells were left with
restrictions prohibiting them from entering one another's markets.
Under the plan to break up Microsoft, he said, ``the separated
companies would be entirely free to compete with each other in all
lines of business.''

REACHING FOR POWER OVER STREETS AND SKY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 14) 
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is architecture an art? What restrictions can
government place on architects without violating constitutional
principles?
</P>
<P>
   A new proposal to overhaul New York City's zoning laws is now
forcing New Yorkers to confront these fundamental questions. Titled
the Uniform Bulk Program, the proposal amounts to the architectural
manifesto of the Giuliani administration _ a major statement on the
most famous skyline in the universe. The statement goes something
like this: New York to Architecture: Drop Dead! At the precise
moment when things are looking up for the continuous art of
building our great city, here comes the cultural equivalent of the
street crimes unit. Back in line! Back in line! We got architecture
off the streets 40 years ago and we're not going to let it back
now!
</P>
<P>
   Proposed by the Department of City Planning, the Uniform Bulk
Program is now wending its way through the public review process
required before it can become law. The plan has already been
endorsed by community boards. The City Council is expected to vote
on it sometime this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But what is it? And why is it here? What's the point? It's hard
to get straight answers to such questions. At a public hearing in
late April, it was obvious that even members of the city's Planning
Commission were in the dark. In a series of exchanges with
representatives from civic and real estate groups, the
commissioners seemed as eager as anyone to figure out just what
their own staff had cooked up. With only a few weeks left to make
revisions, the plan headed for the City Council vote has many
people asking ``say what?''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no apparent strategy to deceive the public. The
issue is much more complicated. Real estate development and
municipal government are two relics of the 19th-century industrial
city. In the information age, the power of both groups has vastly
diminished. They are both in major denial about this. Both sense
that the center of power has shifted to the cultural plane. But
neither of them knows how to climb up there. The Uniform Bulk
Program is supposed to give them a boost. It's designed to give a
cultural aura to what are fundamentally economic and political
transactions. Unfortunately, it does so at the expense of
architecture that has a genuine cultural contribution to make.
</P>
<P>
   Some features are discernible within the program's nebula of
charts, graphs, codes and bureaucratic jargon. Three of these would
have a substantial impact on architecture in New York. The first
two we might call the Tops and Bottoms of the new urban silhouette.
</P>
<P>
   _The plan would set height limits on new skyscrapers throughout
the city. Depending on location, the height would vary from 360
feet to 495 feet to 720 feet. Large swaths of midtown and lower
Manhattan would be exempt, along with downtown Brooklyn and Long
Island City, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   _The plan would abolish current zoning regulations that
encourage developers to create small public parks and plazas in
exchange for added height. Instead, new towers would sit on
low-rise bases that extend to the street wall. These would
typically be used for retail. The planning department describes
this so-called contextual format as a rejection of the
towers-in-a-park concept encouraged by the 1961 zoning resolution,
which is still in effect.
</P>
<P>
   _The third provision, by far the most ominous of the three,
calls for the creation of a design review panel within the city
planning department. Chosen by the department's chairman, a
political appointee, the panel would consist of ``architects and
others concerned with design issues.'' Assuming a function now held
by the city's Board of Standards and Appeals, it would review
applications from developers seeking special permits that would
exempt them from the new contextual zoning.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Since the Uniform Bulk Program is a political as well as a
cultural document, it's worth speculating about the political
motives behind it, even though, with such a secretive and rigid
city administration, it is natural to suspect the worst. Here are
some suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   The Law of the Instrument states: the instrument must be used.
With so many planning functions now performed by other city, state
and federal agencies, as well as private business improvement
districts, something must be found for City Planning to do. Here it
is.
</P>
<P>
   With only two years remaining in his term as planning chairman,
Joseph B. Rose wants to be remembered for doing Something. The
Something could just as easily be Something Else. It happens to be
this.
</P>
<P>
   The program is an elaborate operation intended primarily to give
Rose control over the special permit procedure now supervised by
the Board of Standards and Appeals. Rose, who comes from one of New
York's most illustrious real estate families, has the makings of a
frustrated architect. The special permit process would enable him
and his successors to fiddle with forms and shapes without being
subject to public scrutiny or accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the ultimate goal of the Uniform Bulk Program is to turn
the city planning chairman _ whoever it may be _ into the design
czar of New York, with sweeping powers to define the cityscape for
years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Like architecture, the Uniform Bulk Program can be analyzed on
two planes: the material and the metaphoric. Real estate developers
will find the program's material implications of greater interest.
What must they do to comply? How much will compliance cost them, in
time and square feet? Will there be a grace period for projects in
the works? Will the new zoning simplify permits? How will it affect
the market?
</P>
<P>
   Those interested primarily in architectural values must reckon
with the program's symbolic as well as its material value. The two
realms are interlocked. In architecture, quantity can be a quality.
To some developers, tall buildings may signify little more than
tall profits. But they are also elements in a skyline that rivals
the Gothic cathedral in symbolic power. By the same token,
developers may regard a bonus plaza simply as a device that enables
them to add more rentable floors. But it is also a void in a city
that has little tolerance for undeveloped land. In this case, lack
of quantity is a quality, at least if you like voids.
</P>
<P>
   The sky and the street are in themselves symbolic. They are
contested spaces where the rights of private ownership and public
use come into frequent conflict. Contestation, in fact, is what
these spaces symbolize. We can quantify them in terms of shadow,
sky exposure, required seating and trees, but their symbolic value
lies in the tension between freedom and equality in a democratic
society.
</P>
<P>
   Contextualism, the overarching ideology of the Uniform Bulk
Program, offers to resolve this tension in symbolic form. By
limiting the visual impact of new buildings, contextual
architecture is supposed to give people the sense that they are in
control of their surroundings. This, at least, is the underlying
theory. The abolition of plazas, the requirement that buildings
extend to street walls, is intended to preserve the existing
character of neighborhoods. The adoption of height limits,
similarly, is meant to preserve the existing skyline as a picture
postcard. The competitive urges of developers like Donald Trump
will not be permitted to disturb its Art Deco ziggurat contour.
</P>
<P>
   In practice things are far less ideal. It is easy to find
examples of bonus plazas to illustrate the argument that these
public spaces should be abolished. What such examples actually
show, of course, is that they were poorly designed, that their
developers have no stake in maintaining them and that city
officials lack the will to demand improvements. But there are other
examples _ I happen to live in a building blessed with one _ in
which the bonus park beautifully fulfills its original concept. In
real as well as symbolic terms, the park helps bridge the chasm
between private luxury and public amenity. This was a worthy
experiment for the capital of modern democracy to undertake.
</P>
<P>
   It scares me to imagine the mentality that wants to preserve the
skyline in its present form. It is painful, of course, to make that
skyward stretch each time a new skyscraper takes shape and towers
over its neighbors. But that stretch is the context of New York.
Changes in scale, evolutions in form: these are traditional
training exercises for a city that prides itself on its ability to
adapt to change. If you don't stop before the miracle happens, a
building that once seemed objectionably out of scale may eventually
look custom-made to your perception. It is hard to believe that New
Yorkers will take to squat, stubby towers with quite the same pride
they take in the Woolworth Building, the Chrysler Building and
Rockefeller Center.

HOSPITALS OFFER SPECIALIZED TELEDIAGNOSES TO THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The telemedicine movement took a giant leap forward
Tuesday when a Cambridge company and several Boston hospitals
agreed to provide second opinions for one of the world's largest
insurers by reviewing patient records on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCare Inc. signed the contract with American Life Insurance
Co., which will allow its customers, for a fee, to seek electronic
second opinions from specialists at Massachusetts General Hospital,
Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and
three other US hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   While it's illegal in this country for doctors to provide
medical advice to out-of-state patients over the Internet, the
telemedicine director for the Boston hospitals said his doctors
will not communicate directly with overseas patients.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they will consult with the patients' regular doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of doing it in a way that promotes the highest
quality of care and ethics,'' said Dr. Joseph Kvedar, director of
telemedicine for Partners HealthCare, the parent company of
Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women's. ``Some companies
promote doctor-to-patient chats online. To me, that's offensive.
What we're talking about is doctor-to-doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of online care argue that it's inappropriate for doctors
to advise and conduct ongoing relationships with patients they've
never met. And they say it's particularly when the doctor is not
licensed in the patient's home state, and therefore not subject to
state standards and oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Kvedar said that doctors charge WorldCare a fee, which he would
not disclose, for the consultations. But, he said, the relationship
``is not a revenue center for us.'' WorldCare, founded in 1992, has
helped arrange second opinions to more than 10,000 patients and
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   The Partners hospitals have provided about 600 second opinions a
year to patients in 30 countries for WorldCare and other online
organizations for several years. But the agreement with American
Life Insurance is expected to significantly expand the program and
the countries where it's available.
</P>
<P>
   It will also make the practice less expensive for the insured,
who now pay about $1,000 for a second opinion from a US hospital.
American Life Insurance will charge patients $5 per year for
second-opinion coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 600 second opinions Partners provides annually to
overseas patients, about 60 patients end up coming to one of the
Boston hospitals for treatment _ which may be the real financial
benefit to the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to raise the standard of care around the world,''
Kvedar said. But, he added, ``it does get our name out.''
</P>
<P>
   American Life Insurance will provide the second opinions to
patients in 16 countries in Latin American, the Middle East, and
Eastern Europe. Using secure digital technology and a private
telecommunications network, WorldCare will transmit patients'
medical records to the hospitals, which also include the Cleveland
Clinic Foundation, Duke University Health System, and Johns Hopkins
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCare's telemedicine coverage includes analysis of the
patient's MRI, X-ray, ultrasound, CT scan, and other radiology
studies; analysis of pathology slides; treatment plans recommended
by a top sub-specialist in the field; and a conference call, if
needed, between the attending doctor and the US specialist.

 &HT;    Frequent fliers vote Continental No. 1
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continental, TWA and Southwest airlines fly highest when it
comes to passenger service quality, according to an annual survey
of frequent fliers.
</P>
<P>
   The trio ranked 1-2-3 for both long-haul and short-haul flight
quality in the survey by Frequent Flyer magazine and J.D. Power and
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, which last year tied with
Continental for third on short flights, was deemed below average in
both categories this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are genuinely perplexed because customer service is a top
priority for Delta, and we have made considerable improvement,''
spokesman John Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Delta, which handles 80 percent of passengers at
Hartsfield International, was among the top four airlines in the
Department of Transportation's primary service measures for 1999.
It recently finished second in a survey of consumer perceptions by
the Harris polling organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Frequent Flyer/J.D. Power survey uses a range of service
measures to establish an industry average in each category, then
ranks carriers that finish above it. Below-average carriers are
listed but not ranked.
</P>
<P>
   The most important factors are on-time performance, airport
check-in processes, flight attendant courtesy, and seat space and
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Results are based on 6,079 flight evaluations submitted by ``a
national sample of representative frequent fliers,'' 54 percent of
whom reported some type of flight problem, according to the
magazine and J.D. Power.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that 25 percent of frequent fliers use the
Internet for travel planning and that about half of those buy
tickets online.

 &HT;    BellSouth: TV coming next year
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BellSouth Corp. has promised that its new satellite service will
create thousands of jobs while reshaping the way customers use
their televisions.
</P>
<P>
   As the deal with GE Americom was formally announced Tuesday,
BellSouth vowed to deliver its Americast service next year, putting
the company in head-to-head competition with a host of cable and
satellite providers already in the market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to hundreds of channels of television, the service
will eventually offer e-mail, video on demand, video games and the
chance to make purchases over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a forward shift in how people watch TV and what they
they use TV for,'' said Bob Frame, president of BellSouth
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The set-top box allows downloading of movies or other programs
that can be watched later, rewound and paused. If you hook the
set-top box to the Net via a phone or high-speed line, you can
watch television and interact with a related Web site. For example,
you'd have a Braves game on and link to the site that sells
merchandise. That hook-up also lets the television serve as a
gateway to the phone, so if you have Caller ID, the screen might
flash the number of an incoming call.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth expects to package this with its other services, said
Frame. ``One company, one call, one bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Even limited to the Southeast, the deal could be a boon to $25
billion-a-year BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   It will extend BellSouth's entertainment offerings throughout
the region, giving the company a chance to deepen its bonds with
customers even as telecommunications competition heats up.
BellSouth would like to use digital television as part of a package
including phone service and Net access.
</P>
<P>
   Without endorsing the estimate, BellSouth officials did not
object to reports that they expect to reap about $3 billion a year
from the service in the Southeast. That figure represents a large
portion of the money already spent on digital television, which
means BellSouth expects to take business from others while the
overall market also grows.
</P>
<P>
   The company is confident of winning a large market share, Frame
said. ``I think 25 to 30 percent is certainly doable.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based telecom analyst Jeffrey Kagan endorsed BellSouth's
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts BellSouth in a very strong competitive position,''
he said. ``The more customers they can tie up with a telephony and
entertainment bundle, the harder it will be for competitors to woo
them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have given the plan mixed reviews, some expressing
skepticism about BellSouth's ability to lure customers from
entrenched satellite providers like DirecTV and EchoStar's Dish
network.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly MediaOne, metro Atlanta's largest cable company,
is blase about the threat. ``We saw this coming five or six years
ago,'' said Reg Griffin, company spokesman. ``We feel as if we are
in a much better more competitive position now.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver-based MediaOne has spent $400 million upgrading its
network here. The company, which has agreed to be acquired by AT&AMP;T,
can now deliver its high-speed offerings to about 40 percent of the
1 million homes passed by its lines.
</P>
<P>
   But MediaOne has a different approach than BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne wants to give customers the option of high-speed
Internet access and digital entertainment _ but not via the same
device, Griffin said. ``Our customers tell us they want those
services, but they want them independent of each other. The serious
user wants the Internet on the desktop or the laptop, while the
rest of the family may be watching television.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the specter of entrenched competitors, BellSouth counts
on its reputation _ as well as the new technology wrinkles _ to
carve out a solid share of the entertainment market.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has declined to talk about how much it will charge for
the new service. Current Americast customers pay an average of $54
a month, more than most satellite services charge.
</P>
<P>
   But BellSouth may not have to undercut competitors to do well,
said Schaffer Hilton, partner in technology at Deloitte &AMP; Touche
Consulting. ``I think the BellSouth brand name carries a lot of
weight in the nine-state region. I would hope they'll be more
aggressive in pricing than the existing satellite providers, but
you can ride on the BellSouth brand name a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Demand for new technology is growing, he said. ``Five years ago,
it was more of a technology looking for a place to happen. Now, a
broader number of consumers don't think this is a stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth intends to have its own technicians install the
equipment, including the 30- by 20-inch dish that will receive
signals. If the venture does well, BellSouth will need customer
service representatives, sales staff, marketing help and
supervisors, in addition to installers, Frame said. ``If we execute
our business plan, there will be literally thousands of jobs
created.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth now delivers its Americast service in 11 metropolitan
areas using either high-speed fiber lines or signals transmitted
from a few antennas in high places. But fiber is costly to install
and has been placed in only a portion of BellSouth territory. And
the wireless signal can be checkmated by hills, buildings and
trees. BellSouth says Americast has been enthusiastically embraced
where offered, but the company can claim just 120,000 takers for
the limited offering.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, BellSouth can use satellites to make Americast
available to 14 million households _ more than 90 percent of the
people in the nine states where BellSouth is the dominant local
phone company. Even more enticing, the satellite service also
dangles the possibility of expanding beyond the Southeast to 50
million households ranging from Texas to Wisconsin and east to the
Atlantic, Frame said.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite deal is the third big-ticket move by BellSouth
since its failed bid to buy Sprint in October.
</P>
<P>
   After taking some heat from analysts, BellSouth has this year
announced a multibillion-dollar tracking stock for its Latin
American investments and a giant wireless alliance with SBC
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Around BellSouth, rivals were growing ever larger, and the
company appeared headed for irrelevance, said analyst Marc Bacurin
of J.C. Bradford &AMP; Co. ``Even six months ago, the impression
everybody had of BellSouth was that things were passing them by.''
</P>
<P>
   While viewing the satellite deal as positive, Bacurin said he is
surprised that BellSouth seems ready to ratchet back its support
for digital subscriber lines, high-speed technology capable of
using some copper wires.
</P>
<P>
   Still, BellSouth and other regional phone companies have had
trouble delivering DSL to much of the market, and satellite
offerings don't preclude work on DSL, Bacurin said. ``It shows that
they are thinking about strategic alternatives, as opposed to a
year ago. They are not going to go down without a fight.''

 &HT;    A digital home sweet home
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Digital technology, which has fueled the revolution in business,
data transmission and communication, is expected to soon change
households and the way we relate to one another in daily life.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech engineers and computer specialists, in a year-long
project, are now examining this future, live and in color.
</P>
<P>
   Their laboratory is a digitally equipped frame house on 10th
Street, dubbed Aware House, that will be a discrete focal point for
their research.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our goals is to discover technology combinations that
can unobtrusively enhance lifestyle in the home of the future,''
said Nikil Jayant, director of Tech's Broadband Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Special attention will be paid to the needs of infants and older
citizens and of families in general, Jayant said.
</P>
<P>
   On display during a recent open house were several special
projects for the special groups, including unique ways to monitor
infants and a system to monitor an older person remotely _ either
across town or on another continent by means of an ``always on''
broadband connection to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The digital watch on seniors, called Aging in Place, builds on
the assumption that older people, even though they are becoming
dependent, do better if they can remain in their familiar home as
long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research suggests that as we grow older the comfort of
familiar surroundings is better for us than being uprooted and
placed somewhere else, however well-meaning,'' said Beth Mynatt, an
assistant professor of computing who will pay special attention to
research on Aging in Place.
</P>
<P>
   Mynatt's research will consist of interviewing seniors and their
children or caregiver to see what families desire to know, and what
levels of information seniors care to share.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far we established one fact _ nobody wants a video camera
in the bathroom,'' Mynatt said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities, however, include cameras on stairs, and
other watchful devices that keep track of security, eating habits,
socialization, and taking of medication.
</P>
<P>
   Systems could be programmed to alert loved ones, police, doctors
or others automatically if things go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   With infant monitoring, the baby's room would be provided a
special edition of the ``smart shirt,'' developed first for
military use by Sundaresan Jayaraman and his Tech team in the
School of Textile and Fiber Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The garment, a wearable computer that the Defense Department
would use to monitor the well-being and
</P>
<P>
   whereabouts of the troops in the field, can be put to peacetime
uses too _ such as to monitor body functions and
</P>
<P>
   protect against sudden infant death.
</P>
<P>
   The specially wired house allows the parent or caregiver to
receive audio or data reports on the infant or sick child
automatically wherever he goes around the house.
</P>
<P>
   The baby's cry or other hints of distress would be picked up by
the snug-wired garment and piped into the
</P>
<P>
   room where the caregiver happens to be, but only to that room if
he so chooses.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the baby garment would be waterproof, Jayaraman said.
</P>
<P>
   That garment could also be adapted for use by others in the
house who are ill or need special monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   As with many of the other applications of technology in the
house, the study will examine not just how things work in the hands
of real people, but how people take to them, and what precisely
they expect from them, the scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human challenge with this technology is as much a
challenge, if not more, than the technological challenge,'' said
Gregory Abowd, an associate professor of computing.
</P>
<P>
   Abowd's classrooms have been minilaboratories in the use of
digital video and audio, as well as data retrieval, in the service
of teaching.
</P>
<P>
   He is a member of the research team at Aware House.
</P>
<P>
   And so is Thad Starnes, a developer and devotee of the unique
wearable computer, whose researchers will be testing a device that
could replace the basket full of remote controls around the living
room.
</P>
<P>
   The special device, which could be worn about the neck or
attached to a shirt like a pendant, would be able to
</P>
<P>
   control lights and electronic equipment with discreet hand
movements instead of by button pushing.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of the research will be to find out what use ordinary
people have for the new technology, Starnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Other features of the house to be studied will be the ``smart
floor,'' a system that can track the movements of individuals by
their footsteps around the house, so that anyone can know their
whereabouts at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Other technologies will tag personal items like glasses,
wallets, keys and other items that have a habit of
</P>
<P>
   getting lost, and help the forgetful individual locate them
instantly at any time.
</P>
<P>
   The study in the 5,000-square-foot three-story house is funded
by a combination of federal funds and private corporate support.
</P>
<P>
   This includes a $700,000 grant from the Georgia Research
Alliance for the design and construction of the house.

 &HT;    F-22 production will remain in Marietta
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin will not move final assembly of the F-22 fighter
from Marietta to Fort Worth, Texas, a decision that preserves more
than 1,000 Cobb County jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The aerospace giant had been quietly considering such a move
since last winter, when it consolidated management of all aircraft
programs at its fighter plant in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   But in a memo to Marietta workers and at a Washington news
conference, executives said Tuesday no move is planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the last few months, we have reviewed results from
several previous studies of F-22 production plans, including
options for moving final assembly,'' Marietta plant chief Tom
Burbage said in the memo. ``The financial implications of these
studies do not support a change in current plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore, there are no plans to move F-22 final assembly from
our facility in Marietta.''
</P>
<P>
   The company didn't say how much it would cost to shutter F-22
facilities in Marietta, but U.S. Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), in a
statement hailing the stay-put decision, pegged it at more than
$500 million.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,200 of the 7,500 jobs at the plant are tied to the
decade-old F-22 program, with most of the rest linked to the C-130J
cargo plane. The company has spent millions building not only an
F-22 assembly line in Marietta but also specialized testing
facilities and an administrative and engineering complex.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the idea of moving the work to Fort Worth has
cropped up periodically as the company has fought to contain costs
in the controversial program, slated to move from development to
production next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth plant already makes midfuselage sections of the
F-22. Lockheed Martin looked at consolidating all its F-22 work in
Fort Worth to cut long-term overhead costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Morning News last week reported that members of the
Machinists union at the Fort Worth plant, just coming off a strike,
believed their plant was in line to get the F-22 final assembly
work.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin officials issued Tuesday's memo in part to quell
the continuing speculation.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a move concerned the Machinists union at
Marietta and Georgia members of Congress. Both have helped Lockheed
Martin protect the F-22 program in Congress and would take a dim
view of any shift of work to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   F-22 funding in the fiscal 2001 defense budget cleared an
initial hurdle Tuesday when the Senate Armed Services Committee
approved the Air Force's request for an initial production lot of
10 planes. The committee also was expected to add funding for two
C-130Js to the four requested by the Pentagon.

 &HT;    Sprint increases EarthLink stake
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sprint Corp. said Tuesday it would increase its investment by
$431 million in EarthLink Inc., an Atlanta-based Internet service
provider .
</P>
<P>
   After the stock purchase of 26 million additional shares, Sprint
has a 26.7 percent interest in the ISP.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint originally owned 29 percent of EarthLink, though that
percentage was cut in half when EarthLink issued additional stock
after Apple Computer invested $200 million in January. EarthLink
merged with Atlanta-based MindSpring earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The long-distance telephone carrier had been expected to
increase its holdings to its previous level and had until Aug. 4 to
exercise that option. Sprint purchased the shares for $16.58 each _
that's 2.5 percent below EarthLink's closing price Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bodes very well for EarthLink,'' said Frank Gristina, an
assistant vice president and research analyst with Atlanta-based
Robinson-Humphrey. ``It's a good move for Sprint and a signal they
want to move into other markets. You'll see more and more
traditional companies trying to expand into Internet markets.
Rather than try to build quality brands in-house, which can be
expensive and distracting, many are finding it's easier to look
outside. Sprint's interest in the company is an extra vote of
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink Chief Executive Officer Garry Betty said the timing of
the investment was auspicious. ``Because of this we are able to do
some things from a contractual standpoint that will be positive for
both EarthLink and Sprint.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty said most people don't realize that EarthLink is Sprint's
consumer Internet offering. He said the two companies were partners
in Sprint's ION (Integrated On Demand Network), which will begin
rolling out in July in selected markets and nationwide next year.
Betty also said that there would be additional branding
opportunities with Sprint including EarthLink wireless service
slated to roll out sometime this summer.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink said Sprint's investment will boost its cash reserve
64 percent to $1.1 billion. Betty says he plans to use the money to
continue building EarthLink's customer base.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of use of the cash, we still feel we have to scale up
to become a stronger alternative to America Online. We'll do both
selective and opportunistic acquistions and internal marketing to
work toward that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty would not specify what companies or partners EarthLink
would consider combining with. ``There are still some properties
that are attractive,'' he said, ``and we will augment our growth
that way if the financial terms are right.''
</P>
<P>
   Gristina said EarthLink has always been very careful about its
acquisition spending, trying never to spend more than $400 per new
subscriber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously they need to keep a little war chest to continue to
market at their current rate and have a little breathing room,'' he
said. ``EarthLink has always focused on the cost of acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   However, with a multimillion-dollar cash infusion from Sprint,
the company may be able to spend more to acquire the subscribers
Betty says it has to have to go after AOL. AOL has about 22 million
subscribers; EarthLink, the second-largest ISP in the country, has
3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this will enable them to do a rebate program with a
computer reseller,'' Gristina said.

 &HT;    Textile proposal stands to boost state
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Georgia yarn and fabric companies should get a significant boost
from a new textile trade agreement that's poised to become law.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to
liberalize trade with Caribbean nations and give struggling areas
of Africa greater access to U.S. markets. The Senate is expected to
approve the measure this week.
</P>
<P>
   The bill expands apparel trade with 48 sub-Saharan African
nations and 25 Caribbean nations. Garments made in those countries
with U.S. yarn and fabric can enter this country without duty or
quotas.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for some Georgia manufacturers that have
watched the steady exodus of apparel operations to other countries.
In a sector marked by dwindling jobs due to technology and overseas
competition, the new trade bill could create 63,000 U.S. textile
jobs, said Roy Bowen, president of the Georgia Textile
Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia is going get a large share of that,'' Bowen said. The
new jobs will come across the board, from production to marketing
and management. About 40 percent of the state's textile companies
are involved in the apparel business, Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote is timely this week, as the state association
held its annual meeting at the Cloister on Sea Island.
</P>
<P>
   Yarn spinners and fabric makers will benefit the most from the
bill, said Roger Chastain, president of the American Textile
Manufacturers Institute and chief operating officer of Greenville,
S.C.-based Mount Vernon Mills.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain predicted that, with the agreement, demand for U.S.
fabric will at least double over the next eight years. The trade
bill, if approved, would take effect in October.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the bill lays the groundwork for a showdown on trade
with China. The House is expected to decide the week of May 22
whether to grant China permanent normal trade status. If the House
approves the measure, Senate passage is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say permanent normal relations with China are
essential to assure the U.S. benefits from China's likely admission
to the World Trade Organization. The textile industry has been
aggressively fighting China's entry into the WTO, fearing increased
competition from Chinese apparel makers.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean measures of the new trade bill could help offset
any damage done if China is allowed into the WTO, said Kay Norwood,
a textile analyst with Wachovia Securities. She warned Georgia
industry leaders Tuesday that China's entry is almost certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fabric manufacturers need to make friends south of the border
(in the Caribbean and Mexico), developing joint ventures, alliances
and relationships with garment makers to assure a market for their
fabrics,'' Norwood said. ``Inaction at this point means you're
giving up future business.''
</P>
<P>
   Boosted by the North American Free Trade Agreement, thousands of
mills churn out clothing in Mexico, for example. Less than a year
after NAFTA was passed in 1994, apparel imports from Mexico
surpassed apparel imports from China, Norwood noted.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Caribbean measures of the bill are viewed generally
as positive, the African portion presents some risks.
</P>
<P>
   China has said it would use the proposed free trade with
sub-Saharan Africa as a way to smuggle its goods into the United
States. ``Because there are no trade restrictions between Africa
and China, the elimination of quotas from Africa would give China
free access to the U.S.,'' Norwood said. ``This would be a disaster
because China could flood our markets with no controls
whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwood said the positive effects of the African measure are
unclear, because the group of 48 countries accounted for less than
one half of 1 percent of apparel imports into the United States
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill creates incentives for growth in Africa's embryonic
textile and apparel industry. Clothing made in Africa from African
fabric would be allowed to rise from 1.5 percent of total U.S.
imports to 3.5 percent over eight years, boosting African exports
of those products from $250 million in 1999 to an estimated $4.2
billion in 2008, according to the International Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   African nations where the gross domestic product is less than
$1,500 a year per capita, all but six of the total, also would
export to the United States quota-free for four years, even when
they use fabric from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has been in the works for about six years, Chastain
noted. During that time, many in the textile industry fought to
stop the legislation, arguing it would cost American jobs.

<P>
   For years, H. John Lochow felt as though the word ``techie''
were practically branded on his forehead. As a computer systems
manager at AT&AMP;T Capital Corp. and at CNA Insurance Cos., and later
as the chief information officer for a succession of corporations,
he says, he was never allowed to run other departments, let alone
serve on high-level management teams at these businesses.
</P>
<P>
   For him, things have turned out well. But Lochow's lurch up the
corporate ladder is not an isolated case. In corporate America, an
increasing number of chief information officers _ basically, they
are the folks in charge of the computers _ are amassing greater
power as top bosses and company boards realize how crucial their
expertise is in staying ahead of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Lochow (pronounced LUCK-oh) got his chance to break loose from
the techie label last year. Opportunity called in the form of a
mini-crisis at his current employer, Tech Data Corp. in Clearwater,
Fla., a giant computer distributor that was growing so fast it
could not hire enough people to keep up with orders. Its warehouses
were bulging with products that could not be shipped.
</P>
<P>
   Lochow, whose main responsibility until then had been to
maintain the smooth functioning of the company's computers in 35
countries, believed he was the man to break the logjam. So he asked
Tech Data's chief executive, Steven A. Raymund, to put him in
charge of the company's supply division. After all, he told
Raymund, he had already turned around the information technology
operations to make them more efficient, and at no additional cost
to the company.
</P>
<P>
   He got the assignment and threw himself into it with tasks like
picking apart and mapping every process that Tech Data used in its
warehouses to receive and ship its products.
</P>
<P>
   He emerged a hero: Within three months, Tech Data had almost
doubled its shipments and had trimmed back inventory. Now Lockow
reports directly to Raymund, and earlier this year he was given
responsibility for managing yet another department, the one that
assembles the company's products.
</P>
<P>
   Lochow clearly savors his new role at Tech Data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now my responsibilities cross many lines of business,'' he
said. ``Before, I felt like I was up against a glass ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by Egon Zehnder International, an executive
search firm, found that companies are increasingly looking to a new
generation of chief information officers to be business
strategists, and that these ``new'' CIOs spend at least half their
time outside the information-technology department on efforts like
developing and incubating new prospects for electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that 15 percent of new chief information
officers now serve on the boards of their companies and 70 percent
are on their companies' high-level management teams. Those numbers
are up sharply from a decade ago, industry specialists say, when 0
percent and 10 percent would have been more likely figures.
</P>
<P>
   The information officers are reveling in their elevation from
backroom tinkerers with fancy titles to strategic thinkers on an
equal footing with corporate presidents, chief operating officers
and chief financial officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the third generation of CIO now,'' Lochow said. ``The
first generation was made up of techies, like data center
directors. And although the second generation was more vocal in
terms of becoming part of corporate planning, its members were
still one level below directly reporting to their chief executives.
Now, however, thanks to the Internet, CIOs are moving directly into
corporate decision-making.''
</P>
<P>
   Executive recruiters say the trend is the inevitable fallout of
the Internet revolution, which has recast the dynamics of the
marketplace of almost every industry overnight and forced companies
to react with equal speed or face extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that companies would say, `Find us a CIO who
will take care of our computer systems,''' said S. Ross Brown, who
is the director of the high technology and telecommunications
recruiting practice at Egon Zehnder. ``But now they're calling to
say, `We need a CIO who can help us define our whole way of doing
business.'''
</P>
<P>
   Those new responsibilities require new duties, of course,
including spending more time with both the corporate brass and
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Cecilia Claudio, the chief information officer at the Farmers
Group, the subsidiary of Zurich Financial Services that is based in
Los Angeles, says her new travel schedule takes some getting used
to. In March, Claudio spent three days crisscrossing Indiana to
meet with more than 60 sales agents, something that chief
information officers like her would never have done five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't look to me as just being a CIO,'' she said. ``I'm
expected to bring wisdom, to understand all aspects of our
business, as well as not work in isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Claudio joined Farmers two years ago, she said, her job
at a former employer was focused entirely on the information
systems. But now she is asked almost daily for her views on
questions like whether to increase the company's sales staff and
how to sell multiple products to existing customers.
</P>
<P>
   Because technology now touches every corner of almost every
company's business, Claudio said, chief information officers are
probably better prepared than other top managers to assume new
responsibilities _ including the mantle of chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of quite a few situations where this has already
happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick J. Zilvitis, the chief information officer of Gillette
Co., says his expertise is sought out because technology touches
every aspect of Gillette's operations, even product design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to be involved in change management in everything I
do,'' Zilvitis said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not as though CIOs are on an unstoppable march to the top
at every corporation in America, of course. One school of thought
is of the opinion, in fact, that as a group they retain a
detail-oriented mentality that can miss the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bernard, who founded his own consulting firm in New York,
for example, believes that for all the changes wrought by the
Internet, too many chief information officers continue to
``worship'' technology, while ignoring both the strategic and the
customer-service aspects of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue for CIOs and their staffers is that no one has
articulated to them how much their jobs have changed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some do grasp those changes, of course, and are leveraging their
new stature to shop themselves around.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hjelm left his job as chief information officer at Federal
Express in January to become chief operating officer at Zoho Corp.,
an Internet vendor in Sunnyvale, Calif., that caters to hotels and
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 years at Federal Express, Hjelm said, he had become
tired of endlessly reinventing the giant company's computer systems
and yearned for a more expansive role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready to try something different, as well as be a part
of the Internet economy,'' he said. ``Now, I'm creating something
new, as well as an entire business model in an industry that's ripe
for it. That's why a lot of chief information officers like me are
leaving.''

 &HT;    Food allergy awareness week: Nothing to sneeze at
 &HT;    By Jennifer Brett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeff Campbell remembers with a grimace the day he had to eat his
lunch all alone.
</P>
<P>
   The self-imposed exile was necessary. Several of the
10-year-old's friends had peanut butter sandwiches in their
lunches, and Jeff is so allergic to peanuts that the smell is
enough to make his lips swell and his skin break out in hives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the lunch lady if I could be moved,'' said Jeff, a
fourth-grader at Crabapple Crossing Elementary School in
Alpharetta, Ga. ``I had to sit by myself, and I was mad.''
</P>
<P>
   That was last year. This year, Jeff says he usually has no
problem at lunch because his friends are sensitive to his allergy.
Mindful of children like Jeff, the school's cafeteria serves no
peanut products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not going to take the risk,'' said Principal Sonia
Terry, who said the school has not served peanuts for at least
three years. ``Every now and then we'll get a delivery (of peanut
products) and it's stopped at the loading dock.''
</P>
<P>
   That might sound extreme, but consider this: According to The
Food Network, a Fairfax, Va.-based organization that has declared
this week ``Food Allergy Awareness Week,'' between 100 and 200
people die each year from food allergy-related reactions. The
organization says there are an estimated 30,000 emergency room
visits a year because of severe reactions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, for example, a 13-year-old middle school student in
Kentucky died after having an allergic reaction to nuts in
chocolate candy she ate at school. And schools in Pennsylvania,
Iowa, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, Illinois, Massachussetts,
California and New York City have banned peanuts from the cafeteria
because of students with severe allergies.
</P>
<P>
   In response to concerns, school officials throughout the metro
area say they use a variety of means to ensure that children with
food allergies don't accidentally eat an item that might cause a
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   For example, students in the Gwinnett County, Ga., use meal
cards. When the cards are swiped, the computerized cash register
alerts the cashier to a child's food allergy, so the cashier can
police what's on the child's tray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some parents give photos of their children to the people at
the register,'' said Laura Nurse, manager of community and media
relations.
</P>
<P>
   At Jeff Campbell's school, Terry credits parents like Jeff's
mother, Susan Campbell, for making everyone in the school aware of
food allergies. Jeff and other students with allergies have
emergency health care procedures posted on the school clinic's
bulletin board. The clinic also stocks EpiPens, medical devices
used to administer epinephrine to a child having an allergic
reaction. Parents bring the EpiPens for their children, and must
present doctors' notes before the clinic can accept them.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who has also placed an EpiPen in Jeff's lunch box, is
pleased with Crabapple Crossing's response but wants to spread her
message of education and awareness. She is a member of the Food
Allergy Network.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta school systems typically don't set rigid
food-allergy policies governing every cafeteria, but allow each
school to deal with whatever allergies or dietary needs the
children there may have. ``There is no districtwide policy,'' said
Barbara Gilbert, food service director for DeKalb County, Ga. ``...
If we are aware a child is allergic to a specific thing, we will
make a special meal. We will work with them.''
</P>
<P>
   When an allergy requires more specialized meals _ such as an
allergy to wheat _ students must bring lunches from home, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb County school cafeterias offer varied menu choices to
accommodate allergies. Children who can't drink milk can have
juice, and children who can't eat a peanut butter sandwich can
choose a turkey sandwich instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lunchroom managers and parents are always in communication
about what the child's needs are,'' said Daphne Hanks, food
nutrition services area coordinator for the system. ``We try to be
as flexible as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Turner, food nutrition coordinator for the Cherokee
County, Ga., school system, said cafeteria workers keep lists of
children with food allergies and monitor them as they proceed
through the lunch line. They also display signs that signal, for
example, the brownies being served that day include peanuts or
walnuts. Even with the signs, children with food allergies often
quiz cafeteria workers to make sure they don't eat something that
could cause a reaction, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids know to ask,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cookies that contain peanuts are served separately from cookies
that do not, Turner said. The cafeteria will also prepare special
dishes for children with food allergies _ broccoli without cheese
sauce for a child who is allergic to milk products, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Food allergies affect not only the cafeteria but also policies
on classroom snacks a parent may bring in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't just give out candy indiscriminately,'' said Paul
Kraack, spokesman for the Clayton County, Ga., school system.
Parents must tell teachers what treat they'd like to bring.
Teachers will ask the parents to bring an additional item if the
proposed treat would cause a reaction in someone.
</P>
<P>
   In high schools, students with allergies pick a buddy in each
class who knows how to administer epinephrine in the case of an
allergic reaction, Kraack said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Minar's daughter Lauren, a fourth-grader at Mountain Park
Elementary in Lilburn, Ga., is allergic to peanuts and other nuts.
Minar feels comfortable sending Lauren, 9, to school because of
school policies that set aside a ``peanut-free zone'' in the
cafeteria and require staff to be aware of allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren also knows to read labels and not to sit near anyone
eating peanut products.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Raymond, assistant principal at Mountain Park, said about
20 of the school's 600 students have allergies. EpiPens are kept in
classrooms, the clinic and the cafeteria. Anyone who comes into
contact with an allergic child knows about the allergy and
emergency plans in case of a reaction, Raymond said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody kind of looks out for these kids, including the
children,'' he said. ``The children at our school know they don't
sit next to someone with an allergy if they're eating something
(the child is allergic to).''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff, the Crabapple Crossing student, said his friends plan
their lunches to avoid problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year if I make a new friend, I say I'm allergic to
peanuts and if it's possible try not to bring any peanut products,
because if they do I won't get to sit with them,'' Jeff said.
``They'll say OK.''
</P>
<P>
   AVOID THESE
</P>
<P>
   Eight foods cause 90 percent of food-allergy reactions: milk,
eggs, peanuts, other nuts, fish, soy, shellfish and wheat. Symptoms
of a reaction include hives, abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea,
swelling of the mouth or throat or difficulty breathing. The most
severe type of reaction, anaphylaxis, is sudden and can be fatal.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   BE A FRIEND
</P>
<P>
   Children can help their friends with food allergies stay safe by
following some simple guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't share your food with food-allergic friends.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Learn what your friend is allergic to and help your friend
avoid it by reading ingredient labels and asking questions when
eating in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wash your hands after eating, especially if you've eaten
something to which your friend is allergic.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Remind your friend to always carry medication if prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't let your friend go to the bathroom alone, especially if
the friend is not feeling well.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If a reaction occurs, call 911 immediately.

COMMENTARY: A SYMBOL ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could argue that the question whether to grant China
``permanent normal trade relations,'' or PNTR, is mainly a
procedural issue. The United States won't be reducing any existing
trade barriers; all the concessions in terms of opening markets
will come from the Chinese side. Nor will we in any way be dropping
our guard against Chinese espionage, abandoning our commitment to
the defense of Taiwan, or otherwise pretending that the Chinese
government is any better than it is.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate over PNTR isn't about the literal content of the
measure itself; it's about the symbolism. For labor, blocking PNTR
would be a demonstration of clout _ even though the trade
arithmetic suggests that union members as a group would if anything
benefit from China's offered concessions. For those who
understandably abhor China's current rulers, blocking PNTR would be
a slap in the face of undemocratic regimes everywhere _ even though
nobody really thinks that a rejection would drive those rulers from
power.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with taking symbolic stands in politics _
and China's government has done nothing to merit kid-glove
treatment. The trouble is that whatever symbolism a defeat for PNTR
might have here in the United States, it would have even more
powerful symbolism elsewhere _ and in a way that would ultimately
hurt the very causes the opponents of trade normalization say they
hold dear.
</P>
<P>
   The reason I support PNTR _ not with a completely clear
conscience, but because the alternatives seem so much worse _ is
that I remember what the world was like a couple of decades ago.
Back then, the tide seemed to be running against everything we
stand for; khaki-clad dictators, who ruled their nations' economies
as well as everything else with an iron hand, seemed to be the men
of the hour. The idea that by the year 2000 Western ideas _ not
just the ideology of the free market, but the principle of liberal
democracy _ would have spread farther than ever before would have
seemed implausible. But it happened, largely because governments in
the developing world became aware of how well some countries had
done by opening themselves to the world market.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Deng Xiaoping didn't decide to liberalize China's
economy because he was a nice guy, or a secret admirer of Adam
Smith; he looked at Taiwan and South Korea and realized that their
export-led, market-driven growth was delivering something Maoism
never could. And post-Deng China _ for all its ham-handed
repression _ has become a far freer, more open society than anyone
could have imagined 25 years ago, mainly because all-out
totalitarianism and a market economy don't mix. You don't have to
be a disciple of Friedrich Hayek to believe that free markets and a
free society have some affinity, and that the world has become more
democratic over the last two decades partly because it has also
become more market-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   So think what a rejection of normal trading relations with China
would in effect say to governments _ China's government and others
_ that are still wavering in their commitment to freer economies
and their willingness to accept the loss of political control that
such economic liberalization usually brings. It would be as if the
United States, the home of the free-market/free-society ideology,
were to say ``Sorry; markets and democracy work for us, but we
aren't letting any more countries into our club.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the opponents of normal trade relations insist that
they don't mean to convey any such message. Of course, they assure
us, the door remains open to countries with sufficiently democratic
regimes and with adequate labor protection. Give us a decent
government in China, they say, one that lets labor unions organize,
and we'll open up the door. But few people in the developing world
_ or for that matter in Washington _ think that such assurances are
sincere; they believe that anything short of political perfection
will be used as an excuse to block exports, that any labor
protection that does not price developing countries out of world
markets will be deemed inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   So the opponents of normal trade relations with China are right
_ it's an issue whose symbolic importance is much larger than its
direct economic implications. But that symbolism is a reason to
vote  &UR; for &LR;  normalization, not against it.

REUTERS GROUP BUYS BUSINESS RESEARCH FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Slumping demand for technology stocks came as bad news
to Primark Corp. which had planned to sell shares in its Yankee
Group technology research subsidiary. But along came Plan B, in the
form of the British media company Reuters Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters has agreed to pay $72.5 million for Boston-based Yankee
Group, part of a campaign to build up Reuters as a major provider
of business research and consulting services. The deal was
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing is going out and building new businesses for
Reuters in the corporate information market, which globally is a
$15 billion industry,'' said Brad Hanson, CEO of Reuters
Enterprise, the unit that will acquire Yankee Group.
</P>
<P>
   As for Primark, the agreement offers an attractive alternative
to an IPO in bearish times. ``The capital markets are not
particularly amenable to IPOs of small companies right at this
moment,'' said analyst Peter Appert of Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Primark acquired Yankee Group in 1996 for $34 million in cash
and up to $31 million in additional performance incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Primark estimated that the deal with Reuters will
generate a $35 million pretax gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the current conditions in the IPO marketplace,'' said
Primark chairman and CEO Joseph Kasputys, ``the cash sale of 100
percent of the Yankee Group is more advantageous than our
previously announced plans for an initial public offering of
approximately 40 percent of its equity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Group's chief executive, Berge Ayvazian, agreed. ``I'm
extremely pleased,'' said Ayvazian, who will remain at the helm.
``The IPO marketplace has become very unfavorable. . . . You can't
throw IPOs out and watch them fly anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   With the deal, Primark will extract itself from the technology
information business. The Waltham, Mass. company sold its TASC
military information unit to Litton Industries for $432 million in
1997. Its remaining stable of companies, including MarketEye,
Disclosure, and A-T Financial Information, focus on economic and
financial news and research.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters, meanwhile, is eager to get into the tech research and
consulting business. Last year, it acquired Tower Group of Needham,
Mass., which specializes in the application of information
technology to financial services companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic strategy here is that the market research sector is
very large,'' Hanson said. ``It's a multibillion-dollar global
industry. It continues to grow at 15 to 20 percent per year.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank's Appert agreed that the Yankee Group acquisition
is good business for Reuters. ``It's a great business, very
profitable, and has grown very, very consistently over the years,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters' American depository receipts closed down $4.9375 at
$99.4375 Tuesday on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Primark fell 13 cents
to $25.3125 on the New York Stock Exchange.

 &HT;    Wary gardener battles hostile takeover attempt
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCCAYSVILLE, Ga. _ Weed war is hell. I learn that anew each year
during high-weed season, and the lesson always disappoints. You
see, I love ``weeds.'' That is, I love some, including the lovely
and talented Queen Anne's lace, long tall mullein, wild potato vine
_ and can you believe anyone would consider horsetail an
undesirable?
</P>
<P>
   But like everything else in the garden, a weed's rise or fall
depends on whose taste rules the plot. It's not a weed if you say
it's not. As a longtime defender of ``weeds'' and ``trash trees,''
such as mimosa, I thought these disparaged ones recognized my
friendship and never would get totally loose in my space. Wrong.
Along came sow thistle, as hostile as dwarf bamboo, that cultivated
plastic grass.
</P>
<P>
   Sow thistle reminds me of what a newspaper friend, an editor,
used to say to jokingly belittle us ungrateful writers: ``No matter
how much you do for a reporter, it will always hate you.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering all I've done for thistle and many other weeds _
giving them homes among the Japanese maples, the hollyhock, ginkgo
and the rest of my intentional ornamentals _ I couldn't believe sow
thistle acted out the way it did. It had to be hate.
</P>
<P>
   That was my reluctant conclusion the other day when I saw two
lines of this dandelionlike plant (yes, dandelion is one I've
always sheltered, too) growing on each side of a row of
twice-blooming cherry trees. The thistles had shot up to at least a
foot in a matter of days, their soft, reddish stems fattening up by
the minute. Clearly, this was a hostile act.
</P>
<P>
   I could not let such disrespect go. I launched my counterattack,
pulling the weeds out, roots, stems, leaves and all, benefitting
from a recent rain, striking while the earth was cool and wet. What
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing like a good weed battle to bring out the
primitive in a gardener. I like to display the vanquished until
they dry up and disappear. I have hung clumps of unwanted bamboo in
the Y of trees and shrubs, condemning the ripped-out reeds to
drying and brittling, doing everything but crying out for merciful
death.
</P>
<P>
   Some ancient trait in me asserts that this public display warns
all that come after: Grow here, and the same will happen to you. I
know, I know. If that really worked, I would be weedless in
McCaysville and everywhere else I have gardened for, lo, these five
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I do it, hang an unwanted weed out to dry.
</P>
<P>
   The sow thistle made such a wonderfully willing victim. So named
because pigs (and some humans) love to eat it, this plant, unlike
some thistles, has a stem unprickled enough to handle without
gloves, my way to garden. Like the dandelion, it produces yellow
flowers and fuzzy-haired seeds that ride wind and water to faraway
places, reproducing by the zillions.
</P>
<P>
   In my garden, a colony had developed underground, popping up in
rows much like cane bamboo, flanking the cherries as if preparing
to close in for a weedy kill. Sometimes growing as high as 6 or 7
feet, they just might have the strength to commit such mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   I beat them to the punch, ripping out and laying out all the
plants on the rocks they grew next to, rocks that I had placed
there to outline the cherry-tree plot. My prize display is a huge
specimen stretched atop a slab of quartz that measures some 4 feet
long. During its tenure on the slab, the thistle has had its root
dirt bathed away by showers.
</P>
<P>
   Even on warmish, blue-sky days, the gray-white slab is cool to
the touch. Thus, it will take days for the sow thistle to dry up,
readying itself for its ultimate return to the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the message to others remains out there. A weed here,
and there, and over there, too, can be beautiful. But don't try to
hog all the space.

<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ After a night of looting, the abandoned
house of the brutal rebel leader Foday Sankoh had been stripped of
almost everything on Tuesday morning. Looters had left gaping holes
in the brick walls where air-conditioners had kept out West
Africa's stifling heat, and they had absconded with every piece of
furniture, clothes and item of value.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the house, seven bodies, most of them Sankoh's
bodyguards, lay stiff in the bush and gutter. Inside, the looters
left behind only some garbage and scraps of paper.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were pages from an original copy of the 10-month-old
peace accord and an original copy of a document in which Sierra
Leone's president granted Sankoh _ the man responsible for a terror
campaign that left thousands of men, women and children killed or
maimed _ ``absolute and free pardon.'' That allowed him to live,
join a power-sharing government, form his political party and,
eventually, participate in presidential elections. At least that's
how the peace process was supposed to go.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it came undone. And so, Foday Sankoh, the legendary
survivor, a jungle fighter with barely a primary school education,
a failed commercial photographer, a cashiered corporal of Sierra
Leone's army, has succeeded in turning his small country into a big
problem for the world.
</P>
<P>
   He has humiliated the United Nations. He has embarrassed the
West, including the Clinton Administration.
</P>
<P>
   And now, after a confrontation outside his house on Monday, in
which his bodyguards killed at least four civilians while 75 U.N.
peacekeepers watched helplessly, he had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Had he vanished into the bush? Did a rival militia kidnap him?
Was he even alive? The U.N. force said it did not have him, and did
not know his whereabouts. In the confusion Monday, U.N.
peacekeepers fled from the compound and apparently did not return
in time to see what happened to Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are anxious to find a way of contacting Mr. Sankoh for
reasons that I think are clear to all,'' David Wimhurst, the
spokesman for the U.N. force, said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons related to the fact that 498 U.N. soldiers and
civilians being held hostage by Mr. Sankoh's men.
</P>
<P>
   In the confusion, the United Nations is trying to sort out what
it can do to restore order. Thousands of fresh troops from Jordan,
India and Bangladesh are expected to arrive sooner than originally
planned to operate under the U.N. flag. In addition, Washington has
sent a military team to Nigeria so that two Nigerian battalions can
be deployed here as a West African force.
</P>
<P>
   That came a mere week after the Nigerians left Sierra Leone and
Sankoh seized on their departure to attack the U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Freetown remained tense on Tuesday, as British
paratroopers evacuated hundreds of Europeans. The paratroopers, who
arrived on Monday, were not expected to take part in the U.N.
force, though many could be seen on Tuesday operating checkpoints
and patrolling near the U.N. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the capital, Nigerian and Guinean soldiers for the
United Nations abandoned the junction town of Masiaka, about 35
miles east of here, after they ran out of ammunition, Wimhurst
said. Sankoh's loyalists were thought to be advancing toward
Freetown. Kamajors, traditional hunters who have been allied with
the government, as well as members of a military junta that briefly
controlled Sierra Leone in 1997, could be seen heading east out of
the capital.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.N. force began losing its grip on the country in recent
days, the country's main militias have re-emerged, recreating the
sense of lawlessness and anarchy that long pervaded Sierra Leone.
New alliances appear to have formed, most significantly between the
government and the 1997 junta, which was allied with Sankoh until
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 junta is made up of former soldiers and headed by Lt.
Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, who, like Sankoh, was a member of this
power-sharing government. Most residents of Freetown, particularly
those living around Sankoh's abandoned house, seem convinced that
Koroma had captured Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Koroma's house on Tuesday morning and afternoon _ where
young men dressed in sweats carried automatic rifles and walked up
and down a staircase above which hung a sign that read ``Peace'' _
men talked of waiting for arms supplies from the government so they
could go fight Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   Koroma was too busy to talk, his aides said. But his personal
bodyguard, Hiroshima Bomb, who wore a skirt and a tanktop over
chest muscles of steel, and a necklace of ammunition rounds,
explained the new alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fight the RUF,'' Bomb said of Sankoh's organization. And of
the government that he had tried to topple only last year, he now
said: ``It's my father, my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens next to Sierra Leone will depend in great part on
whether Sankoh is alive or dead.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Sankoh's ruined house on Tuesday, one local man, Michael
Kamara, 50, said Sankoh's involvement was essential to resolving
the nine-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to express himself to the people,'' Kamara said. But
what if he were dead? ``Peace will take its course,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power and wealth to the people,'' read a poster in front of
Sankoh's destroyed house.
</P>
<P>
   It was with that message that Sankoh began a civil war from the
bush in 1991. The message struck a chord. Sierra Leone, rich with
diamonds, had long been controlled by a corrupt elite made up of
Lebanese businessmen and urban Sierra Leoneans. Many of these
Sierra Leoneans were descendants of the freed slaves who gave the
capital its name and formed a privileged class.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh represented the rural dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Sankoh, who is in his 60s, seemed driven by a drive
for power. His ally, Charles Taylor, a guerilla fighter who
terrorized Liberia into making him its president, provided the
overall strategy: Target civilians and make their suffering so
great that they will make you president just to stop the suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Sankoh's group began committing the atrocities that
defined this war: chopping off people's hands and arms. Belgian
colonialist had done that decades ago to rule their colony in
central Africa, the Congo. But Sankoh infused the strategy with a
contemporary significance: his men cut people's hands because they
had used them to vote in 1997 for the current president, Ahmad
Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
   No hand, no more vote, his men said, as they chopped off limbs
with machetes and axes.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that Sankoh did not believe in elections, preferring
the military option. Since the peace accord was signed in July, he
delayed laying down his weapons and obstructed peacekeepers from
deploying, especially in the diamond district, where his men kept
digging. Now it is believed they are better financed and equipped.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Mr. Sankoh's gutted house, in a second-floor room
designated ``confidential office'' and ``out of bounds to all,''
self-motivational messages decorated the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three kinds of people,'' read one of them. ``Those
who make things happen. Those who watch things happen. Those who
wonder what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, if he is alive, certainly sees himself belonging to the
first category, and has gambled that the international community
will fall into one of the others.

 AFTERMATH OF ELIAN RAID LEAVES MIAMI BITTERLY DIVIDED   By RICK c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For such a small boy, Elian Gonzalez has had a large,
far-reaching impact on the government of a city that was his home
for a mere five months. Mayor Joe Carollo, a Cuban-American
incensed by a federal raid to seize the child, has virtually remade
city hall, and the Miami city government is, more than ever,
distinctly Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo, who fired City Manager Donald Warshaw after he refused
to fire Police Chief William O'Brien after the armed raid on the
house of Elian's relatives on April 22, has named Carlos Gimenez, a
Cuban-American who was the city's fire chief, as city manager.
</P>
<P>
   The move came just a little over a week after Raul Martinez,
also a Cuban-American, was named to replace O'Brien, who resigned
in anger, as police chief.
</P>
<P>
   Miami now has a Cuban-American mayor, city manager and police
chief, as well as a Cuban-American majority _ three of five _ on
City Commission. While Cuban-Americans mostly supported Carollo's
actions, some residents here wonder if such a preponderance of
power is good for the already sharply divided city.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, Anglos, blacks and some Hispanics have
pelted City Hall with bananas, a symbol of what many here see as
Miami's ``banana republic'' government, and have begun a petition
to remove Carollo.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of people here are concerned and outraged because
they believe the city of Miami has lost its balance and
equilibrium,'' said Arthur Teele Jr., Miami's only black city
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Teele, like many here, said Carollo's government seemed willing
to exclude all but Cuban-Americans at a time when passions were
running high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to talk about healing when you are widening the
gap,'' said Teele.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent development in Miami's chaotic political
landscape, a Miami-Dade County Circuit judge lifted a temporary
injunction Tuesday that had prevented Carollo from removing
Warshaw. That cleared the way for the Cuban-born mayor's
appointment of the Cuban-born Gimenez.
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw, who was appointed by Carollo two years ago, said the
mayor had subjected him to a ``humiliating public execution.'' Each
man accused the other of misdeeds, but Circuit Judge Steve Levine
ruled that Carollo, under the city charter, could fire the city
manager.
</P>
<P>
   But in Miami, it is the impetus for all these drastic changes in
city government that has some residents angry.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor sided with the city's exiles against the federal
government in the custody battle to keep Elian in the United
States, after the child was found floating on an inner tube off the
coast of Fort Lauderdale on Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo demanded, in the days after the raid that returned Elian
to his father, that Warshaw fire O'Brien, who had refused to tell
Carollo about the raid on the house because he was afraid the mayor
would tip off demonstrators and create chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw refused to fire O'Brien, a 25-year police veteran, and
he himself was fired by Carollo on April 27.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien resigned the following day, saying he could no longer
work for the ``divisive'' and ``destructive'' Carollo.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both Gimenez and Martinez said they wanted to get on with doing
their jobs. ``We need to put this whole episode behind us,'' said
Gimenez.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he was proud to be a Cuban-American police chief,
``but more proud to be just the chief of police.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few days, many outside the Cuban community have
reacted harshly to the exiles' protests of Elian's removal by
taking part in counter-demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Many feel they have no voice in a government that, to them,
seems to be by, of and for Cuban-Americans, and are angry at the
exiles' protests in which the American flag was flown upside down.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Miami ``defines diversity and division now,'' said
Susan MacManus, a political science professor at the University of
South Florida. ``It's not surprising, but it is disheartening to
non-Cubans. There could be long-term negative consequences because
people feel they are not being represented.''
</P>
<P>
   Gimenez is not seen as a pure political appointee, but as a
capable administrator who is respected inside and outside city
hall, said James Corey, a political science professor at the
University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows the ins and outs of this city's government,'' Corey
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, where more than 60 percent of voters are
Cuban-American, it is inevitable that political appointees will
reflect the community, pointed out some political experts.
</P>
<P>
   It is the timing, at such a sensitive time, that seems unwise to
the critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a purge to get rid of all the Anglos in the
city,'' said Max Castro, a senior research associate at the Dante
B. Fascell North-South Center at the University of Miami.

 &HT;    Elian media coverage in Atlanta expected to be a circus
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It should look like the media circus has come to town
when the Elian Gonzalez hearing takes place in Atlanta on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the TV weaponry sure to be employed on the narrow
downtown streets in front of the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
_ more than a dozen satellite trucks, banks of cameras aimed at the
courthouse doors, endless feet of cable snaking along the sidewalks
_ TV largely left this story a couple weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   So its arrival on Thursday is likely to be a one-day performance
_ just long enough to capture images of 6-year-old Elian's Miami
relatives, expected to attend the hearing; the lawyers for both
sides; whatever demonstrators are present; and developments from
inside the camera-free courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The major network news anchors are not scheduled to come to
Atlanta. Only the cable news networks are expected to report live
outside the courthouse. Other networks will report during their
morning shows and evening newscasts, and beefed-up local newscasts
will break in as events warrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drives the story for us are the images, and thus far the
images haven't changed,'' said CBS correspondent Byron Pitts, based
in Atlanta. ``All the networks will be there, they'll all do
stories, but I think there's a belief, as far as TV is concerned,
that it's drawing to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, this is a network TV soap opera,'' Pitts added,
``and while some episodes are more interesting than others, you
still have to cover every one. If this was a soap opera about a
60-year-old star having a baby, (Thursday's hearing) would be her
going for a sonogram.''
</P>
<P>
   With 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez out of camera range since federal
agents took him from Miami on April 22, TV coverage has fallen off
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   In April, 243 segments on the Gonzalez case appeared on
broadcast network morning shows, and 22 segments on afternoon and
evening newsmagazines, according to Kansas-based NewsTV
Corporation, which monitors coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But so far this month: only 9 segments have aired on morning
shows, and one segment on the newsmagazines.
</P>
<P>
   Only 12 media credentials were granted inside the 136-seat
courtroom, picked from a lottery of about 45 media outlets, said
Norm Zoller, Circuit executive. WSB, which didn't get a lottery
credential, is paying two interns to camp out overnight in line for
when the public is admitted, first-come first-serve, beginning at 7
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Short of something unexpected, the most compelling image
Thursday is likely to be the departure from the courthouse of
Elian's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not be able to read the judges, but we'll be looking
for any type of emotion or reaction from (the relatives),'' said
Sharon Fain, southeast bureau chief for Fox News, which is flying
in its New York booker to round up key players for its primetime
talkshows.

 &HT;    Elian media coverage in Atlanta expected to be a circus
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It should look like the media circus has come to town
when the Elian Gonzalez hearing takes place in Atlanta on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the TV weaponry sure to be employed on the narrow
downtown streets in front of the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
_ more than a dozen satellite trucks, banks of cameras aimed at the
courthouse doors, endless feet of cable snaking along the sidewalks
_ TV largely left this story a couple weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   So its arrival on Thursday is likely to be a one-day performance
_ just long enough to capture images of 6-year-old Elian's Miami
relatives, expected to attend the hearing; the lawyers for both
sides; whatever demonstrators are present; and developments from
inside the camera-free courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The major network news anchors are not scheduled to come to
Atlanta. Only the cable news networks are expected to report live
outside the courthouse. Other networks will report during their
morning shows and evening newscasts, and beefed-up local newscasts
will break in as events warrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drives the story for us are the images, and thus far the
images haven't changed,'' said CBS correspondent Byron Pitts, based
in Atlanta. ``All the networks will be there, they'll all do
stories, but I think there's a belief, as far as TV is concerned,
that it's drawing to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, this is a network TV soap opera,'' Pitts added,
``and while some episodes are more interesting than others, you
still have to cover every one. If this was a soap opera about a
60-year-old star having a baby, (Thursday's hearing) would be her
going for a sonogram.''
</P>
<P>
   With 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez out of camera range since federal
agents took him from Miami on April 22, TV coverage has fallen off
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   In April, 243 segments on the Gonzalez case appeared on
broadcast network morning shows, and 22 segments on afternoon and
evening newsmagazines, according to Kansas-based NewsTV
Corporation, which monitors coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But so far this month: only 9 segments have aired on morning
shows, and one segment on the newsmagazines.
</P>
<P>
   Only 12 media credentials were granted inside the 136-seat
courtroom, picked from a lottery of about 45 media outlets, said
Norm Zoller, Circuit executive. WSB, which didn't get a lottery
credential, is paying two interns to camp out overnight in line for
when the public is admitted, first-come first-serve, beginning at 7
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Short of something unexpected, the most compelling image
Thursday is likely to be the departure from the courthouse of
Elian's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not be able to read the judges, but we'll be looking
for any type of emotion or reaction from (the relatives),'' said
Sharon Fain, southeast bureau chief for Fox News, which is flying
in its New York booker to round up key players for its primetime
talkshows.
</P>
<P>
   At CNN, Thursday is merely ground zero for a story it has
covered from the start, whether there are compelling visuals or
not. Executives compare it covering a critical day at the U.S.
Supreme Court, which also bars cameras.
</P>
<P>

Keith McAllister, managing editor for national newsgathering.

<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ After a night of looting, the abandoned
house of the brutal rebel leader Foday Sankoh had been stripped of
almost everything on Tuesday morning. Looters had left gaping holes
in the brick walls where air-conditioners had kept out West
Africa's stifling heat, and they had absconded with every piece of
furniture, clothes and item of value.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the house, seven bodies, most of them Sankoh's
bodyguards, lay stiff in the bush and gutter. Inside, the looters
left behind only some garbage and scraps of paper.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were pages from an original copy of the 10-month-old
peace accord and an original copy of a document in which Sierra
Leone's president granted Sankoh _ the man responsible for a terror
campaign that left thousands of men, women and children killed or
maimed _ ``absolute and free pardon.'' That allowed him to live,
join a power-sharing government, form his political party and,
eventually, participate in presidential elections. At least that's
how the peace process was supposed to go.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it came undone. And so, Foday Sankoh, the legendary
survivor, a jungle fighter with barely a primary school education,
a failed commercial photographer, a cashiered corporal of Sierra
Leone's army, has succeeded in turning his small country into a big
problem for the world.
</P>
<P>
   He has humiliated the United Nations. He has embarrassed the
West, including the Clinton Administration.
</P>
<P>
   And now, after a confrontation outside his house on Monday, in
which his bodyguards killed at least four civilians while 75 U.N.
peacekeepers watched helplessly, he had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Had he vanished into the bush? Did a rival militia kidnap him?
Was he even alive? The U.N. force said it did not have him, and did
not know his whereabouts. In the confusion Monday, U.N.
peacekeepers fled from the compound and apparently did not return
in time to see what happened to Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are anxious to find a way of contacting Mr. Sankoh for
reasons that I think are clear to all,'' David Wimhurst, the
spokesman for the U.N. force, said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons related to the fact that 498 U.N. soldiers and
civilians being held hostage by Mr. Sankoh's men.
</P>
<P>
   In the confusion, the United Nations is trying to sort out what
it can do to restore order. Thousands of fresh troops from Jordan,
India and Bangladesh are expected to arrive sooner than originally
planned to operate under the U.N. flag. In addition, Washington has
sent a military team to Nigeria so that two Nigerian battalions can
be deployed here as a West African force.
</P>
<P>
   That came a mere week after the Nigerians left Sierra Leone and
Sankoh seized on their departure to attack the U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Freetown remained tense on Tuesday, as British
paratroopers evacuated hundreds of Europeans. The paratroopers, who
arrived on Monday, were not expected to take part in the U.N.
force, though many could be seen on Tuesday operating checkpoints
and patrolling near the U.N. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the capital, Nigerian and Guinean soldiers for the
United Nations abandoned the junction town of Masiaka, about 35
miles east of here, after they ran out of ammunition, Wimhurst
said. Sankoh's loyalists were thought to be advancing toward
Freetown. Kamajors, traditional hunters who have been allied with
the government, as well as members of a military junta that briefly
controlled Sierra Leone in 1997, could be seen heading east out of
the capital.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.N. force began losing its grip on the country in recent
days, the country's main militias have re-emerged, recreating the
sense of lawlessness and anarchy that long pervaded Sierra Leone.
New alliances appear to have formed, most significantly between the
government and the 1997 junta, which was allied with Sankoh until
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 junta is made up of former soldiers and headed by Lt.
Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, who, like Sankoh, was a member of this
power-sharing government. Most residents of Freetown, particularly
those living around Sankoh's abandoned house, seem convinced that
Koroma had captured Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Koroma's house on Tuesday morning and afternoon _ where
young men dressed in sweats carried automatic rifles and walked up
and down a staircase above which hung a sign that read ``Peace'' _
men talked of waiting for arms supplies from the government so they
could go fight Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   Koroma was too busy to talk, his aides said. But his personal
bodyguard, Hiroshima Bomb, who wore a skirt and a tanktop over
chest muscles of steel, and a necklace of ammunition rounds,
explained the new alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fight the RUF,'' Bomb said of Sankoh's organization. And of
the government that he had tried to topple only last year, he now
said: ``It's my father, my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens next to Sierra Leone will depend in great part on
whether Sankoh is alive or dead.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Sankoh's ruined house on Tuesday, one local man, Michael
Kamara, 50, said Sankoh's involvement was essential to resolving
the nine-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to express himself to the people,'' Kamara said. But
what if he were dead? ``Peace will take its course,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power and wealth to the people,'' read a poster in front of
Sankoh's destroyed house.
</P>
<P>
   It was with that message that Sankoh began a civil war from the
bush in 1991. The message struck a chord. Sierra Leone, rich with
diamonds, had long been controlled by a corrupt elite made up of
Lebanese businessmen and urban Sierra Leoneans. Many of these
Sierra Leoneans were descendants of the freed slaves who gave the
capital its name and formed a privileged class.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh represented the rural dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Sankoh, who is in his 60s, seemed driven by a drive
for power. His ally, Charles Taylor, a guerilla fighter who
terrorized Liberia into making him its president, provided the
overall strategy: Target civilians and make their suffering so
great that they will make you president just to stop the suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Sankoh's group began committing the atrocities that
defined this war: chopping off people's hands and arms. Belgian
colonialist had done that decades ago to rule their colony in
central Africa, the Congo. But Sankoh infused the strategy with a
contemporary significance: his men cut people's hands because they
had used them to vote in 1997 for the current president, Ahmad
Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
   No hand, no more vote, his men said, as they chopped off limbs
with machetes and axes.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that Sankoh did not believe in elections, preferring
the military option. Since the peace accord was signed in July, he
delayed laying down his weapons and obstructed peacekeepers from
deploying, especially in the diamond district, where his men kept
digging. Now it is believed they are better financed and equipped.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Mr. Sankoh's gutted house, in a second-floor room
designated ``confidential office'' and ``out of bounds to all,''
self-motivational messages decorated the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three kinds of people,'' read one of them. ``Those
who make things happen. Those who watch things happen. Those who
wonder what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, if he is alive, certainly sees himself belonging to the
first category, and has gambled that the international community
will fall into one of the others.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The choreographer and performance artist Ann Carlson has a knack
for astonishing audiences with simplicity. Downtown dance mavens
still oh and ah when recalling ``Visit Woman Move Story Cat Cat
Cat'' (1987), in which the voluptuous 5-foot-tall performer danced
naked while clutching a tiny kitten, vividly recreating the image
of Koko, the 300-pound female gorilla who learned to communicate
through sign language, and her pet kitten, All Ball.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of a series of dance works Carlson made in which
animals became her partners. And then there was the time in 1992
when she transformed the forbidding black-box theater at Dance
Theater Workshop into a gleaming white cube for an evening of
dances called ``Etihw,'' white spelled backward, that dealt with
purity, blindness and the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson, 45, has repeatedly based dances on ``what if''
scenarios _ often incorporating nontraditional performers _ while
exploring issues of community, femininity and mortality. In the
process, she often breaks down the barrier between performer and
spectator while redefining what constitutes performance. Carlson is
a conceptual artist who uses gesture, text and humor to break your
heart. As Jennifer Dunning wrote in The New York Times in 1998, ``
Carlson has an extraordinary gift for connecting the real and the
imaginary in ways that leave their mystery vibrantly intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson's new work will stretch the boundaries of dance
performance once again. ``Night Light,'' presented by Dancing in
the Streets in association with the Kitchen for eight performances
beginning on Wednesday, is a nighttime walking tour through the
Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Eight guides _ people who live
or work in Chelsea _ will lead groups of 15 to several locations
where they will happen upon tableaux vivants in which historic
photographs taken at those sites will be reconstructed by dancers.
The dancers don't move, the audience does, but then again, ideas
about stillness have long been a part of Carlson's choreographic
vocabulary. For reservations and location, call the Kitchen at
(212) 255-5793, Extension 11.
</P>
<P>
   There will be seven tableaus in all, although no single tour
will visit every site. Included are images of three women in towels
at a Turkish bath, based on a photograph from 1904, priests leaving
General Theological Seminary carrying suitcases (a recruitment
advertisement from 1955), a murder victim and an 1895 Alice Austen
photo of a young woman selling newspapers on the corner of Sixth
Avenue and 23rd Street in Manhattan. (The reconstructed ``vendor''
will be on the same corner.) Austen, an amateur photographer who
took about 8,000 images, is considered a precursor of documentary
photography. Carlson, with the help of two photo researchers and
the Museum of the City of New York, scavenged through thousands of
images before settling on these.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many issues in each photo,'' Carlson said. ``I
don't have a photographic background and it's been interesting to
learn about what photos are staged or not staged _ in one sense,
they are all staged _ and what the archives hold. You fall into
this abyss of whose history we are talking about when you look at
the archives. What gets kept? What gets remembered? It's very
difficult, for instance, to find historic images of people of
color. The photos also reveal issues of class. My concern is how do
you talk about that and not be didactic?''
</P>
<P>
   On one level, ``Night Light'' is a timely examination of
gentrification and displacement, of how one industrial section of
New York _ not accessible by public transportation _ has become one
of the centers of the contemporary art world. Dozens of galleries
have transformed garages into sleek exhibition spaces. And it's not
uncommon to bump into tour groups wandering through the galleries
on weekends. At the same time, Carlson is winking at herself as
part of this privileged, hipster world. Her portrait, taken with
the videographer Mary Ellen Strom, her partner of the last 10
years, was included in the recent Catherine Opie show at Gorney
Bravin Lee on West 26th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of ordinary people and their extraordinary stories has
been a recurrent element in Carlson's work. She burst onto the New
York performance scene in 1986 with ``Sloss, Kerr, Rosenberg and
Moore,'' a nine-minute dance for four real-life attorneys. The
performers were confined to a rectangular area taped on the floor
and never looked at one another. Through their wild gesticulations,
Carlson hilariously captured the competitive and insecure world of
corporate life. Other pieces using nuns, security guards and
basketball players have followed.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson, who grew up in Park Ridge, Ill., graduated magna cum
laude from the University of Utah with a bachelor's degree in
dance. She earned a graduate degree at the University of Arizona
before moving to New York in 1984. Specifically, she came hoping to
work with Meredith Monk, a multidisciplinary artist she had read
about but had never met or seen perform. She auditioned and did not
get into the troupe at first, but in 1986 she did join Monk, who
subsequently insisted that Carlson leave to pursue her own muse.
Today, Carlson lives in Stuyvesant Town with Strom and their three
adopted children, 7-year-old twin boys and a daughter, 6.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two years, ``Night Light'' will be recreated in
Boston, Chicago, Portland, Ore., and Riverside, Calif. In each
city, the presenter will pick the neighborhood for the tours, and
Carlson will then do the photographic research. Meanwhile, she is
presenting a new solo at the American Dance Festival in Durham,
N.C., on June 11 and 12, a companion piece to ``Grass/Bird/Rodeo,''
a triptych of solos she performed in February at grade school P.S.
122. In that piece, Carlson tries to demystify the choreographic
process by telling stories about the work and taking questions from
the audience before each section.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Night Light' is looking into a moment that is gone,''
Carlson said. ``I loved the idea of seeing these two-dimensional
photos brought back into three dimensions. I'm recreating these
images in a gray scale _ these ghostly images in a full-toned
world.''  &QL;

BRITISH CONSORTIUM BUYS ROVER FROM BMW 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ For the symbolic sum of 10 pounds, BMW of Germany sold
its money-losing Rover subsidiary Tuesday to a British consortium
that wants to maintain the troubled British automaker as a mass
producer of cars and guarantor of thousands of British jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price, equivalent to little more than $15, was
offset by a heftier promise of a $767 million loan from BMW to
enable the buyer, the Phoenix Consortium, to take over the company.
German newspapers have labeled Rover ``The English Patient''
because of its losses and low productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, struck with surprising speed after the collapse 11
days ago of negotiations between BMW and a British venture capital
firm, Alchemy Partners, seemed at least for now to avert the
threatened closing of Rover's Longbridge plant near Birmingham in
the British Midlands industrial belt.
</P>
<P>
   The plant employs around 9,000 people _ half of Rover's work
force _ and provides jobs for more than 20,000 others in the supply
business.
</P>
<P>
   BMW had said it would shut down the plant if no buyer was found
by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the sale showed how desperate BMW was to cut its
losses. But analysts said the consortium faced an enormous
challenge if it is to succeed where BMW failed after a six-year,
multibillion-dollar investment.
</P>
<P>
   The British pound, at $1.5332 in New York Tuesday, is at a
stubborn high against the euro, at 90.69 cents _ making exported
British-made cars more expensive in Continental Europe and imported
rivals cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   And, without mass sales, analysts said, it is difficult to see
how Rover can generate income to develop new models to replace its
compact 25 and 45 sedans.
</P>
<P>
   John Towers, a former Rover chief executive and prominent
Midlands businessman who leads the Phoenix Consortium, said the
company aims to produce 203,000 cars a year, slightly below its
output of 220,000 in 1999, and would be profitable in two years.
While BMW's previous negotiations with Alchemy Partners had been
expected to lead to thousands of job losses, Phoenix said there
would fewer than 1,000 layoffs at Longbridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted that, together with BMW, we have secured a
brighter future for Rover and its stakeholders,'' Towers said.
</P>
<P>
   His consortium is supported by labor unions, Rover dealers and
the British government. Apart from BMW's loan, Phoenix's financial
backing includes an offer of $315 million in credit from Burdale
Financial, a London-based division of First Union of Charlotte,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping we can calm the situation down and get on with
making cars,'' Towers said in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
   Joachim Milberg, the BMW chief executive, said, ``After intense
negotiations, we managed to find a buyer who will prevent the loss
of thousands of jobs in the Rover plant in Birmingham, in the
supplier industry and in the retail business.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix said Longbridge would make Rover's 25, 45 and flagship
75 model sedans, along with the MGF sports car and a version of the
Mini that is to be superseded by one produced by BMW. Alchemy
Partners, by contrast, had planned to phase out the Rover marque
and operate as MG Car Co., producing niche sports models. BMW,
whose British ventures include the rights to manufacture
Rolls-Royce luxury cars, will continue to supply engines for Rover.
</P>
<P>
   In a previously announced $2.9 billion deal, BMW is selling
Rover's sport utility Land Rover division to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The Rover investment _ and the difficulties in getting out of it
_ posed such a severe problem for BMW that some questioned its own
future as an independent producer of luxury cars. After Tuesday's
announcement, BMW shares rose 3.6 percent in Frankfurt, to 34.45
euros, or $31.24.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Rover by the consortium is the latest chapter in
a long-running story of troubles for the British manufacturer under
successive owners. It was state-owned in the 1970s and much of the
'80s. British Aerospace bought the company in 1988, followed in
1994 by BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Towers indicated at a news conference that he was considering an
alliance with a major car producer, possibly Honda, a collaborator
with Rover before its sale to BMW. At that time, Towers was Rover's
chief executive. He left a year after the BMW takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions welcomed the deal exuberantly. ``It's a fabulously
good day for my members,'' said Tony Woodley, of the Transport and
General Workers Union, which has negotiated packages for laid-off
workers valued at $32,000 to $40,000. ``We are absolutely over the
moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts remained skeptical of Phoenix's prospects, arguing
that Rover did not have the scale to compete in a marketplace
dominated by giants like Ford, Volkswagen and General Motors. ``I
suspect this just prolongs the agony,'' said Graeme Maxton, an auto
industry consultant.

challenge to digital music-swapping, Ian Clarke, a 23-year-old
Irish programmer, is moving on to the next battleground. He is
finishing a program that he claims will make it impossible to
control the traffic in any kind of digital information _ whether it
is music, video, text or software.
</P>
<P>
   His program, known as Freenet, is intended to make it possible
to acquire or exchange such material anonymously while frustrating
any attempt to remove the information from the Internet or
determine its source.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke and his group of programmers have deliberately set
themselves on a collision course with the world's intellectual
property laws. They express the hope that the clash over digital
copyrights will produce a world in which all information is freely
shared. In any case, the new programs could change the basic terms
of the discussion about intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   The swapping of music files over the Internet, through services
with names like Napster and MP3.com, has already raised the hackles
and mobilized the lawyers of the recording industry and some
musicians, who say the practice amounts to piracy. They hope either
to halt the services or to collect royalties on the digital works
being swapped.
</P>
<P>
   But programs now emerging make it possible to find and acquire
files without reference to a central database, and thus provide no
single target for aggrieved copyright holders. In fact, the
encryption methods being developed to protect such works may wind
up being trumped by encryption devised to cover the tracks of those
swapping them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this whole thing catches on,'' Clarke remarked, ``I think
that people will look back in 20 to 40 years and look at the idea
that you can own information in the same way as gold or real estate
in the same way we look at witch-burning today.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups and companies pursuing the new distribution
technologies _ programs that in effect create vast digital
libraries spread across potentially hundreds of thousands of large
and small computers _ do not necessarily share Clarke's ideological
viewpoint. They range from iMesh, an Israeli-American start-up
company that aspires to become an international commercial digital
distribution system, to several small groups of free software
developers intent on building new systems for the sharing of any
kind of digital information.
</P>
<P>
   Some contend that if their software lends itself to copyright
infringement, it is the user's responsibility, not theirs. Clarke,
putting into practice a view expressed by many in the free-software
movement, takes the more extreme position that copyright protection
is simply obsolete in the Internet era.
</P>
<P>
   The first version of his Freenet program _ written in England
and now distributed to many countries around the world _ was posted
on the World Wide Web in March.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, who lives in London and works for a small electronic
commerce company, said last week in a telephone interview that
there had been more than 15,000 downloads of the early versions of
his product, indicating that hundreds or perhaps thousands of
network servers on the Web were already running the program.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is confident that corporations trying to develop
complex technologies to encrypt information or otherwise halt the
free sharing of computer data will ultimately fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two words for these companies: give up,'' he said.
``There is no way they are going to stop these technologies. They
are trying to plug holes in a dam that is about to burst.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude, plus the fact that millions of users have come to
rely on easy access to digital information via the Internet,
suggests that the issue may quickly outstrip the current debate
over copyright infringement between the recording industry
association and a variety of Internet music distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no shortage of gray hairs from worrying about these
programs,'' said Talal Shamoon, a Silicon Valley executive who
heads the Secure Digital Music Initiative, a technology and
entertainment industry working group.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts believe that the intellectual property laws
are being used in an effort to grapple with technologies they were
never intended to address.
</P>
<P>
   ``Copyright law is not the right tool in the case of many of the
new technologies,'' said Pamela Samuelson, a digital technology and
copyright expert at the laws school of the University of California
at Berkeley. ``The question will quickly become whether other
governments have reasons to try to regulate these new systems or
whether the U.S. government has the ability to regulate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials are only beginning to wrestle with the
implications of new technologies that will permit the anonymous,
instant, global distribution of information of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously looking at all of these,'' said Christopher
Painter, deputy chief of the Justice Department's computer crime
and intellectual property section. ``It makes our job more
difficult and makes it harder to find the people who are
perpetrating crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Freenet, which Clarke conceived while he was an undergraduate at
the University of Edinburgh, is intended to function without any
centralized control point. ``Freenet is a near-perfect anarchy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet digital distribution program, Gnutella, created
by software developers at the Nullsoft subsidiary of America
Online, has the same distributed approach employed by Freenet,
meaning that there is no central directory of what information the
system contains.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Napster, which is limited to digital music files,
Gnutella makes it possible to distribute video, software and text
documents as well.
</P>
<P>
   America Online declared Gnutella an ``unauthorized freelance
project'' in March, just hours after it was made available on the
Internet. But since its developers made its code freely available,
independent programmers have continued to refine Gnutella even
though the project was officially canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Many computer industry executives contend that if the recording
industry's suit against Napster succeeds, it will simply lead
digital-music enthusiasts to use alternatives, like Gnutella and
Freenet, which are even less open to copyright enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``So are all the musicians and record companies going to
continue their suits against Napster?'' a Gnutella user who
identified himself as Panicst8 wrote in a recent network posting.
``It seems kind of pointless, or have they just not figured out yet
that Gnutella is about 10,000 times more effective at locating what
you want?''
</P>
<P>
   Freenet goes several steps beyond Gnutella in an effort to
protect the anonymity of those who publish or copy information
electronically. It encrypts each file and scrambles the key _
actually a long number _ needed to find the file within the system.
And Freenet incorporates a digital ``immune system'' that responds
to any effort to determine the location of a piece of information
by spreading the information elsewhere in the network.
</P>
<P>
   Freenet relies on a system of volunteers who run the program on
network computers, or servers, Clarke said, and it will even be
difficult for the operators of individual parts of the network to
determine which computer holds any particular file.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, at least, copyright holders can take comfort
from the fact that Freenet is more efficient at obscuring the
source of information than at helping users find it. Clarke has not
yet built a search capability into the system, so users must find
other ways to let one another know how to retrieve files.
</P>
<P>
   And technologists like Shamoon say systems like Freenet present
a challenge, but not an insurmountable one. In addition to his
industry role with the Secure Digital Music Initiative, Shamoon is
senior vice president for media at the InterTrust Technologies
Corp., a Silicon Valley company that builds systems for protecting
intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   He cites the possibility of the transmission of viruses and
other harmful programs as being one of the obvious risks inherent
in electronic communities where no basis for trust inherently
exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a trust standpoint, the current generation of tools such
as Gnutella and Freenet are a nightmare for the same reason that
badly constructed social communities are a nightmare,'' Shamoon
said. The recording industry will survive, he argues, if it is able
to offer its users new things of value.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of dangers here,'' he said. ``But as a
society, we're very adept at adapting to compensate for these
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, it seems, would not disagree. Citing past innovations
from the photocopier to magnetic tape, he writes on his Web site:
``Artists and publishers all adapted to those new technologies and
learned how to use them and profit from them; they will adapt to
Freenet as well.''

   Bush backs Barnes' education plan
</P>
<P>
   By Alan Judd
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's conversation with teachers at High Point
Elementary, one of Fulton County's most culturally diverse schools,
was going fine. The Republican presidential candidate's questions
and the teachers' answers closely followed the event's theme: the
importance of educating all children, regardless of their
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush asked about Georgia's new education reform plan.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was silence. Then, nervous laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you don't want to tell me,'' Bush said finally, ending
an awkward moment.
</P>
<P>
   High Point's principal, Linda Sumpter, explained that she and
her staff weren't sure yet what to make of Democratic Gov. Roy
Barnes' education plan. The measure mandates smaller class sizes
and increased testing to measure student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sort of sitting on hold,'' Sumpter said, ``waiting,
being diplomatic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I suggest you be diplomatic,'' Bush said, laughing. Increased
accountability, he added, ``shouldn't trouble anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's endorsement of Barnes' education plan was the only
surprise during the Texas governor's tightly scripted campaign
visit to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsburgh earlier Tuesday, Bush received the endorsement of
a former GOP rival, U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona. In Atlanta,
he wanted to mark National Teachers Day by emphasizing his
commitment to public education. To make sure no one missed the
point, Bush's staff covered a wall of the High Point library with a
banner that read, ``No Child Left Behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he came to High Point, off Glenridge Drive in Sandy
Springs, because of its diversity. About 40 percent of its 700
students are Hispanic, and about one-third take classes for
children for whom English is a second language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a school that's not afraid of standards and expectations
and measurement,'' Bush told Sumpter and the eight teachers who
joined him for a 30-minute roundtable discussion. ``The
accountability system you use here shows you are improving.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaching children who live in homes where English isn't spoken
is crucial to ensuring that ``America's promise extends its reach
to every single family in our country,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, he said, he responded to proponents of an English-only
policy with, ``Why don't we have English-plus? We respect other
languages. Plus, we respect somebody else's culture. I think it's
important for our society.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he told parents gathered outside the school _ in Spanish
_ that their children need to learn English.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why they're here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Vice President Al Gore, who is seeking the
Democratic presidential nomination, called reporters in Atlanta to
dispute Bush's commitment to education. ``He can talk the talk,''
said spokesman Todd Webster. ``But if you look at his proposals and
plans, they're much different that the rosy picture he is
painting.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush's visit, High Point's diversity was on abundant
display. A sign in the school lobby welcomed the candidate with,
``Bienvenidos, George Bush.'' And two of the teachers Bush spoke
with were Hispanics who now work with children who, like them, had
to learn English in school.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Bush arrived, just before 4 p.m., most of the
Hispanic students had headed home on school buses. The majority of
the children who greeted his motorcade were white and, judging by
the BMWs and sport utility vehicles their parents parked nearby,
upper middle-class.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were first-grader Emily Nault and third-grader Ryan
Williams. They stood near the school's front door, holding a
hand-lettered poster that said, ``Welcome, Governor Bush'' in red,
white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it's the only time I'm going to see him,'' said
Emily, 7. Asked what she knew about Bush, she answered, ``He's the
governor of Texas. He has a brother that's the governor of
Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   After Ryan whispered to her, she added, ``His father was
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, 9, was more interested in the controlled chaos surrounding
the candidate's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the secret agents,'' he said. ``And the camera
people.''

   Judge blasts Lewis prosecutors
</P>
<P>
   By Bill Torpy
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A judge scolded prosecutors Tuesday after learning
that Atlanta police had destroyed investigative notes in the Ray
Lewis murder case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find troubling the destruction of handwritten notes,'' said
Fulton County Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bonner ruled that police did not exhibit ``bad faith''
in destroying notes of witness interviews and therefore she would
not exclude any prosecution testimony or reports. She did order
prosecutors to make some of their witnesses available to defense
attorneys for them to interview.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony, defense attorneys pointed out that lead
investigator Ken Allen, in some of his notes that survived, had
written partial quotes, such as: ``Ray and Shorty at corner'' and
``pull off victim.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the finished report, Lewis was pulling a participant of
the fight into a limousine. There is nothing mentioned about anyone
being pulled off a victim.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner noted that the ``discrepancy was material and
substantive,'' adding ``If there's a lot more like it, it will
matter to the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonner also chided prosecutors for not telling police to keep
their notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much longer or how often the district
attorney's office can get away with not being specific enough'' and
not telling investigators to turn over their notes, Bonner said.
</P>
<P>
   If a defense team opts into the discovery process, the
prosecutors ``shall produce for the opposing party any statement of
any witness that is in the possession, custody or control of the
state ...,'' according to state statute. The process was
established so a defendant would not be blindsided with new
evidence during trial.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Baker told the judge
``it's regrettable there was a lack of communication'' between
police and prosecutors but noted that a recent Georgia Supreme
Court ruling said officers don't have to maintain notes.
</P>
<P>
   In McGee v. State, the state high court said the landmark
federal Brady v. Maryland ruling ``does not require that agents of
the state retain rough notes made in the course of their
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, defense attorneys are eager to obtain raw notes to
find such discrepancies. Allen said he destroys notes because they
become ``very messy.'' The Lewis case is his second homicide.
</P>
<P>
   The motions hearing is expected to be the last before jurors
come in Friday to answer questionnaires. Jury selection begins
Monday. Lewis and co-defendants Joseph Sweeting and Reginald Oakley
are charged with murder in the Jan. 31 stabbing deaths of two
Decatur men in a Buckhead street fight.

 &HT;    Elian whirlwind about to greet Atlanta police
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The spotlight will be trained on the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals Thursday when three judges hear arguments on
whether 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez will be allowed to apply for
asylum to the U.S. against the wishes of his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the drama will unfold outside the courthouse along
Forsyth Street, where hundreds are expected to protest and
pontificate why the young castaway should or should not be allowed
to remain in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban Americans _ both local and from Miami _ are expected to
flock to the courthouse as early as 8 a.m. Most want Elian to stay
in the United States, with or without his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Other demonstrators _ such as the North Atlanta chapter of the
national group Fathers Are Parents Too _ will conduct a news
conference to talk about fathers' rights. FAPT is in favor of Elian
returning to Cuba with his surviving parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primacy of parental rights should take precedence over
politics,'' said Tony Zizza, vice president of FAPT's North Atlanta
chapter. ``We expect about 100 people to attend Thursday. The main
thing we want to talk about is that fathers should have the same
rights as mothers do when it comes to children.''
</P>
<P>
   Other protests are planned across the country this week.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever views and political leanings rumble outside the
courthouse Thursday, the Atlanta Police Department believes it is
ready. It has even set up separate areas for protesters with
opposing views.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're no strangers to protests,'' said Maj. John Woodard, who
heads the police precinct that covers downtown. ``We'll have
several officers from the precinct, as well as several officers
from the Special Operations Section, out there. There will also be
officers from Special Operations on standby in case things get out
of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of the department's Spanish-speaking officers have
been reassigned to deal with demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrian traffic will be prohibited in the immediate area
surrounding the courthouse. Several streets bordering the building
will be blocked off. The city's motorcycle units will patrol the
area, redirecting traffic, said Woodard and Deputy Chief Wesley
Derrick.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is scheduled to begin about 9 a.m. and is expected
to last less than an hour. About 100 seats are available to the
public on a first-come, first-served basis. Doors open at 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the group espousing the parental rights of fathers
is Chicago-based attorney Jeffery Leving. The lawyer, whose mother
is Cuban, also represents Manuel Gonzalez, one of Elian's great
uncles and the eldest brother of Lazaro Gonzalez, the great uncle
who kept Elian in Miami for five months.
</P>
<P>
   Leving was retained by Manuel Gonzalez after Juan Miguel
Gonzalez wrote a letter to U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno asking
her to give custody of his son to Manuel Gonzalez, who also lives
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole things has divided the Gonzalez family,'' Leving
said. ``This should never have been about politics. It's all about
a father's rights to his child.''

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The congressional Democrats' racketeering lawsuit
against Rep. Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, is wrong,
ethically, legally and politically.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which charges DeLay with extortion, racketeering and
money laundering in his aggressive fund-raising for Republican
candidates, represents everything I hated about the politics of
personal destruction as it was waged against President Clinton.
Those of us who decried the abuse of the legal system for partisan
ends then now have a moral obligation to condemn the legal pursuit
of DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seems to lack merit. G. Robert Blakey, the legal
scholar who assisted in drafting the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act, said that the statute was intended to
police business and criminal behavior, not political fund-raising.
``This is the kind of case that gives RICO a bad name,'' he told
The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   By going after a Republican leader, the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee is doing Republicans an enormous favor: shifting
attention from the GOP's pathetic record on gun control, Social
Security, the patients' bill of rights and other issues that
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, DeLay has met with lobbyists in his Capitol office, where
they were allowed to write their own special interest legislation
themselves (``because,'' he said, ``they have the expertise'').
</P>
<P>
   But while the conduct he is accused of may raise ethical
questions, it isn't criminal. Maybe it should be, but until
Congress toughens campaign finance laws, politicians will seize
every advantage they can. And if there is a question about criminal
conduct, we have a perfectly competent Justice Department to decide
if there's a case to be made.
</P>
<P>
   If I were still running Democratic campaigns, I would
undoubtedly be troubled by reports that DeLay has a scheme to swamp
my candidates with unlimited, undisclosed money, an outrageous new
tactic. But the answer is: Run to the press and call on reporters
to investigate. Run to the voters and tell them about any secret
schemes. But don't run to the courthouse to file a suit that
equates Tom ``the Hammer'' DeLay with Sammy ``the Bull'' Gravano.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee was pursuing its nasty business against DeLay, House
Republicans were busy using hearings to torment current and former
White House aides. The former deputy White House counsel Cheryl
Mills, now a private citizen, spoke for many of us when she
addressed the GOP members harassing her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could spend your time making the lives of the individuals
you serve better,'' she said, ``as opposed to tearing down the
staff of a president with whose vision and policies you disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats sue Republicans. Republicans investigate Democrats. As
I watched the president, the first lady, innumerable staffers and
too many honest cabinet officers bankrupted by right-wing attempts
to carry their partisan warfare into the courtroom and the
committee room, I wondered how the cycle would ever be broken.
Payback is a natural human emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Well, here is how it ends: I'm going to say what too few
Republicans of conscience were willing to say that their party
wrongfully harassed the president and those around him; my party
should drop the suit against DeLay and return to talking about
issues. If we do that, we're more likely to win. And I know we'll
be more deserving of victory.

   BERKELEY, Calif. _ As Microsoft's lawyers present proposals for
far less radical changes than splitting the company in two, it is
tempting to look at Microsoft and see AT&AMP;T. The breakup that
Microsoft is trying to forestall, but that the Justice Department
and 17 states have asked a federal court to order, seems
reminiscent of the antitrust settlement that divided AT&AMP;T into a
long-distance telephone network and a group of local phone
companies. But the appearance is deceiving _ and not just because
the companies themselves are different.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has made a persuasive case for ending
Microsoft's monopoly in computer operating systems, and it made a
compelling one in the 1980s for breaking up the regulated telephone
monopoly. But the government can do this job better: its proposal
for Microsoft does not create the same innovation-stifling
conditions that were imposed on telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T breakup did what was intended: it opened competition in
the telephone business and quickly gave consumers lower
long-distance prices and new services. But it also brought an era
of micromanagement of telecommunications by a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   It is now the computer industry that needs to be invigorated
with competition, and we have already found that merely setting
down rules to restrain Microsoft's conduct is not enough. The
company signed a consent decree in 1994 agreeing to forgo certain
restrictive arrangements with computer equipment makers. But in
practice, these rules did little to change the company's
exclusionary conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's plan for breaking up the company allows
the marketplace, not the courts, to decide where the industry will
go next. The architects of the government's plan have carefully
avoided including the ``line of business'' restrictions that put
boundaries on what services the Baby Bells and AT&AMP;T could offer.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the two new companies created from Microsoft would be
prohibited from offering the identical products sold by the other
company, and they would be barred from recombining through merger.
But nothing in the government proposal prevents either company from
developing a new product that competes with a product offered by
the other. The operating system company could develop a new word
processing or spreadsheet programs. The applications company could
develop a new operating system.
</P>
<P>
   After the AT&AMP;T judgment, Judge Harold Greene arbitrated disputes
for more than a decade on matters like whether the Baby Bells could
provide data, video and voice-mail services. The stream of requests
for waivers of provisions in the judgment clogged his court and
threatened to strangle technological and commercial progress.
Eventually, Congress restructured the industry with the 1996
Telecommunications Act.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows with any certainty what the next big change will be
in the computer industry, or from where it will come. It is
important to allow innovation to flow from any source. Microsoft
argues that the government's proposed remedies to curb its
monopolistic behavior would curb its innovation.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, the breakup it spells out would let the computer
industry itself _ within a new framework of competition _ decide
the future of technological development.

 &HT;    Bush has quite a lot to be relieved about
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He looked like a man with a load off his mind, which he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was great,'' George W. Bush said of his
long-awaited meeting earlier in the day in Pittsburgh with his
chief Republican rival, Sen. John McCain. The Texas governor was
kicking back with some lemonade after an afternoon session with
educators at High Point Elementary School here.
</P>
<P>
   ``John knew, for example, I was interested in reforming Social
Security. He wanted to hear the passion in my voice. He wanted to
know I was as committed to Social Security reform as he is,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has not yet laid out the full details of his Social
Security plan, said ``the initial step for reform'' could be
accomplished in the first years of the next administration. McCain
(R-Ariz.), Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) and others have spoken of
getting a bipartisan commission's report on the president's desk by
2001, and Bush said it would be a priority.
</P>
<P>
   They'd talked about campaign finance reform as well, Bush said,
but while he said McCain ``understands I have a desire to reform
the system,'' Bush's response seemed to suggest the passion
regarding that issue was still in the other voice.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has accused Bush of hiding his plans for
Social Security and challenged him to a debate devoted to the
issue, but Bush insisted he would lay out his plan ``on my terms,
on my timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You notice the last couple of weeks the vice president has
been spending a lot of time talking about me. I'm talking about me.
I kind of like it that way. We've got two of us talking about me,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the meeting to smooth his strained relations with
McCain was something Bush likely was glad to have out of the way,
his greatest relief has to come from the polls, which have him
leading in the Midwestern states considered key to this year's
election and comfortably ahead in the South.
</P>
<P>
   As good as the news has been, these are the slow days before the
conventions. While Gore has taken some shots at Bush, the heavy
artillery hasn't been deployed yet.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was asked his impression of Democratic Rep. Patrick
Kennedy's suit against his fellow Texan, House Majority Whip Tom
Delay, charging that Delay's strong-arm tactics with lobbyists
amounted to extortion. Wasn't it likely Gore's campaign would try
to hang Delay around Bush's neck?
</P>
<P>
   ``Could be. Probably. But I don't think that's going to work. I
think America's going to look for something better than that in the
campaign,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it's like in your state Capitol here, but
they're making some reforms. Barnes is a Democrat, you've got a
bunch of Republicans over there, and I know they're squabbling over
some aspects of the reform package, but they're making progress. We
did the same thing in Texas. ... Washington is full of rancor,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the party switching disputes of the past weeks, some
Republican legislators might not be as upbeat about the spirit of
cooperation under the Gold Dome. But it's interesting that we now
have two presidential candidates citing Georgia as an example of
how to do things right.

 &HT;    No consensus on flag debate
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Columbia, S.C. _ Today on one of South Carolina's newest
holidays, Confederate Memorial Day, the state House continues
wading through 40 more amendments on a bill that would remove the
controversial Confederate battle flag from the dome of the
Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   On its first day of formal flag debate Tuesday, the House found
no consensus as it debated for nearly six hours. It passed just one
amendment _ a proposal similar to a Senate plan that black House
members have said they will not support.
</P>
<P>
   While other state offices will be closed today to observe the
new holiday, the General Assembly and Gov. Jim Hodges plan to work.
The House reconvenes this morning.
</P>
<P>
   The House debate is being watched closely throughout the Deep
South, where the controversy over Confederate symbols is spreading.
Creation of Confederate Memorial Day, in fact, was part of a
compromise last month that also created a holiday honoring slain
civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   As debate on the flag began Tuesday, a handful of flag
supporters gathered outside on the Statehouse lawn and waved their
deep red Rebel flags.
</P>
<P>
   Cool-headed debate on the floor evoked comments on race
relations, the Civil War, honor and the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Becky Meacham-Richardson, a Republican flag supporter
from Fort Mill, proposed a nonbinding statewide vote on the flag.
The House tabled her amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought, really, that we were a government of the
people and by the people and for the people,'' Meacham-Richardson
said from the House well, ``not a government of the NAACP, by the
NAACP and for the NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
launched a tourism boycott of South Carolina Jan. 1
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP lacks support for its boycott, according to a new
Gallup poll. The same survey showed fewer people see the
Confederate flag as a symbol of Southern heritage.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 U.S. adults were questioned and 65 percent
opposed the boycott, 27 percent supported it. According to 59
percent of the respondents, the flag represents Southern pride. In
1992, 69 percent of poll respondents said it was a symbol of Dixie
pride.
</P>
<P>
   The House also tabled a plan supported by the Democratic caucus
to remove the flag and replace it at the Confederate Soldiers
Monument with a bronze likeness of the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, especially black House members, supported that
compromise, pushed by former House speaker Robert Sheheen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lacks a flag ... I think this is an insult,'' said Rep.
Bill Cotty (R-Columbia), a member of the House Judiciary Committee,
which proposed a plan similar to what the Senate approved.
</P>
<P>
   The committee plan, offered by Cotty and the first one
considered, was defeated in a close vote.
</P>
<P>
   If the House agrees to change the bill sent to it, the Senate
could accept it, send it to a conference committee where members
from both chambers would work out differences, or it could amend
the bill again and send it back to the House, which then only would
have the option of approving or rejecting the measure.
</P>
<P>
   If Hodges calls the General Assembly back into special session
because the House can't settle on a plan, Sen. Glenn McConnell _ a
chief architect of the Senate compromise _ said that might be a
waste of time. The chambers could vote to adjourn, then be dragged
back by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect if this debate drags on, the chances of the flag
staying at the dome, because of the lack of common ground, will
probably grow,'' McConnell said. ``I say that because I don't know
of anywhere else we in the Senate really can go now.''
</P>
<P>
   Flag supporters say they'll counter the NAACP boycott with a
boycott of Michelin and other prominent South Carolina-based
companies calling for the flag to come down. Farmers, commuters and
truck drives will be urged to buy tires from other companies, said
Jerry Creech, chairman of the Southern Heritage Coalition. Drivers
will be asked to send their tire bills to Michelin's headquarters
in France and ``tell them to stay out of South Carolina's
business.''

TO CROWD'S DELIGHT, GORE TRIES BORSCHT BELT, WITH A TWANG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Tenn., D.C., S.C., Minn., Mich., Ohio, Ill., Pa., Mo.)   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore goes Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the nation's political attention seemed focused on
Sen. John McCain's endorsement of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for
president, the notably unethnic, Southern Baptist vice president
said the heck with it and tried out a Borscht Belt routine before a
largely Jewish audience here.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose family comes from Tennessee, told the
Anti-Defamation League that a sub-genre of music was proliferating
in Nashville _ the Jewish country-western song.
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 on the hit list, he said, was this: ``I was one of the
chosen people _ until she chose somebody else.'' No. 3: ``The
second time she said `Shalom' I knew she meant goodbye.'' No. 2:
``I've got my foot on the glass, now where are you?''
</P>
<P>
   And No. 1, which the vice president sang with a soft lilt and a
twang: ``Mommas, don't let your ungrateful sons grow up to be
cowboys when they could very easily just have taken over the family
business that my own grandfather broke his back to start and my
father sweated over for years, which apparently doesn't mean
anything now that you're turning your back on such a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience roared and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   But seriously, folks, the vice president really wanted to get in
on the McCain-Bush act.
</P>
<P>
   He has been struggling for weeks against the presidential-level
attention paid to McCain who, despite suspending his presidential
campaign, remains enormously popular and has been absorbing much of
the available political oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore, who has been lagging in the polls behind Bush, is
still overtly courting the independent-minded voters who were
attracted to McCain's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of the Bush-McCain meeting Tuesday, Gore had held a
private visit with McCain in Washington. And today, his little
humor routine aside, he used his speech to about 450 members of the
Anti-Defamation League to try to draw a contrast between McCain and
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming the two Republicans, Gore said it was wrong not
to condemn the Confederate battle flag flying over the South
Carolina statehouse. Bush has said repeatedly that it is up to the
state to decide whether to bring it down. McCain said the same
thing during the Republican primaries, but last month he voiced
regret for not having spoken out against the flag, saying he was
afraid that such a stand could have cost him votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Tuesday of the flag controversy: ``We know it is wrong
not only to support it but to find it impossible to summon the
moral courage to speak out about it. It is wrong to remain silent
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's remarks allowed room for McCain's reversal but not for
Bush's continued refusal to condemn the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech was an official one as vice president, and the
league is a tax-exempt organization that cannot endorse political
candidates. But Gore's speech was certainly a political one,
designed to paint Bush as an extremist and undermine any impression
that McCain's endorsement might make Bush more acceptable to
independents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Independent voters are definitely on Gore's mind. Much of his
campaign since he secured the Democratic nomination has been geared
toward swing voters in battleground states from Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Michigan, Illinois and Missouri. And just as he has been wooing
McCain supporters, he has also been going after the backers of
Jesse Ventura, the independent governor of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, Ventura was at the White House this morning for
a pep rally in support of permanent trade relations with China, and
Gore singled him out for thanks, among others, as did President
Clinton. Gore had also had Ventura and his wife to his home in
Washington last month for a private dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The gateway topic for Gore to cozy up to both McCain and Ventura
has been overhauling the campaign finance system, and campaign
aides said they expected the vice president to explore the topic
publicly with both as the campaign progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Gore's speech to the Anti-Defamation League poked
fun at his own obvious differences with his audience, he still
hoped to convey his commitment to their causes. ``I feel right at
home here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His commitments included support for a national law against hate
crimes. This amounted to another dig at Bush, who critics have said
failed to shepherd through such a law in Texas. In a speech that
extolled the virtues of tolerance, he sprinkled his comments with
references to famous Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freud once spoke about the narcissism of slight difference,
just as Einstein taught that the most destructive power known on
earth is within the smallest state we know _ the inside of the
atom,'' Gore said. ``The smallest differences sometimes unleash the
most horrific violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also won applause when he used the Hebrew phrase, ``Refua
shlayma,'' to wish a complete recovery to Abraham Foxman, the
league's national director, who recently had bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Howard Berkowitz, national chairman of the league, said
that the league had been concerned that both candidates were
injecting too much religion into the campaign. ``We want to make
sure that one candidate doesn't out-religion the other,'' he said,
citing Bush's comment that Jesus was his favorite philosopher.
``These things are better left in private,'' Berkowitz said.

   Gay issues, guns take center stage
</P>
<P>
   By Gayle White
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland _ United Methodists entering the convention center
here today are braced for a gay rights demonstration that is
drawing activists from across the country, including Yolanda King,
daughter of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the quadrennial General Conference of the United
Methodist Church are expected to vote Thursday on whether to keep
the church's prohibition against performing same-sex blessing
ceremonies and ordaining sexually active homosexuals to the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates spent part of Tuesday morning debating another
emotionally charged issue, gun control. After a discussion of
whether to include handguns, they voted by a 3-1 ratio for a
resolution calling on the U.S. government and other governments
where United Methodists are a presence to outlaw ``ownership by the
general public of handguns, assault weapons, automatic weapon
conversion kits and weapons that cannot be detected by
traditionally used metal detection devices.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, North Georgia delegates huddled around
their bishop, Lindsey Davis, for a pep talk and strategy session on
what to expect today as Soulforce, a gay rights coalition, stages a
vigil outside the meeting hall. ``I would encourage you to not be
nervous about it,'' Davis said. ``Stay calm and loving and
gracious, just as you always are.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishop told the delegates that the presence of security
guards and Cleveland police, already increasingly visible, will
probably be even greater today.
</P>
<P>
   North Georgia's 26 delegates favor keeping the bans on same-sex
ceremonies and gay ordination, said Tom Jackson, a lay delegate
from Athens. ``It was a litmus test for being elected to the
conference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The General Conference legislative committee responsible for
handling gay and lesbian issues has recommended maintaining the
status quo in the denomination's Book of Discipline, with the
addition of an admonition not to ``reject or condemn'' homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a more conservative General Conference,'' said
the Rev. Martha Forrest, district superintendent of the
Atlanta-College Park district and a candidate for bishop later this
summer. ``I feel fairly confident that the Discipline will remain
the same on same-sex unions and ordination.''
</P>
<P>
   While the North Georgia delegates discussed their response, at a
hotel several blocks from the convention center Tuesday afternoon
several dozen people attended a workshop sponsored by Soulforce.
Demonstrators are planning to block the taxi ramp to the convention
center today, and its leaders have negotiated terms of possible
arrest and punishment with Cleveland police.
</P>
<P>
   Arun Gandhi, grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, who is participaing in
the demostration said he believes he is doing what his grandfather
would have done _ but said, ``It will take many such instances to
bring about change.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Marlan of San Jose, Calif., co-chair of the Soulforce
event, admitted in an interview Tuesday that the group has little
hope of persuading delegates to change the denomination's position
on sexuality issues this week..
</P>
<P>
   ``We see our role as being able to bring public attention to
what's going on,'' he said. ``Delegates have their minds made up in
a lot of ways. We know that. In a way, what we're trying to do is
plant seed for 2004. We will be back.''

<P>
   ASMARA, Eritrea _ A United Nations Security Council delegation
visiting Africa has abruptly shifted its attention from the crisis
in Congo to the Ethiopian-Eritrean border, where hundreds of
thousands of troops on both sides are preparing for imminent war,
Western intelligence reports say.
</P>
<P>
   With the crisis in Sierra Leone hovering over both regional
problems, the Security Council decided in the past 24 hours to
intervene in the Horn of Africa conflict, hoping to prevent an
outbreak of fighting along the border. As the three crises have
come together in the past week, the Security Council's unusual
field trip to Africa has become more eventful, complicated and
immediately purposeful than any members had imagined, officials
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the trip was planned,'' said Richard C. Holbrooke, U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations and the leader of the council
delegation, ``Congo was the No. 1 crisis in Africa. By the time we
got here, it had dropped to No. 3.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuttling back and forth Tuesday between Ethiopia's capital,
Addis Ababa, and the Eritrean capital, Asmara, the council members
were urging Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia and President
Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea to consider seriously the consequences of
reigniting what one diplomat called ``the stupidest war in
Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks began on Monday night and are expected to continue through
Wednesday. Because of the high tension between the two countries,
the council's chartered Boeing 737 cannot fly directly between
Addis Ababa and Asmara, but has to detour over Djibouti and the Red
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, Ethiopia and Eritrea have battled sporadically over
inland border territory at a cost of tens of thousands of lives.
With a peace agreement brokered by the Organization of African
Unity almost within reach, negotiations broke down last week in
Algiers. After reports that more troops, equipment and medical
supplies were being moved to the border, the British and French
ambassadors on the Security Council delegation proposed visiting
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of us succeeding are very small,'' Holbrooke said.
``Our sole objective is to get the OAU talks restarted. The U.N. is
not going to replace the OAU in the Horn. But maybe the Security
Council's support will encourage the two parties to talk instead of
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unacceptable that two of the poorest countries on earth
_ one with 16 million people facing famine _ should bring their
troops to the border to prepare for war. It's senseless. Completely
senseless. The last war resulted in 50,000 deaths, and this could
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said after Wednesday's talks, ``I was sitting there
listening to these two highly articulate, intelligent men on the
edge of a war over trivial differences in the midst of a famine''
in Ethiopia, ``and I thought: This is one of the saddest things I
ever saw in international affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the problem between Ethiopia and Eritrea _ led by
two men who were once allies, until Eritrea effectively won
independence from Ethiopia _ has been the last of three pacts that
together form a peace package. It covers the technicalities of
pulling back troops and restoring property along the disputed
border.
</P>
<P>
   The French ambassador, Jean-David Levitte, said in an interview
Wednesday that remaining problems could be solved by arbitration.
He said he emerged from a session with Meles of Ethiopia taken
aback by the casual way in which these countries seem to be gearing
up for war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to Meles, `When you start a war you think you will
achieve results fast,''' Levitte said. ``But that could be a
miscalculation. That's exactly what happened when the war started
in 1914 in Europe. On both sides, the French and the Germans and
their allies, were convinced that after a few weeks, there would be
a victory _ and a victory on their side.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, I said, `When you start a war you never know,''' Levitte
added. ``The result of this miscalculation in Europe was, four
years later, millions of dead people and an end to a possible
positive role for both countries for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at reports on preparations for war on the border,
Levitte said that he is reminded frequently of World War I, and he
said that he pointed that out to Meles. ``You have, face to face,
two armies entrenched,'' he said, ``and it will be very, very
bloody, because first will come the planes and the guns, then
infantry from Ethiopia will fight to get more land and thousands of
young Ethiopians will be killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer of Meles was absolutely incredible,'' Levitte said.
``He said: `No, there is a difference. We poor countries cannot
afford long wars. We have not enough money to buy arms in
quantities to maintain the war effort for a long period.' He
implied that having made the effort to equip an army, he wanted a
fast return on the investment.''

 &HT;    Johnson's harnessing huge talent in 7-0 start
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phoenix, Ariz _Randy Johnson regrets a lot of it now. The years
he led the league in walks. The aimless rages. The senseless nights
when he kept throwing as hard as he could until his arm went as
limp as his Spinal Tap 'do. He went nearly half his career, he
admits now, without knowing how to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   It seems impossible to believe now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, every athlete wants to be successful. To what
extent? Some more than others,'' Johnson said. ``Once again, that
word complacency comes in there. I'm really never satisfied with
anything that I do. I took some lumps when I was younger and have
kind of come into my own.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm feeling I'm right where I want to be right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell the National League about it. Where he is, is 7-0 with an
absurdly low 0.93 ERA, facing Los Angeles and ace Kevin Brown
tonight, trying to extend the game's finest spring campaign since
Pedro Martinez, then in Montreal, won his first seven starts in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers will find what baseball has seen over the season's
first five weeks. The Big Unit, now 36, not only is the most
dominating pitcher over the last half-decade; he somehow is still
traveling an upward gradient.
</P>
<P>
   If he did not comprehend the pitcher's art until he reached 30,
then this is his payback. And the payback, as former teammate Bret
Boone said, is ``a freaking titanic struggle, like it always is.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson emerged from April with the best showing in baseball
history. He is the third pitcher to win six times during the month.
Vida Blue did it in Oakland in 1971, and Dave Stewart did it in
Toronto in 1988. Neither came close to Johnson's minute ERA, made
up of six earned runs in his first 58 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire guys like Randy and Roger Clemens because they
dominate,'' Blue said. ``I'll take the power pitchers. I know there
are guys like Greg Maddux, but I like the guy who blows you away.''
</P>
<P>
   That scouting report is dying a long death. Johnson continues to
run up double-digit strikeout counts _ 131 times, second only to
Nolan Ryan's remarkable 215 _ but the Unit's reputation for
traditional pitching has expanded. Working a two-seam fastball into
his repertoire over the past two years, Johnson still can reach 100
mph with his four-seamer and then throw a 93-mph two-seamer that
sinks. He finishes the show with his unworldly slider; it is a
slicing wonder, which on April 20 struck out Colorado's Brian
Hunter swinging as the ball bounced under his back foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person seeing it on TV can't really get the picture,'' said
Diamondbacks catcher Damian Miller, who usually handles Johnson's
starts. ``You can't explain how absolutely nasty it is. It's
ridiculous. When he's pounding that 98-mile-per-hour fastball in
and then he throws that slider, it's stupid is what it is. It's
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   So are Johnson's numbers. He leads the majors in wins, ERA,
innings, complete games (4), shutouts (2), strikeouts (76) and
lowest batting average allowed (.156). All of that follows the 1999
Cy Young season, in which he set personal bests for complete games
(12) and innings (271 2/3) while leading both leagues with his
career-high 365 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   With his second Cy Young, he joined Pedro Martinez and Gaylord
Perry as the only men to win the award in both leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can sit here all day and I can rattle off all kinds of
little things that made me a better pitcher today than five or six
years ago,'' Johnson said. ``Just going through failure and
learning how to deal with it from a maturity standpoint, and then
also from a personal standpoint, in not trying to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I failed a lot in this game. Heck, in Seattle in '92,
I lost eight straight games. And I think that was my first step in
analyzing my mechanics and wind-up, learning a little more about
pitching. Then I met Nolan Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he credits a 1993 meeting with Ryan and subsequent
lessons on the wind-up from coach Tom House, Johnson remains
essentially self-taught. He learned to throw his insidious slider
on his own, as he did the new two-seamer. Nothing really is
responsible for his evolution as a complete pitcher but his own
will. He can't even talk like a power pitcher anymore
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't work on trying to strike people out. I'm just kind of
letting them,'' he said. ``I'm more concerned with going out there
and throwing as few pitches as possible, not only in the game but
in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me a great deal of pride to be able to get a
double-play ball instead of striking three guys out. Not only is it
easier on my arm, but the team isn't out there as long, either.''
</P>
<P>
   He has done far more for the Diamondbacks than give them a
pretty good chance every five days. Johnson rode lead on a flock of
acquisitions during the winter of 1998-99, as free-agent outfielder
Steve Finley and right-handed starter Todd Stottlemyre linked up
with two trade additions, outfielders Luis Gonzalez and Tony
Womack, since converted to shortstop. Third baseman Matt Williams
and second baseman Jay Bell already were here.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent 100-win season in 1999 and the fastest division
championship by an expansion franchise hardly are random events.
The D-backs opened play Tuesday with the best record (22-10) in the
NL. Johnson's late-career improvement is emblematic of an
experienced roster that is thriving with players in the latter
stages of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``From center field, it's awesome,'' Finley said of watching
Johnson pitch. ``The guy hardly ever misses the mitt. You don't
think of control with a guy 6-10, plus going 98, 100 miles per
hour. And then, every once in a while, that pitch gets away, which
always plants in a hitter's mind that when you're that big, you're
not going to throw every pitch right where you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   That unspoken menace transcends the mere heater at the neck. It
reaches into the opposing dugout, where a manager is forced to play
with one hand tied behind his back. Johnson has allowed lefties a
.182 average over his career, and many accomplished hitters _ Larry
Walker, the retired John Kruk _ would just rather not face him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're able to negate two or three quality left-handed bats
on a bench, that's a big advantage for us,'' Arizona manager Buck
Showalter said. ``We've had a few times, where Randy needs relief,
we'll bring a left-hander in behind him because you don't want all
those left-handers (on the other bench) coming in late in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   His routine tonight will be unchanged: two hours of clubhouse
quiet with some music lulling Johnson almost into a trance. Nobody
talks with him but, as he says, laughing, ``Nobody talks to me
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People always ask me if it's hard to catch him,'' Miller said.
``Well, when you first start, it's a little different, but once you
get a handle on the physical side of it, going out every fifth day
with him is more mentally challenging for a catcher, just to keep
him calmed down. He gets caught up in the emotion a lot and can be
very intense out there. I've learn the last two years that that's
my biggest job.''
</P>
<P>
   Controlled rage has helped deliver Johnson from a 49-48 pitcher
over his first five seasons to a 118-40 one since 1992. Back
surgery in 1996 not only extended his career but improved it, as
Johnson has given more effort to physical conditioning since then.
</P>
<P>
   Quick starts guarantee little. Martinez went 10-8 after winning
his first seven starts in 1997 but still won his first Cy Young.
McDonald went 7-7 in 1994 after his 7-0 start, finished 23-23 in
three subsequent seasons and, beset by a series of shoulder
problems, hasn't appeared in the majors since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is a different species. He has surpassed Sandy Koufax's
career win total, by two, as well as his strikeout total, by 372,
in 16 fewer innings. He also never has pitched better than right
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been up to me to go out and take it a step further and be
consistent with it and become more of a pitcher,'' Johnson said.
``I'm enjoying where I am now, believe it or not. A lot of people
think it doesn't appear that I'm enjoying this. But deep down, I
am.''

 &HT;    Road trip starts badly for Rocker
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ They nibbled on his ears for most of nine innings Monday
night. But the crowd at Pro Player Stadium toasted John Rocker when
it was over.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 14,024 were hoping for Rocker, the Braves closer, to
mess up when he came in to face the Marlins in the bottom of the
ninth. He obliged, balking in Florida's winning run in a 3-2
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd erupted. With glee.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's journey into South Florida's diverse landscape _ the
first of what may be a tumultuous seven-game road trip _ opened
with lots of security watching the area around the Braves' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Rocker signs carried in by fans (``RocKKKer,'' read one)
were confiscated while the teams were warming up.
</P>
<P>
   Six uniformed security staffers surrounded the Braves' bullpen
on the field and in the stands. Miami-Dade cops had a heavy
presence. There was also a large security force in plainclothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, because there is a potential for any possible
protest or actions by Mr. Rocker or anybody else,'' said M. Bruce
Schulze, stadium director.
</P>
<P>
   This was the start of what could be a volatile road trip for
Rocker, whose comments in Sports Illustrated offended many racial
and ethnic groups. South Florida's diversity was apparent Monday
night by the number of Venezuelan flags being waved whenever Braves
first baseman Andres Galarraga came to bat.
</P>
<P>
   But the evening was a success for all concerned. No one was
arrested, nothing was thrown on the field and no one mooned Rocker
like one citizen did in Los Angeles last week.
</P>
<P>
   There was a mixture of Braves and Marlins fans near the bullpen,
who debated with one another while the insults were flying in
Rocker's direction. His only reaction to the fans was to reach up
and autograph hats for a number of spectators.
</P>
<P>
   When Rocker began warming up as the Braves were batting in the
ninth, John Kloss and Chuck Snapp, both of Hollywood, Fla., tried
to get a chant going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Redneck,'' they yelled when Rocker threw a warmup pitch.
``Racist,'' they yelled again. ``I went back and read that magazine
article last night and it made me angry all over again,'' said
Kloss, a computer programmer. ``The things he said were totally
ignorant. And his attitude since he came back has been atrocious.''

MARKETPLACE: AT&AMP;T WIRELESS HOLDS THE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN with SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors who missed out on the biggest-ever U.S.
initial stock offering last month need not worry or hurry. Shares
of AT&AMP;T Wireless Group are back down to their offering price and,
judging by Tuesday's trading pattern, they may not be heading back
up again any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the shares _ which track the performance of AT&AMP;T's
wireless telecommunications business _ closed at $29.50, unchanged
from Monday. Since dipping below it briefly on Monday, the shares
have rarely strayed from their offering price.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly flat line on the wireless unit's stock chart resulted
from a strong show of support from the investment banks that
underwrote the $10.6 billion offering. In general, it is considered
bad form on Wall Street to allow a client's first-time stock
offering to quickly fall below its initial price without putting up
a fight.
</P>
<P>
   But traders said it was not clear how much longer the price of
AT&AMP;T Wireless would hold steady because there are no concrete rules
on how far the underwriters must go in providing support against
selling pressure. In after-hours trading, the stock slipped to $29.
</P>
<P>
   Traders at a few big investment banks said that Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co., one of three lead underwriters, was buying a lot of stock back
at the offering price Tuesday on behalf of the syndicate of
underwriters, which included almost every major investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   More than 12 million shares of AT&AMP;T Wireless changed hands
Tuesday for a total of about $360 million. Goldman Sachs officials
declined to say how much of that buying the firm did or to discuss
why the firm was buying back the stock.
</P>
<P>
   But traders and investment bankers at other firms said that
Goldman clearly felt obligated to prop up the stock because it was
such a lucrative, high-profile deal and because AT&AMP;T wields such
clout on Wall Street. A lesser deal that had performed early on as
AT&AMP;T Wireless did probably would not have received as much support,
they said. The wireless stock rose as high as $36, a gain of more
than 20 percent, in its first few days of trading before it began
to sink.
</P>
<P>
   Most prospectuses explain that the underwriters may purchase
shares in the open market to stabilize the stock price ``above
independent market levels.'' Underwriters also establish what they
call ``penalty bids,'' parameters set to discourage individual
investors from reselling, or ``flipping'' shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a fair amount of syndicate stabilization,'' said a
telecommunications stock trader at one Wall Street firm who, like
several of his peers, asked not to be identified. He said that
there are no concrete rules on what banks must do to stabilize a
new issue but that syndicates usually disband once a new stock
appears stable at a particular price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if they stop supporting it, it goes to $25, right?''
said the manager of a large mutual fund that owns shares of AT&AMP;T
wireless, on condition of anonymity. ``So maybe it goes to $27. I
think it was just priced high to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a dollar to put into wireless, I'd buy Nextel, or
Voicestream or PCS,'' the manager added, referring to the stock
symbol for the shares meant to track Sprint Corp.'s wireless unit.
``But I think over the next six months, the AT&AMP;T shares can support
this level. The stock's not a short and the company has a good
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Liu, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, said that some
institutional investors were turning their attention to other
wireless investments, like Sprint PCS, which recently announced
surprisingly strong subscriber growth.
</P>
<P>
   Before the AT&AMP;T Wireless offering, Liu said, ``The underwriters
were telling investors that this is a name you have to own. Now,
clients are asking, `Why do I have to own this name?'''
</P>
<P>
   Liu, one of the few Wall Street analysts who has not been
recommending the new AT&AMP;T stock, said investors also were concerned
about the lukewarm endorsements it received from analysts at some
investment banks that were involved in the underwriting.
</P>
<P>
   An executive close to AT&AMP;T said the company was not buying the
wireless shares on its own. AT&AMP;T's treasury department, however,
has traded the company's shares on the open market before,
according to people close to the company. While companies generally
disclose large plans to repurchase their own shares, a person close
to AT&AMP;T said Tuesday that the company would not have to make an
immediate public announcement were it to join the effort to support
the wireless shares.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the prospectus for the wireless offering refers
obliquely to the potential for ``repurchases by AT&AMP;T of shares of
AT&AMP;T Wireless Group tracking stock for the account of the AT&AMP;T
Wireless Group.''
</P>
<P>
   An AT&AMP;T spokeswoman declined to comment.

GALAXY TIRED OF CONTROVERSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sigi Schmid is tired of talking about it. The Galaxy players are
tired of talking about it. It's just a waiting game now.
</P>
<P>
   Is Mexican striker Luis Hernandez coming? Is any Mexican player
coming?
</P>
<P>
   The Hernandez rumors started during pre-season. It seemed like a
wonderful idea at the time. Former Galaxy striker Carlos Hermosillo
returned to Mexico, leaving a vacant foreign allocation spot on the
Galaxy's roster. It was perfect, making even more sense because
Hernandez wants to come to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a potent front line Cobi Jones, Clint Mathis and
Hernandez together. It's scary on paper, probably scarier in
person.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out it's so frightening that Major League Soccer
probably will never let it happen.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the robbery takes place, this is why the long
delay.
</P>
<P>
   MLS insists that San Jose and New England each are due foreign
allocated players before the Galaxy even though the only foreign
allocated player on the Galaxy's roster is Mauricio Cienfuegos, who
was allocated in 1996, MLS' inaugural season.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that MLS wants to sign and assign Hernandez to Los
Angeles, San Jose and New England can wait. It's like holding the
top two choices in a draft. If the Galaxy wants Hernandez, they
have to give away something to get the next allocation. And if they
don't want that allocation now, too bad, they may have to take it.
</P>
<P>
   In talking to team officials, it appears MLS is asking for far
too much from the Galaxy. As many as three starters have been
mentioned, including Roy Myers, Clint Mathis, Joey Franchino and
Greg Vanney. With the Hernandez signing looming, MLS is asking the
Galaxy to make a few players available for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid, coach and president of soccer operations, is too smart
to give up that much for a player who will only be here a third of
the time, especially if it's Hernandez, a standout who could miss
plenty of action on Mexico's World Cup qualifying team.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy (5-0-3) is unbeaten, one of MLS' top teams, so why
make any drastic moves for a part-time player, even if he's as good
and as coveted as Hernandez?
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the MLS says so. That's what this may come down to.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, after Schmid finally says to leave his team
alone, that it is fine the way it is, MLS can step in and force his
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN Magazine writer Jeff Bradley, calling the Galaxy mess the
``Dispersal Draft,'' said it best last week: ``MLS' Mission Control
is saying `we're not going to let the coaches and GM's cost us the
chance to get a gate attraction like Hernandez. We're not just
going to allow undefeated Los Angeles to load up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   MLS has stepped in before.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami last season, coach Ivo Wortman benched Carlos
Valderrama. With Valderrama unhappy, MLS told Wortman to make a
trade. Wortman didn't like what other teams were offering, so he
held out. MLS grew impatient and re-assigned Valderrama to Tampa
Bay, essentially stealing him from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   This will probably happen to the Galaxy. At some point, when MLS
is ready to sign a Mexican player and assign him to L.A. to
increase a fan base that is already tops in the MLS, it will come
at a huge cost. It will be a theft.
</P>
<P>
   To get Hernandez, the MLS will make the Galaxy spread the wealth
it has worked for since 1996. This Galaxy team was built on great
draft choices players like Vanney, Franchino, Mathis, Sasha
Victorine and Kevin Hartman and trades that brought Danny Pena and
Myers to L.A. But that means nothing to MLS.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid can't even protect them. That's what's wacky about this
league. How can you build a team for the future when someone else
can tear it down?
</P>
<P>
   The single-entity concept was created so that owners would
invest in the league, control player contracts, but allow
individual teams to operate autonomously within their markets. When
did that change? And when did the MLS become every team's general
manager? This is why Galaxy players are upset. This is why Galaxy
defender Danny Pena said last week he has no respect for the MLS'
front office.
</P>
<P>
   No one argues that Hernandez will be a great fit in L.A., but
it's too bad he may come with controversy, because some of the
luster will be lost.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LIBBY, Mont. _ When W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. sold them the 21-acre site
along the Kootenai River seven years ago, Mel and Lerah Parker were
ecstatic. They finally had a tract large enough to build new
quarters for their thriving nursery business and a new home.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the business is closed, and bulldozers will soon raze
everything on the land, forcing the Parkers to find a new place to
live and work. In recent months, tests have revealed that their
property is contaminated by a toxic form of asbestos called
tremolite _ the result of years in which Grace used the site as a
transport center for the vermiculite ore the company mined nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Tremolite, a microscopic fiber known to cause lung disease and
several forms of cancer, occurs naturally in vermiculite, which is
used in insulation and dozens of other products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Katie, my 7-year-old granddaughter, is asking me if I'm going
to die,'' Mrs. Parker said, sobbing. ``Why should children that age
be thinking about things like that?''
</P>
<P>
   While the Parkers knew of lawsuits against the company linking
the mining operations to illness, Mrs. Parker said no one from
Grace ever told them that ore dust _ all over the property when
they bought it _ posed any lingering health threat from asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Parkers are among a growing list of residents
in the Libby area now reeling from the medical, psychological and
financial consequences of the 67-year-old mining operation, which
once provided desperately needed high-paying jobs here in the vast
stretches of northwest Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Though Grace shut it down in 1990, the mine is being blamed for
scores of cases of respiratory illness and death from exposure to
the tremolite. The problems in Libby, a town of 2,700, represent
the ``most significant single source of asbestos exposure'' in the
nation's history, said Paul Peronard, a coordinator for the
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The area contaminated by the mining operation is now the EPA's
first priority for cleanup, a process likely to take six months and
cost $3 million, Peronard said. Still in dispute is who will pay
for the cleanup, but the agency said it would move ahead while
negotiating with Grace.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 15 years, scores of local residents, armed with
medical opinions linking their relatives' deaths to asbestos
exposure from mining, have filed lawsuits against Grace, charging
negligence and deceit.
</P>
<P>
   Without acknowledging any deliberate wrongdoing, Grace has
settled dozens of cases out of court, largely to avoid expensive
litigation, company lawyers said; other cases are still pending.
Meanwhile, the company has also offered medical coverage for people
who were exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from exacting a human toll, the mining operation has
raised questions for people here concerning how much Grace knew
about the dangers of asbestos and whether state supervision was too
lax.
</P>
<P>
   The story has also caused deep divisions in Libby. Some
residents welcome recent publicity about the environmental woes and
governmental attention to them, but others fear they are the new
millennium's version of the 1970s environmental disaster in the
Love Canal neighborhood of Niagara Falls, N.Y. The story here, they
say, might do irreversible damage to a town struggling to share in
the nation's economic good times.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While acknowledging the problem, Grace executives said that
little was known at the time about the effects of asbestos, and
that as knowledge grew they did their best to comply with the
safety standards of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question in my mind that if the company knew how
to do it, if anybody knew how to do it, it was done,'' said Harry
Eschenbach, the company's director of health and safety for 20
years, through 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Eschenbach insisted that Grace violated no laws, provided annual
chest X-rays and updated technologies in Libby. ``Sure, the state
would come in and tell us to do more,'' he said. ``But do what? The
technology wasn't always there. If it was, we'd have used it. We
were desperate to try to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Eschenbach also dismissed the notion that Grace hid anything
from its workers, saying: ``They have a right to know the hazards
to which they are exposed. I always told them, one on one and in
groups of one on two or three.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the rising incidence of illness and the
ensuing legal battles have played out in relative obscurity. Then,
in November, articles by The Daily Inter Lake in Kalispell and The
Seattle Post-Intelligencer brought new focus to the mining
operations and caught the attention of the EPA. Tests of air and
soil since then found several areas still contaminated by asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the review and lawsuits, a fuller picture of the
operation and its effect on Libby has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as the mine operated _ 40 years under the
now-defunct Zonolite Co., the last 27 under Grace _ workers, as
well as company and state officials, recognized illness as an
occupational risk. Nor did anyone especially fear any deadly impact
of asbestos in the early days.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the residue containing asbestos was so abundant and
powdery that Libby children were invited to play in it. Many did.
Other people bagged the material and took it home to use as
insulation, garden mulch and cat litter.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Runyan, 73, a former office secretary for Grace, said she
used the dust as filler in recipes for muffins and bread and ate
it. ``At the time, nobody made the connection to any problems,''
said Runyan, who said she suffered no ill effects from the
asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   But as the years wore on, the mine workers were treated for
various respiratory illnesses, and deaths from such illnesses
slowly rose. By the early 1980s, doctors were seeing the same
illnesses in the workers' wives and children, making it apparent
that asbestos-related problems were greater than anyone realized.
Family members, it turned out, had been exposed when the miners
returned home from work, still wearing their dust-covered clothes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 deaths were attributed to asbestos exposure by
lawsuits and newspaper studies of medical records and death
certificates. No one has disputed the figures. And there could be
more to come. Medical research shows that asbestos-caused diseases
like asbestosis, a fatal scarring of the lungs, can take 30 years
or more to develop.
</P>
<P>
   As the pattern became clear, the first of scores of lawsuits was
filed in the mid-1980s, asserting that company officials
consistently ignored warnings by state agencies to clean up the
mining operations. By Grace's own count, the company is now a
defendant in 121 negligence cases from people exposed in Libby. In
72 previous cases, Grace paid out $15.6 million through 60
settlements and 4 jury verdicts against the company. Eight other
lawsuits against the company were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   For Grace, a giant chemical and packaging company based in
Columbia, Md., this is another unwanted environmental fight. The
company was the focus of the book and film ``A Civil Action,''
about lawsuits by eight Massachusetts families accusing it of
dumping chemicals that leaked into wells and caused leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Grace is a defendant in asbestos-related lawsuits from
105,000 plaintiffs around the country, including those in Libby.
But company officials contend that Grace did nothing wrong in
Libby.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Hughes, a lawyer for Grace, said he believed that many of
the lawsuits had been filed at the urging of personal injury
lawyers who earn a hefty percentage of any settlement and that
Grace offered to settle cases to avoid ``the risks of a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lawsuits, however, include as evidence extensive material _
much of it from Grace's own files _ that shows state and federal
agencies warned the company often, and as early as the 1960s, that
conditions at the Libby mine, the transport center and Grace's
processing plant posed health hazards.
</P>
<P>
   More than 15 years ago, one local doctor, Richard Irons, was so
alarmed by the growing number of nonoccupational cases of
asbestosis that he traveled to a Grace division in Cambridge,
Mass., to request money for additional pulmonary equipment to study
the impact of the disease on people in Libby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was told to leave it alone,'' said Dr. Brad Black, who was
Irons' partner at the time. ``They just dismissed him and did
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Eschenbach, who met with Irons, said Grace had already
undertaken the study he was suggesting.
</P>
<P>
   Grace recently pledged $250,000 a year ``for the foreseeable
future'' for a screening program in Libby and proposed a long-term
health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   But local health officials, residents and their lawyers have
criticized both as inadequate, especially the health care plan,
which many contend enables people to qualify only after they have
grown seriously ill or close to death. Black claimed that its
eligibility requirements would exclude 85 percent of people who are
currently affected.
</P>
<P>
   Black, who is trying to help establish a trust fund in Libby for
asbestos victims, said of Grace's proposed plans: ``I was waiting
to see if they would do the right thing. Obviously, they haven't
changed their approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor have state and federal agencies been especially helpful to
Libby, according to the lawsuits. In response to a 1983 inquiry
about Libby from Rep. James Courter, R-N.J., an EPA acting
assistant administrator, Don R. Clay, said tests of the Libby mine
found only minor problems with asbestos and that the vermiculite
industry had improved worker safety.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Clay wrote, the agency would turn its efforts
against asbestos elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana, a two-term Republican who grew up
in Libby, said the apparent lack of oversight by governmental
agencies over the years mirrored times when the country knew little
of the hazards of asbestos and when sons of the Depression who were
happy to have good-paying jobs rarely complained about the
inconveniences of any respiratory ailments.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Racicot said, state inspections in Montana
included confidentiality agreements that no information could be
made public.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, by the 1980s, a new era had arrived in Washington
_ a pro-business, anti-regulatory attitude championed by the Reagan
administration that believed government should get out of people's
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of these people, working was more important than
safety,'' said Racicot, who recalled playing in piles of asbestos
dust as a child and ice-fishing off the bank of what is now the
Parkers' property. ``And in all the conversations I had with family
and friends in Libby I've known for years, I never heard one
complaint about asbestos.''
</P>
<P>
   That all changed in November. The EPA announced a plan to test
air and soil samples well into this year and found, initially, two
``hot spots'' _ the Parkers' property and the area around what was
then the ore processing plant near downtown. The agency has
promised to clean up those sites first, but it is also conducting
tests in other states where Grace shipped its vermiculite over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   The growing realization about the damage left by the mines has
stirred anger and resentment toward Grace among many local
residents. But it has also inspired sympathy for the company from
residents who recall how it once made the town thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Some also complain that news coverage of the problem has scared
off companies that might have had an interest in relocating here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've literally had people on the phone say to me that their
doctors have told them it would be suicidal to move here,'' said
Russell S. Barnes, president of the Lincoln County Economic
Development Council, who contends that some coverage has been
irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   Peronard, the EPA official, said that the area is generally safe
and predicted that by the end of the year, all remaining problem
areas would be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   But legal fights will not go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's depressing,'' said Roger Sullivan, a lawyer who has
handled 150 of the Libby suits, ``because none of these stories
really has a happy ending.''

FORMER LOUISIANA GOVERNOR CONVICTED OF RACKETEERING AND
CONSPIRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Calif.)   By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After a picaresque career lived at the edge of the
law, Edwin W. Edwards, the former governor of Louisiana, was
convicted Tuesday of racketeering, conspiracy and extortion charges
related to the awarding of state riverboat casino licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, 72, who served four terms in office and survived two
previous criminal trials without being convicted, was found guilty
by a federal court jury of 17 of the 26 counts against him,
including the most serious racketeering and conspiracy charges.
</P>
<P>
   His son Stephen also was convicted of multiple counts, as were
three other co-conspirators who were charged with being middlemen
between the Edwardses and several businessmen seeking casino
licenses. Two defendants _ a prominent state senator and a member
of the state's gaming board _ were acquitted of the relatively
minor charges against them.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who is rarely at a loss for words, was prohibited by a
judge's gag order from discussing the verdicts in detail on
Tuesday. But in brief comments to reporters outside the courthouse
in Baton Rouge, he thanked family members who supported him during
the trial, which lasted more than four -months, and he vowed to
appeal. A high-stakes gambler known for hosting $10,000-ante poker
games in the Governor's Mansion, Edwards then acknowledged that his
luck might finally have run dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese have a saying that if you sit by the river long
enough the dead body of your enemy will come floating down the
river,'' he said, his voice calm and measured. ``I suppose the feds
sat by the river long enough, and here comes my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a Democrat, could be sentenced to more than 200 years
in prison and fined millions of dollars. A forfeiture hearing to be
held on Wednesday could cost Edwards a substantial amount of cash
and property as well.
</P>
<P>
   After being indicted in November 1998, Edwards joked that if he
was sentenced to the maximum possible term he did not expect to
serve it all. Tuesday, he was less cavalier as he faced the
prospect of what he called ``a very large, long prison term.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that it has ended this way,'' Edwards said, shaded by
a canopy of oaks, ``but there is the system. I've lived 72 years of
my life within the system. I will spend the rest of my life within
the system. Whatever consequences flow from this I'm prepared to
face.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I will try to maintain the same demeanor of
confidence and support that I've had in the past three years as all
of this began to unfold. And in due course, whatever comes,
comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who was the only defendant to testify during the trial,
showed little emotion as he listened to the verdicts. His wife,
Candy, 35, who kept a front-row seat through the trial, broke down
in tears as the first guilty verdict was read.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors, who succeeded where their predecessors had
not, suppressed their glee in public. Most walked sternly from the
courthouse without speaking to reporters. But some allowed
themselves a wee smile. ``Look at my face,'' said Eddie J. Jordan
Jr., the U.S. attorney in New Orleans, who oversaw the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards still faces a trial in June on federal fraud charges
that he helped a failed insurance company evade millions of dollars
in state payments.
</P>
<P>
   The jury received the casino case on April 24 after a long and
captivating trial highlighted by the playing of wiretap-generated
audiotapes and the testimony of former Edwards friends who turned
state's evidence against him.
</P>
<P>
   Among the star witnesses was Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., the former
owner of the San Francisco 49ers, who secured a plea bargain by
agreeing to testify that he paid Edwards $400,000 in exchange for
his help in winning a casino license for a DeBartolo partnership.
DeBartolo was forced to turn over control of the football team to
his sister because of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors outlined a series of five distinct schemes in
which Edwards and his son demanded substantial payments _ nearly $3
million in all _ in exchange for his assistance in procuring the
coveted casino licenses. Some of the extortion schemes took place
during Edwards' final term in office, which ended in 1996, while
others occurred after he stepped down but still held influence over
legislators and gaming regulators.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He was found guilty of the broadest racketeering and conspiracy
charges, and of involvement in four of the five schemes. Stephen
Edwards was convicted on 18 of 23 counts. Andrew Martin, a former
top aide to Edwin Edwards, was convicted of all six counts against
him; Cecil Brown, a longtime Edwards friend and business partner,
of four counts; and Bobby Johnson, another Edwards friend, of nine
counts. State Sen. Greg Tarver and Ecotry Fuller, the gaming board
member, were acquitted of charges that they helped Edwards
illegally obtain a confidential report for DeBartolo.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Edwards was circumstantial, because even the
hundreds of hours of audiotape never captured him making an
explicit demand. But the testimony of his former friends and
several suggestive conversations caught on the tapes apparently
were enough to persuade the jury. The tapes revealed him talking
about splitting up proceeds that he maintained he never received
and brainstorming schemes to launder money.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were surprised that Edwin, who has always been
so smart, let them get so much information on him,'' said Bernie R.
Pinsonat, a Baton Rouge pollster. ``They had tapes in his office,
tapes in his house, and they obviously nailed him. Regardless of
what happens from here on out it is the end of an era.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who by his own count has been investigated by 22 grand
juries, first escaped conviction in 1985 when a federal jury in New
Orleans deadlocked while considering charges that he took payoffs
to help his patrons win state hospital licenses. He was retried and
acquitted the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution clearly had stronger evidence in this year's
case, including the tapes and the witness testimony. It also
benefited by trying the case in Baton Rouge, where jurors are
considered more conservative than in New Orleans. All but one of
the jurors was white, a significant factor given that Edwards
strongest support always came from black Louisianans.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the verdicts were rendered, the defense team had
been handed at least one significant cause for appeal. Last
Thursday, after two days of investigation and legal hand-wringing,
U.S. District Court Judge Frank Polozola dismissed one of the 12
jurors, a white man known only as Juror 68. The verdicts, thus,
were returned by a jury of 11, and defense lawyers have assumed
that the dismissed juror was resisting the majority's arguments for
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The judge did not explain the dismissal, but Louisiana
newspapers have reported that the juror asked to be dismissed. The
newspapers, including The Advocate in Baton Rouge and The
Times-Picayune in New Orleans, reported that the juror sent
Polozola a note saying, ``I am being very intimidated because of
how I may feel. There is such an awesome responsibility with the
lives of people in our and my hands that I am trying to erase some
doubts but can't seem to forget them in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   After the juror was dismissed, defense lawyers asked for a
mistrial and were rebuffed by the judge. The time devoted to
dismissing the juror, when combined with other delays, meant that
the jury deliberated for only about seven of the 12 work days it
had the case.

ANALYSIS: PEACEKEEPING MISSION IN SIERRA LEONE SUFFERS FROM MANY
WEAKNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SIERRA LEONE, SIERRA-LEONE-RESPONSE) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The flaws in the U.N. peacekeeping mission in
Sierra Leone reach back to decisions supported by the Clinton
administration last year, when there was a rush to end the civil
war and dispatch an international force that would bring what some
call ``peace on the cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   The formula for the peace deal known as the Lome accord, which
the administration helped forge with an assist from the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, worked this way: The rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, was
released from death row and given a prominent role in a new
government on the understanding that his men would put down their
weapons, in a setting with U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration, haunted by the memory of 18 American
soldiers killed in Somalia on a U.N. mission, and mindful of 14
Belgians slaughtered in Rwanda, made it clear to Congress that it
would not send American forces to Africa again. Britain, the former
colonial power in Sierra Leone, similarly did not offer to send in
troops as peacekeepers there. Nor did or any other European
country.
</P>
<P>
   Washington also repeatedly told African leaders that, although
the United States was not prepared to risk its own people in
Africa, it cared about the troubled continent.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of that support, a peacekeeping force was formed,
crafted from a hodge-podge of nations whose armies had never worked
together, and who were given minimal equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council also did not give the peacekeeping force
the means to patrol the borders of Sierra Leone, through which,
according to experts on Africa, the rebels could continue trading
diamonds for weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission, like that of most U.N. peacekeeping forces, was
essentially to police a peace agreement, and not to plunge into the
fray. The problem was that they were sent to monitor a very fragile
peace.
</P>
<P>
   When the arrangements started to collapse, Britain sent several
hundreds paratroopers to the airport at Freetown on Monday, but
insisted they had the sole task of evacuating foreigners, while the
United States announced it would help transport 700 Bangladeshi
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials now say that Sankoh was never
interested in peace _ although it had enough trust in him for
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to meet him when she visited
the country last October.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its European allies have not offered
troops for the planned peacekeeping operation in Congo, either,
where 500 monitors are scheduled to deploy with the protection of
about 5,000 troops. Diplomats at the United Nations say that this
mission is now in question.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. peacekeeping department itself has already been going
through a series of inquiries after the world body failed to stop
the slaughter in Rwanda and to halt the killing of Muslims in the
Bosnian town of Srebrenica in 1995. A former Algerian foreign
minister, Lakhdar Brahimi, was appointed in March by Secretary
General Kofi Annan to look into the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robust peace enforcement is beyond the capacity of the United
Nations,'' said J. Stephen Morrison, the director of Africa
programs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
``The Security Council does not have the stomach for it,
contributing countries don't want to put their troops under other
commanders and then have to answer questions at home when their
troops get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   By backing such a weak force in a volatile country like Sierra
Leone, Morrison said, the Clinton administration was hoping for
``peace on the cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate within the administration and among other members of
the Security Council is now focused on whether to reinforce the
crippled force in Sierra Leone or to come up with a regional force,
led by the Nigerians, administration officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The tide is turning toward a regional force, and officials said
they hoped that would be the result of the meeting held Tuesday in
Abuja, Nigeria, of leaders from the region.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the session in Abuja, the leaders of nine African states
said they were considering deployment a West African force, led by
the Nigerians and known as Ecomog.
</P>
<P>
   Such a force had been in Sierra Leone before the Lome accord of
last July, and if it returns it would be a signal that regional
forces are viewed as better suited to enforcing the peace than
inexperienced U.N. troops, several administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of a regional body that controls the Ecomog force
said on Tuesday they would convene the 15 member countries'
ministers of defense and chiefs of staff on May 17 to consider
sending the troops back.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The logic of regional forces, according to administration
officials, is that each region looks after its own trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, NATO intervened in Bosnia and Kosovo; the Australians went
to Timor last year, and the West Africans may be poised to enforce
the peace in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, with its experience in Sierra Leone, was considered key
to a solution in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   But after Nigerian soldiers suffered casualties and were nearly
defeated by the rebel Revolutionary United Front in January 1999,
the Nigerian government told the United Nations, the United States
and Britain that it was going to pull out its troops if it did not
win increased financial support, an administration official said.
There was reluctance by the British and the administration to fund
the Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
   When the United Nations decided to send a peacekeeping force to
Sierra Leone, Nigeria _ like the United States _ said it did not
want its troops to serve under the U.N. commanders.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the Nigerian troops had left by early last week, the
moment when administration officials now say Sankoh's forces
decided to test the will of the U.N. force by taking Kenyan and
Zambian soldiers hostage and stripping them of ammunition and
armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   By last week, when the rebels struck, the U.N. force was still
3,000 soldiers short of the full 11,000 complement set up in
February. Recruiting non-African countries to send their soldiers
was particularly difficult, with the Indians, the Bangladeshi and
the Jordanians being the main non-African countries to offer men.
</P>
<P>
   After U.N. troops started arriving early this year _ six months
after the peace accord was signed _ the Indian commander of the
force, Gen. Veejay Jatley, told administration officials that the
organization in New York was so chaotic that he did not know what
troops were coming, or which country they were coming from, until
they arrived, one of the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Jatley sent the new peacekeepers into the hinterland where the
rebels were still killing civilian Sierra Leoneans. ``This was good
to visibly demonstrate the peacekeepers were there but not good if
they got into a shooting war,'' an administration official said.
The peacekeepers were often intimidated, surrounded by rebels and,
according to Human Rights Watch, the peacekeepers did not intervene
to stop rapes, abductions and killings that were occurring close to
where they were.

AS McCAIN ENDORSES BUSH, HE SHUNS VP JOB 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Smoothing out a rough spot in the Republican
presidential campaign, Sen. John McCain endorsed George W. Bush on
Tuesday and said he would ``campaign enthusiastically'' for the
Texas governor but was not interested in being his vice
presidential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Their private meeting and subsequent joint news conference ran
about as smoothly as the Bush campaign could have hoped, given
McCain's prickly personality and deep displeasure at some of the
dirt Bush dished his way en route to wrapping up the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, Bush's stiffest competition for the nomination, did not
use the word ``endorse'' in his initial statement, and when asked
if he were endorsing Bush, McCain answered tersely: ``Yes.'' When
questioned further about whether he had a problem with the semantic
point, McCain repeated six times: ``I endorse Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way,'' Bush said, ``I enthusiastically accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain clearly came to no meeting of the minds in their
90-minute meeting on the Arizona senator's call for outlawing
unlimited, unregulated ``soft money'' in campaigns. But both men
emphasized that their agreements on public policy outnumbered their
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Each hoped the meeting put an end to speculation about McCain as
a Bush running mate, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked his advice about the vice presidency,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked that I not be considered for vice president of the
United States,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take him for his word,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about Bush's choice for a running mate has begun to
focus on Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, whom Bush said McCain had
specifically mentioned. But McCain said the list of prospects was a
long one, including a few of the limited number of senators who
backed his presidential bid, such as Sen. Fred Thompson of
Tennessee and Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The body language of the event, in which Bush seemed to stand as
close as possible to McCain, indicated that the moment was more
important to the governor than the senator. Bush acknowledged as
much with his wish that McCain's backing send a signal to the
senator's supporters in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who think John is not only a great
American but a person who's got a good, solid agenda for the
future,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent national polls show that if McCain ran as an independent
presidential candidate, which he has said he will not do, he would
get about one quarter of the popular vote and force Bush into an
even closer race with Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive
Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the ``single most important reason'' for giving Bush
his formal backing is that the governor ``is the most qualified
person to be president of the United States. He has the vision, he
has the knowledge and the experience to carry out the mission of
maintaining the United States' supremacy, both militarily and
economically, in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's clear that Governor Bush's philosophy, his ideals
and his ability to articulate a vision of the future is the major
reason why he should be president of the United States and not Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee quickly issued a release
recalling some of McCain's more caustic comments about Bush during
the heat of the late winter GOP campaign, including: ``If Governor
Bush is a reformer, I'm an astronaut.'' Also on the DNC list was
McCain's view earlier in the year that Bush would ``lose to Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   In part of his opening statement, McCain seemed reserved in his
evaluation of Bush as national leader and was restrained in his
choice of words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that it's very important that we restore integrity
and honor to the White House,'' McCain said. ``I am convinced that
Governor Bush can do that more than adequately.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed on his timing and frame of mind in finally offering
Bush formal backing, McCain replied, using a reporter's phrase: ``I
think your `take the medicine now' is probably a good
description.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said she took McCain's comment as
a joke, but the senator's advisers said that he had finally decided
it was time to get the long-anticipated event behind him. Until the
weekend, McCain had not intended to endorse Bush immediately after
their meeting.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a glitch in the proceedings, it was Bush's refusal,
in answer to a reporter's question, to repudiate the view of
religious right leader Pat Robertson that McCain was so emotionally
rash that he would be ``dangerous'' as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, without reference to Robertson, said only that McCain is
``a man of good judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also indicated that he would spend more time working to
keep Republicans in control of the House and Senate than in
boosting Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the two men did not discuss a specific role for McCain
at the Republican National Convention this summer, nor did they
apparently discuss other joint campaign appearances. Bush said he
wanted McCain to have ``a key role'' at the GOP convention. &QL;

 McCAIN BACKS BUSH BUT WON'T BE ON TICKET  
(EDS: Updates throughout with fresh quotes, additional background,
analyst comment; story now in 2 takes; note byline change.) 
 By FRANK BRUNI c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Citing common goals and shared values that
transcended any of the bitterness between them, Sen. John McCain at
last endorsed Gov. George W. Bush on Tuesday and pledged to help
the de facto Republican presidential nominee achieve what McCain
had wanted so badly for himself: a seat behind the desk in the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to enthusiastically campaigning for Governor
Bush for the next six months,'' McCain said at a news conference
here that was attended by more than 100 members of the news media,
a reflection of just how unpredictable and closely watched the
interactions between the Arizona senator and the Texas governor had
become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that it's very important that we restore integrity
and honor to the White House,'' McCain said. ``I'm convinced that
Governor Bush can do that more than adequately.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by McCain, which followed his private
90-meeting with Bush, heralded a new phase in a rocky political
relationship that went from remarkable amity in December to
extraordinary animosity in March and a tense, delicate dance of
reconciliation over the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, McCain's formal endorsement of his one-time
adversary allowed Bush to lay claim to a unified party, to put an
important piece of unfinished business behind him and to reach out
to independent and swing voters with the blessing of McCain, who
had held a potent allure over that group in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Bush and McCain and political analysts said just
how much work McCain would do on Bush's behalf _ and just how
thoroughly the wounds of a lacerating primary season had healed _
remained unclear. McCain's often tepid demeanor and restrained
language at the news conference only heightened those questions.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated several times that his support for Bush did not
alter or diminish his commitment to an overhaul of campaign funding
laws that was more sweeping than the plan favored by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He did not actually use the words ``endorse'' or ``endorsement''
until reporters pressed him to make sure they understood correctly
what was going on. At that point, McCain made something of a comedy
routine, saying: ``I endorse Governor Bush. I endorse Governor
Bush. I endorse Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   And when one journalist asked McCain if his actions Tuesday _ an
almost inevitable obligation for any politician wishing to remain
loyal to his party _ were like swallowing a dose of necessary
medicine sooner rather than later, McCain answered, ``I think `take
the medicine now' probably is a good description.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides chose to interpret the ambiguous remark as an
example of the senator's sometimes deadpan humor, and it did not
diminish their conviction, shared by many Republican operatives,
that the Texas governor had accomplished something important
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also made clear Tuesday that he had told Bush what he had
been saying publicly for some time: that he had no interest in the
vice presidency. But he and Bush said they had discussed other
strong candidates for the job, including Govs. Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania, Christie Whitman of New Jersey, Tommy Thompson of
Wisconsin and John Engler of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting McCain's endorsement, Bush heaped praise on him,
providing a stark contrast to some of the dismissive remarks that
he and his aides had made about McCain after Bush effectively
secured the Republican presidential nomination in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   And he cast their acrimonious exchanges during the primary as a
beneficial experience that prepared him for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him point blank he made me a better candidate,'' Bush
said, referring to their meeting in a room of the Westin William
Penn hotel here. ``He waged a really good campaign and put me
through my paces. And as a result of the campaign, I stand better
prepared to become the president, which is exactly what I intend to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   And McCain said that it made no sense to revisit the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to look back in anger or with any rancor would be a
mistake,'' he said. ``It would harm me. It would harm Governor
Bush. And it would harm those who supported me in this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the tone of his remarks suggested that his and his aides'
ire over some of the negative tactics used by Bush and his
supporters during the primaries had not dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   That anger was rekindled Tuesday when Bush dodged a question
about whether he would repudiate a statement by the evangelist Pat
Robertson two days ago that choosing McCain as a vice president
would be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said Rick Davis, who had managed
McCain's campaign. ``I don't think there's a Republican around who
doesn't think Pat Robertson's comments Sunday were outside the
mainstream of our party. What's the harm of saying that?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said that McCain's eventual endorsement of
Bush was never really in much doubt, in part because the senator,
seen as something of an untameable maverick in his own party,
needed to show his political peers that he could follow the loyal,
polite course. That would be particularly critical if Bush loses
and McCain seeks to become the party's nominee four years from now.
</P>
<P>
   But the road leading to this point was bumpy, and it was not
clear until Monday that Tuesday morning's meeting, scheduled a
month ago, would bring the waiting to an end. McCain's prior
statements that he would support the party's nominee fell short of
a formal seal of approval and fueled speculation, which Bush's
aides were eager to quell, about what was taking so long.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Brookover, a Republican strategist, said Tuesday's meeting
should give voters more of a sense of Bush's leadership abilities.
``What people want to see in a president and a presidential
candidate is the ability to forge forward through difficult times
and an ability to reach out and work with many people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the two men's aides, Bush did not offer McCain
anything concrete in exchange for his support. And one McCain
supporter said efforts by the aides to hammer out a document
detailing joint policy goals had failed.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's aides have let Bush campaign officials know that
the Arizona senator would like a prominent speaking role at the
Republican National Convention, and the Bush campaign has indicated
interest in making that happen.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of the meeting, both McCain and Bush acknowledged
that they still have policy disagreements, although they declined
to linger on them. During the primaries, for example, McCain
repeatedly asserted that the size of Bush's proposed tax cut might
jeopardize the health of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain's vision of overhauling the campaign finance system,
for example, includes bans on unregulated donations to political
parties from both corporations and individuals; Bush does not think
individual contributions should be limited.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, McCain said, ``I want to assure people that supported
me in the primary that I will continue to pursue this agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to both politicians said there had not yet been any
discussion about specific ways in which McCain could or would
bolster Bush's campaign efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But several Republican strategists in Washington said that
McCain would probably wind up doing a great deal and that his tone
Tuesday simply reflected the difficulty of accepting that it was
finally time to cede the stage to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went from huge media star and man-of-the-moment to having
to fall back in line,'' said William Dal Col, who managed Steve
Forbes' campaign for the Republican nomination. ``But it'll get
better and better as time goes by, and if he wants to run in 2004,
the smart thing for him to do is be as energetic and pro-Bush as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Warfield, who was the press secretary for the 1996
presidential campaign of Bob Dole, acknowledged that McCain was
``flippant and unconventional'' in delivering his endorsement but
that his manner did not change ``how important it really is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, in the immediate aftermath of McCain's defeat,
there was furious speculation that he might run as a third-party
candidate,'' Warfield said. ``As recently as last week, there was a
poll that showed McCain, in a hypothetical three-way race, with
more than 20 percent. Any time you get endorsed by someone with
that kind of star quality is a very good day.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two former presidents and an array of senior
officials from Democratic and Republican administrations rallied
Tuesday with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore at the
White House to urge Congress to approve a landmark China trade
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a ceremony in the ornate East Room, Clinton
intensified his lobbying in advance of the House vote, now likely
on May 24 or May 25, to grant China permanent normal trading
privileges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Congress votes against it, they'll be kicking
themselves in the rear 10 years from now, because America will be
paying the price,'' Clinton told scores of invited dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Statesmen, scholars and military chiefs, including former
Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and James Baker III, whose
public service spanned nearly 50 years in some cases, stood with
Clinton in warning of the consequences of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``A negative vote in the House or Senate would be catastrophic
to American agriculture, electronics, telecommunications, autos and
countless other products and services,'' said former President
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the measure, which would allow American companies to
benefit fully from a market-opening agreement that would pave the
way for China to enter the World Trade Organization, say it would
sacrifice lawmakers' influence over Beijing's record on human
rights and religious freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Carter acknowledged that China had fallen short
in those areas, but cautioned against rejecting the measure.
``There's no doubt in my mind,'' Carter said, ``that a negative
vote on this issue in the Congress will be a serious setback and
impediment for the further democratization, freedom and human
rights in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched between Clinton and the former presidents in turns at
the microphone, Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential
nominee, appeared reluctant to give his full-throated endorsement.
His words sounded support. But his subdued tone suggested the pains
that Gore has taken to avoid alienating a pivotal ally, organized
labor, that opposes the accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is right for American jobs, it is right for the cause of
reform in China, and I believe it will move us closer to the strong
and stable world community that we all seek to create,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   With just two weeks left before the vote, the White House and
its allies on Capitol Hill say they are still 10 to 15 votes shy of
the 218 needed for passage. About 30 Democrats and roughly as many
Republicans remained officially undecided, and the presentation
Tuesday was aimed at pulling both camps down off the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said opponents _ an unlikely coalition of liberal
Democrats and conservative Republicans _ were unwittingly doing the
bidding of the measure's foes in China, the owners of state-owned
enterprises and reactionary military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is truly ironic when you look at who's against this in
China to see that some of the most progressive people in the United
States are basically doing what they want them to do in opposing
this agreement,'' said Clinton, who may visit a Democrat's district
in Minnesota or Ohio on Friday to champion the proposed lower
tariffs for American farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In their own news conferences, opponents warned that normalizing
trade relations would only reward China's bellicose government.
``Regardless of the administration's trade objectives, the reality
is that China prepares for war,'' said Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to sway uncommitted lawmakers, Reps. Sander M. Levin,
D-Mich., and Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., announced a bipartisan plan to
create a commission to monitor Chinese human rights and require
protection against a surge in Chinese imports.
</P>
<P>
   One undecided Republican, Phil English of Pennsylvania, said,
``This will make my decision a lot easier.'' But Rep. Dick Armey,
R-Texas, the majority leader, said provisions on labor and imports
would cost Republican votes on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   But without some sort of bill to address labor and human rights
issues, Rep. Robert T. Matsui of California, a top Democratic vote
counter, said, ``this will be a real problem for us.''

PEROT MAY SKIP HIS REFORM PARTY'S CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ross Perot, the founder of the Reform Party and its
presidential candidate in 1992 and 1996, probably will not attend
this year's convention of the party, which is expected to nominate
Pat Buchanan for president, an aide said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pretty clear that if Buchanan is the nominee that Perot
will not attend the convention or support the nominee,'' said the
aide, a party official and Perot ally who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Perot did not return a phone call seeking comment, but another
of his key supporters, Russell Verney, said, ``He has a very tight
travel schedule for business this summer and no definite plans have
been made one way or the other with respect to appearing at the
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The Perot aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said that
supporters of Perot felt that Buchanan's positions on social
issues, including his opposition to abortion and gay rights, were
contrary to the Reform Party principles against government
involvement in private matters. Taking positions on either side of
those issues, the aide said, would deflect attention from the
causes that led to the formation of the party, including its
support for campaign reform and its opposition to some
international free-trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to comment on the likely absence of Perot from the
convention, Scott McConnell, a senior policy adviser to the
Buchanan presidential campaign, said: ``Though Buchanan did not
endorse Perot in 1992 or 1996, he has great respect for him and
remembers fondly the battles against NAFTA and the WTO, in which
they were side by side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Perot does want to attend the convention, the welcome mat
will be out for him,'' McConnell said. ``If he chooses not to come,
we fully respect his decision.''
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a will-he-or-won't-he aspect to Perot's
own candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   When Verney was asked whether there was any chance that Perot
might enter the presidential campaign later, he answered, ``No _
the window is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gerry Moan, chairman of the Reform Party, said that ``I
still think there's an outside chance he'll be there. We hold out
hope.''

INVESTIGATORS LOCATE MORE MONEY BELIEVED LOOTED FROM NIGERIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Investigators pursuing what the Nigerian government
says is billions of dollars looted from the West African country
during the rule of its late leader, Sani Abacha, have found $630
million in Luxembourg bank accounts connected with his sons.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, which has now uncovered more than $1 billion
in European accounts in the names of the Abacha family or
associates, has embarrassed officials in Switzerland and set off an
investigation of Credit Suisse, one of the country's two biggest
banks, where part of an additional $654 million in Nigerian money
was found.
</P>
<P>
   The latest amounts disclosed had been put in eight bank accounts
at the Luxembourg office of M.M. Warburg &AMP; Co., a private bank, in
the names of Alhaji Sani Mohammed and Abba Mohammed Sani,
Luxembourg officials confirmed. These names were falsely used by
two sons of Abacha, Mohammed and Abba, said a lawyer for the
Nigerian government.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts have been frozen, according to Jean-Paul Frising,
the deputy prosecutor in Luxembourg, and documents verifying the
accounts have been sent to the Nigerian government, which now must
ask that the money be returned.
</P>
<P>
   That request will be made before the end of the month, said a
lawyer for Nigeria's new democratically elected government, which
claims that Abacha embezzled more than $2 billion, much of it
through the nation's central bank, during the five years he
controlled the African country. He died in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt for Abacha-related money also turned up more than $300
million in England last month. The money was originally transferred
there to pay Russian firms for building the Ajaokutu steel factory
in Nigeria, but found its way into the Abacha family accounts. That
money is being disputed, with a Geneva financier claiming the money
on grounds that the Russians had signed the debt over to him.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss authorities have been conducting an extensive
investigation because the money found in the country, which is the
most since Ferdinand Marcos, the former Philippine dictator, hid
$550 million here, cannot be returned without proof that it was the
product of illegal acts.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Geneva officials charged a New Delhi businessman
with fraudulently using some of the money to repay Russian
construction companies.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by the indictment of an Abacha associate,
Abubakar Bagudu, in London on April 26 on charges of money
laundering, fraud, corrupt management and involvement in a criminal
organization. This was in connection with the Ajaokuta steel
venture and with two sales of vaccines, in 1995 and 1997, to
Nigerian health agencies, which allegedly netted $66.6 million.
Some $25 million of this illicit money is frozen in Geneva at the
Banque du Gothard and Credit Agricole, according to legal papers.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual procedure, an investigating magistrate, Georges
Zecchin of Geneva flew to London where he indicted the Nigerian at
the Swiss embassy. Bagudu, the Abacha associate, who ran an
import-export business in Nigeria, had traveled to Switzerland
twice last year to answer questions, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bagudu maintains that any money in Switzerland is the proceeds
of lawful business activities, and that he had settled Lagos'
claims last summer in a civil lawsuit. However, when it appeared he
would not come to Geneva to be charged, the Swiss magistrate went
to England. &QL;

 FORMER CHAMP STADLER DROPS OUT (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) By JIMMY BURCH AND CHARLES CLINES
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Craig Stadler withdrew yesterday from the GTE
Byron Nelson Classic because of a rib injury, becoming the third
former champion to drop out of the tournament since practice rounds
began Monday at the Four Seasons Resort.
</P>
<P>
   Stadler, 46, ranks 40th on the PGA Tour money list ($472,462)
this season and finished second in his most recent event, the Shell
Houston Open (April 27-30). Stadler won the 1984 Nelson and has
finished 11th or better eight times in his past 15 appearances at
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Stadler's departure came one day after Nelson officials learned
that Ernie Els, the 1995 champ, and Fred Couples, the 1987 winner,
had withdrawn because of back injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Stadler's place in the 156-player field will be taken by
alternate Steve Gotsche.  &QL; 
Fancy footwork
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price displayed some quick feet upon arrival at the course
yesterday. And it had nothing to do with running to avoid
intermittent showers, which interrupted practice rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Price joined locker room attendant Martin Oribhabor in
what could best be described as an impromptu, soft-shoe dance
routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an African greeting dance,'' said Price, who grew up in
Zimbabwe. Oribhabor, a native of Nigeria, said the two countries
have similar customs because of their proximity in Africa. Price
and Oribhabor routinely greet one another with the dance during
Nelson week.
</P>
<P>
   If Price is in contention during the weekend rounds, Oribhabor
said they will reconvene for the ``jumbo'' dance, which is designed
for good luck. They performed the ritual before the final round of
the 1991 Nelson, which Price won.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the real dance,'' Oribhabor said. ``This other was just
a welcome. Hopefully, it's a warm-up for bigger things to come.''  &QL; 
Early-bird Tiger
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods avoided the crowds yesterday during a practice round
at the Cottonwood Valley course. Woods joined Casey Martin, a
former Stanford teammate, on the tee at 6:30 a.m. They finished at
9:20 a.m., well before most fans arrived. Woods declined interview
requests after his round but said he would answer media questions
today.
</P>
<P>
   For Woods, it marked his second early start of the week. He
played at 7 a.m. Monday with Aaron Baddeley, an Australian amateur.
He plans to make another early start today. Woods' group is
scheduled for a 7 a.m. start on the TPC course in the Gold Pro-Am.
 &QL; 
Kickoff ceremony
</P>
<P>
   Byron Nelson and his wife Peggy were among the officials and
dignitaries who helped kick off the 2000 GTE Byron Nelson Classic
at a ceremony conducted about 12:15 p.m. yesterday while light rain
fell.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony was moved from in front of the Nelson bronze
statue, that is the centerpiece of the Nelson Plaza adjacent to No.
1 tee, to under an awning near Byron's Room, a restaurant just in
front of the statue.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who took part in the ceremony were Irving mayor Joe
Putnam, tournament chairman Patrick McEvoy Jr. and Four Seasons
Resort general manager Craig Reid.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson gave a short speech, and said the tournament that's named
after him is ``the best thing that's happened to me, what with what
the Salesmanship Club does and my association with all the pros.''
</P>
<P>
   The sponsoring Salesmanship Club of Dallas raised $5.9 million
for its charities from last year's tournament.  &QL; 
A more upright Duval
</P>
<P>
   David Duval was working to improve his posture during his
practice session Monday and said he'll be aware of the need to
stand taller this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I start slouching over too much,'' he said. ``I
don't know how long I've been doing it. It's something that could
be from day-to-day.''
</P>
<P>
   By standing up more, Duval said his swing is on a more level
plane.  &QL; 
Watch that hook
</P>
<P>
   Former Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach, among the
participants in yesterday afternoon's Skins Game, said as he gets
older, he has begun to play more golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf has a lot of aspects to it _ chipping, putting,
driving,'' said Staubach, who sports a 16 handicap. Staubach said
he isn't close to mastering any of the aspects, but said if he has
a strength it's probably his driver. He hit some impressive drives
on the practice range, but was worried what he would do on the
first tee.
</P>
<P>
   He soon found out and had the gallery to the left scrambling
after he hooked his drive.  &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   MasterCard Colonial officials Dee Finley and Scott Corpening
worked the Nelson locker room yesterday, trying to secure
additional commitments for the May 18-21 event in Fort Worth.
Deadline for Colonial commitments is Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez visited players on the
driving range. Rodriguez spent time chatting with Davis Love III
and Hank Kuehne, among others.

HICKMAN EXPLAINS VOTE FOR IVERSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Fred Hickman's mind, Allen Iverson simply answered the
question better than Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   But no way did the CNN/SI anchor figure he'd be questioned so
much about it Tuesday, trying to justify what turned out to be the
vote that ruined O'Neal's chances of becoming the first NBA Most
Valuable Player to win the award unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that bothers me is that some people see this as
a vote against O'Neal, and it's not,'' said Hickman from his home
in Atlanta. ``Shaq's one of my favorite players. This is simply a
vote for Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main criterion is: What does a guy do to lift his team? I
had it down to Shaq, Iverson, Gary Payton (of Seattle), Tim Duncan
(of San Antonio) and Kevin Garnett (of Minnesota).
</P>
<P>
   ``I take the vote very seriously. I do as much homework and take
as much input as I can. It's a long agonizing process for me. But
to me, when you look at the Sixers without Iverson, I see a really
bad team. And the Lakers without Shaq are still a pretty good club
that makes the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to an MVP vote, you can't really compare a
center to a backcourt man. They're in different systems. They're in
different conferences. I can't argue with anyone who votes for
Shaq. He's just No. 2 on my ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hickman says that Michael Jordan's seemingly annual MVP award
selection ``took everyone off the hook for a few years,'' but
Hickman did vote for Karl Malone of Utah the year he was a
semi-surprising winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past several years, there is no clear-cut No. 1 or
No. 2 guy now that the league has shifted. There are many quality
players. You have to do your homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Hickman doesn't feel hung out to dry by the league, which
handles the voting procedure by members of the media. He says he
usually is one of the last to send his ballot back and has been
voting ``for years in a number of categories.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact Hickman, who put up his explanation on the CNN/SI
Web site Tuesday afternoon, had to answer to some two dozen or more
media members Tuesday was quite ``mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them who rousted him up early Tuesday was Dr. Dre of the
urban-rap L.A. radio station The Beat, who then playfully roasted
Hickman for his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK, they're fans like everyone else,'' said Hickman.
``I don't mind (answering to my vote), but I had no idea I'd be
singled out.''

THIS TIME, BASEBALL IS MAKING A PITCH FOR EXCITEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Baseball fans thrilled to the exploits of
Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa two seasons ago, when the sluggers took
aim at the sexiest single-season record in the sport, Roger Maris'
61 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   They staged an epic battle that ended with both not just
breaking the previous mark, but shattering it. McGwire finished
with a staggering 70, and Sosa was close behind with 66.
</P>
<P>
   The 70 homers gave McGwire the record and the victory in the
individual battle, but the real winner was the game of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The two were credited with reviving interest in a sport still
licking its wounds from the 1994 players' strike that wiped out the
World Series. It was cool to watch baseball again. Even casual fans
followed the progress of Mac and Sammy.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the home run has almost become passe. There's
so many hit that the latest tape-measure shots are greeted with a
yawn, the ``half the guys in baseball are on pace to hit 50''
updates elicit a so-what shrug.
</P>
<P>
   A recent ESPN.com poll asked if there are too many home runs hit
these days. More than 60 percent said yes.
</P>
<P>
   So it again falls to two players to save the game, but this time
the two players are the very antithesis of McGwire and Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it's Pedro Martinez and Randy Johnson who could take
the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez and Johnson couldn't be any different from McGwire and
Sosa. They are skinny pitchers, not bulky sluggers. Their job is
not to hit balls over fences, but to keep hitters from doing it.
</P>
<P>
   However, their feats are perhaps even more incredible than the
1998 home run exploits of McGwire and Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   In this era of offense, when even middle infielders hit
opposite-field homers with regularity, Martinez and Johnson are
dominating the game.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is 7-0 with a 0.93 ERA and 75 strikeouts in 58 1/3
innings for the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who lost one start to rain, is 5-1 with a 1.22 ERA and
67 strikeouts in 44 1/3 innings for the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson hasn't lost since Aug. 31 last year. He's 10-0 with a
1.59 ERA and 124 strikeouts in 96 1/3 innings during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has lost once since Aug. 31, falling last Saturday
despite pitching a six-hit, one-run, one-walk, 17-strikeout game
against Tampa Bay, losing 1-0 to Steve Trachsel. Martinez is 9-1
with a 1.04 ERA and 138 strikeouts in 86 1/3 innings during that
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both dominating power pitchers with control,''
Mariners starter Aaron Sele said. ``That's a tough combination.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa had more than a thrilling home run chase in
'98. They also sparked considerable debate as to who was the better
player.
</P>
<P>
   Was it McGwire, who hit the most homers? Or was it Sosa, who had
a better average _ .308 to .299 _ and more RBI _ 158 to 147?
</P>
<P>
   The debate is the same for the two pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Is it Johnson? An imposing 6-foot-10, he's more intimidating. He
can also help himself with the bat; he's batting .273 and has a
five-game hitting streak. His fastball is perhaps a tick faster,
and his slider is deadly. His ERA is lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad he's on our side,'' Diamondbacks manager Buck
Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Is it Martinez? His changeup gives him more weapons than
Johnson. His control is a bit more precise. He's better at changing
speeds. His fastball tops out in the upper 90s. His ERA going back
to August is better than Johnson's and he has more strikeouts,
despite pitching in the league that employs the designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Who's better?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd take either one of them,'' Sele said. ``If I can have
both, even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has both. In this era of mind-numbing home run numbers,
that's something everyone should be thankful for.

EMMITT SMITH TOPS FOES IN SKINS GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ Emmitt Smith has achieved plenty in his professional
life. Three Super Bowl rings, four NFL rushing titles, a Super Bowl
MVP award and an NFL regular-season MVP selection.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's got something else: bragging rights on at least three
golfers who are competing in the GTE Byron Nelson Classic this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys running back, playing in the first of two groups in
yesterday's Celebrity Skins Challenge, won three skins during his
seven holes against John Daly, 1998 U.S. Amateur Champion Hank
Kuehne and Tommy Armour III, taking home $5,000 for Potter's Home
Church, his charity of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I did OK,'' Smith said. ``I had a good time and hit
some good shots.''
</P>
<P>
   He did more than hit a few good shots. Getting a stroke on each
hole against the pros in his group, he made a net birdie on the
par-4 No. 3, a three-hole carry for $1,500. He made net par on the
par-4 No. 4 as well to pick up another $1,000, then got a little
help on the par-4 No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   After no player won the skin on 18, the group went to a
chip-off. Smith went first, running his chip within 15 feet. The
other three then played at the same time, all purposely blasting
the ball 100 yards over the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured they would pull some junk like that,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith did it all with a new driver _ a Taylor Made that Kuehne
gave him on the driving range.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he gets done with football, he definitely has a future in
golf,'' said Kuehne, who earned $3,000 with a birdie on the par-3
No. 17. ``It's a lot of fun playing with Emmitt. He's such a good
guy. And his game is really good.''
</P>
<P>
   In the group behind Smith's, Paul Stankowski of Flower Mound
earned $5,500 for his charity, doing it all on the par-4 No. 18.
After his group, including Nick Price, defending Nelson champion
Loren Roberts and former Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach all
pushed on the 18th _ which had a three-hole carry _ Stankowski won
the chip-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all had pretty lousy chips,'' Stankowski said.
``Mine somehow just ended up the closest.''
</P>
<P>
   Staubach had a chance to win the hole in regulation after
hitting his second shot over the green and chipping to within five
feet. With his extra stroke, his putt for a net birdie stayed just
outside the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot tougher than football,'' Staubach said. ``In
football, I could make a bad pass and other players could make up
for it. I could have made up for my whole day at the end. All I had
to do was make a 5-foot putt.''

GALAXY CLEARS HURDLE IN STADIUM BID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH _ The Los Angeles Galaxy Tuesday cleared a major
hurdle in its quest to move from the enormous, 96,636-seat Rose
Bowl into cozier quarters on the campus of California State
University Dominguez Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Those quarters a 30,000-seat soccer-specific stadium have yet to
be built, but the Finance Committee of the California State
University Board of Trustees gave its unanimous approval to the
concept at a meeting at Long Beach State. The full board is
expected to approve the plan this morning.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, the Galaxy, which has been talking about
leaving the Rose Bowl since October of 1998, could be playing in
its new stadium by April 2002, said Tim Leiweke, the team's
president. The Galaxy has played at the Rose Bowl since Major
League Soccer's inaugural season of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The vote) indicates there is interest in going ahead with
good faith negotiations,'' Leiweke said. ``We're a lot closer now
(to moving) and it's nice to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the Galaxy move, it will have an immediate financial
impact on the Rose Bowl, but Leiweke and Rose Bowl General Manager
Darryl Dunn said they are negotiating a deal to have international
soccer matches and events too large for a 30,000-seat venue played
at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a conversation with Tim Leiweke two days ago,'' Dunn
said. ``They still would like to have a future with the Rose Bowl,
but their intention is to go beyond the Galaxy and be more active
as far as international games.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the number of matches played there, the deal could
actually work in the Rose Bowl's favor. Dunn said the stadium makes
more money from events that draw more people. Since the Galaxy
averages less than 20,000 fans per game, it's in the Rose Bowl's
best interest to bring international matches to the stadium. Many
of those matches draw crowds in the range of 50,000-70,000 Dunn
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potentially it's a better deal,'' Dunn said. ``I think it
makes a lot of sense from our perspective because our history of
international soccer here is unparalleled.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl is the only stadium in the world to have served as
host for the Olympic soccer gold medal match as well as the men's
and women's World Cup championship matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more people that are in the stadium, the more money we
make,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Leiweke said he would also negotiate with the Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum if he couldn't reach a deal with the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium plan put forth Tuesday by the Galaxy and James E.
Lyons, president of Cal State Dominguez Hills, calls for several
ambitious renovations on a portion of the Carson campus that is now
occupied by a velodrome that was used for bicycle races in the 1984
Olympic Games. The location occupies 85 acres of property on the
western portion of the campus.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy and its owner, billionaire Philip F. Anschutz,
operating under the formal name of Anschutz L.A. Soccer, want to
add several improvements to the site at a total cost of $85
million, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for:
</P>
<P>
   A 30,000-seat soccer stadium;
</P>
<P>
   A 12,000-seat tournament tennis stadium;
</P>
<P>
   Fields and support facilities for the United States Soccer
Federation's National Training Academy;
</P>
<P>
   Locker rooms, weight rooms, offices, video rooms, a gymnasium,
pool and track;
</P>
<P>
   Housing for as many as 240 people.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's approval of the plan was a necessary step in Leiweke's
quest to have the U.S. Soccer Federation move from its current
headquarters in Chicago to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing we have to do is win the bid for the USSF to
move here,'' Leiweke said. ``They have 12 proposals, but we
understand we're one of two favorites.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is enthralled with the proposal. Steve Meiche, head
of the Southern California Velodrome Association, said he may file
a lawsuit. Meiche said his organization currently leases the
velodrome from the university and has a contract to do so through
2003. Meiche said many neighbors of Cal State Dominguez Hills also
are upset with the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think everyone in the area is going to play along,''
he said. ``The vast majority of the people I've talked to are
opposed to this. There's been no community forums to discuss this
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he is seeking community input, Lyons said the
university has the final say about how the land is used.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big problem is going to be the issues of concerts, soccer
and soccer violence,'' he said. ``Some members of the community
will be asking, `What do you do to guard against it?'
</P>
<P>
   ``But, we're not putting this out to a public referendum and
asking them to vote on it,'' he said. ``I'm trying to broker the
best business and education deal that I can for the university.''

HIKER DESCRIBES EVENTS LEADING UP TO KNIFING OF FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. _ Three days of desperate, haphazard hiking
through the parched stream beds and treacherous mountain trails of
Rattlesnake Canyon had brought David Coughlin to a final night of
retching pain and fatal resolve, his best friend said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get the knife,'' Coughlin asked Raffi Kodikian, who described
the scenario in dramatic, tearful testimony from the witness stand
at Eddy County District Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `No, I'm not going to do this,' '' Kodikian recalled.
``He grabbed me and said, `Stop (expletive) around. You know
they're not coming . . . Put it through my chest.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian said he complied with his friend's desperate plea,
piercing his lung on the first attempt. The second thrust, he said,
struck its mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put the knife in his heart,'' Kodikian said. ``I asked him
if he was still in pain, and he said no, and he smiled.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Coughlin died on the desert floor. Within hours,
Kodikian was rescued by park rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The gripping testimony was the first time Kodikian, 25, has told
his story in public. Although he described it as a mercy killing,
Kodikian has pleaded no contest to second-degree murder for
stabbing Coughlin, a 26-year-old man from Millis, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Chief District Judge Jay W. Forbes has presided over the
sentencing hearing, and could deliver his sentence as early as
Wednesday after hearing from the final two witnesses. Kodikian
faces a maximum of 20 years in prison, but the judge could also
make him free man by placing him on probation instead.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian's plea avoids a jury trial by placing his fate in
Forbes' hands, but it also preserves his right to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian's emotional, detailed recounting of a nightmarish visit
to Carlsbad Caverns National Park _ in which a planned overnight
stay last Aug. 4 turned into a fatal, four-day ordeal _ did not
allay skepticism among park officials and law officers here.
</P>
<P>
   During a recess, Mark J. Maciha, the National Park supervisor
who spoke with Kodikian at his campsite shortly after being found,
said he remains baffled by several things he saw on the bottom of
Rattlesnake Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``From day one, I've tried to put myself in their perspective,''
said Maciha, who testified for the prosecution Tuesday. ``I've just
found too many things to resolve in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   First, Maciha said, Kodikian seemed alert when the rangers found
him, despite spending four days in the desert with no food or
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was as coherent as I was,'' Maciha said.
</P>
<P>
   Other puzzling elements: the pair's decision to camp in a
shadeless stream bed, and that Kodikian had enough strength to
cover his friend's body with rocks weighing as much as 70 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a substantial amount of energy to move those rocks,''
Maciha said.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian testified that he had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to do it,'' Kodikian said of his makeshift tomb. ``I
wanted his parents to be able to ID him. If I left him uncovered,
the buzzards would have torn him apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination by Chief Deputy District Attorney Les
Williams, Kodikian maintained that killing Coughlin was not an act
of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what he needed, yeah. I recognized the situation,''
Kodikian said. His motivation, Kodikian added, was ``keeping my
friend from going through 12 to 24 hours of hell before he would
die.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Kodikian's description of his state of mind, a
neuropsychologist who examined him extensively after his arrest
said Kodikian was suffering from a temporary mental disorder at the
time, caused by the conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying for the defense, Dr. Thomas Thompson, said he also
noted that Kodikian has difficulty processing visual and spatial
information, even under normal circumstances. Inside the canyon, he
said, Kodikian likely could not align himself with geographical
landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   For Kodikian, walking into Rattlesnake Canyon was ``a disaster
waiting to happen,'' Thompson said. The topographical map he bought
at the park's visitors center, he added, might as well have been
``a text in Greek.''
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian's strong verbal-related intelligence probably made him
dangerously overconfident, Thompson testified. Faced with what
appeared to be a hopeless situation and a friend begging for death,
the doctor said, Kodikian ``would have had no ability to rise above
the situation and see it any other way.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sheriff A.M. ``Chunky'' Click, who has questioned Kodikian's
statements from the beginning, said what he saw of Tuesday's
testimony did little to change his skepticism. When asked during a
break whether he believed Kodikian's version of events, Click
replied: ``There's only one person who really knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian's account, delivered directly to Judge Forbes,
portrayed a pair of young men who detoured to Carlsbad, en route to
California, to view the world-famous caverns here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were basically just looking for a bed,'' Kodikian said of
their 24-hour permit to enter the park's back-country.
</P>
<P>
   But when they awoke Aug. 5, the men could not find the trail
back to their car, Kodikian said. They spent a day vainly searching
for the path and ended back at camp _ baffled, tired, and out of
water.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, they climbed to the top of a ridge, but could not
find the place where where they believed they had seen headlights
on a road the night before. That exhausting trek, Kodikian said,
led only to more frustration, dehydration, and creeping thoughts of
suicide as buzzards circled overhead.
</P>
<P>
   As they returned to camp, Kodikian testified, they saw mirages
of water at an abandoned ranch, and tried to drink their own urine,
strained through a baseball cap, he said. The next day, Aug. 7, was
as mentally and physically exhausting as any he has endured,
Kodikian said.
</P>
<P>
   The pair became convinced that park authorities had misplaced
their permit and were not searching for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no hope that anyone knew we were down there,'' Kodikian
said. Coughlin even tried to cut Kodikian's wrist in a failed
attempt to begin a joint suicide act, Kodikian testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally and physically I was destroyed. I didn't know if I
could go through another day like that.'' At the same time, he
testified, Coughlin's condition deteriorated rapidly, vomiting
uncontrollably. ``He spent the whole night on his hands and knees,
throwing up,'' Kodikian said.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn, he added, the excruciating end-game began.

SOUTH CAROLINA HOUSE DEBATES OPTIONS FOR MOVING REBEL FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ On the tense opening day of what may be the
final debate over flying the Confederate battle flag on the
Statehouse dome, an all-white majority of the South Carolina House
of Representatives appeared to be willing to accept a compromise
that would move the flag to a Confederate monument in front of the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote on the proposal, which passed the state Senate
last month, will probably come Wednesday. But in a preliminary
vote, 72 of the 120 House members accepted an amendment that on
July 1 would move a smaller version of the flag to a pole in front
of the Capitol's main entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the flag, all but 11 of whom were white
Republicans, succeeded in passing a proposal that would make the
flag more prominent, raising the size of the pole to 30 feet from
the 20 feet proposed by the Senate, and illuminating it at night.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of the body's deep racial divisions, none of the
House's 26 black members supported the amendment. Many black
members already opposed the Senate's proposal, saying that it kept
the Confederate flag in a position of prominence, and were even
more vehemently against the idea of making the flagpole taller and
lighting it up. The National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, which is conducting an economic boycott of the
state over the flag, also opposes the plan to move it to the
Confederate Soldier's monument.
</P>
<P>
   Black members, joined by many white Democrats, did support two
plans that were voted down by the majority: one to put a bronze
relief of the flag on a granite slab near the monument, and the
other to fly the flag on an ``avenue of flags'' adjacent to the
Capitol along with a series of other flags that have flown over
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   White supporters angrily denounced the bronze-relief plan as an
``insult'' to their heritage, and mustered the votes to defeat it
on a vote of 65-43.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Civil War was a big part of the history of the state, not
a small part, but huge,'' said Bill Cotty, a Republican from
Columbia. ``But this tombstone monument type of bill, you might as
well lower it down and give it perpetual care. You're saying, bury
that baby, get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   About 40 white members were opposed to moving the flag at all,
and one member, Jake Knotts of West Columbia, said he would prefer
that the Confederate flag fly above the United States and South
Carolina flags.
</P>
<P>
   Black legislators, all of whom are Democrats, said it was clear
that the Republican leadership of the House was doing everything
possible to make the flag extremely prominent once it comes down
from the dome, making the entire exercise of moving it essentially
meaningless. They said that putting a symbol of slavery at the
entrance to the Capitol was nearly as offensive as flying it on
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``They voted down every suggestion we made to put it in
historical context, and they're just trying to ram it down our
throats,'' said Todd Rutherford of Columbia. ``If they try to pass
this without any of our votes tomorrow, it will once again be a
case of the great white fathers knowing what's best for the
African-Americans of this state.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of the House, David Wilkins, said it appeared that
the House was moving toward the 30-foot flagpole provision, which
he supported. But he said Republicans in the House would not bear
all the weight of moving the flag; they will not support it in a
final vote if Democrats, and particularly black members, remain
opposed, he said.

LAWSUIT CHALLENGES BOSTON POLICE HIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In yet another assault on one of the last vestiges of
Boston's affirmative action efforts, a federal lawsuit was filed
Tuesday challenging the police department's practice of bypassing
white applicants to hire lower-scoring minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The suit filed by Bradley J. Donahue, 31, a white man who
applied for a job as an officer, says a 1973 federal consent decree
that required the police department to give preference to
minorities is no longer valid because more than 30 percent of the
city's uniformed officers are black or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   After each entrance exam, the state's personnel administrator
provides the police department with a list that includes the name
of one minority officer for every white officer, regardless of
their test scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courts around the country have said over and over again that
straight quotas are no longer constitutional,'' said attorney
Michael C. McLaughlin, who represents Donahue and who successfully
fought to overturn racial quotas at the city's three exam schools.
``It's fundamentally divisive. Granting benefits because of race or
holding someone back because of race is no different than racial
profiling.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit filed in US District Court comes just five months after
Boston Police Commissioner Paul F. Evans announced he was scrapping
a 19-year practice of promoting lower-scoring minority officers
over white officers.
</P>
<P>
   That shift came in response to a ruling last year by Suffolk
Superior Court Judge John Xifaras, who said that race should not be
a factor in police promotions.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a federal judge ruled that eight white Boston police
officers who were bypassed for promotion in favor of eight blacks
with the same test scores could proceed with their suit against the
state's personnel administrator.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1998, a federal appeals court ruled that the Boston
public schools use of race in admissions to the prestigious Boston
Latin School was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said the 1973 consent decree that settled a
discrimination complaint by minority police officers came at a time
when the Boston Police Department wasn't hiring minorities, who
then comprised about 2 percent of the force.
</P>
<P>
   But McLaughlin says times have changed and now whites are being
discriminated against by the old affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high moral ground of the old quotas is gone,'' said
McLaughlin. ``They're all falling one by one. The fundamental issue
here is if (Donahue) should get in on merit, then he should get in.
And if they are using a quota against him, it should stop. He just
wants to make sure he's treated fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Mary Jo Harris, who represents the police department,
said the department's hiring of officers is controlled by the
consent decree, which is supposed to remain in effect until the
level of minority representation on the force reaches parity with
the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not there yet,'' said Harris, adding that as of January
about 30 percent of the department's 2,400 uniformed officers were
minorities, about 5 or 6 percent shy of the overall percentage of
minorities in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Harris also noted that a federal appeals court upheld the
consent decree in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are one party among a number that are bound by the consent
decree,'' Harris said. ``Our legal obligation is to examine the
list in the order Civil Service gives it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The list provided to the police department by Civil Service
contains an equal number of minority and white officers and a
series of codes that reveal whether they have been given a
preference because they are minorities, veterans, disabled
veterans, or the children of officers who were killed in the line
of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue, who lives in Boston and commutes to his job as a police
officer in West Yarmouth, received no preference and wasn't hired.
He scored a 92 on the 1997 entrance exam and 96 on last year's
test.
</P>
<P>
   At least one minority officer who took the test with Donahue in
1997 and scored a 76 was hired, according to McLaughlin, who
complained that he's been unable to determine the scores of other
officers because the department has refused to disclose information
he has requested.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also names the City of Boston, Evans, James J. Hartnett
Jr., the state's personnel administrator, and a number of other
state officials.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that Donahue has been denied equal protection
under the law and his rights have been violated and urges a judge
to order the Boston Police Department to hire him as a student
officer and stop giving preference to minority applicants.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said he will argue that the consent decree is no
longer legal and it makes no difference whether the proportion of
minority officers on the force is now representative of the
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to go back to simple merit principles,'' McLaughlin
said. ``The consent decree was upheld in 1992, but I do not believe
it will be upheld now.''

 AFTER QUESTIONS ARISE, A HIGH-PROFILE eBAY DEAL IS POSTPONED  
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man who put a painting up for auction on the Internet for 25
cents and ended up making a $135,805 sale acknowledged Tuesday that
he concocted part of the story he used to describe the work and
said he would let the buyer out of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Before the bidding closed on Monday, speculation that the vivid
abstract work, which bore the initials ``RD,'' was by the
California artist Richard Diebenkorn set off a frenzy, though the
description never said who had painted the work.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth A. Walton, a lawyer in Sacramento who used the Internet
name ``golfpoorly'' in offering the painting on eBay, said he would
cancel the sale to Rob Keereweer of Nieuwkoop, the Netherlands,
which is legally binding, if experts determine that the canvas is
not by Diebenkorn and the buyer wants out.
</P>
<P>
   Walton, far from being a married homeowner who cleaned the
painting out of his garage to please his wife, is single and has
sold a raft of paintings on eBay, where he also uses the Internet
name ``advice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a heck of a ride,'' he said. Since The New York
Times reported the sale, he added, ``I've had people ringing my
doorbell, calling me late at night and calling my family.''
</P>
<P>
   But Walton said that he had not faked the painting or added the
signature. He said he was only trying to raise cash to finance his
new law practice by reselling works he bought cheaply at estate
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Walton and Keereweer spoke by phone Tuesday evening and, after
Walton acknowledged that he had ``made up a little story to go with
the painting,'' the two decided to put off the transaction
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will bring in an expert opinion from the outside before
finalizing the deal,'' Keereweer said from his home in the
Netherlands. ``Both he and I want to be sure. If it is authentic,
then we will proceed _ that's a fair deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton, who using the name ``advice'' is currently listing four
other paintings in eBay auctions that close on Friday, has run into
trouble selling art over the Internet before. Last summer, he
offered an unattributed Impressionistic work that bore a signature
``P. Gray,'' but again made no claims for its authorship. Thinking
it was by Henry Percy Gray, a California painter known for his
oak-laden landscapes, Michael Luther, a Nebraska businessman,
agreed to pay $7,600 for it, sent a check and received the
painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an amateur painting; it was garbage,'' Luther said.
``We put a black light on it and the signature swam on the paint,''
indicating that it was added long after the painting itself was
completed. ``I wrote a letter saying I'd sue, and he e-mailed me
back saying that he was an attorney and that he would fight back.''
</P>
<P>
   Luther has not filed suit, however. ``I've forgotten about it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such tales _ especially those involving sums like $135,805 _
certainly illustrate the perils of buying art online, but some
lawyers said that Walton probably stands on solid ground if Luther
sues. ``The definition of fraud on the Internet is no different
than in the offline world,'' said Susan Crawford, an expert in
e-commerce law at Wilmer, Cutler &AMP; Pickering in Washington. A party
who feels wronged in an auction on a site like eBay, which does not
vouch for the authenticity of sellers' merchandise, can prevail
legally only if the seller makes materially false statements in the
item's description, several lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   When he offered the painting signed ``P. Gray,'' Walton said he
did not make up a story. He bought the work at an estate sale, he
said, and made no changes to it. ``I absolutely never added a
signature to a painting _ that's totally untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether or not, in the case of the $135,805
painting, the fact that Walton is not married and does not have a
child who put a hole in it _ things he said in his offer _ is
material information that affected the decisions of potential
buyers. ``It looks like he was intending to confuse people,''
Crawford said, ``but it would be up to a judge.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Walton, 32, insisted that he had, as he said online, bought the
work at a garage sale in Berkeley. At the time, in the mid-'90s, he
was a law student at the University of California's Hastings School
of Law in San Francisco. ``I can't remember what I paid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walton also said that he has never sold anything as potentially
valuable as the painting bid on by Keereweer, which ``golfpoorly''
had described as a ``great big wild abstract painting'' that he
kept in his garage because his wife would not allow it in the
house.
</P>
<P>
   The 33 paintings he has sold on eBay since March 30 as
``advice'' fetched a total of $5,766.62, with the biggest price
being $697 for a what he described as a ``FINE Impressionist Oil _
Nude Bathing Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bidding on the four items currently on the site, a
painting he described as an ``OUTSTANDING ESTATE OIL _ ARABS ON
HORSEBACK,'' has gone highest, $1,100 Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Walton said he has made something of a hobby going to estate and
garage sales on weekends to search out paintings because he is
trying to raise money to start a private law practice. Until about
six months ago, he worked at Kronick, Moskovitz, Tiedemann &AMP; Girard
in Sacramento, but he said he left because he wanted to work in
copyright, intellectual property and trademark law, an area related
to his brothers' employment in the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to start a law practice and it's tough,'' he said.
``I don't come from a family with money, and I spend my time on
weekends going around to estate sales and buying paintings,'' he
said. ``I can find these paintings for $20 to $30 a pop and put
them up on eBay and get $300. If you think that's nefarious.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton declined to say how much he has made this way. He has
used the name ``advice'' on eBay since November 1998 and
``golfpoorly'' since last August. Because records for eBay sellers
are accessible for only 30 days, it is impossible to determine a
total for Walton during that entire period.``I made not that much
last year and this year it's more,'' Walton said. He said that no
one other than Luther had attempted to return a painting.
</P>
<P>
   Keereweer, a managing director of a software company who turns
43 next week, said that he had discovered eBay about seven weeks
ago. Since he began collecting art about 15 years ago, he has
focused on American and European art from 1900 to 1960, and owns
works by Arshile Gorky and Franz Kline, among others. But since he
had the first of two sons four years ago, he said, ``it's hard to
find the time to go to auctions and galleries.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend told him of eBay. ``I started to look for things,'' he
said, ``and I have bought seven or eight things,'' including works
by Leger, Alex Jawlensky and Mondrian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't received them all yet, but what I bought was OK,''
Keereweer said.

CHARLIE BROWN GETS ONE MORE CHANCE TO KICK THE BALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alone in his studio in Santa Rosa, Calif., drafting his final
Peanuts comic strips, Charles Schulz blurted it out for an audience
of no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good grief,'' he said, ``that little kid is (set
ital)never(end ital) going to get to kick that football.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz himself related the incident to Lee Mendelson, his friend
and TV collaborator of 37 years, shortly before Schulz died in
February.
</P>
<P>
   The little kid, of course, is Charlie Brown, the Schulz creation
who's honored Wednesday night in a CBS special, ``Here's to You,
Charlie Brown: 50 Great Years!''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie was destined always to have the football whisked away at
the last moment by Lucy Van Pelt, but he will get gridiron pointers
in the special from Joe Montana.
</P>
<P>
   That, and baseball pointers from Willie Mays and Yankees manager
Joe Torre, as well as a musical tribute from Faith Hill. The
one-hour special is hosted by the ubiquitous Whoopi Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   The special, which has the bad fortune of being scheduled
opposite ABC's equally ubiquitous ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' isn't a Schulz retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS tribute to Schulz aired in February. Wednesday's special,
in the works since last year, was designed as a 50th anniversary
homage to Charlie Brown and his Peanuts pals. Mendelson said Schulz
was involved in planning the show.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be the last original TV special in a string of 46.
Another project, called ``It's the Pied Piper, Charlie Brown,'' is
to debut later this year on home video, then land on television
later.
</P>
<P>
   While holiday perennials such as ``A Charlie Brown Christmas''
and ``The Great Pumpkin'' apparently have an infinite life span,
Mendelson said Schulz's family will have to decide whether to
sanction any more new TV specials.
</P>
<P>
   Though colon cancer forced Schulz to give up his comic strip _
the last new Peanuts was published in newspapers the day after he
died _ Mendelson said Schulz intended to oversee more television
specials.
</P>
<P>
   Mendelson's association with Schulz stretches back to 1963.
Mendelson had produced a documentary about Willie Mays and figured
that since he'd examined the world's best baseball player, he might
as well try to bring the worst baseball player, Charlie Brown, to
TV as well.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz acquiesced, though the resulting show was shelved for
several years for lack of a sponsor. CBS' ``A Charlie Brown
Christmas'' finally got Schulz and the Peanuts gang onto network
TV, in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Mendelson, now 67, eventually grew accustomed to the
hour-and-40-minute drive north from his home in Hillsborough, south
of San Francisco, to Sonoma County to confer with Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Schulz and executive producer Mendelson, the
regular Peanuts TV team included Los Angeles-based animator Bill
Melendez and, until his death in 1976, composer and jazz artist
Vince Guaraldi, recommended to Schulz by Chronicle critic Ralph
Gleason.
</P>
<P>
   There was no regular voice for Charlie Brown. Mendelson said
real children were hired to give voice to the Peanuts cast, which
meant turnover every few years. He said the originals are now in
their 40s.
</P>
<P>
   Mendelson said he knew Schulz as a man of disciplined habits,
great curiosity and pride disguised by shyness.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz's neighbors knew his weekday routine well. There would be
coffee, a pastry and The Chronicle in the coffee shop at Schulz's
Redwood Empire Ice Arena in Santa Rosa, after which he'd head for
his studio up the street to work on Peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he remembered most about Schulz, Mendelson said, ``It
was his curiosity. He read books avidly. He went to movies. He went
to stage shows. He questioned everyone: `Why did you get into what
you do, and what do you like about it?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, he was very competitive, whether it was tennis, or golf,
or the comic strip. He wanted to win. Did you know that at one time
he was a 7-handicap golfer? He was basically a shy man, but
internally he was a competitor. He once said to me that he was a
humble egotist.''
</P>
<P>
   The veneer of humility probably sprang from Schulz's Midwestern
roots. He was a Minnesotan, and Minnesotans tend to mix their
competence with self-effacement and a sense of fatalism.
</P>
<P>
   In his heart, said Mendelson, Schulz knew that he'd created the
world's best comic strip. No one is about to whip that football
away from him.

FORD, CARTER JOIN CLINTON IN SUPPORTING CHINA TRADE BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Flanked by a bipartisan cast of elder statesmen,
President Clinton Tuesday warned that failure by Congress to
approve permanent normal trade relations with China will only end
up hurting the United States economically.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we vote for this, 10 years from now we will wonder why this
was a hard fight,'' Clinton said at a White House event attended by
former Presidents Ford and Carter and former Secretaries of State
Henry Kissinger and James A. Baker III. ``And if Congress votes
against it, they'll be kicking themselves in the rear 10 years from
now because America will be paying the price.''
</P>
<P>
   The president brought out the all-star group as he intensified
his effort to convince lawmakers to ease trading relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote on the China trade bill scheduled for later this
month is expected to be close, with many members of the president's
party opposed to the measure.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest tally by the Reuters news agency, 161
House members have said they were supporting or leaning toward
voting for the trade measure, 57 votes short of the 218 needed to
clear the 435-member House. Ninety-seven lawmakers said they are
undecided and 163 have indicated they are opposed to the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The trade measure is expected to pass the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is opposed by human rights advocates and
organized labor, who fear that American jobs will be replaced by
cheap Chinese labor.
</P>
<P>
   However, business and agriculture interests have backed an
improved trade relationship, saying it will open up a lucrative
overseas market to their products.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton and others have argued that the trade deal would be
a boost to the U.S. economy. The president said that even if
Congress doesn't approve the deal, China still will join the World
Trade Organization, which will ease its ability to trade with Japan
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition of unions to the trade pact has put Vice
President Al Gore in a difficult position because he is relying on
organized labor's members and money to help in his presidential
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore showed up at the White House event and stood with
Clinton to strongly endorse the China trade pact, arguing ``it is
right for American jobs. It is right for the cause of reform in
China and I believe it will move us closer to the strong and stable
world community we all seek to create.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on their experience with China over the past decades,
the former presidents and Cabinet officials acknowledged human
rights abuses in China. But they said the United States would be in
a better position to encourage change in China by trading with the
huge Asian powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooperative relations with China are in the American national
interest,'' said Kissinger, who helped engineer President Nixon's
trip to China _ a seminal event that helped thaw relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who noted that he first voted for a China trade agreement
as a House member in the 1940s, said the measure's defeat would be
``catastrophic, disastrous to American agriculture, electronics,
telecommunications, autos and countless other products and
services.''
</P>
<P>
   And Carter, who has championed human rights issues around the
world, noted that most Chinese human rights advocates approve of
better trade relations between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``China still has not measured up to the human rights and
democracy standards and labor standards of America, but there is no
doubt in my mind that a negative vote on this issue in the Congress
will be a serious setback and impediment for the further
democratization, freedom and human rights in China,'' said Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who served as secretary of state in the Bush
administration, noted that over the years there has been bipartisan
support for improving trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush was unable to attend the White House
event, although administration officials were quick to note that he
backed the China trade bill.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While American courts struggle over the recording industry's
challenge to digital music swapping, Ian Clarke, a 23-year-old
Irish programmer, is moving on to the next battleground. He is
finishing a program that he claims will make it impossible to
control the traffic in any kind of digital information _ whether it
is music, video, text or software.
</P>
<P>
   His program, known as Freenet, is intended to make it possible
to acquire or exchange such material anonymously while frustrating
any attempt to remove the information from the Internet or
determine its source.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke and his group of programmers have deliberately set
themselves on a collision course with the world's copyright laws.
They express the hope that the clash over copyright enforcement in
cyberspace will produce a world in which all information is freely
shared. In any case, the new programs could change the basic terms
of the discussion about intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   The swapping of music files over the Internet, through services
with names like Napster and MP3.com, has already raised the hackles
and mobilized the lawyers of the recording industry and some
musicians, who say the practice amounts to piracy. They hope either
to halt the services or to collect royalties on the digital works
being swapped.
</P>
<P>
   But programs now emerging make it possible to find and acquire
files without reference to a central database, and thus provide no
single target for aggrieved copyright holders. And methods being
developed to protect such works _ like scrambling the data and
requiring a key to decode it _ may wind up being trumped by similar
encryption that covers the tracks of those doing the swapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this whole thing catches on,'' Clarke remarked, ``I think
that people will look back in 20 to 40 years and look at the idea
that you can own information in the same way as gold or real estate
in the same way we look at witch-burning today.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups and companies pursuing the new distribution
technologies _ programs that in effect create vast digital
libraries spread across potentially hundreds of thousands of large
and small computers _ do not necessarily share Clarke's ideological
viewpoint. They range from iMesh, an Israeli-American start-up
company that aspires to become an international commercial digital
distribution system, to several small groups of free software
developers intent on building new systems for the sharing of any
kind of digital information.
</P>
<P>
   Some contend that if their software lends itself to copyright
infringement, it is the user's responsibility, not theirs. Clarke,
putting into practice a view expressed by many in the free-software
movement, takes the more extreme position that copyright protection
is simply obsolete in the Internet era.
</P>
<P>
   The test version of his Freenet program _ written in England and
now distributed free to many countries around the world _ was
posted on the World Wide Web in March.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, who lives in London and works for a small electronic
commerce company, said last week in a telephone interview that
there had been more than 15,000 downloads of the early versions of
his product, indicating that hundreds or perhaps thousands of
network servers on the Web were already running the program.
</P>
<P>
   Any file that any user wants to offer to others can be made
available through the system. So far, that includes software
programs, video pornography and a copy of George Orwell's ``1984.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke said he was confident that corporations trying to develop
complex technologies to encrypt information or otherwise halt the
free sharing of computer data will ultimately fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two words for these companies: give up,'' he said.
``There is no way they are going to stop these technologies. They
are trying to plug holes in a dam that is about to burst.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude, plus the fact that millions of users have come to
rely on easy access to digital information via the Internet,
suggests that the issue may quickly outstrip the current debate
over copyright infringement between the recording industry
association and a variety of Internet music distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no shortage of gray hairs from worrying about these
programs,'' said Talal Shamoon, a Silicon Valley executive who
heads the Secure Digital Music Initiative, a technology and
entertainment industry working group.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts believe that the intellectual property laws
are being used in an effort to grapple with technologies they were
never intended to address.
</P>
<P>
   ``Copyright law is not the right tool in the case of many of the
new technologies,'' said Pamela Samuelson, a digital technology and
copyright expert at the laws school of the University of California
at Berkeley. ``The question will quickly become whether other
governments have reasons to try to regulate these new systems or
whether the U.S. government has the ability to regulate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials are only beginning to wrestle with the
implications of new technologies that will permit the anonymous,
instant, global distribution of information of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously looking at all of these,'' said Christopher
Painter, deputy chief of the Justice Department's computer crime
and intellectual property section. ``It makes our job more
difficult and makes it harder to find the people who are
perpetrating crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Freenet, which Clarke conceived while he was an undergraduate at
the University of Edinburgh, is intended to function without any
centralized control point. ``Freenet is a near-perfect anarchy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet digital distribution program, Gnutella, created
by software developers at the Nullsoft subsidiary of America
Online, has the same distributed approach employed by Freenet,
meaning that there is no central directory of what information the
system contains.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Napster, which is limited to digital music files,
Gnutella makes it possible to distribute video, software and text
documents as well.
</P>
<P>
   America Online declared Gnutella an ``unauthorized freelance
project'' in March, just hours after it was made available on the
Internet. But since its developers made its code freely available,
independent programmers have continued to refine Gnutella even
though the project was officially canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Many computer industry executives contend that if the recording
industry's suit against Napster succeeds, it will simply lead
digital-music enthusiasts to use alternatives, like Gnutella and
Freenet, which are even less open to copyright enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``So are all the musicians and record companies going to
continue their suits against Napster?'' a Gnutella user who
identified himself as Panicst8 wrote in a recent network posting.
``It seems kind of pointless, or have they just not figured out yet
that Gnutella is about 10,000 times more effective at locating what
you want?''
</P>
<P>
   Freenet goes several steps beyond Gnutella in an effort to
protect the anonymity of those who publish or copy information
electronically. It encrypts each file and scrambles the key _
actually a long number _ needed to find the file within the system.
And Freenet incorporates a digital ``immune system'' that responds
to any effort to determine the location of a piece of information
by spreading the information elsewhere in the network.
</P>
<P>
   Freenet relies on a system of volunteers who run the program on
network computers, or servers, Clarke said, and it will even be
difficult for the operators of individual parts of the network to
determine which computer holds any particular file.
</P>

   For the moment, at least, copyright holders can take comfort
from the fact that Freenet is more efficient at obscuring the
source of information than at helping users find it. Clarke has not
yet built a search capability into the system, so users must find
other ways to let one another know how to retrieve files.
</P>
<P>
   And technologists like Shamoon say systems like Freenet present
a challenge, but not an insurmountable one. In addition to his
industry role with the Secure Digital Music Initiative, Shamoon is
senior vice president for media at the InterTrust Technologies
Corp., a Silicon Valley company that builds systems for protecting
intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   He cites the possibility of the transmission of viruses and
other harmful programs as being one of the obvious risks inherent
in electronic communities where no basis for trust inherently
exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a trust standpoint, the current generation of tools such
as Gnutella and Freenet are a nightmare for the same reason that
badly constructed social communities are a nightmare,'' Shamoon
said. The recording industry will survive, he argues, if it is able
to offer its users new things of value.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of dangers here,'' he said. ``But as a
society, we're very adept at adapting to compensate for these
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, it seems, would not disagree. Citing past innovations
from the photocopier to magnetic tape, he writes on his Web site:
``Artists and publishers all adapted to those new technologies and
learned how to use them and profit from them; they will adapt to
Freenet as well.''

CALIFORNIA LAWSUIT BLOCKS RETURN OF BOY TO THAILAND
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)  By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Members of the Thai community here blocked the
return a 2-year-old boy to Thailand on Tuesday as they sought
custody safeguards similar to those afforded Elian Gonzalez, the
Cuban boy whose case has inflamed passions in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The child, Phanupong Khaisri, was taken into custody on April 11
by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which said he was
being used as a decoy by a smuggling ring bringing women into the
United States. The boy had arrived in Los Angeles under a false
name with a man and women pretending to be his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates representing the child said they feared that sending
him back to Thailand without more investigation could put him in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai government, working with the immigration service, had
intended to return the boy to Thailand on Tuesday. But advocates
refused to give the boy to Thai officials and filed suit in federal
court in Los Angeles to delay his return. The boy had been placed
with a social worker through the Thai Community Development Center,
a nonprofit organization that serves Thai residents in Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, the boy's mother was sold into sexual
slavery at the age of 12, and Phanupong had been in the care of his
maternal grandmother until February, when his mother sold him for
about $260. It is believed that he had been used as a decoy at
least two other times.
</P>
<P>
   The father, according to the lawsuit, had contracted HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS, and had committed suicide when the boy was
just a few months old.
</P>
<P>
   Although the paternal grandparents have agreed to adopt
Phanupong, advocates for the boy said they believed the case was
being rushed in a way that could further traumatize him.
</P>
<P>
   They said they feared that the boy would be placed in an
orphanage while his adoption was processed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the widespread nature of corruption, bribery and child
trafficking in Thailand, we are very concerned that unless custody
is transferred to his paternal grandparents he may find himself
back in the stream of illicit child trafficking once again,'' said
Peter A. Schey, president of the Center for Human Rights and
Constitutional Law, who filed the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit asked that the immigration service provide a formal
hearing before the boy leaves the country, that his parole status
be extended temporarily if the request is not granted and that he
be given temporary asylum while custodial arrangements are made
final.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The suit was filed in behalf of Phanupong and the social worker,
Chutima Vucharatavintara.
</P>
<P>
   Schey said the U.S. Attorney's office had agreed to try to
resolve the case in the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Gavin, a spokeswoman for the immigration service, said
officials had been working with the Thai government to assure the
boy's safe return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all working toward the same goal: to ensure the safety
and well being of the young boy,'' Gavin said.
</P>
<P>
   She said technically the boy had been paroled to the custody of
the Thai government, giving it the authority to determine when he
was returned.
</P>
<P>
   But the Thai consul general in Los Angeles, Piyawat Niyom-rerks,
said it was up to the immigration service to determine when the
child should be returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not angry,'' Niyom-rerks said of the lawsuit. ``I know
they mean well to the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Chanchanit Martorell, executive director of the Thai Community
Development Center, said that given the child's background and what
he had been through, extra care was needed in the transition to a
new home.
</P>
<P>
   Phanupong had to be hospitalized for an ear infection and the
flu for a week after he arrived in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the boy question why the type of scrutiny that was
given to Elian Gonzalez, whose father was interviewed and brought
to the United States, was not being given to this child.
</P>
<P>
   They speculate that the United States is less inclined to go
against a country it shares political and economic ties with, as
opposed to a country like Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   While there are few similarities between the two cases,
Phanupong has no relatives in the United States and no one is
seeking permanent residency for him, advocates feel that his case
should have been given similar scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian has been treated with kid gloves by the attorney
general, the INS and the president,'' Schey said. ``This child is
being treated completely different.''

LIBERTIES: BIG PICTURE, LITTLE PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ W. may have gone too far this time.
</P>
<P>
   Americans can forgive him not knowing that Gen. Pervez Musharraf
seized power in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   But can we forgive him not knowing that Sarah Jessica Parker
quaffs Cosmopolitans in Manhattan?
</P>
<P>
   So he thinks the Taliban is a rock band. We can live with that.
But he's never heard of ``Sex and the City''?
</P>
<P>
   Now there's an ominous lacuna. Americans actually care about TV.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter for Glamour magazine, David France, interviewed Bush
on ``women's issues'' by playing a game of ``verbal Rorschach'':
``I was rattling off names and concepts, and he was telling me the
first thought that came to his mind.'' (W. still likes to live
dangerously.)
</P>
<P>
   France said ``Phyllis Schlafly.'' Bush replied ``Icon of the
conservative right.'' France said ``Madonna.'' Bush replied, ``I'm
not into pop music.'' France said ``Gloria Steinem.'' Bush replied,
``Uh, pioneer.''
</P>
<P>
   France said ``Sex and the City.'' Bush's face ``blistered in a
purple fury,'' and his eyes narrowed and glowered. The candidate
clearly thought he was being challenged on his claim of monogamy or
support of teen-age abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Johndroe, Bush's press aide, tried to clear up the
confusion. ``Governor,'' he said, ``it's an HBO television show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been on the campaign trail,'' Johndroe told France
apologetically.
</P>
<P>
   But even when the governor is home, he told me in an interview
last October, he doesn't go out to the movies or watch much TV _
except sports. He doesn't ordinarily look at political talk shows
or late-night comics or network series or TV movies, or even zap
around with his ``flicker,'' as he calls it, to get a feel for what
the country's talking about.
</P>
<P>
   He may be the only Regis virgin left in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Culturally adrift,'' he cheerfully confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are brainy about global issues are often not up on pop
culture. And those who know about the Wu-Tang Clan may not know the
intricacies of the World Trade Organization. But it's rare to get
someone who has zero curiosity about either the big picture or the
little picture.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has Condi Rice and a raft of coaches to prop him up on
foreign affairs. But, as Broderick Crawford said of Judy Holliday's
Billie Dawn in ``Born Yesterday,'' who's going to buy the kid some
culture?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to imagine how further free-associating on prime time
could get the guy in all sorts of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Wing''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Next stop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Law and Order''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't get enough of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Simpsons''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan and Ann are good folks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mad About You''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope all the women voters are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NYPD Blue''?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Rudy's problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``La Femme Nikita''?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Putin's problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Night''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Walker, Texas Ranger''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Made some money. Sold the team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy Meets World''?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't play gotcha with drug questions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Queen Latifah''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethiopia?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pretender''?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough primary, but I've always respected John.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened and he listened. And now we've got a good
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Animals Attack''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad Pat Buchanan left the party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies Man''?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's leaving. I'll restore honor to the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Access Hollywood''?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Democratic money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffy''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncle Bucky's wife.''

   ``I'm a better person for meeting with those Log Cabin
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just Shoot Me''?

<P>
   ``Your questions weren't so bad. A little psychoanalytic. A

TRYING TO KEEP THE SUN FROM SETTING ON BRITPOP 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release, Sunday, May 14) 
 By JODY ROSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though England has long since come to terms with the political
reality of its empire's demise, remembered glory still haunts the
national imagination and reverberates in the country's popular
culture: in the flag-fluttering pomp that greets royal weddings, in
the blaring jingoism of the tabloid press, in the chants, to the
tune of ``Rule Britannia,'' which rumble down from the terraces of
soccer stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Yearning for the grandeur of England's yesteryear exists even in
the youth-obsessed realm of pop music. English pop has its own
version of a venerated imperial heyday: the mid-1960s peak of the
British Invasion. On the one hand, the era is a symbol of British
cultural triumph: the moment when the Beatles, the Kinks, the Who
and other seminal bands stampeded onto the American charts and
established London as the home of the pop zeitgeist.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the music itself that resonates with modern Britain's
fondest and most sentimental self-image. Its wonderfully rich mix
of psychedelia and Victoriana, of fuzz-toned rock guitars and
French horn fanfares, of visionary anthems and quaintly provincial
evocations of village greens, conjures a fairytale England in which
the boundlessly sunny present and the charmed past magically
coexist.
</P>
<P>
   For a few years in the mid-1990s, the English pop scene was
consumed by the desire to relive that hallowed musical era.
Guitarists sprouted mop-top hairdos, Union Jacks were hoisted above
drum-risers and a wave of young bands flooded the airwaves with
records whose jaunty, tuneful Anglicisms self-consciously invoked
the legacy of the '60s greats.
</P>
<P>
   Flaunting classically English pop qualities _ wry lyrics,
winsome melodies, exaggerated cockney-inflected vocals _ the trend
was a defiantly Anglocentric rebuke to the grunts and macho poses
of the American grunge bands that were dominating guitar pop: the
chiming, cheery sound of the empire striking back.
</P>
<P>
   The movement, christened Britpop, swept up English pop culture
in a whirl of music-inspired patriotism. When American bands
resuscitate old styles, it is usually to make fashion statements.
But the flag-toting fervor of the Britpop revival was something
more serious. Against a backdrop of domestic uncertainty _ a
floundering British economy, anxiety about joining the European
Union, political weariness after nearly two decades under
Conservative government _ Britpop offered an image of cultural
renewal, promising not merely to resurrect the giddy cool of
swinging London circa 1966 but to recapture some deeper lost
essence of British greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Half a decade later, England has conspicuously abandoned the
Britpop cause.
</P>
<P>
   The music press long ago declared the movement dead. Most of
Britpop's upstarts have disappeared, dropping off the radar when
their borrowed riffs and blokey histrionics fell out of fashion.
Britain's latest guitar pop favorites strike different postures:
quavering earnestness (Radiohead, Travis), Americana obsessed
(Gomez), techno-savvy (Beta Band) or, in the case of the reformed
ex-Britpop torchbearers Blur, a bit of all three.
</P>
<P>
   But traditionalist stalwarts remain. Two veteran Britpop bands,
Oasis and Supergrass, are currently in the United States, touring
behind new albums steeped in English pop classicism. Now several
years removed from the peak moment of Britpop hysteria, the records
provide insight into why the movement flared and fizzled, and are a
study in Britpop's limitations and possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Oasis was Britpop's marquee act.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the scowling, leering Gallagher brothers _ the lead
singer Liam and the guitarist-songwriter Noel _ the band arrived on
the British charts in 1994 with a bombastic sound and a grandiose
aspiration: to be ``bigger than the Beatles.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Britpop groups like Blur, Pulp and Gene embraced the
literate, arty aspect of the English pop tradition, Oasis offered
visceral pleasures: crunching guitars and the catharsis of soaring
choruses. In Liam Gallagher, the band had a bona fide rock star,
who put across his brother's often meaningless lyrics with gruff
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``(What's The Story) Morning Glory?,'' Oasis' second album, sold
15 million copies, but the band never managed a Beatles-like
conquest of global pop. Its third record bombed, and the recently
released fourth, ``Standing on the Shoulder of Giants'' (Epic
EK63586), a collection of rhythmically turgid, mid-tempo retro-rock
songs, finds Oasis slipping into wearisome self-parody.
</P>
<P>
   The root of Oasis' problem is the same misapprehension that
vexed so many of its Britpop compatriots: a failure to comprehend
the urbanity of classic English pop. The music of the British
Invasion might sound quintessentially English to today's listeners,
but its creators were cosmopolitan seekers, who assimilated a range
of influences _ in particular black American music _ into their own
very personal styles.
</P>
<P>
   Oasis professes devotion to the Beatles, but the band's gloss on
its heroes is shallow. Though it endlessly cribs the Beatles'
mannerisms _ announcing the gravity of its ballads with stately
``Hey Jude''-like piano chords, even co-opting famous Beatles
lyrics _ Oasis has absorbed none of its idols' zeal for musical
exploration. The Gallagher brothers traveled far on the momentum of
their bluster, but with ``Standing on the Shoulder of Giants'' the
band reaches the same dead end as a hundred Britpop lesser-lights:
worshiping vapidly at the altar of the past, Oasis consigns itself
to present-day irrelevance.
</P>
<P>
   Supergrass, a rugged trio from Oxford, never dared to dream
Oasis-size dreams of rock glory. But its musical ambitions have
always been vast. When the band first appeared in 1994, playing
funny, taut songs that combined the stuttering tenacity of the
Manchester punk legends the Buzzcocks with the wit of songwriters
like Ray Davies of the Kinks, Supergrass quickly gained a
reputation as Britpop's lovable clown princes. But even the band's
most cartoonish songs, like its breakthrough single ``Caught by the
Fuzz,'' were constructed with orchestral intelligence _ every burst
of feedback, guitar overdub and background vocal was witty, telling
and exact.
</P>
<P>
   On its third album, ``Supergrass'' (Island 314-542 388-2), the
band's promise is splendidly realized. Augmenting its power trio
line-up with keyboards and a small string section, the
singer-guitarist Gaz Coombes, the bassist Mick Quinn and the
drummer Danny Goffey have made an almost epic album, integrating a
riot of influences into an organic and highly eccentric
contemporary variation on classic British guitar pop. Avoiding the
pratfalls of their peers, Supergrass treats Britpop not as an
ideology or a kind of connoisseurship but as an approach to
songcraft. The result is one of the best English pop records in
many years. (MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Supergrass has a command of a variety of pop styles, which it
moves between with easy virtuosity. The band plays passages of Sly
and the Family Stone-inspired funk, dreamy guitar arpeggios that
sound like Pink Floyd, rave-ups in the style of glam-era David
Bowie; it changes tempos and time signatures like a '70s
progressive rock band and sings lonesome high-harmony parts that
recall Brian Wilson's Beach Boys.
</P>
<P>
   But Supergrass has such a strong musical personality and such a
lucid sense of purpose that the record never feels like pastiche:
every arrangement and production flourish is made in the service of
a song. The stunning album opener, ``Moving,'' is a case in point.
The song starts out with Coombes crooning, accompanied only by
guitar and strings, erupts into a churning, manic R-and-B chorus,
then morphs into a lush Philadelphia soul-style ballad.
</P>
<P>
   But this stylistic hodgepodge feels just right: each musical
passage gives its accompanying lyric the perfect coloration, and
the listener feels the overarching mood of road-bound resignation
in the loping bass line that nudges the song through its wistful
fade.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Supergrass'' is, unmistakably, a record in the Britpop
tradition, it never indulges in genre cliches. When Oasis tries to
spike its new album with psychedelia, the group trots out shopworn
trippy motifs _ walls of echo and guitar reverb, sitar drones,
woozy keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   Supergrass' psychedelia, like the Beatles', grades into the
baroque; it is intrinsic, textural, symphonic _ an accumulation of
sonic details, bristling beneath unusual melodies, that reward
solitary listeners with sharp ears and a good set of headphones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supergrass'' is the album that the mid-'90s Britpop movement
promised but never delivered. Smart, inventive, melodically rich,
rambunctious yet subtle, ambitious but totally unpretentious, it
distills the best qualities of classic English pop and makes an
emphatic argument for the idiom's continued vitality. Half a decade
after the musical patriots packed up their flags, Supergrass has
given England a reason to wave them. ``Britpop'' is dead; long live
Britpop. &QR;

   WASHINGTON _ A V-22 Osprey crashed on a training mission in
Arizona last month because the pilot was bringing the aircraft down
for a landing so fast that its helicopter rotors encountered the
turbulence they created beneath themselves, and one of the two
rotors lost lift as a result, the Marine Corps said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the finding at a news conference, Lt. Gen. Fred
McCorkle, assistant chief of staff for Marine aviation, said
investigators ``have found no mechanical or software failures''
that might have caused the crash, which killed all 19 people aboard
the Osprey, a tilt-wing craft that takes off and lands like a
helicopter but cruises like a fixed-wing plane.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said an analysis of the crash showed that the Osprey
had been descending too quickly, McCorkle declined to attribute it
to pilot error, noting that the investigation was still under way.
</P>
<P>
   The crash occurred little more than four weeks ago, far less
than the months it typically takes the Defense Department to make
information about crash inquiries public. But in the case of the
Osprey, which has been in development for 20 years, the Pentagon is
eager to resume flights in order to prepare for full-scale
production of the craft this fall. McCorkle said the Marines were
``rock solid'' on plans to resume Osprey flights soon, probably on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the $44-million-each Osprey has a long and
controversial history, Pentagon officials defended it emphatically
Tuesday. They said the crash was not related to the aircraft's
hybrid nature and could have happened to any helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the third for the Osprey. The first, in June 1991,
injured two people and was traced to incorrect wiring. The second,
a year later, killed all seven aboard and was caused by an engine
fire that in turn resulted from a leak of gear-box oil.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent crash, on April 7 at a small airport in Marana,
Ariz., near Tucson, occurred on a mission in which Marines were
training for evacuations. The Osprey's builders _ Boeing, Bell
Textron and Allison Engine _ have described it as particularly well
suited to evacuation missions, since it has a range that is
characteristic of a fixed-wing plane but does not need a runway. It
can carry 18 to 24 troops.
</P>
<P>
   The craft that crashed was the second of a pair of Ospreys that
were to land at Marana, and investigators are still looking at an
alternative to their belief that the accident was caused by a
descent that was too rapid. This other possibility is that
turbulence from the first Osprey interfered with the second. As a
result of the crash, the Marines have ordered that for the time
being, Ospreys stay at least 200 feet from each other horizontally
and that one not descend within 50 feet in front of another.
</P>
<P>
   But McCorkle said the investigators thought that the pilot had
simply been flying the craft ``outside the flight envelope.'' The
Osprey was descending at a rate of more than 1,000 feet a minute,
and is not supposed to exceed 800 feet a minute when the forward
speed is less than 40 knots. According to the investigators, the
Osprey that crashed was moving forward at a speed of less than 40
knots in the five-second period before the crash. (At higher
forward speeds, a helicopter can avoid the downdraft created by its
rotors.)
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle said the doomed Osprey had entered a ``vortex ring
state,'' in which the rotor blades were circulating disturbed air
and failing to generate lift. At higher altitudes, a pilot can cut
power to move forward faster and escape a vortex. But data from
on-board recorders indicate that when the Osprey dropped below 40
knots of forward speed, it was less than 350 feet above the ground.
The pilot banked the craft slightly to the right to refine his
course, and then the right rotor lost lift and the Osprey flipped
over.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle said it would be ``very inappropriate'' to attribute
the crash to pilot error until the board of inquiry could determine
why the craft had been descending so fast. He suggested that the
pilot might have deviated from his plan earlier on and descended
too slowly, and was now trying to catch up, to touch down the
proper distance from the lead Osprey.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle said the pilot, Maj. John A. Brow, 39, was ``highly
experienced,'' although he had logged only 85 hours in the Osprey,
plus 100 hours in an Osprey simulator.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, McCorkle said he did not know whether
the Osprey simulator used for training had been programmed to
reproduce the vortex ring effect. But investigators found that the
programming was insufficient to re-create the accident on the
simulator, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When flights resume, he said, one task will be to take the
Osprey to high altitudes, from which recovery is possible, and
force it into the vortex ring state to see how it performs.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in a demonstration of the Pentagon's confidence in
the Osprey, Gen. Jim Jones, the commandant of the Marine Corps, and
Gen. Mike Ryan, the chief of staff of the Air Force, which also
uses the craft, had volunteered to be first when the Ospreys resume
carrying passengers.

ACCELERATING GROWTH HAS FORCED JANUS TO CLOSE THREE FUNDS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Colo., N.Y.)  By DANNY HAKIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Popularity has its complications.
</P>
<P>
   Under an onslaught of money from investors, Janus said Tuesday
that it would close three funds, including the $42 billion Janus
Worldwide, the nation's largest fund with an international bent.
The closings would become effective Wednesday. (Existing
shareholders would still be able to add to their positions.)
</P>
<P>
   The move, a year after the company shuttered the popular $35.4
billion Janus Twenty, means that nearly half of Janus' 15 equity
funds would be closed to new shareholders. Such closings are a
common practice in the industry to keep the assets in any given
fund from growing too large to be effectively managed.
</P>
<P>
   The last 16 months have brought great success to Janus, the
Denver mutual fund company known for its aggressive stock-picking
style. Last year, 28 cents of every dollar invested in mutual funds
went to Janus, according to the fund tracking firm AMG Data
Services, and the growth has only accelerated of late. In the first
four months of this year, the firm's equity funds took in $31
billion more, nearly equaling the company's inflows for all of last
year and propelling Janus from the 20th biggest mutual fund concern
at the end of 1998 to the fifth at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   That was so much money that several managers requested the
closings, which, by Janus policy, is within their discretion. ``It
will slow the flows,' said Stephen Stieneker, a Janus spokesman.
``We hope it will allow us to continue the performance our
investors expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Fidelity and Vanguard, which offer a diverse slate of
funds covering dozens of sectors and investment styles, Janus made
its name by offering relatively few funds largely focused on
aggressive stocks, and by making some prescient bets in the
technology and telecommunications sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The focused approach has meant that several of the same stocks
appear in the portfolios of different Janus funds, so if one Janus
fund is closed, investors may find a similar investing style in
another offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``For investors, you need to keep in mind that you're getting
somewhat similar exposure,'' said Christine Benz, a senior analyst
at the fund tracking firm Morningstar. For the company, ``the
challenge is that they'll need to develop the other parts of their
product line.''
</P>
<P>
   Janus added a value-oriented fund this year and two sector
funds, one focused on technology and one on health stocks, at the
end of 1998. The health fund, Janus Global Life Sciences, was one
of those closed Tuesday, along with the $8 billion Janus Olympus.
The technology sector fund was closed earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   While Janus executives consider how best to handle their growth,
they also must navigate an even more delicate situation _ Janus'
impending spinoff from its parent company, Kansas City Southern
Industries. Janus executives, including Tom Bailey, the founder and
chief executive, have criticized Kansas City Southern's plan to
package Janus along with its three other financial holdings into a
subsidiary called Stilwell Financial. Janus executives would prefer
to be spun off as a separate company.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Southern executives have rejected that suggestion,
and they expect the spinoff to proceed as soon as they receive
regulatory approval. Still, the future of Janus will remain with
Janus, say Kansas City Southern officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy has been that you don't change a winning
formula,'' said James R. Jones, a former chief executive of the
American Stock Exchange and current member of Kansas City
Southern's board of directors. ``It's an industry with a lot of
strong personalities, and they speak their mind,'' he said of the
Janus officials.

FILIPINO SUSPECT IN `LOVE BUG' VIRUS RELEASED 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to correct spelling to Reomel in 4th graf.)  
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines _ A bank employee was released Tuesday for
lack of evidence after being held overnight as a suspect in the
creation of a computer program that has disrupted computer traffic
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said that he must reappear in 10 days to answer
charges and that they were examining a list provided by the FBI of
10 possible suspects.
</P>
<P>
   All the names on the list are linked to a computer college in
Manila where an official said Tuesday that a student had earlier
written a password-stealing program similar to the destructive
program that caused tens of millions of dollars of damage in at
least 20 countries over the past week.
</P>
<P>
   The list apparently includes the bank employee, Reomel Ramones,
27, and his girlfriend, Irene de Guzman, who failed to turn herself
in Tuesday as she had promised the National Bureau of
Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is incomplete,'' said the senior prosecutor,
Severino Gana. ``There are still diskettes which they need to
evaluate.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are hampered by the fact that a computer that
could provide crucial evidence appeared to have been removed from
the home of the two initial suspects and by the lack of any law in
the Philippines that makes computer vandalism a crime.
</P>
<P>
   An arrest warrant was issued under a law aimed at prosecuting
credit card and bank fraud. Experts said Tuesday that prosecution
under that law might be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no computers retrieved, but there were indications
of equipment taken out; there were computer parts,'' said Federico
Opinion, the chief of the National Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Another bureau official, Elfren Meneses, said the names of the
10 people under suspicion were embedded in the virus, possibly in
coded form, and that all had links with the AMA Computer College in
Manila. He said both Ramones and de Guzman had attended the
college, which has 10,000 students at branches in Manila and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Abad, the executive vice president of the school, said
the college had examined student theses in recent days and found
one with a program he described as ``very close'' to the virus.
</P>
<P>
   He said it had been written mostly in Visual Basic, the
programming language used for the virus, and that the thesis had
been rejected because ``we saw something there that will download
passwords of other users,'' just as the virus did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very simple,'' Abad said. ``Once you triggered it, it
would look for passwords and pass them back. I think we have a
strong lead here.''
</P>
<P>
   The virus, which was sent as an attachment to an e-mail message
with the subject line ``I Love You,'' propagates itself to e-mail
addresses found on the victim's computer. It was also designed to
detect and steal passwords from recipients' computers and relay
them to an e-mail address in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ramones and de Guzman on Tuesday denied involvement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials said Ramones told them he was a victim of ``mistaken
identity.'' He told The Associated Press: ``What hurts is that I
did not do it and yet they are pinning me down. The problem here is
I am not even fond of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has a degree in accounting and works in the user
support department of Equitable Bank, where he refers calls about
computer problems to technicians.
</P>
<P>
   De Guzman's lawyer, Rolando Quimbo, visited the headquarters of
the National Bureau of Investigation and told reporters,
``Definitely she has nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they targeted the couple because they had
traced the virus to a computer in their apartment in Pandacan, a
lower-middle-class neighborhood in Manila.
</P>
<P>
   Officials raided the apartment on Monday and seized telephones
and computer accessories, but said they had found no computer or
modem. While they were there, Ramones arrived home from work and
was taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   The raid had been delayed for nearly three days because
investigators said they could not find a judge over the weekend to
issue a warrant and then could not determine an applicable law
under which to make arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo Zamora, executive secretary to President Joseph Estrada,
called on congress to pass urgent legislation covering computer
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the virus caused much damage,'' Zamora said.
``We were not affected that much, but the Philippines was used as
the point of origin.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the government had not yet decided whether the
Philippines would allow other countries affected by the virus to
seek damages from any suspects. Any possible extradition could also
be complicated by the lack of a domestic computer-crimes law
because extradition generally requires recognition of a crime by
the host country.

   BRITAIN: BLAIR DEFIANT
</P>
<P>
   In his first speech since his most significant setback in three
years in office, Prime Minister Tony Blair said he would not change
his government's program to suit his critics. ``Come fair weather
or foul, we intend to stick to the course we have set out,'' he
said in an uncompromising address to the Periodical Publishers'
Association. In elections last week, Blair suffered the loss of
nearly 600 local council seats and the indignity of seeing Ken
Livingstone, whom he opposed, become London's first elected mayor.

   NORTHERN IRELAND: MURDER INQUIRY SOUGHT
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Commission, a watchdog group set up under the
April 1998 Ulster peace accord, dismissed as insufficient a police
investigation of the murder of a prominent Catholic rights lawyer,
Pat Finucane, and called for an independent inquiry. A Protestant
paramilitary group claimed responsibility for the 1989 murder, but
the family and civil liberties groups say they have evidence of
collusion between the killers and the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
</P>
<P>
   NORTHERN IRELAND: ARMY PULLBACK
</P>
<P>
   British army bases in Londonderry and South Armagh and a
military camp close to the Irish border are to be closed, and
several observation towers in Belfast are to be dismantled, said
Sir Ronnie Flanagan, chief of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The
steps follow an announcement by the Irish Republican Army
permitting international inspection of its secret arms dumps.

   Three former members of East Germany's Politburo went on trial
for manslaughter in the shooting deaths of four people trying to
flee across the Berlin Wall between 1984 and 1989. Herbert Haeber,
69, Hans-Joachim Boehme, 70, and Siegfried Lorenz, 69, are accused
of not speaking out in the Politburo against the killings of people
trying to escape to the West.

   ITALY: BERLUSCONI WINS
</P>
<P>
   A Milan appeals court overturned a bribery conviction against
Silvio Berlusconi, a media tycoon and leader of the center-left
opposition. Berlusconi, whose victory in regional elections drove
former Prime Minister Massimo d'Alema to resign, was cleared on one
of four bribery counts. The court overturned three others because
the statute of limitations had elapsed. He still faces trials on
other charges of bribery and false accounting.

   FRANCE: MORE MAD COW DISEASE
</P>
<P>
   Officials announced that they had detected yet another case of
mad cow disease, this time in the northwest Manche region. The cow
and a herd of 141 other cattle were slaughtered and burned. The new
case brought to 17 the number of new cases discovered this year,
suggesting France is on the way to far exceed last year's total of
30 cases.

   The number of high school graduates seeking admission to the

   KENNEDY OPPONENT IN TROUBLE
</P>
<P>
   Jack E. Robinson III, the ill-fated Republican challenger for
Edward M. Kennedy's Senate seat, faces some new adversity that may
be potentially fatal for his campaign. As of 5 p.m. Tuesday, the
Massachusetts secretary of state's office had certified only 5,122
of the 10,000 signatures Robinson needed by that hour to officially
qualify to run. So unless he has some 5,000 signatures stashed out
there that can readily and unquestionably be certified, he has
failed to make the ballot, said Secretary of State William F.
Galvin. ``It's very much up in the air whether he will make it or
not,'' Galvin said. If he does not, Galvin added, it would mean
that Massachusetts Republicans had failed to field a U.S. Senate
candidate for the first time since senators were first elected by
popular vote, back in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson offered no explanation for what happened to his
signature-gathering effort or his campaign in general _ a campaign
he had sworn to continue despite a raft of damaging accusations and
incidents, ranging from traffic troubles to bad behavior toward
women.
</P>
<P>
   SWITCHING TO DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear yet whether it is a real trend, and if so why,
but the conversion of Southern Republicans to the Democratic Party
may be spreading. It began last month with two South Carolina
legislators. Then a few days ago, a Georgia state representative,
Randy Sauder, who represents the Atlanta suburb of Smyrna, became
the first Georgia Republican in 16 years to switch to the
Democrats. Another Republican state legislator, Buddy DeLoach of
Hinesville, is becoming an independent.
</P>
<P>
   Sauder, who switched just before the filing deadline to prevent
any Republicans from running against him, said he was disappointed
in the Republican Party's rigidity on issues like education.
Republicans vowed to run one of their own against him as an
independent candidate. Over the past few decades, those switching
parties in the South were mostly Democrats turning Republican.
</P>
<P>
   EYE ON 2004 RACE?
</P>
<P>
   Though this year's presidential primary season is not officially
over, a coming fund-raiser in Georgia is already stoking
speculation about races four years or so down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Next Monday, Jeanne Shaheen, the Democratic governor of New
Hampshire, will be the beneficiary of an event in Atlanta _ a bit
south of Concord _ that planners hope will raise at least $25,000
for her re-election.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the hosts, as well as one of the contributors, will
be Georgia's governor, Roy Barnes, a first-term Democrat who is
beginning to win national attention for his policies on improving
schools and limiting sprawl. Robert S. Kahn, Barnes' chief of
staff, says his boss was simply supporting a fellow Democratic
governor, not pocketing a chit to be cashed later, in time for New
Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary in 2004 or 2008. ``The only
election he's interested in, other than legislative elections, is
his own re-election,'' Kahn insisted.
</P>
<P>
   The event is being organized by Michael Coles, a prominent party
fund-raiser and Barnes ally who met Shaheen while working for Vice
President Al Gore in New Hampshire last winter.

TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD ACTOR RECALLS THE MAKING OF A CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM THORNTON   The Gadsden (Ala.) Times   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GADSDEN, Ala. _ The ghost of Atticus Finch was at work this
week, in the eyes of students at Westbrook Christian School.
</P>
<P>
   As the mysterious Boo Radley once more kept watch over Jem,
Scout and Dill, students watched the screen expectantly, their
heads leaning forward, some hiding their faces in excited dread.
Adults looked on as well, familiar smiles playing on their faces as
the child actors of almost 40 years ago brought to life Harper
Lee's classic novel.
</P>
<P>
   Then, applause swelled as the students showed their appreciation
for the timeless book and the classic movie made from it.
</P>
<P>
   A reminder of both was on display Monday, as Gadsden native
Philip Alford answered questions and recounted ``a special time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you tell the difference between then and now?'' the
51-year-old asked, his smoky voice staring out at the young faces
through glasses. Balding, dressed in blue jeans and loafers, he
bore little resemblance to the boy who had just reappeared on
screen.
</P>
<P>
   When Alford was 13, he received the key to the city for his role
as Jem Finch in ``To Kill a Mockingbird.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost 30 years since he quit show business. He said
he grew tired of its drug culture and the roles that were being
offered. He is now a building contractor in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently has he begun acknowledging his role in the 1962
movie, which won four Academy Awards and still retains much of its
magic. That was evident by the crowd of schoolchildren who lingered
to get Alford to sign their dog-eared editions of the Lee novel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Alford had not even read the Pulitzer Prize-winning
novel when he was offered a role in the movie. He was discovered
while acting in Birmingham, and only took the role after his mother
told him he could miss school. By that time, more than 2,500
children had already auditioned for the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the right size in the right place at the right time,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   From February to late May, he and cast members Mary Badham, the
late John Megna and Gregory Peck spent their days at the Universal
sound stage, then transformed into Depression-era Alabama. It was
originally scheduled to be a 10-week shoot, he said, until
producers realized ``they had something special.''
</P>
<P>
   In that time, he went from 89 pounds to 112, and grew 7 inches
in height. He tried desperately not to kill his co-star Badham, who
played Scout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated her,'' he admitted, smiling. ``She had this really bad
habit of mouthing your lines when she wasn't supposed to be
speaking. We were serious about killing her.''
</P>
<P>
   This antagonism sometimes translates on the screen, and remains
vividly in Alford's memory. A breakfast scene required endless
takes because of Badham, he said, forcing him to consume helping
after helping of bacon, eggs and grits.
</P>
<P>
   He also offered insights into 1960s Hollywood. The picture's
makers decided not to let the child actors watch any filming of the
movie's climactic court scenes, he said, because the trial dealt
with a supposed rape. The film's social content was supposed to
have doomed it at the box office in the South, but it ended up
being more popular there than elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Alford recalled the fun of making the film.
One story involved the book's secretive author. For the first few
days of the film shoot, Lee was on the set as a technical adviser.
When she watched Peck with the film's children in one of the first
scenes filmed, Peck spotted a tear coming down her cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad to see you were touched by the scene,'' Peck later
told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the scene,'' she replied. ``You have a pot belly,
just like my daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a pot belly,'' the screen legend shot back.
``That's acting.''
</P>
<P>
   In his seven years of acting, Alford went from making $500 to
$10,000 a week. He said he missed the applause most of all, but did
not regret the life he found with his wife and family.
</P>
<P>
   Only four years ago did he get the itch to act again. A photo
shoot with Vanity Fair magazine reunited ``Mockingbird's''
surviving cast members for the first time in more than 30 years,
redepositing them on the movie's old set. The familiar smell of
paint and glue made him want to act again, he admitted, but only
for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has retained a friendship with Peck _ always
called ``Mister Peck'' _ and the other cast members. He speaks
perhaps four times a year at colleges and schools, but this was his
first appearance in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of little things I had never heard him talk
about before,'' said his cousin, Jim Copeland of Gadsden. ``It was
very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has given up a movie career that began with great
promise, he has not had to turn his back on its adulation. Judging
by the applause he received Monday, Alford's career, and the appeal
of ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' is alive and well.
</P>

CISCO'S $662 MILLION PROFIT TOPS FORECASTS 
</HEADLINE>
  By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Cisco Systems Inc. said Tuesday that its
third-quarter profit beat expectations while it posted a 55 percent
gain in sales as the leading supplier of hardware for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended April 29, Cisco reported earnings of $662
million, or 9 cents a diluted share, compared with $636 million, or
9 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Per-share figures
reflect a stock split effective March 22. Sales rose 55 percent, to
$4.92 billion from $3.17 billion. It was the company's ninth
consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter included acquisition-related charges of $488
million, or about 6 cents a share, after taxes. Pro forma net
income, which excludes the acquisition charges, payroll tax on the
exercise of stock options and gains realized on certain
investments, was $1.03 billion, or 14 cents a share, up 58 percent
from $649 million, or 9 cents a share, in the quarter a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Cisco to earn 13 cents a share, according
to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Before Cisco reported its results, the company's shares closed
unchanged at $62.75. Cisco's shares had dropped earlier in the week
after an article in Barron's questioned the company's high
valuation and acquisition strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was another amazing quarter from Cisco,'' said Paul
Johnson, an analyst with Robertson Stephens &AMP; Co. He said he did
not think the company's valuation or ability to continue acquiring
other companies was an issue, at least not this quarter. ``Most of
the growth came from home-grown products,'' he said. ``The growth
has continued despite the acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, John Chambers, Cisco's
president and chief executive, said: ``Globally, business and
government leaders are beginning to dramatically transform their
traditional business models into Internet economy business models.
Business leaders are beginning to get it, and as they get it they
begin to bring the applications up and spend at an accelerated
rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers said the greatest competitive threat to Cisco came not
from the established players in networking but from new smaller
companies. ``Our toughest pinpoint competition continues to come
from the existing start-ups and the virtually unlimited venture
capital available to fund new ones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Johnson of Robertson Stephens said that some of these
smaller companies were growing much more rapidly than Cisco, noting
that three of them _ Juniper Networks, Redback and Copper Mountain
_ had combined revenue of $1 billion in the quarter. ``When you
look at Cisco, it's hard to believe there are any threats, but the
non-Cisco next generation companies are now a $4 billion business
growing in excess of 150 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., completed
the acquisitions of Aironet Wireless Communications and Pirelli
Optical Systems for a combined total, including assumed
liabilities, of about $2.85 billion. During the quarter, Cisco also
announced it planned to acquire Pentacom Ltd., Growth Networks,
Atlantech Technologies and a unit of Seagull Semiconductor Ltd.
Last week, Cisco said that it had agreed to acquire ArrowPoint
Communications, Inc. in a stock swap valued at $5.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies that lead in this decade will not only have the
ability to develop products internally and acquire effectively, but
they'll also have the ability to form an ecosystem of partners,''
Chambers said. ``For this reason, Cisco is better positioned than
ever to lead the Internet revolution through a combination of
internal development, acquisitions, and partnerships.'' &QL;

   Behind Painting Sold Online Was a Partly False Story
</P>
<P>
   The man who sold a painting on the Internet for $135,805
acknowledged that he concocted part of the story he used to
describe the work, which bore the initials ``RD,'' creating
speculation that it was painted by the California artist Richard
Diebenkorn.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being a married homeowner who cleaned the painting out
of his garage, the man is a single lawyer who has sold paintings on
eBay before. But he said that he did not fake the painting or add
the signature and that he would cancel the sale if experts
determine that the canvas is not by Diebenkorn.

   Bestfoods Hints Deal Is Possible
</P>
<P>
   When Bestfoods rejected a takeover offer from Unilever last
week, it seemed emphatic. But over the last few days, senior
executives at Bestfoods have talked with the company's largest
investors, discussing their reasons for turning down the $18.4
billion offer, saying that Unilever has underestimated the savings
of such a deal. The executives' position hints that Bestfoods would
consider a merger opportune at the right price, analysts said.
Shares of Bestfoods fell $1, to $63.50.

   Stocks dropped on fears about the effect of an expected increase

HENDERSON'S FUTURE WITH METS TURNS CLOUDY 
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Unsure how much more production they can get from a
future Hall of Famer, the Mets have placed outfielder Rickey
Henderson on major league waivers, baseball officials confirmed
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has 48 hours to pass through waivers, giving clubs _
in order from the National League team with the worst record to the
one with the best, then the same way in the American League _ a
chance to claim him and assume the remainder of his $2 million
salary for this season. If a team claims Henderson, the Mets can
decide to pull him back, and perhaps work out a trade with that
club. Or, they can simply let him go to the other team for the
$20,000 waiver price. That team would pick up his salary.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson is 41, and Mets officials do not know whether he has
reached the end of the line in a brilliant career. Henderson is a
unique talent, probably the best leadoff hitter in baseball
history, but so far he has had a bad season without any period of
extended success.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets discussed trade possibilities involving Henderson over
the winter, and putting him on waivers gives them options; they can
see who has interest now, and if they determine he is finished,
they can save money and let him go for the waiver price. The Mets
can also keep him and hope he rediscovers the form he showed in
1999, when he batted .315, stole 37 bases and had a .423 on-base
percentage. The Mets apparently have no current interest in simply
releasing him. If they did, they would owe him his full salary. If
another team then picked him up, the Mets would still have to pay
most of what he would be owed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't anticipate releasing Rickey Henderson,'' General
Manager Steve Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets are frustrated with Henderson's play. He has said
he has had problems seeing the ball, a common affliction for
players but one that rarely lasts this long, one Mets official
said. Henderson was hitting .207 after going one for four in the
Mets' 2-0 win over the Pirates in Pittsburgh on Tuesday night, and
he had no hitting streak longer than two games, just one extra-base
hit and only two stolen bases, a stunningly low number for the
career leader in steals. Even Mets catcher Mike Piazza has more
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson was unhappy that the Mets did not renegotiate his
contract this season and grumbled in spring training about the way
he was sometimes double-switched out of games last season. He did
not speak much to reporters from early April until last weekend,
when he again questioned Manager Bobby Valentine's use of him. Just
days before that, while Phillips was speaking to reporters in San
Francisco, Henderson asked him for a meeting. Phillips has been
exasperated by the distractions Henderson causes, but he insisted
the San Francisco incident did not bother him.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips and Valentine also spoke Tuesday with Henderson, who
started in left field against the Pirates and led off, as usual.
Their message, Henderson said, was this: ``Don't worry about it. It
don't mean nothing. You have a Mets uniform on and you're in the
lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Henderson was critical of the way Valentine used
him in Florida, but Phillips said he had heard similar comments
before. For the Mets, Henderson's production on the field is more
important than anything Henderson says. He has always said
flamboyant things.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Rickey's going to talk _ and he has talked during his
career _ he's usually able to walk his talk,'' Valentine said.
``That ability is what separated him _ not what he has said, but
what he's capable of doing. He's capable of playing better than
he's played, and he'll do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson came out early for batting practice Tuesday, something
he said he was planning to do, and he got in 40 to 50 extra swings,
concentrating on limiting movement of his head and ``tracking the
ball'' better. He thinks he is finding his stroke, he said, and he
is looking forward to warmer temperatures. He said he does not know
his waiver status now _ ``I know I've been on it probably 1,000
times,'' he said _ and said he is not bothered by it, whatever it
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you get disappointed, but nothing in this game makes
me mad or sad,'' he said. ``I'm here. I think we all _ players,
managers, anybody _ we get frustrated when things aren't going the
way we want them to go or expect them to go. But this game is about
adjustments. That's what I've got to do. That's what I think
Bobby's going through.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything's going well, it would be no problem. When
things go bad, it seems like we have a lot of controversy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Baseball officials are fined if they comment on waivers, so
Phillips did not confirm nor deny that he had asked waivers on
Henderson. There are two types of waivers; the type the Mets are
using on Henderson, and the irrevocable waivers in which a team
cannot pull a player back if he is claimed. The fact the Mets did
not use irrevocable waivers on Henderson would indicate they have
not fully given up on him.
</P>
<P>
   As for another team claiming Henderson, one baseball official
said, it would have to be a big-market team that would be willing
to gamble on an aging, slumping player.
</P>
<P>
   Without Henderson, the Mets would seem to have few options to
replace him as their everyday leadoff hitter. While the speedy
outfielder Jason Tyner, a first-round draft pick, is hitting .314
with 16 stolen bases at Class AAA Norfolk, Phillips said: ``We have
a lot of minor leaguers with speed. I'm not sure any of them are
ready for the major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Nunnally has batted leadoff six times for the Mets this
year, and Benny Agbayani and Melvin Mora have done so once apiece.
Jay Payton, who has good speed, is another possible leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Rickey got hurt, I don't think we'd have any problem
finding someone for the leadoff role,'' Valentine said. ``We
wouldn't cancel the season.''

A NO-BRAINER: CUTTING HENDERSON  
 BY GEORGE VECSEY  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sad but true: Because Rickey Henderson does not move nearly as
nimbly as he once did, the door will indeed whack him in the back
on his way out.
</P>
<P>
   It's time. Never mind the fine line between regular waivers and
unconditional waivers and any other waivers a team can seek. It's
time to escort Rickey to the front door, thank him for his services
and get on with the season.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those great determining moments for the Mets. Are
they serious about getting back into the playoffs? Everybody can
see Henderson cannot play anymore, and not only that, he doesn't
want to play anything resembling winning baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets have been caught up in some kind of bookkeeping
malaise, trying to justify the prospect of paying a $2 million
salary to a forwarding address. The forwarding address cannot kick
singles into triples. Go for it.
</P>
<P>
   Pay the money, even though Henderson has stolen 1,336 bases,
more than any other player in history. On his statistics, he is
bound for the Baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   (One can hear the plaques of the immortals, living and dead,
conversing in the quiet moments when the hall is closed for the
night. The plaques will nod in the direction of Henderson's plaque
and they will whisper, ``Hey, Rickey is Rickey,'' the 20-year
description of his whimsical approach to life. It stopped being
cute when his batting average plummeted toward the Mendoza line,
and so did his attitude.)
</P>
<P>
   Less is more. Addition by subtraction. The Mets will be a better
team the moment Henderson is out of uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't anticipate releasing Rickey Henderson,'' said Steve
Phillips, the general manager, using a fine Clintonian parsing of
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The key word there is anticipate _ not releasing. Phillips put
the double-dribbling left fielder on waivers, surely not expecting
that somebody would leak it to the waiting world, putting us all on
Rickey watch.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was rather hoping some general manager with no access
to cable channels or the Internet or the daily box scores or the
grapevine would think this was the 25-year-old Rickey or the
30-year-old Rickey or even the 40-year-old Rickey of last season,
instead of the broken-down Rickey of this season.
</P>
<P>
   The oddity was that while the Mets waited out the waivers,
Henderson was still in uniform, and not only that, but also leading
off in the Mets' 2-0 win over the Pirates in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he had stirred himself to five hits and five stolen
bases and managed to hold on to simple fly balls _ no automatic in
recent weeks _ this would have been an anomaly. Babe Ruth, after
all, poleaxed three home runs in a game shortly before his overdue
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Henderson's suddenly rheumy eyes and weary legs has
brought back sad memories of a 42-year-old Willie Mays stumbling
around the basepaths in his final moments as a Met in 1973. But at
least Mays was a New York icon, beloved by ownership and fans
alike.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has been a rent-a-Met, setting a bad example for young
players. His card games in the clubhouse with the equally
malcontent Bobby Bonilla nearly scuttled the Mets' October run last
year. He went into a snit over double-switch lineup changes. Last
year he had the credibility of a marvelous .315 season. This year
he can't play, and he ain't funny.
</P>
<P>
   Who will play left field? Somebody. It has been enjoyable
watching motivated younger players named Payton and Mora and
Agbayani and Nunnally, along with the seasoned Derek Bell. They
have been hustling and trying, and that's all you can ask.
</P>
<P>
   You could feel it in the air in Shea Stadium. Whenever Manager
Bobby Valentine would double-switch Henderson out of a game _ and
sometimes it seemed he was twitching to do it in the third inning _
you could hear a sigh, like a cool evening breeze.
</P>
<P>
   There are no Hall of Fame players in that lot, but it doesn't
matter. This is no audition for a plaque. Some kid making close to
the minimum salary will give more than Henderson has given: a .207
batting average with just two runs batted in, 14 runs scored and
two stolen bases. Plus, his eyes are shot.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing dishonorable about an athlete losing it at 41,
or any age. But there is something unappealing about a player's
punching the time clock, trying to add to his statistics.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets' management is worried about eating Henderson's
salary, it should put canisters alongside the turnstiles when the
Mets come home Friday night. Let the fans vote with their quarters,
the way they have been voting with their boos. Never has vox populi
been more correct. Time to say goodbye.

WORD ABOUT O'CONNOR'S SUCCESSOR NEGATES A CHURCH TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This was not the way it was supposed to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   As New York's archbishop, Cardinal John O'Connor, was being
buried in the crypt of St. Patrick's Cathedral on Monday, there was
little question of the usual month-long period of respect and
reflection before his successor as archbishop would be announced.
</P>
<P>
   A priest attending the funeral asked Bishop Edward M. Egan of
Bridgeport for confirmation he was indeed the Vatican's choice, as
everybody, including the bishop's brother-in-law from Maryland, had
been saying. ``I'll let you know after Wednesday,'' the bishop was
overheard answering.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the bishop will be installed in a ceremony not long
after that, according to his brother-in-law, Raymond Egan, who said
he planned to visit New York for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to papal secrecy? What of the half-dozen other
candidates whose names had surfaced since last summer? And why did
Egan not initially figure among them?
</P>
<P>
   The selection of archbishops is normally played close to the
vest, with those who participate sworn never to acknowledge even
their role in the process, much less its details. The choice
becomes official only when Rome speaks, either directly or through
its delegate in the United States, and in recent memory, there have
been no real cracks in the wall of confidentiality protecting
Vatican appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything this close to the fact covered this
way,'' said Msgr. John Doherty, who was vicar of the Bronx when
Egan worked in New York as auxiliary bishop for education.
</P>
<P>
   As O'Connor's health failed last autumn and winter, a committee
of American bishops began the search for his successor. They
canvassed leading clergymen and lay Catholics about the problems
facing the archdiocese now and in the coming years, gathering
opinions about who might best fill the job.
</P>
<P>
   A number of names surfaced as possibilities. These included that
of Bishops Henry Mansell of Buffalo and Sean O'Malley of Fall
River, Mass., and Archbishops Justin F. Rigali of St. Louis,
Theodore E. McCarrick of Newark, N.J., and Edwin F. O'Brien, who
oversees military chaplains.
</P>
<P>
   One church official who was briefed by the cardinal said that
the final list of names handed to Pope John Paul II came down to
three: Archbishops Rigali and O'Brien, and Bishop Mansell, who
O'Connor said he favored for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Another clergyman, who was consulted by the Vatican and who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had suggested Egan, along
with two other candidates, as his choices. Weighing heavily in this
clergyman's mind was the need to close and consolidate schools and
parishes in the New York archdiocese, whose population had changed
substantially during O'Connor's 16-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, he noted, had been able to close and merge parishes and
schools in the Bridgeport diocese, where he has served as bishop
since 1988. And at 68, this clergyman said, Egan would be an
interim archbishop, making the necessary changes before submitting
his letter of resignation upon turning 75, as Vatican tradition
demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that he would be very good for the interim position, in
which he'd take some difficult actions that would result in a
measure of unpopularity, and that was what was needed,'' the
clergyman said. But animosity, he added, was not inevitable: an
astute archbishop could win people over by revitalizing the merged
or streamlined parishes and redefining their missions.
</P>
<P>
   Egan's name was not on the list of three names, or terna,
submitted to the pope for final consideration, said the church
official in whom the cardinal confided. The Vatican had assigned
Egan to New York in 1985 shortly after O'Connor arrived here, and
the two men had had a rocky start. The clergyman who suggested
Egan's name to the Vatican said he suspected that it did not make
the terna because the cardinal and the bishop ``were just on
different wavelengths.''
</P>
<P>
   In the deliberations to narrow the choices, O'Brien's name fell
first, the official who was briefed by the cardinal said. One
faction involved in the selection supported Rigali, while another
faction, to which O'Connor belonged, supported Mansell.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the pope agreed with neither group, and selected a
name of his own, the archdiocesan official said, much as he had
done in appointing O'Connor archbishop of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In February, O'Connor visited the Vatican _ a trip that doubled
as a farewell visit and lobbying effort on behalf of Mansell, said
the official in whom the cardinal confided. Not long after that,
O'Connor, in a letter of farewell to the 870 priests who worked
under him, said he expected to see his replacement named sometime
in March.
</P>
<P>
   But March passed quietly, as did April, with church officials
whispering that the Vatican seemed inclined to allow O'Connor to
die in office, as had all previous archbishops of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as O'Connor's illness lingered, the Vatican appeared to
have decided it could not leave New York leaderless indefinitely.
Early last week, several church officials said, preparations began
to make public Egan's appointment to the Roman Catholic Church's
most visible pulpit in the country. Word of the impending
announcement went out to a limited circle of bishops and their
auxiliaries in New York and archbishops throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, O'Connor's condition deteriorated, and it became clear
that his death was imminent. Out of respect for the cardinal, the
preparations screeched to a halt. But the word, once out, could not
be locked back up.

COKE TO ADVERTISE ON CHANNEL OWNED BY LAWYER IN BIAS SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Fla.)   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adding a new twist to the already complicated racial
discrimination lawsuit brought against Coca-Cola by a group of its
black employees, Coke said Wednesday that it was becoming a major
advertiser on a cable channel owned by a Florida lawyer who last
month began representing four of the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Coke signed a five-year agreement with the Atlanta-based
channel, MBC Network, which plans to broadcast children's shows,
movies, cartoons and sports programs specifically for black
families 24 hours a day, according to a statement from MBC.
</P>
<P>
   The channel, owned by Willie D. Gary, was formed in 1998. It is
backed by Evander Holyfield, the boxer; Marlon D. Jackson, one of
the original Jackson Five; Cecil Fielder, formerly of the Detroit
Tigers; and Alvin D. James, a longtime broadcaster, as well as
Gary.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's name will appear on print and electronic announcements
connected with the channel, which will advertise all Coke brands,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Gary represents four of the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit
against Coca-Cola, which was filed 13 months ago and contends that
the plaintiffs were denied promotions, raises and other advancement
at the company because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Coke could raise questions about a conflict of
interest between Gary's role in the lawsuit and Coke's support of
his business venture. Gary could not be reached Tuesday night for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Cyrus Mehri, the lawyer who originally represented the four and
continues to represent four other current and former Coke employees
in the lawsuit, said the arrangement ``is an issue between Mr. Gary
and the four individuals he represents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My team's focus is on fighting for the best possible
resolution for the class,'' Mehri added.
</P>
<P>
   A Coke spokesman said the company's discussions and final
negotiations occurred before Gary announced his intention to get
involved in the lawsuit, which is seeking class-action status for
as many as 2,000 Coke employees,
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making the ad buy because it gives us an opportunity to
support what we believe is some very meaningful programming and
connect our advertising with African-American consumers on a
frequent and consistent basis,'' said the spokesman, Ben Deutsch.
</P>
<P>
   Gary, who is best known for obtaining a $500 million award in a
1995 case against the Loewen funeral home company, was introduced
to Coke's former chairman, M. Douglas Ivester, by the Rev. Jesse
Jackson. Gary is Jackson's lawyer. The Loewen award was eventually
settled at $175 million.
</P>
<P>
   Coke and the employees named in the lawsuit began court-ordered
mediation last month. &QL;

 &HT;    Wild first is grand for Lopez
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miami _ The Braves gave one away with a walk-off balk the
previous night, but they were on the other end of the giveaway
Tuesday night against the Florida Marlins and walked off with some
10-5 payback.
</P>
<P>
   Using seven walks and two hit batsmen by rookie starter Brad
Penny in the first 2 1/3 innings, the Braves had a five-run first
inning on their way to snapping a three-game losing skid.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who had lost four of five since a franchise-record
15-game winning streak, tied their season high in runs.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez was the prime benefactor. He came to the plate with
the bases loaded in the first and cleared them with a grand slam on
the way to a 3-for-4 night.
</P>
<P>
   Not since they clinched the National League East division last
year in Montreal had the Braves enjoyed such a productive first
inning, when they scored five runs on their way to a 10-0 win on
Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The big first inning, which included an RBI by Brian Jordan when
he was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded, helped untrack the
Braves' offense and make a winner out of John Burkett for the first
time in three starts as a Brave.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Quilvio Veras drew a bases-loaded walk in the third
to make it 6-1 _ which would be the last the Braves saw of Penny _
they had matched their offensive output of the previous three
games.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a week since the Braves had outhit an opponent. They
were down to hitting .234 with runners in scoring position and a
lowly .225 on the road. In short, they needed this.
</P>
<P>
   Penny obliged with a display of erratic control. He has walked
17 batters in 15 1/3 innings over his past three starts. His night
included a balk among the seven walks, a wild pitch, two hit
batters, three hits and six runs allowed He loaded the bases three
times in the first three innings before Marlins manager John Boles
had seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves did a lot more of what they should have done the
previous game against Vladimir Nunez, the other pitcher along with
Penny that the Marlins acquired from Arizona last season for closer
Matt Mantei, and that's keep the bat on their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   After getting Veras out to start the game, Penny allowed the
next four batters to reach when he walked two and hit two,
including Jordan with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett was making his first appearance in Pro Player Stadium
since the Marlins traded him to Texas in August 1996. He became the
fourth former Marlins pitcher to beat them in the past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett allowed five baserunners in the first three innings but
kept the damage to a minimum. He struck out seven and limited the
Marlins to two runs over six innings, the longest he has lasted in
three starts for Atlanta.

   (Undated) Edwin Edwards, the flamboyant former four-term

investigations, was convicted Tuesday of doling out licenses to

Houston Mayor Fred Hofheinz in another extortion case, were also
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, 72, was found guilty by a federal jury in Baton Rouge,
La., on 17 of 26 counts of extortion and racketeering in connection
with Louisiana's gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contended he extorted hundreds of thousands of
dollars from former San Francisco 49ers football team owner Eddie
DeBartolo Jr. and other wealthy businessmen seeking riverboat
casino licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards told reporters the verdict was in keeping with Chinese
prophecy. ``If you sit by a river long enough, the dead bodies of
your enemies will float by you,'' he said. ``I suppose the feds sat
by the river long enough and here comes my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Edwards hatched the extortion plot in 1996, as
his final gubernatorial term wound to an end. He told applicants he
could use his influence to help them win licenses to operate
riverboat casinos _ for a price.
</P>
<P>
   But Edwards said he was acting as a consultant, and that the
money he collected was consulting fees.
</P>
<P>
   Lead prosecutor Jim Letten said Edwards' cronies made most of
the contacts to protect the high-profile politician. They
characterized Edwards' son, Stephen, as the manager of the
extortion plot. Andrew Martin, a former Edwards aide; Cecil Brown,
a cattleman and longtime friend; and contractor Bobby Johnson were
said to be the front men.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Martin were convicted on all counts, Johnson on nine
counts and Stephen Edwards on 18 of 23 counts.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors didn't totally see the plot as prosecutors presented it.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the state gambling board, Ecotry Fuller, was charged
with giving state Sen. Greg Tarver a copy of a confidential state
police report about casino-license applicants and lying about it to
a federal grand jury. He was acquitted, as was Tarver, who had been
accused of passing the report to Edwards for DeBartolo.
</P>
<P>
   But DeBartolo's testimony was the most damaging to Edwards.
Forced to give up ownership of his team because of his part in the
extortion plot, DeBartolo testified that Edwards demanded _ and
received_ $400,000 in a cash payoff for helping him get a casino
license.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo said Edwards picked up stacks of $100 bills near the
San Francisco airport and hid the cash in a wide money belt under
his shirt.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Frank Polozolo will reconvene the jury
Wednesday to decide what assets are subject to forfeiture.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards could be sentenced to more than 40 years in prison and
nearly $1 million in fines _ if the verdict sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations began April 24, but one of the 12 jurors was
dismissed last week for failing to deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   South Texas College of Law Professor Neil McCabe said continuing
deliberations after dismissing a juror is outrageous _ and grounds
for appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our system is based on the belief that one person who has a
reasonable doubt can be a defendant's salvation,'' he said, ``but
in this case, if you have somebody who has a reasonable doubt, who
votes innocent when everyone else votes guilty, then throw that
juror out.''
</P>
<P>
   McCabe said holdout jurors must learn to play the game. ``Say,
`I have reasonable doubt, so convince me otherwise.' If you're the
holdout, don't say, `I won't listen and I won't talk.'''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jordan, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of
Louisiana, did not return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards faces another influence-peddling trial in June.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is a co-defendant with Hofheinz and Texas businessman Guy
Thompson in another extortion case.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Edwin Edwards, as well as public corruption
cases involving Hofheinz, former Texas prisons director James A.
``Andy'' Collins, and others stem from information given the FBI by
Texas con artists Michael and Patrick Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Polozolo allowed the government to keep secret the details
of prosecutors' financial and immunity agreements with the Graham
brothers, even though such information is normally disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes of Houston said the Justice
Department cannot keep such information from the public. He has
ordered depositions by the Grahams, Letten and FBI agent Geoffrey
Santini.

BESTFOODS, SPURNING SUITOR, HINTS THAT PRICE IS THE ISSUE  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Bestfoods rejected a takeover offer from Unilever last
week, it seemed emphatic. The price was inadequate, it said,
adding, ``It is not opportune to consider a sale of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the last few days, senior executives at Bestfoods have
talked with the company's largest investors, discussing their
reasons for turning down the all-cash offer of $66 a share, or
$18.4 billion. Rather than casting doubt on the potential cost
savings of the merger, as might be expected, they have said that
Unilever has underestimated the savings at $500 million when they
could be as much as $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been saying to shareholders that we believe there
would be substantially more synergies than Unilever is
describing,'' said a spokeswoman, Gale Griffin, confirming the
discussions. ``We are trying to explain to them our rationale.''
</P>
<P>
   The executives' position hints that Bestfoods would consider a
merger at the right price, stock analysts said Tuesday. ``It's an
unusual takeover defense, because it highlights the benefits of
consolidation,'' said John R. McMillin, a food-stocks analyst for
Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   With another $500 million in cost savings at stake, Bestfoods
executives could argue that their shareholders deserve a higher
price per share than Unilever has offered. ``Let's have some of it
go to the shareholders,'' McMillin said.
</P>
<P>
   One stock analyst who had doubted that the merger would occur,
given Bestfoods' earlier comments, changed his mind Tuesday after
learning of the company's talks with investors. ``They are playing
real hardball in order to get the highest cash price,'' said Daniel
Peris, the analyst, with Argus Research. ``As a Unilever
shareholder, I might be legitimately concerned, because although
the prospects of synergies are great, rarely do these megamergers
work as well as they are planned, either on the cost side or the
growth side.''
</P>
<P>
   The union of Bestfoods and Unilever would create the largest
food and household products company in the world, with brands like
Knorr, Skippy and Hellmann's lining up alongside Wish-Bone, Dove
and Ragu. Unilever, which is also in the middle of a restructuring
designed to shed some of its less-vibrant brands and stimulate
better growth, announced plans last month to buy Ben &AMP; Jerry's
Homemade for $326 million and Slim-Fast for $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Peris said he remained concerned about what a merger with
Bestfoods would do for both sides, as well as the global effects.
``Bestfoods and Unilever are similar in their international
strength,'' he said, ``and a merger or acquisition would take
international distribution out of the system. It is more useful to
have a U.S. company plugged into Bestfoods' distribution than to
have Unilever take out or duplicate that distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Little progress has been reported by either side since the
Bestfoods board voted to reject Unilever's bid a week ago. On
Monday, Unilever said a conversation had taken place between that
company's chairmen, Niall FitzGerald and Antony Burgmans, and
Charles R. Shoemate, the chairman and chief executive of Bestfoods.
A spokesman called the conversation ``businesslike,'' and said it
was intended to open talks between the companies.
</P>
<P>
   FitzGerald and Shoemate are scheduled to speak, about three and
a half hours apart, at a conference for investors being hosted by
Goldman, Sachs next week. Goldman is advising Unilever in the deal,
while Bestfoods is represented by Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever is scheduled to announce its first-quarter earnings
Wednesday morning.

PLANTS THAT REDEEM WATER WITH MURKY PASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maybe you missed the invitation to tour one of this
city's waste water treatment plants Tuesday, in honor of National
Water Week, a time designated by Congress for contemplation of
water's vast and varied uses, from diluting single-malt scotch to
filling hot tubs and flushing toilets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Robert Rickey, who has worked for 25 years for the city's
water system, was standing by Tuesday at the city's Red Hook plant
on the East River in Brooklyn, ready for any and all comers seeking
instruction on the waste water cycle. He was ready to describe how
the plants, with their pumps, pools and pathways, turn raw sewage
into the relatively clean water that is released each day into the
East River, the Hudson and the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, he had had only two visitors. But Rickey
did not seem downcast. He is often called on to give tours to
engineers and municipal politicians from as far away as Thailand,
Korea and Japan, as well as ``all the mayors of Israel,'' students
from elementary schools to colleges, and Frank Perdue, the chicken
man.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey, a corpulent, ebullient engineer who resembles James
Beard, the chef and cooking writer, said he always began his tours
with the same question: ``What happens when you flush your
toilet?'' Tuesday, as usual, he answered it himself: ``It's a very
complex treatment. It's not just a matter of taking out the solids
and dumping it into the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was about that simple once, and not so long ago. Until
the Red Hook plant, one of the newest and smallest of New York's 14
water treatment plants, was completed in 1988 at the Brooklyn Navy
Yard at a cost of $444 million, the nearby neighborhoods' 60
million gallons of waste water a day were merely filtered through a
screen and discharged. (The city as a whole produces about 1.6
billion gallons of waste water a day.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, when a toilet nearby flushes, the sewage flows
through pipes into a chamber at the plant 40 feet below the
surface, where it is pumped through screens and then into a series
of outdoor pools to be cleaned by oxygen and microorganisms. That
process of aerating sewage water is one of the cheapest and most
effective ways of cleaning it, Rickey said. The other main method
used by the city to remove pollutants is the addition of
pathogen-consuming bacteria. ``Good bacteria,'' he said, ``eat the
bad bacteria. The good bacteria are the unsung heroes of the
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing on a concrete walkway between eight open pools of
turgid, odorous sewage water, he said: ``This is food. It needs to
be eaten.'' Then he stood by another group of pools a few feet
away, where several thin streams of bacteria-rich water were
carrying in the bacteria that eat the bad microbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where the diners are,'' he said of the cloudy,
medium-brown fluid with a topping of thick brown scum. ``Too white
means too much oxygen,'' he said. ``Too black means too high a
sludge density level.'' The brown is just right.
</P>
<P>
   Switching from culinary to medical metaphors, Rickey continued:
``We're like doctors. We ask ourselves: `What is the state, the
condition, of the bacteria? We watch the bacteria's ingestion,
digestion, flow, respiration _ a lot of terms you think of as
medical terms. Waste water treatment is a biological process, a
living thing just like your body.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first pools, the heavier sludge settles to the bottom. In
the secondary pools, the bacteria that are introduced latch onto
the suspended sludge particles, pulling them down to the bottom
like weights on a swimmer. The sludge is removed from the pool
bottoms, dried for a month or longer in storage containers, and
sent to farms in the Midwest for use as fertilizer. Last year, the
city produced 1,200 tons of fertilizer sludge a day.
</P>
<P>
   The water in the final pools is noticeably paler and clearer.
Green algae adhere to the pool's edges, a signal that higher
organisms can also survive in the water. No algae can grow in the
poisonous, oxygen-empty raw sewage that is piped into the plant.
Before the water is released into the East River, chlorine is added
to kill any disease-causing bacteria. The entire treatment process
lasts 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The tour at its end, Rickey tosses out a few of the waste water
trivia questions he has collected in more than two decades in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   When did New York City's stop using well water? In the late
1800s. Around 1890, the city provided its exploding population with
a continuous supply of fresh rainwater when it bought watershed
property upstate. Where was New York City's first waste water
treatment plant? In Coney Island, in the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, a question from the audience: After 25 years, is
Rickey still bothered by the smell from the open pools?
</P>
<P>
   ``Smell?'' he said. ``What smell? It doesn't smell bad. It just
smells different.''

DESIGN ERRORS, POOR COMMUNICATION CITED IN KANSAS BRIDGE CLOSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. CRONKLETON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Design errors, along with lack of
communication between the design and construction teams, led to
problems that forced the closing of the 151st Street bridge in
Olathe, Kan., a consultant's report says.
</P>
<P>
   The report indicates that a lack of oversight also led to damage
to the newly built bridge, and that some of the errors probably
could have been caught by a thorough review of the plans.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of such a review constituted a failure to follow good
engineering practices, according to the report, which the Kansas
Department of Transportation released this week.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge stretches across Interstate 35 and makes up a key
interchange providing access to the Great Mall of the Great Plains.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge was finished in 1995 and cost $3.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   It was closed last month for $3.8 million in repairs because the
abutments supporting the ends of the bridge had shifted a few
inches, causing extensive damage. Engineers are concerned that the
bridge might not be able to handle normal stresses if the abutments
continue to move.
</P>
<P>
   According to an investigation by the Seattle office of the
Nielsen-Wurster Group, a national management consulting and dispute
resolution firm, TranSystems Corp. of Kansas City should be
responsible for $2.3 million of the repair costs.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen-Wurster was hired by the Kansas Department of
Transportation. The group says the abutments failed because, among
other things, parts of the bridge were designed poorly and
inappropriate soils were used when embankments supporting the
abutments where built.
</P>
<P>
   JBM Engineers &AMP; Planners and Boyd Brown Stude &AMP; Cambern designed
the bridge and interchange. The two companies, along with a third
firm, merged in 1995 to form TranSystems.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Weatherford, TranSystems office manager, said that he had
seen the report but that a contract the company had with the
Transportation Department prohibited him from commenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is typical in this type of contract,'' Weatherford said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also criticized APAC-Kansas Inc. Wilkerson-Maxwell
Division of Kansas City, Kan.; GeoSystems Engineering Inc. of
Lenexa, Kan.; and the Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
   The report said APAC-Kansas, the contractor that built the
bridge, should pay $394,462 of the repair costs; GeoSystems, which
did soil testing, should pay $12,521; and the Transportation
Department should pay $495,432.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to APAC-Kansas were not returned Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wendland, engineering manager with GeoSystems, said the
company had received a copy of the report and had no comment at
this time.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Matthews, a spokesman for the Transportation Department,
said the consultant's report would be used to negotiate an
agreement on how the repair costs would be shared.
</P>
<P>
   He said the department hoped an amicable solution would be
reached without litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews said the state considered the report final and
supported its findings. The report said highway officials failed to
catch the design problems and did not properly administer the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are willing to take our licks,'' Matthews said. ``The
oversight was ours, and they dinged us for not fulfilling that
role. The report, however, found that we were not entirely
responsible for the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The report holds Olathe responsible for $552,436 of repair
costs. While Nielsen-Wurster did not find Olathe at fault for any
of the problems, it said that Olathe should pay for some of the
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bridge had been constructed in a manner best fitting
the subsurface conditions at the site, the original construction
cost of the bridge would have been greater,'' according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen-Wurster concluded that Olathe should be responsible for
those costs because it was sharing the original cost of the bridge
with the Transportation Department. The report said that Olathe was
responsible for 80 percent of the overall costs and that the
Transportation Department was responsible for the rest, up to a set
limit.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department maintains that the limit has been
exceeded.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Biery, public works director for Olathe, said the city had
not had a chance to completely review the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was preliminary yet,'' Biery said Monday. ``We
have not had a chance to formulate our full response yet. We also
have not met with our attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   Biery expressed concerns that the city was held responsible for
some of the repair costs. He said the Transportation Department
paid 100 percent of the costs associated with the bridge. He said
Olathe was responsible only for the roadways leading up to it.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Tuesday, Biery said he had nothing to add.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, these are the main errors made in
construction:
</P>
<P>
   - Steel pilings supporting the east abutment were not driven
deep enough to reach bedrock.
</P>
<P>
   GeoSystems' soil and geology tests showed that the site had clay
overlying shale and then limestone. GeoSystems recommended that the
pilings be driven all the way down to the limestone.
</P>
<P>
   In the design, however, the companies that later merged to
become TranSystems used the wrong elevation for the pilings for the
east abutment. Thus, those pilings were resting on shale, which
would not be expected to support the structure adequately.
</P>
<P>
   - The plans failed to specify the use of special soil that would
not expand or shift as much as clay to build the bridge's
embankments. GeoSystems' report had indicated that such special
soil should be used. But the Nielsen-Wurster report said GeoSystems
did not communicate its concerns strongly enough.
</P>
<P>
   The wrong soil was used to build the embankments leading up to
the abutments. When Transportation Department tests showed that the
wrong fill was used, the department did not order APAC-Kansas to
replace it.
</P>
<P>
   - GeoSystems was not asked to review the final plans, despite
specifically requesting to do so. Moreover, the Transportation
Department did not receive a copy of the soil testings until 1993,
nearly four years after they were completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the (errors) would likely have been caught by
a geotechnical review of the plans prior to issuance for
construction,'' the report said. ``Apparently, neither GeoSystems
nor KDOT (Department of Transportation) personnel were requested to
perform such a review.''
</P>
<P>
   - In construction, Transportation Department officials
discovered that the storm drainage system did not adequately handle
surface water from the bridge. Transportation officials made
changes to correct the problems, but those changes were not enough
to prevent storm water from eroding soil supporting the abutments.
</P>
<P>
   - It is thought that the east abutment started to settle in
construction. That movement was not recognized as settling at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, this was thought to be a survey bust (error); but
in retrospect on further review by the surveyor, it seems likely
that this was an early reflection of the settlement of the fill
and/or abutment,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   - Before completion of the bridge, the embankment leading up the
west abutment failed. APAC-Kansas fixed the embankment, but
Transportation Department crews had to repair the embankment again
after construction. At that time, the crews may have damaged the
drainage system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nielsen-Wurster finds that the current situation with the
151st Street bridge is due to a number of adverse circumstances and
irregularities in the design and construction process,'' the report
said. ``The common factor among the majority of these problems is
the poor communication between and among the design and
construction teams.''

LOBBYIST WIELDS ENORMOUS POWER IN JEFFERSON CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ The Senate debate had bogged down over how
to restrict smoking in the Capitol hallways when Sen. Danny Staples
offered a compromise that would limit the inconvenience to
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   A smoking area, Staples suggested, should be designated wherever
lobbyist John Britton was standing. The proposal passed easily.
</P>
<P>
   The approval of the mobile smoking area was a good-natured jab
at Britton, the chain-smoking dean of the Capitol lobbyist corps.
But it also illustrates the deference that lawmakers extend to
Britton, whose personal connections, powerful clients and
reputation as a kingmaker make him one of the most influential
people in Jefferson City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call him `Mr. Britton,' '' said Sen. Joe Maxwell, a Mexico
Democrat now running for lieutenant governor. ``He really is an
awesome presence.''
</P>
<P>
   His influence is evident as this year's legislative session
enters its critical final days. Last week, when a House panel
gutted an effort to toughen Missouri's drunken driving laws, the
first reaction from the bill's supporters was the muttered phrase:
``It's Britton's people.''
</P>
<P>
   Britton, who has tended to the legislative interests of
Anheuser-Busch Inc. for 35 years, is often credited with derailing
any proposal that might put a crimp in beer sales.
</P>
<P>
   But Britton's fingerprints also can be found on legislation
ranging from taxes on cigarettes and deposits on bottles to funding
for arts groups and elimination of blue laws. To many people, he
embodies how and why things get done in Jefferson City.
</P>
<P>
   He downplays his own role with a long pull on his cigarette, a
dismissive flick of the ash and an overly modest self-assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looked at as an abrasive, garrulous old man who at one
time might have had some charm that has become somewhat
tarnished,'' Britton said.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 40 years lobbying the Missouri legislature,
Britton has achieved a rarefied status: He has been at turns
friend, adviser, mentor and sometimes antagonist to two generations
of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the original lobbyists in Missouri,'' said Bob
Johnson, a former state senator from Lee's Summit and now a
lobbyist who once worked for Britton. ``Since he didn't have a lot
of peers, he set the definition of what a successful lobbyist
was.''
</P>
<P>
   A major source of gifts and campaign contributions to his
allies, Britton can also be a bitter adversary who has financed
challengers to run against lawmakers who cross him. And for many
years, Britton helped select and nurture upcoming legislative
leaders _ favors that serve him well when proposals that affect his
clients hang in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   That combination of important connections and raw political
power has given Britton a reputation bordering on the mythical. And
each victory serves to burnish his standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is responsible for Missouri having no deposit on bottles
and cans,'' said Republican Sen. Franc Flotron of St. Louis County.
``They don't even try (any more). They know they would lose. You
put a few heads on spikes outside your office and it gets
results.''  &LR; brkstr:I I I
</P>
<P>
   Britton seems to specialize in working on behalf of
organizations engaged in the legal vices: His clients have included
the Tobacco Institute, Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Co., Station
Casinos, horse racing interests and the Missouri Wine &AMP; Spirits
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose those are the groups most under attack and thought
they needed someone,'' Britton said. ``We had the reputation that
we would fight those types of battles. And remember, most of our
clients we have had for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Britton keeps his presence known by spending liberally and
keeping anyone who asks supplied with beer.
</P>
<P>
   From January 1994 to January 2000, Britton and three associates
reported spending $193,694 on beer, meals, receptions, tickets and
other gifts for lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Alliance for Campaign Reform found that
Anheuser-Busch was the second-largest contributor to legislative
campaigns in 1998, with donations of $82,100. Britton said he will
direct about $75,000 in Anheuser-Busch contributions to legislative
candidates this year.
</P>
<P>
   He can be so effective on behalf of controversial clients that
several lawmakers refer to him only half facetiously as a force for
evil. But that takes into account only part of Britton's efforts.
He has lobbied on behalf of the Kansas City and St. Louis
symphonies and helped pass legislation that created the community
college system. He also has lobbied to improve vocational education
for the disabled and served as an officer of the Missouri Mental
Health Association.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his influence stems from a genuine affection for him
among many lawmakers, who describe him as thoughtful and
philosophical. He sprinkles his conversations with references to
Ralph Waldo Emerson, John Stuart Mill and Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   He is so confident in his role that he often berates legislators
who go against him. Lawmakers talk about watching as House members
cringe and change their votes when Britton yells at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had arrived in the Senate when he started screaming
at me in the hall,'' recalled Flotron, who served six years in the
House before moving to the Senate in 1988. ``And I knew I was a
senator when I screamed back. He's the only one with the nerve to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 74, Britton is still an irascible, forceful personality. Yet
his bald pate, white beard and gravely voice lend him an avuncular
quality _ befitting a man with five children and four stepchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Britton's contradictions might be the key to his success at
representing such a disparate group of clients.
</P>
<P>
   He is a four-pack-a-day smoker who says if he paid attention to
health statistics, he should be dead. A libertarian by nature, he
nonetheless helped gather initial support for the Missouri Arts
Council.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most ironic is this: The chief lobbyist for the
world's largest brewer is an alcoholic, though he has been sober
for more than four decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an ex-drunk,'' Britton said emphatically. ``Don't make it
sound fancier than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that others might see his life's work as a bit
hypocritical. So he turns to a paraphrase of Emerson:
</P>
<P>
   ``Foolish consistencies,'' Britton said, ``are the hobgoblins
that haunt the minds of petty politicians, philosophers and
divines. Say what you believe today in words as hard as
cannonballs, although you may change tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   On his work for Anheuser-Busch, Britton said simply: ``There is
nothing intrinsically evil about alcohol.''  &LR; brkstr:I I I
</P>
<P>
   John Frederick Britton was born Oct. 23, 1925, in Pennsylvania,
but his family moved to the Boston area in the 1930s _ one step
ahead of the rent collector, he said. During World War II he
volunteered for the military and became a paratrooper with the
101st Airborne Division in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was glamorous and it was where the tough guys
went,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he attended Harvard University, where he graduated
in 1949 with a classical education that focused on the humanities.
He eventually joined an advertising firm in New York. It was the
growth industry of the day, but his ``very short and abysmal career
was fraught with failure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't belong there,'' he remembered. ``It was very
structured and I wasn't a conformist. I didn't like them and they
didn't like me.''
</P>
<P>
   After about 18 months, his father got him a job setting pavement
on a road construction crew in Nebraska. The Harvard grad learned a
bit of humility, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He married his wife, Kate, in 1954 and soon landed a job with
the Nebraska Highway Department, writing pamphlets and speeches for
department officials. In 1957, he moved to Jefferson City as
executive director of the Missouri Bituminous Contractors
Association, which represented about a dozen road contractors eager
to cash in on the road-building boom spawned by the launching of
the interstate highway system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, however, the association disbanded and Britton joined
the staff of Attorney General Thomas Eagleton. When Eagleton was
elected lieutenant governor the next year, Britton decided to hang
out his shingle as a hired lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   As a parting gift, Eagleton, who had worked for Anheuser-Busch,
took Britton to meet company chairman August A. ``Gussie'' Busch
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a two-minute interview and he hired me,'' Britton said.
Anheuser-Busch became his first client.  &LR; brkstr:I I I
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, two lawmakers, including then-Rep. Wayne
Goode of St. Louis County, were rabbit hunting near Britton's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had all these dead rabbits as they went past my house and
asked Kate to cook them,'' Britton said. ``They invited their
friends out to the house. One of the guests said, `Hey, next
Monday, we'll bring you some Lebanese food from St. Louis.' The
following week someone brought food from another part of state.
After about four weeks, someone said, `Why don't you just cook
dinner for us?' ''
</P>
<P>
   That started a 15-year tradition where a bipartisan group of
House and Senate leaders would eat at Britton's house almost every
Monday night during the legislative session. Soon, Britton started
inviting young lawmakers whom he thought had leadership potential
to join the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very select group,'' said Sen. Jim Mathewson, a
Sedalia Democrat who became president pro tem from 1989 to 1996.
``If you were invited, it was a real honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The chance to socialize with leadership immediately put
ambitious legislators in Britton's debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more difficult to vote against a friend than
against someone you don't know,'' Mathewson said. ``It was a lot
like voting against someone back home, because you knew you were
going to have to justify it.''
</P>
<P>
   Britton's care and feeding of lawmakers sometimes began before
they took office and continued long after. Mathewson said he met
Britton during his first campaign for a House seat in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to Sedalia just to say hello,'' Mathewson said. ``He
knew my wife's name, kids' names and my political connections. It
was a personal conversation about who I was, not who he was.''
</P>
<P>
   But he could also be vengeful.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Britton had a run-in with then-Rep. Jerry Howard of
Dexter over a bill about chiropractors. Howard criticized Britton
on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ronnie DePasco, a Kansas City Democrat who was elected to
the House that year, said Britton exacted his revenge by
bankrolling a candidate to run against Howard. Britton acknowledged
financing the campaign and working the phones on behalf of Howard's
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Howard lost a close election and was out of the legislature for
11 years before getting back into politics. He is now a state
senator.
</P>
<P>
   Britton was close to House Speaker Kenneth Rothman throughout
the late 1970s. But in 1980, Britton made one of his few missteps:
He backed then-Rep. Joe Holt when the House elected Bob Griffin
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   DePasco, one of the original ``Dirty Dozen'' Griffin supporters,
said Britton was on the outs for the first several of Griffin's 15
years as speaker. That's when he turned over much of his House
lobbying to Jennifer Durham Riks, who has been his partner since
1978.  &LR; brkstr:I I I
</P>
<P>
   After 43 years in the Capitol, Britton still arrives early to
stalk the hallways outside the Senate chamber, swapping stories and
chatting up key lawmakers and legislative staffers.
</P>
<P>
   To many younger lawmakers, Britton's in-your-face lobbying style
can be off-putting, lawmakers and other lobbyists said. Some
lawmakers predict Britton will retire after term limits begin to
take effect in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Britton acknowledges that, as he has grown older than most
lawmakers, his image has suffered a bit. He has more difficulty
identifying with the backgrounds and outlook of the younger
members. But he says he can't see himself taking a course on
medieval poetry at Lincoln University and his eyesight has grown
too bad to shoot pool any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what else I'd do,'' Britton said. ``I have no
plans to retire unless I get lung cancer, I get hit by a truck or I
become so bad at this that I have to (quit). I'll be doing this
until I die.''

<P>
   1, 2, 4, 12, 33, 37. Money ball: 4
</P>
<P>
   That's the ticket! Lottery officials in seven participating Big
Game states worked into the wee hours making their lists and
checking them twice to see whether somebody won the $350 million
jackpot that has been growing since March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Is he or she out there right now, getting a new, unlisted phone
number, or will the jackpot grow, yet again? The answer was not
expected until about 5 a.m. Wednesday, and Georgia Lottery Corp.
officials planned to put the results online by 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   A sole winner would receive either $8.9 million a year for 26
years or a one-time payment of $114 million after taxes. Those
numbers are based on Georgia state taxes, and would change slightly
if the winner bought the ticket in another state.
</P>
<P>
   But whether one person won the whole enchilada, or split it
several ways, chances are excellent that somewhere in Georgia are
several players who matched five white balls to win $150,000 or who
correctly picked four white balls plus the gold Big Money Ball to
win $5,000.

PROSECUTION RESTS IN RAILROAD KILLER TRIAL

c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The man who arrested admitted serial killer Angel
Maturino Resendiz at the Mexican border denied Tuesday that he
promised the fugitive's family anything for their help in
persuading him to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   During the second day of Maturino Resendiz's capital murder
trial, the defense team grilled Texas Ranger Drew Carter in an
effort to show he had tricked the Mexican national into
surrendering in U.S. territory. The Mexican government does not
allow the extradition of citizens who face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Carter insisted he had been forthright with the family and had
explained that Maturino Resendiz could get the death penalty if
convicted of murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't care where he was caught, as long as the
killing stopped,'' Carter testified.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution rested its case after calling 10 witnesses on
Tuesday, including Carter, the Harris County medical examiner and a
DNA expert.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz, 40, has pleaded not guilty by reason of
insanity to the December 1998 slaying and rape of Dr. Claudia
Benton at her West University Place home near Houston.
</P>
<P>
   He has admitted killing Benton and eight other people _ five in
Texas, two in Illinois and one in Kentucky _ while riding railcars
cross-country during a two-year rampage.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Department of Public Safety's elite
investigative team, Carter was asked by West University police to
help investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
   During questioning by prosecutor Devon Anderson, Carter said he
tracked down the wanted man's sister, Manuela Karkiewicz, in New
Mexico. After several meetings, she called Carter on July 11,
saying her brother would surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``She indicated that there might be some stipulations,'' Carter
told the jury. ``I told her we needed to know what they were to see
if we could do anything about them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said she had told him the family wanted him to get an
independent psychiatric evaluation and to be allowed to visit him
while he was in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said she also wanted to know if the family could get any
of the reward money and if there were restrictions on how the
family could use the money.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he could not guarantee anything but would write a
letter to Harris County officials outlining the demands.
</P>
<P>
   After District Attorney John B. Holmes Jr. approved the jail
visits and mental evaluations in writing, Karkiewicz arranged for
Carter to meet Maturino Resendiz on July 13 at an international
bridge connecting El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he shook hands with Maturino Resendiz, allowed him
to hug his sister, then handcuffed him and brought him back.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Karkiewicz has received $86,000 of the reward money and
is eligible for another $40,000 if her brother is convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Allen Tanner said Carter had only befriended
the sister as a ruse, especially since other agencies had been
``rough with her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you lead her to believe: `Manuela you help us, I'll help
your brother'?'' Tanner asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No sir,'' Carter replied.
</P>
<P>
   The ranger acknowledged that he had prayed with the family and
had offered to help answer any questions, but that he was always
upfront with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you were in New Mexico and Manuela was making demands,
did she also say she wanted her brother to be treated humanely?''
Tanner asked.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he never used the word ``humane'' in the
discussions, telling Karkiewicz only that Maturino Resendiz would
receive ``fair treatment under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She asked me specifically about the death penalty,'' Carter
testified. ``I informed her that the crime her brother was
suspected of was a capital crime in Texas and the death penalty was
an option that could be pursued.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was aware of that and even made the comment that it was
better to have capital punishment than rot in jail your whole
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Harris County Medical Examiner Joye Carter
testified that Benton had broken her right arm struggling for her
life while being bludgeoned, stabbed and then raped.
</P>
<P>
   Benton's head was hit 19 times with a bronze statuette and she
was stabbed three times in the back with such force that the
kitchen knife used pierced her chest completely. Both lungs were
punctured.
</P>
<P>
   As she lay face down on a bedroom floor, her head covered in a
plastic bag, Benton was sexually assaulted. Carter said it could
not be determined if she was still alive when the rape occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Semen samples collected from the scene were linked to Maturino
Resendiz, said Edith Emrick, a DNA analyzer for the Texas
Department of Public Safety. She said the chance that the semen
came from someone other than Maturino Resendiz was one in more than
six billion.
</P>
<P>
   The defense is scheduled to begin arguing its case Wednesday.
During opening statements, Tanner told the jury Maturino Resendiz
had killed all nine people, but that he was insane at the time and
had turned himself in to seek treatment.

PATAKI OFFERS NASSAU COUNTY A BAILOUT, REQUIRING BIG BUDGET CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki went to Nassau County on
Tuesday offering a $100 million state bailout to help one of the
nation's wealthiest counties avert financial chaos.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the debt-ridden county has to allow the state to
monitor its finances and future budgets and agree to make large
spending cuts over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   If the politically fractured county fails to make the required
spending cuts _ $50 million this year and an additional $70 million
in each of the next three years _ the state will withhold the aid
and impose a more powerful financial control board with the power
to tell the county what cuts to make and even to abrogate civil
service contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a carrot and stick,'' Pataki said as he announced the
plan, which he said could restore the county to fiscal stability
without raising taxes. His proposal requires the approval of county
officials and the State Legislature; leaders of both parties on
both levels of government reacted favorably to the plan on Tuesday
and said they expected it to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The governor took the extraordinary steps of intervening in the
affairs of a local government _ and of pledging millions in state
aid to the wealthy county _ after years of unbalanced budgeting
left Nassau County running out of money during one of the longest
periods of economic prosperity in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would include $100 million in state aid spread out over
five years and would set up a financial authority with the ability
to sell new bonds, guaranteed by the county's sales tax revenue.
That would allow Nassau County to borrow money at a lower interest
rate than the county, whose bonds are hovering just above junk
status, can now get on its own. The arrangement is intended to buy
the county time while it makes severe, long-term spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his fiscal recovery plan, the governor said that
he wanted to ensure that a county of vital economic importance to
the state did not go bankrupt. Credit rating agencies have already
threatened to reduce the county's bond rating to junk status if it
does not put a financial plan in place by June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted guardedly. ``This gives them more time, but
it highlights the necessity to come up with real, ongoing changes
in the fiscal operation of the county,'' said Steven Murphy, a
managing director at Standard &AMP; Poor's, the credit rating agency.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor's actions have a political impact as well: the
fiscal crisis already led Nassau County, long one of the state's
most solid Republican bastions, to elect a Democratic majority to
its County Legislature in November. And Republicans fear that
continuing anger over the county's finances could mean more losses
this November in races for the State Legislature, the U.S. Senate
and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The plan that was announced on Tuesday has been in the works
since March, when Pataki appointed Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of
the group that runs the Nasdaq stock exchange, as his special
adviser on Nassau County. Zarb found that the county's 2000 budget
of $2.2 billion was $178 million short, and that if no action were
taken the deficit would balloon to $233 million next year and $321
million by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb painted a grim portrait of Nassau's fiscal practices,
noting that the county had become increasingly dependent on selling
off its assets and borrowing money through bonds to meet its
expenses, which have grown drastically as its spending far outpaced
the rate of inflation. The county is now $2.7 billion in debt; Zarb
found that the county spent roughly one out of every five dollars
servicing its debt.
</P>
<P>
   And he noted that Nassau's antiquated property tax system _ the
county has already agreed to overhaul it _ had forced it to borrow
$800 million to pay refunds to people who successfully challenged
their taxes, and to pay interest on that money.
</P>
<P>
   To put the county back on its feet, the governor proposed the
creation of the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, which would sell
new bonds backed by the county's sales tax at a lower cost to the
county and refinance the county's existing debt so that it could be
paid back in smaller installments over a longer time.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the authority would have the power to monitor the
county's finances.
</P>
<P>
   If the county met its obligations, it would get $100 million in
state aid over the next five years, and the state would give the
county an additional $5 million to hire lawyers and assessors to
help the county reduce its backlog of tax refund claims.
</P>
<P>
   But if the county failed to immediately cut $50 million in
spending and adopt a balanced four-year financial plan, the state
would appoint a control board with the power to tell the county
what cuts to make.

 QUIP CAUSES BLIP FOR EXCITEATHOME  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ExciteAtHome shares briefly soared 60 percent
Tuesday after a news report suggested that Comcast, the cable
television company, would be interested in buying a majority stake
in the Redwood City, Calif., Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   But ExciteAtHome's stock quickly tumbled back to earth after
observers said the remark, made by a Comcast executive during a
panel discussion, was intended as a joke. Three different sources
said a Bloomberg News reporter was mistaken in taking the comments
literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comcast is not making a bid to take over ExciteAtHome,'' said
ExciteAtHome spokeswoman Melissa Walia. A source close to Comcast
confirmed that the company has no plans to buy ExciteAtHome.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would have been especially surprising given that
Comcast and Cox Communications agreed in March to sell their stakes
in ExciteAtHome to AT&AMP;T for as much as $3 billion. AT&AMP;T spokesman
Steve Lang said the company is ``happy with the arrangement'' and
has no plans to modify the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Comcast President Brian Roberts still said he was bullish on
ExciteAtHome during a panel discussion at the National Cable
Television Association's annual meeting in New Orleans. He said the
company is still a `'strategic asset.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned to his counterpart from AT&AMP;T and jokingly said:
``If you want to flip the deal, we'd buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bloomberg News service, taking the remark seriously, quickly
dispatched a story headlined: ``Comcast President Interested in
AT&AMP;T's Excite Stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which closed Monday at $17.50, raced up to $28 in
heavy trading before the companies denied the story. Shares closed
at $19.94, up $2.44. ExciteAtHome was the second-most-actively
traded stock yesterday. Its shares had fallen 78 percent in the
past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Both AT&AMP;T and Comcast declined to comment on the Bloomberg
story. But privately, some people complained that Bloomberg did not
report the tone and context of the remarks, which would have made
it clear that Roberts was probably joking. The company also
dispatched the story before it had had a chance to ask any of the
companies to comment on the remarks.
</P>
<P>
   A Bloomberg spokesman, Chris Taylor, defended the story. ``It's
what he said, and no one is denying that,'' she said, adding that
Bloomberg was planning to post audio excerpts of the speech so that
``readers can decide for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also said that it is the news service's responsibility to
report what is said as fast as possible, since such comments can
potentially move the markets, and that the company considered it
more important to report the words ``rather than the
interpretation.''

JUDGES' RULING COULD HELP END USE OF ELECTRIC CHAIR IN NEBRASKA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) If a three-judge panel convening Wednesday decides
Raymond Mata Jr. deserves life in prison for killing and
dismembering a 3-year-old boy, Mata's personal battle against
electrocution in Nebraska becomes moot.
</P>
<P>
   But if the panel votes for death, some legal experts predict
that the case could lead to the end of the electric chair in
Nebraska _ one of only two remaining states that mandate
electrocution for prisoners sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   Scotts Bluff County District Judge Robert Hippe ruled Monday in
connection with Mata's case that Nebraska's particular method of
electrocution _ four separate jolts of electricity _ amounts to
cruel and unusual punishment. Witnesses testified that the short
delays between jolts increase the chances the prisoner will suffer
excruciating pain.
</P>
<P>
   Hippe did not rule against the death penalty, per se. But his
ruling forces the state attorney general's office to assure the
court that Nebraska's method of execution ``removes the potential
for infliction of unnecessary pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska case is unusual in that his attorneys challenged
the Nebraska method of execution after Mata was convicted in
January, but before reaching the punishment phase. If the state
judicial panel Wednesday rules for the death penalty, the question
of how death should be carried out will likely continue. The state
attorney general's office has vowed to appeal any ruling declaring
the electric chair unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   If the panel rules Mata should get a life sentence, Hippe's
ruling will not be binding. However, Mata's attorneys believe it
will have implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think practically speaking, other inmates who are on death
row and other people who are charged with first-degree murder ...
their attorneys will (make similar claims to cruelty) knowing that
there was at least one favorable ruling from a well respected
district judge,'' said one of Mata's attorneys, Jim Mowbray.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Nebraska's first execution was in 1903. Eight men
had been hanged by 1913, when the state Legislature switched to
electrocution. Fifteen men have since died in Nebraska's electric
chair, the last on Dec. 2, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has not reviewed electrocution since New
York executed its first prisoner in the electric chair in 1890.
Electricity was the new technology of the day, and advocates were
eager to find novel applications for it.
</P>
<P>
   Only Nebraska and Alabama mandate electrocution for executions.
Georgia and Florida switched to lethal injection this year.
</P>
<P>
   Florida was pressured to abandon electrocution after witnesses
to a series of grisly executions questioned whether the condemned
prisoners were, for all practical purposes, tortured. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Nebraska and Alabama will likely abandon electrocution within a
year, speculates Fordham University law professor Deborah Denno,
who testified in the Florida case. Both state legislatures have
introduced lethal-injection measures in recent sessions, she said,
and the rarity of electrocution is, in itself, a viable argument
that it is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The last man to die in the electric chair was Robert Lee Tarver,
executed April 14 in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Tarver's attorney, Bryan Stevenson of the Equal Justice
Initiative in Montgomery, said he expects the Nebraska Legislature
would change its method of execution rather than be forced to
defend it before the U.S. Supreme Court. ``I've seen it happen in
other states,'' he said.

 DIGERATI AND OTHERS PONDER NEW ECONOMY  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An all-star cast of luminaries from government,
technology and academia Tuesday gathered at a posh Portola Valley,
Calif., home to discuss Washington's policies toward the
much-vaunted ``New Economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending the government's stand on antitrust issues and the
Microsoft case, Justice Department antitrust chief Joel Klein told
a largely admiring crowd of tech executives and venture capitalists
that, when it comes to assessing the abuses of monopoly power, the
new economy is just like the old.
</P>
<P>
   ``While technology changes, human nature does not,'' he said,
pointing to the Sherman Act of 1890 as the Magna Carta of a free
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Klein quoted dire predictions made a quarter century ago that
the breakup of AT&AMP;T would kill the goose that laid the golden egg.
Instead, that divestiture unleashed remarkable competition that
lead to the rise of the Internet and such technologies as
broadband, wireless and vfiber optics, as well as lower consumer
prices for phone service, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he argued that splitting Microsoft into two
companies, one for operating systems and one for application
software, will produce ``substantial innovation and competition in
the software business.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporting Klein's argument, venture capitalists such as Mark
Kvamme of Sequoia Capital acknowledged that precious little VC
money has gone to fund companies making software for PCs. ``If
there's a breakup, that could change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Doerr of Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &AMP; Byers was even more
blunt. His firm has an ``unwritten rule (that) we would never
invest in anything even remotely competitive with Microsoft,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The daylong forum at the sprawling, wooded estate of real estate
magnate Walter Shorenstein was sponsored by the Haas School of
Business at UC Berkeley and modeled on the annual World Economic
Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the Hass School dean, drew on her
connections from her tenure as President Clinton's economic adviser
to lure top administration officials, including Klein, Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers and Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Roger
Ferguson, to address the crowd of some 40 technology power brokers,
economists and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   On the economic front, Ferguson said he was ``cautiously
optimistic that the recent rapid productivity growth _ an annual
gross domestic product growth of 4.25 percent for the past five
years _ will continue in the future. His remarks came a week before
the Fed's next expected interest rate hike.
</P>
<P>
   Several people at the meeting warned, however, that a shortage
of skilled workers could be a negating factor on continued economic
growth. ``I wonder how many highly educated, experienced people are
left,'' said Sequoia's Kvamme. ``We will pay anything for these
people.''
</P>
<P>
   George Shaheen, chief executive of Internet grocer Webvan, said
he sees a fresh supply of tech workers coming from college
campuses. ``Their worst nightmare is to have to go back into that
old economy to seek their future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although yesterday's tech boosterism was being preached to the
choir, even some of the most fervent cheerleaders expressed some
reservations about Wall Street valuations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love Cisco,'' said Stephen Roach, chief economist for
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Still, he said, ``there's no way to
justify a triple-digit (price-earning) ratio for that stock.''

 &HT;    Are you the multimillionaire?
 &HT;    (Eds: Fixes winning numbers, recasts lede.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ 1, 2, 12, 33, 37. Money ball: 4.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the numbers drawn Tuesday night in Atlanta in the
record-jackpot Big Game lottery drawing. Lottery officials in seven
participating Big Game states worked into the wee hours making
their lists and checking them twice to see whether somebody won the
$350 million jackpot that has been growing since March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Is he or she out there right now, getting a new, unlisted phone
number, or will the jackpot grow, yet again? The answer was not
expected until about 5 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A sole winner would receive either $8.9 million a year for 26
years or a one-time payment of $114 million after taxes. Those
numbers are based on Georgia state taxes, and would change slightly
if the winner bought the ticket in another state.

 SALES SURGE AGAIN AT CISCO  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Despite concerns that it could be overvalued,
Cisco Systems reassured Wall Street on Tuesday by ringing up
another solid quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose, Calif., Internet infrastructure company reported
sales surged 55 percent to $4.92 billion for the third fiscal
quarter, which ended April 29. That's well ahead of analysts'
predictions of $4.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company's profits, excluding acquisitions and
other special charges, came in at 14 cents per share, a penny ahead
of estimates, according to First Call and within the range of
``whisper estimates.'' Profits jumped 58 percent to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Including acquisition costs, taxes and other charges, earnings
increased slightly to $662 million, 9 cents a share, up from $636
million, or 9 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a solid quarter,'' said Chase H&AMP;Q analyst Erik
Suppiger. He was especially impressed with the company's enterprise
division. The unit, which sells networking equipment to
corporations, saw a 20 percent increase in sales from the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco shares closed Tuesday, before the earnings announcement,
unchanged at $62.75. The stock seemed to hold steady in immediate
after-hours trading. Since Cisco is the most valuable technology
firm in terms of market value, its earnings announcements can
potentially have a major effect on the market as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was also significant because Cisco shares
tumbled more than 7 percent on Monday after a scorching cover story
appeared in Barron's, arguing that Cisco is overvalued and could
have trouble maintaining its growth through acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   An illustration depicted Cisco, and the 58 companies it has
swallowed, as a deck of cards. It also pointed out that Cisco had a
sky-high price-earnings ratio _ 129 as of Tuesday, compared to 40
for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the article did not contain any specific bomb shells
about Cisco. And Cisco executives said the quarter demonstrates
their financials are solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows continued strong momentum across the board,'' said
Chief Strategy Officer Mike Volpi. Executives also said their $6.9
billion purchase of Cerent, an obscure Petaluma, Calif., optics
company, is already paying off. By next quarter, Volpi said Cisco
could be on track to generating $1 billion in annual sales from
fiber optics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chief Executive John Chambers warned that the company
needs to do a better job forecasting its supply needs, especially
in newer markets like optics. Companies like Cisco have been having
a tough time finding adequate supplies in some markets, like
cellular and fiber optics. ``It's a little bit of a concern,''
Chambers said in a conference call with analysts. But Volpi said
the shortages hasn't had any financial impact so far.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco also confirmed that the Securities and Exchange Commission
is investigating possible insider trading just before it bought
Arrowpoint Communications of Acton, Mass., for $5.7 billion Friday.
But Volpi said the SEC has looked into five of the six acquisitions
it has made of publicly traded companies. ``It is very common,''
Volpi said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Cisco has grown, surpassing Microsoft in market value
and gobbling up potential competitors, the company has faced
questions about whether it could attract added scrutiny from
federal antitrust regulators. It enjoys roughly an 80 percent
market share in its core market of a device called routers, which
direct bits of traffic over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But Chambers insisted the parallels end there. He said Cisco
emphasizes open standards _ so its routers will work with other
companies' networking hardware. By contrast, software written for
Linux won't run on Windows, for instance. (Rivals gripe that Cisco
equipment is designed to work better with other Cisco equipment.)
</P>
<P>
   He also said the company faces stiff competition from hundreds
of startups, which can quickly grow into publicly traded rivals
like Juniper Networks and Sycamore. And Chambers insisted it hasn't
bullied other companies or sold products at a loss to drive out
competition _ two things Microsoft has been accused of. ``We get
along with most of our competitors,'' he said.

 FED READY TO RATCHET UP RATES  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ New economy? Maybe, says the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the central bank won't keep using the
old-economy remedy of pushing up interest rates by as much as half
a percentage point to beat back inflation, the Fed's top official
in the West signaled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Parry, in a
speech at a meeting of financial planners in the city, praised the
spread of computer technology, which, he said, is allowing workers
to produce more goods and services with the same amount of labor.
That has fueled boom times with, until recently, little upward
pressure on prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Fed policymakers have been worrying the economy has such a
strong a head of steam that surging productivity can no longer keep
prices at bay. To cool things down, monetary policymakers ratcheted
up short-term interest rates five times since last summer, from
4.75 percent to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Fed may be poised to raise rates at a faster pace. In an
unusually broad hint, Parry said policymakers might play ``a second
note,'' when the central bank's rate-setting committee meets next
week.
</P>
<P>
   The comment was taken to mean that the Fed might raise its
target for short-term interest rates by more than the quarter-point
baby steps it has taken so far. ``He was trying to say that a
half-percentage-point increase is more likely than anything else,''
said Robert MacIntosh, chief economist at Eaton Vance, a Boston
money management firm.
</P>
<P>
   Parry made the remark in response to a question whether the Fed
will abandon its cautious policy of small rate hikes, given signs
that the economy may be overheating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have moved cautiously, but that doesn't mean we only have a
single note to play,'' he added. ``I'm not sure I would consider a
second note inconsistent with caution.''
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's rate-setting committee includes seven Federal
Reserve governors and 12 district bank presidents. Only five of the
presidents have voting privileges, which are rotated on a yearly
basis. Parry is a voting member this year.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, higher interest rates haven't taken much of a bite
out of economic growth. But a half-point increase, particularly if
it is followed by further rate hikes, could finally put a chill in
the economy by raising borrowing costs, slowing job growth, making
housing more expensive and putting downward pressure on stock and
bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional economic wisdom holds that fast economic growth and
low unemployment rates feed inflation. But proponents of the new
economy theory believe technology lowers the cost of doing business
so dramatically that rapid growth is possible without inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the new economy crowd has had plenty of
evidence on its side. Despite the longest expansion in U.S.
history, inflation has remained below 2 percent annually in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   While inflation was subdued, the Fed at least partly embraced
the new economy argument, Parry said. That dictated a policy of
gradual rate increases, even as the economy surged forward at a
pace that might once have prompted the Fed to come out with guns
blazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to proceed with some caution, because there's a fair
bit of uncertainty about the economy's behavior right now,'' Parry
said.
</P>
<P>
   As economic growth accelerates and signs of inflation reappear,
it's becoming harder for the Fed to maintain that posture. In the
past few weeks, said MacIntosh, ``We've seen the first really
negative numbers,'' including evidence that inflation is well above
2 percent again.
</P>
<P>
   Fed watchers say the central bank may combine dovish words and
hawkish actions, as it tries to reconcile its inflation-fighting
mandate and its new economy sympathies.

NET WORTH: BIG TECH INVESTORS HAVEN'T UNFASTENED SEAT BELTS
JUST  YET
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It was a sober crowd at the Chase H&AMP;Q Technology
Conference luncheon Tuesday, and not just because there was no wine
on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Four professional investors gave their outlook for tech stocks,
and none of them is expecting a repeat of the mad acceleration that
took tech stocks to breakneck speeds until they hit the wall in a
fiery crash.
</P>
<P>
   We have just experienced a ``a world-class speculative blow
off,'' said Roger McNamee of Integral Capital Partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had $2 stocks masquerading as $200 stocks. Now they're
masquerading as $50 stocks. Valuations are still very high.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that when the 1990s started, technology was 6
percent of gross domestic product and 5 percent of the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index. Most investors were underweighted in tech,
meaning that it represented less than 5 percent of their
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 1990s, tech accounted for 10 percent of GDP
and 30 percent of the S&AMP;P 500, and most investors were overweighted
in technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never again enjoy the benefits of the tech S&AMP;P
weighting moving from 5 percent to 30 percent,'' McNamee said.
</P>
<P>
   The other panelists tried to put a positive spin on things, but
there was also a lot of talk about the V-word.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become much more concerned about valuations,'' said
Joe McNay, CEO of Essex Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Appledorn, senior manager with Munder Capital Management,
called the term ``Internet valuations'' an oxymoron but has tried
to make some sense of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have re-evaluated every position,'' said Appledorn, who
helps manage the Munder Net Net fund. He said the old PEG ratio _
which says a company is fairly valued when its price-earnings ratio
equals its expected earnings-growth rate _ ``is not a bad place to
operate from.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the session, someone asked the question
everyone wanted to hear. It went something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, Intel, Cisco and Dell have emerged as the dominant
tech stocks. Do you still believe in those companies? And over the
next five years, who will be the next ``four horsemen'' of
technology?
</P>
<P>
   McNamee said he considers Microsoft a ``great value'' at today's
prices and thinks a breakup of the company would be a boon to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am stunned at the way Oracle has reinvented itself'' as an
Internet company, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But he had harsh words for Dell. ``Its days as an industry
leader are fading,'' he said, adding that the company has ``lost
control of the supply chain.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that one of the future ``horsemen'' will be Viant,
which describes itself as ``an integrated strategy and solutions
partner'' that has ``pioneered powerful approaches for successfully
incubating and launching e-commerce enterprises.''
</P>
<P>
   McNamee also thinks investors are so focused on virtual
companies that they have neglected the ``physical side'' of the
business, especially contract manufacturers. He said Flextronics is
the ``most visionary'' company in this field, but Solectron is also
``incredibly well positioned.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the other panelists, Jay Hoag, a general partner with
Technology Crossover Ventures, said, ``Ariba has the opportunity to
become the defining company in the B2B space.''
</P>
<P>
   McNay is betting on Phone.com, which provides software for
delivering Internet services to wireless phones; Broadcom, which
sells chips for high-speed telecommunications; and Brocade
Communications, which provides components for high-end data storage
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Appledorn named Oracle, Ariba (B2B software), InfoSpace
(Internet services) and Critical Path (e-mail outsourcing for
business).
</P>
<P>
   All four companies, he said, are ``leaders in their industries,
extremely well managed, know how to partner and have great revenue
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Appledorn confessed to being the only investor to raise his hand
at Monday's Chase H&AMP;Q luncheon, when venture capitalist Stewart
Alsop asked who would buy Webvan at $6.25 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Appledorn, who has been buying the online grocer since it went
public, described it as a ``lottery ticket'' that will either win
big or go to zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in the management. We believe conceptually in what
they are doing,'' Appledorn said. But he said the company needs to
increase its average order size, get up to full capacity in its
warehouses and work out the kinks in its distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at least 12 months away from getting a clear signal
which way they are going to go,'' he said.

 GROW A BUSINESS: FOCUSING ON QUALITY IS TRAILBLAZING TECHNIQUE  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Home remodeler Judith Thompson's flourishing
business illustrates how entrepreneurs can sometimes avoid the mass
market and succeed in the process.
</P>
<P>
   She has built a $20 million-a-year construction business with
about 80 employees by focusing on quality rather than quantity. Her
San Francisco company, Thompson Brooks, has become the largest
woman-owned remodeling company in the country by working with only
about 10 clients at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it helps that her market is San Francisco,
neighboring Marin County, and Silicon Valley, where upscale clients
are happy to spend millions to buy a property and millions more to
tear it apart. Two of Thompson's current customers are spending
about $5 million each on fixer-uppers in San Francisco's Pacific
Heights neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Thompson will join Venture Strategy Group founder
Joanna Rees Gallanter and Bread &AMP; Roses founder Mimi Farina as
winners of the Woman Entrepreneur of the Year awards of the San
Francisco chapter of the National Association of Women Business
Owners. NAWBO, as it is known, has 82 chapters and more than 6,600
members across the country, and the local chapter has been
spotlighting top entrepreneurs since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is receiving this year's ``Trailblazer'' award for
building her successful remodeling business during the past decade
and serving as a mentor to other entrepreneurs. But Thompson tried
several careers before remodeling. She started as a high school
counselor and art teacher and then house painter in Chicago and San
Francisco. In 1987, she sold her local painting company, Windy City
West, and went to architecture school.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Thompson decided she wanted to be a general
contractor, not an architect, and started with a $20,000 bathroom
renovation in the Western Addition neighborhood. Today, she
wouldn't touch such a small project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easier to do 10 big jobs than 200 small ones,'' said
Thompson. Her firm has never advertised and depends entirely on
word of mouth for new business. Thompson said that has never been a
problem. ``We're very service oriented and do perfect work.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanna Rees Gallanter will receive NAWBO's ``Rising Star'' award
for her venture capital fund, Venture Strategy, which she started
in 1996 and which has $200 million in capital.
</P>
<P>
   Gallanter decided to get into venture capital after spending
most of her career in consumer products for such brands as Digital
Equipment, Evian water, Gravy Train and Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   After learning about the financial side at San Francisco's
Vrolyk &AMP; Co. and BA Securities Private Placement Group, she started
her own firm and is focusing on the nexus of branding and
business-to-business exchanges and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the companies Venture Strategy invested in, Post
Communications and Allbusiness.com, were recently acquired by
Netcentives and NBC Internet, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Mimi Farina is receiving the ``Community Advocate Award.'' For
25 years, her Bread &AMP; Roses charity organization has brought live
performances to prisons, hospitals and senior homes.
</P>
<P>
   EMERGING MARKETS: State Treasurer Philip Angelides, California's
chief investment officer, will launch an initiative today to get
public pension plans and state and local governments to invest $8
billion in California's ``at-risk communities.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, Angelides noted, the state's two largest
pension funds have invested more than $5 billion in overseas
emerging markets while some California communities remain in
serious need of capital.
</P>
<P>
   The treasurer's ``Double Bottom Line'' initiative calls for the
California Public Employees Retirement System and California State
Teachers' Retirement System to invest at least 2 percent of their
more than $270 billion portfolios _ more than $5 billion _ in
California emerging market opportunities by December 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for $600 million of additional home loans
for low- and moderate-income Californians, $1 billion in new state
deposits in California financial institutions and more than $1
billion in new urban investment programs.

 YIPES STRIKES RICH VEIN OF VC FUNDING  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Yipes Communications Inc. was one of the big
recipients of venture capital dollars in the past quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco startup that seeks to eliminate the so-called
bandwidth bottleneck between high-speed corporate networks and
cross-country fiber-optic networks raised $77 million on March 8.
</P>
<P>
   The year-old company took Ethernet technology developed for
local area networks and found a way to pump the signals through
glass fiber at similar high speed over 40-plus miles.
</P>
<P>
   Yipes leases access to glass fiber rings to corporate customers
in a growing number of cities and lets them order just the service
they need in 1-megabit increments all the way to 1 gigabit (a
billion bits per second).
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses are demanding faster, simpler and more scalable
networking services,'' said Yipes Chief Executive Officer Jerry
Parrick. ``We are offering bandwidth on demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than having to order T1 (1.5 megabits per second), DS-3
(45 mbps) or other fixed-capacity lines from telecommunications
suppliers and waiting weeks or months to get the fixed-capacity
systems installed, Yipes customers can order the networking
capacity they need and expand it as their needs change.
</P>
<P>
   The company also says it offers significant cost advantages _
providing roughly twice the bandwidth at 80 percent of the price of
traditional data communications services. Another advantage for
many businesses that already have Ethernet systems is that they
don't need to change existing protocols to use the high-speed
linkup.
</P>
<P>
   Yipes' service is available only in a few markets including Palo
Alto, Calif.; San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, Denver and Los
Angeles. One client, the Palo Alto Medical Foundation, uses Yipes'
high-speed links between its Palo Alto campus, satellite clinics
and the Internet for sending teleconferencing, interactive
learning, CT scan images and other data in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Yipes, which expects to serve 15 major U.S. cities by the end of
the year, so far has raised $91 million to build its network.
Venture capital investors include Norwest Venture Partners, New
Enterprise Associates, the Sprout Group/DLJ, Chase Capital Partners
and BancBoston Ventures/Robertson Stephens. Strategic corporate
investors include Juniper Networks, Extreme Networks and Intel
Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, Yipes plans to tap big telecommunications and
other companies in a late round of financing before going public.
For an Internet infrastructure company pioneering new services,
Parrick said, ``There's no such thing as too much money.''
</P>
<P>
   Yipes, with more than 200 employees, is growing fast. Like many
other high-tech startups in downtown San Francisco, it occupies
temporary offices under renovation, with phone lines festooned from
the ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Before Yipes, Parrick headed data groups at US West and Pacific
Bell and then founded Diamond Lane Communications, a Petaluma,
Calif., DSL equipment supplier that was purchased by Nokia a year
ago for $125 million.
</P>
<P>
   To go along with his second startup's catchy technology, Parrick
was looking for a catchy name. The company paid a branding firm
$25,000 and received about 700 suggestions, including Lightrider
and Metrocrossing.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, management decided to follow the Yahoo approach of
trying to describe a potential customer's emotional reaction to
using the service.
</P>
<P>
   A marketing manager suggested ``Yikes,'' as in ``yikes that's
fast.'' Parrick fine-tuned it to ``Yipes,'' which also happens to
be an anagram of ``yes'' and the initials for ``Internet
Protocol.''

 VENTURE CASH IS FLOWING FAST  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Venture capital investors poured more than $1
billion a week into promising U.S. startups in the first quarter,
and Bay Area companies once again received a disproportionate share
of the bounty.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. venture-backed companies raised $17.8 billion in 1,040
rounds, according to VentureOne, a San Francisco VC research firm.
Bay Area companies accounted for a third of the total _ 342 of the
deals and nearly 6.3 billion of the dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The local numbers are not that much different from the torrid
totals from the fourth quarter of 1999. But the number of deals in
the most-recent quarter is nearly double the number in the first
quarter of 1999 and the amount raised is more than triple.
</P>
<P>
   The big winners in the past quarter were companies that provide
fiber-optic communications and networking services. Kestrel
Solutions raised $105 million; Telseon, $80 million; Yipes
Communications, $77 million; and Optical Networks, $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has invaded nearly every area venture capital
investing, including financial and medical services. Web-related
investments now account for 84 percent of all the dollars compared
with 60 percent a year ago and just 41 percent two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, not all Internet sectors are equally attractive.
VentureOne research director Sasha Talebi reports that more than
half the Internet dollars in the past quarter went to business
services companies. Internet infrastructure companies also were
popular.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investments in business-to-consumer and other
e-commerce companies dropped to 5 percent of the total from 12
percent in the fourth quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
   The rules of the venture capital game have changed some since
many dot-com darlings and other high-tech stocks hit the skids on
Wall Street last month.
</P>
<P>
   The private equity markets are buffered somewhat from what
happens in the public market. But many venture capital investors
are now more picky.
</P>
<P>
   Talebi suggests that they are taking a rifle instead of shotgun
approach and are targeting companies that have a technology edge, a
clear market advantage or real profit potential. Venture capital
investors are also demanding more for their money, meaning that
entrepreneurs have to give up greater stakes for the same amount of
cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question there will be a shakeout,'' said John
Taylor, director of research for National Venture Capital
Association in Arlington, Va. ``You can only have so many people
selling dog food over the Internet.'' But he says the quality of
ideas and entrepreneurs is still very high and the reservoir of
available capital remains at record levels.
</P>
<P>
   Venture Economics of Newark, N.J., reports that VC firms
nationwide raised $46.1 billion in capital last year and corporate
funds raised an additional $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As fledgling companies require more capital to build their
businesses and establish a dominant market position, the size of
venture capital investments is growing, too. The median U.S.
investment in the past quarter was $12 million, compared with $6
million a year ago. In the Bay Area, the median investment
increased to $13.25 million from $6.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the past quarter, 38 local companies received $50 million or
more from venture capital and other private-equity investors,
compared with only 16 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list of companies that raised the most is
AdvisorTech Corp. of San Francisco. The Internet-based financial
services company that was started two years ago by former Charles
Schwab President Timothy McCarthy raised $125 million from a
variety of investors, including Whitney &AMP; Co., Chase H&AMP;Q and
California State Teachers' Retirement System.
</P>
<P>
   AdvisorTech is using the Internet to provide proprietary
research on mutual fund selection, trading services and record
keeping to financial advisers outside the United States. Its first
market is Japan, where households have $12 trillion to invest but
only 9 percent of it is invested in mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``AdvisorTech provides the resources that enable both
independent financial advisers and institutional clients overseas
to better compete in the Internet age,'' said McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Not all newly financed dot-coms are startups. Dove Brothers, a
Foster City industrial auctioneer that started in 1937, changed its
name to DoveBid and raised $109.5 million to convert to an online
business.
</P>
<P>
   Customers such as Raytheon and General Dynamics can go to
Dovebid.com to buy and sell everything from computers to office
furnishings to manufacturing equipment. Investors include Softbank
Capital Partners, Texas Pacific Group, Yahoo Inc., Sun Microsystems
Inc., Fremont Ventures and Mayfield Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Venture Economics reports that VC firms invested $22.7 billion
in 1,557 U.S. entrepreneurial companies in the first quarter, up
266 percent from the $6.2 billion invested in the like quarter last
year. Its numbers are higher than VentureOne's numbers because it
includes more corporate investments and other private placements.
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-year, investments in Northern California startups jumped
the most _ 347 percent, to $7.9 billion from $1.8 billion.
Meanwhile, investment in the Northeast grew 296 percent, to $5.4
billion from $1.4 billion; and investment in the Southeast jumped
253 percent, to $1.8 billion from $525 million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent slowdown in initial public offerings, many VC
investors still favor IPOs as their so-called exit strategy. In the
past quarter, 69 venture-backed companies went public, according to
VentureOne. That compares with 75 in the fourth quarter and just 23
in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers and acquisitions remain a viable alternative to selling
shares to the public. In the first quarter of this year, VentureOne
reports 88 VC-backed companies were bought for $42.7 billion. That
topped the $40.9 billion paid for 276 companies during all of last
year.

<P>
   MIAMI _ After the chaos he triggered in the minds of the Heat
players, near the end of a game he had scrambled with his rugged
style, the emotionally restrained Charlie Ward carried on as usual
once the rest of his team caught on to the mood he established.
</P>
<P>
   He simply faded into the background down the stretch. His work
was nearly done. For three quarters, Ward barged into the chest of
Alonzo Mourning when his teammates shied away. For three quarters
he carried the Knicks when Patrick Ewing, Allan Houston and Latrell
Sprewell could not find the basket as the Heat hovered over their
every move. For three quarters, Ward popped 3-pointers to puncture
the spirits of the Heat players.
</P>
<P>
   After he gave his team a nice lead, Ward stepped aside and let
his teammates frolic in the fourth quarter. It was almost too much
for them to handle. After some flashy dunks by Sprewell and the
late arrival of Houston's jumper, the Knicks built an 18-point,
fourth-quarter lead, only to allow the Heat to close within 7
points before ending the suspense with an 82-76 victory on Tuesday
night at American Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   That evened the four-of-seven-game, second-round series at one
victory each and stole the Heat's precious home-court advantage in
the process. Games 3 and 4 will be at Madison Square Garden on
Friday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie is one of the toughest guys on our team,'' Ewing said.
``He dives for the ball, he has no fear of injury. That's the
football player in him. We needed somebody to step up and have a
big game. I'm glad Charlie was the guy who did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward ended the game 5 for 10 with 13 points. Sprewell (2 for 13)
had 11 points, Houston (3 for 14) had 12 points and Ewing (4 of 12)
ended with 13.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Knicks shot just 35 percent, they held the Heat to
34 percent. The most important difference was at the free-throw
line. The Heat made just 19 of 33 attempts, while the Knicks hit 31
of 42. For Miami, Alonzo Mourning had a game-high 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about Miami's free-throw shooting, Heat Coach Pat Riley
said: ``When you get to the line, you've got to knock them down.
You have to stay with your routine _ take three breaths and hit
them. You have to do that. That's all there is to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to Ward, the Knicks got 10 points from Marcus Camby. The
only other Knicks to match Ward's intensity. Camby left the game,
staggering to the bench with 8 minutes 32 seconds left in the game,
after putting the Knicks up by 10. Chris Childs also gave the
Knicks a big lift down the stretch when he nailed a 3-pointer with
8:21 left. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell said: ``It was one of those hard-fought, intense games.
We played really well until those last five minutes. I'd say our
point guards really did it for us tonight. They should get all the
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 24 hours after the Knicks' Game 1 loss, Coach Jeff Van
Gundy found himself surrounded by second opinions. The active Camby
has to be on the floor at the end, the gimpy Hardaway has to be
preyed upon, a big backcourt is the answer.
</P>
<P>
   `'I know everyone is looking for monumental changes,'' Van Gundy
said on Tuesday morning. `'But we're not going to change
monumentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they simply changed their mentality. Resisting the urge
to launch jumpers, Ward set the tone by fearlessly driving right
into the biceps of the looming Mourning. It was follow the leader,
but when Sprewell and Houston ducked inside, they went in flinching
as they waited for Mourning to swat their attempts away.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Knicks' many misses, the desired result was
achieved. The Knicks got to the free-throw line, put Mourning and
Brown in foul trouble and found themselves in an unreal position at
the half: They were ahead, 38-34.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to fathom because the Knicks shot just 28.2 percent
from the field and Ewing, Houston, Larry Johnson and Sprewell
combined to hit just 4 of 27 shots. As the unlikely high scorer,
Ward led the Knicks with 7 first-half points.
</P>
<P>
   The mind-boggling reason for the Heat's deficit was actually as
simple as a foul shot. The Knicks hit 16 of 22 free throws, while
the Heat missed an amazing 13 of 20, including 8 in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks didn't know it would work out like this, but their
aggressive nature put them in a position to make the Heat pay for
their horrible free-throw shooting. The Knicks drove to the basket
on 6 of their first 10 attempts, with two opening driving layups by
Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Ward was also instrumental in giving the Knicks a quick start
early in the third quarter. But this time, he was the one lingering
wide open behind the 3-point arc for a shot that gave the Knicks a
43-37 lead with nine minutes left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   When given the chance to counter, the Heat missed open jumpers
and were swarmed when they dared to drive inside. After three
turnovers in two minutes, the Knicks had a 49-40 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Heat started to make the Knicks pay for double-teaming
Mourning as Hardaway hit back-to-back 3 pointers to pull the Heat
within 49-46 with four minutes left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Until that point, the Knicks had held the Heat to just 3 of 14
in the third quarter. But as intense as they were, so was the Heat.
With Bruce Bowen giving Sprewell fits, the Knick forward was forced
into his fourth turnover of the game on a play that gave Mashburn a
fast-break layup to close the Knicks' lead to 1 point.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after Ewing showed some life, Ward also came to the rescue
again. In the middle of the brutal, physical style displayed on the
floor by both teams, he calmly hit a 3-pointer with a minute left
to put the Knicks up, 57-50.
</P>
<P>
   After two free throws by Houston, the Knicks survived the
craziness to lead, 59-50, entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it was a lead built on free-throws. The Knicks were
shooting 33 percent, as was the Heat, but they had the touch at the
line. At this point, the Heat was 8 of 22 from the line. More
important, Majerle, Bowen and Brown were in deep foul trouble with
four apiece. And Mourning had three.
