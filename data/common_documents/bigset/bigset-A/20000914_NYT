<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Troy Aikman and Randall Cunningham split time at
quarterback in the Cowboys' practice Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After the workout Aikman said he felt fine and that he did not
experience any recurrence of the symptoms stemming from the
concussion against the Philadelphia Eagles that kept him out of
last week's game against the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Dave Campo, however, will wait at least until
after Aikman goes through practice today before making a final
decision on who will start against the Washington Redskins on
Monday night. Aikman will start if he is healthy, and Cunningham
will return to his duties as backup quarterback. ``Troy looked
good,'' Campo said. ``We are fortunate to have an extra day. It
will give us more evaluation time. I'd like to have everything done
by Thursday. But I honestly don't have a timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said he will talk in more detail about his status today.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's presence was welcomedby teammates, and his efforts in
practice passed their eye test, especially tight end Jackie
Harris'.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to see him back out there, moving around and
throwing the ball, screaming at guys, that kind of thing,'' said a
laughing Harris, who added a ``Nah'' to the last part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect him not to play,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Added tight end David LaFleur: ``Troy's Troy. He came out there
and threw the ball around and looked like his old self. I guess he
felt good. If it's left up to Troy, I think he's definitely going
to be out there \Ragainst the Redskins\S.'' \Nsubheds:No interest
in Smith A source said the Cowboys have no interest in re-signing
cornerback Kevin Smith, despite their struggles at the position.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys vice president Stephen Jones, who declined to discuss
Smith's future, said the team simply abided by Smith's wishes when
they removed him from the reserve-retired list and released him
Tuesday. \Nsubheds:Stupid question? Unnamed reporter: Will a win
over the Redskins erase what happened in the first two games?
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys center Mark Stepnoski: ``We'll still be 1-2. There's no
erasing what happened in the first two weeks, because that's done.
It's on the record regardless.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Briefly Right guard Solomon Page missed practice
Wednesday because of a strained hamstring. He is listed as
questionable for Monday's game against Washington. If he can't
play, Jorge Diaz will start. Running back Chris Warren (strained
neck) is also listed as questionable.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys signed rookie free-agent defensive tackle Ron Moore
to the practice squad. Moore was drafted by the Green Bay Packers
in the seventh round of the 2000 draft out of Northwestern
Oklahoma. He was cut in training camp. nn

IRL POINTS LEADER BUDDY LAZIER TESTING LIMITS AT TMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of course, it will be damp and 51 degrees and the wind will be
blowing from the north when Buddy Lazier attempts to clinch his
first Indy Racing League driver's championship at Texas Motor
Speedway next month.
</P>
<P>
   As we all know, it usually rains any time an IRL race is booked
at TMS, site of the season-ending Excite 500.
</P>
<P>
   So, the sunny and hot and dry conditions under which Lazier and
his Hemelgarn Racing crew labored on Monday at TMS might render all
data collected useless on Oct. 15. But that is the point _ there
are 32 days to go before Lazier, Scott Goodyear and Eddie Cheever
Jr. race for the championship and a $1 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Time to go testing, and send a subtle message or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny thing about testing,'' said Lazier, who finally exited
his No. 91 Delta Faucet Dallara/Aurora with a sunburn around his
eyes and nose, and a top speed of approximately 211 mph. ``You'll
hear numbers that are put up, and the numbers that we ran today are
honest, fair numbers. In fact, we'll come back and run faster than
what we ran today next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of gamesmanship and strategy going on here, but
we don't really partake in that. We focus on improving our package
every time we test.''
</P>
<P>
   A two-time winner this season, Lazier has built a 38-point lead
over Goodyear and a 41-point advantage over Cheever heading into
qualifying on Oct. 14. Lazier needs a 13th-place finish to clinch
the Indy Racing Northern Light Series title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost ran a full-race distance,'' said Lazier, a
32-year-old resident of Vail, Colo. ``Ran almost 200 laps, in
different segments. Ran almost two mph faster than we ran without a
draft \Rin June\S. And it isn't our updated engine, so we feel like
we made some good gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to retest our spring combination, our shocks. We
realize that this is probably not the temperature we're going to
have four weeks from now, and so this was basically a generic test,
in that we were testing everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Included were the recently repatched portions of Turn 4 and Turn
1 of the 1.5-mile quadoval. Recall that Turn 4 drew the ire of some
IRL drivers during the Casino Magic 500 in mid-June, when a bump at
the bottom of the 24-degree banking upset handling of the
low-slung, open-wheel cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has clearly gotten better,'' said Lazier, referring to the
big black patches in Turn 4 and a lengthy repair between Turns 1
and 2 that sits out of the preferred racing groove. Together, they
present an ugly racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't count 'em, but you can tell there's a large number of
patches,'' Lazier said. ``Turn 4, you still have a little bump
there, and a dip, but it's nothing compared to what we had last
time we raced. And they really smoothed out a couple of the
critical areas. With the improved racing surface, I think it could
be even a closer race now.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be some race, considering that Scott Sharp's victory
over Robby McGehee in the Casino Magic 500 was by 0.059 seconds,
the closest finish in series history and perhaps the greatest
side-by-side race ever.
</P>
<P>
   Lazier previously has raced side-by-side at TMS, logging two
electrifying laps alongside Tony Stewart in the inaugural True
Value 500 night race at TMS in June 1997. Lazier, in fact, started
on the pole here in June en route to a seventh-place result.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've led here. But we haven't won here,'' said Lazier, an IRL
original who shared the 1996 Indianapolis 500 victory with affable
team owner Ron Hemelgarn. ``Fact is, we haven't even had a podium
finish here. I really love the racetrack and do have a lot of miles
here, so it's a bit of a frustration for me. It's been like a
thorn. I don't understand why ... I think we have everything that
it takes to have a podium finish and maybe contend for a victory.
And it'd be great to win the championship, and win the last race.
That would be spectacular. There's no reason why we can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, time to go testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was our last test here,'' Lazier said. ``But we will test
next week in Kentucky \Rfor Firestone\S, and then we're going to be
down for about three weeks. Normally, you appreciate the time off,
but it really isn't time off. Because we'll be working on all kinds
of stuff on the race car.''
</P>
<P>
   And sending another subtle message or two.
\Nsubheds:SPOTLIGHT ON...
Andretti says CART's limits not enough
Following up on a promise made by interim president/CEO Bobby
Rahal, CART officials have taken the first steps to reduce the warp
speeds of the series' turbocharged open-wheel race cars.
</P>
<P>
   An interim engine formula for the next two seasons was announced
Sunday by Hal Whiteford, president of operations for the
Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series. Whiteford said engine
suppliers Ford, Honda, Toyota and Mercedes-Benz will reduce maximum
intake manifold (or turbo) pressure from 40 to 37 inches in 2001
and to 34 inches in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are expected to decrease horsepower from the current
900 to approximately 845 next year and to 775 in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Bisco, vice president of Cosworth Racing, was among a
handful of Ford executives hailing a change that is expected to
knock approximately 60 horsepower/5 mph off terminal speed in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But former series champion Michael Andretti, who drives a
Ford-powered Lola for Newman/Haas Racing, said the rule does not go
far enough for a facility like Texas Motor Speedway. The 1.5-mile
quadoval in Fort Worth is scheduled to play host to the inaugural
Texas 600K on April 29.
</P>
<P>
   With its 24-degree banked turns, CART cars easily would be
expected to click off trap speeds in the 250 mph range without some
sort of boost reduction. At that speed, any sort of accident could
have tragic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they take 50 horsepower away, the engine manufacturers will
find a way to get that back before the season even starts,'' said
Andretti, CART's winningest active driver. ``The biggest thing they
needed to do was to make a bigger move. If they would have taken
200 horsepower away, the engine manufacturers would have gained 100
of it back by midseason. They also need to come down the same
percentage on downforce. That would promote safer racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reduction they have decided on will not be enough to make
a difference, especially at places like Texas that will be very
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz will not be affected by the rules, as the German
manufacturer announced Saturday it was withdrawing technical
support from CART at season's end. But it is likely that Ilmor
Engineering, which builds the Mercedes-Benz CART V-8 engine and
formerly manufactured the engines badged for Chevrolet, will
continue to supply the powerplants to interested teams for at least
another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driving factor was safety and reducing the high speeds,''
Bisco said. ``The perception was that more power creates more
speed, making it more dangerous. I think if we reduce power in an
amicable way for all manufacturers without putting huge costs on
their plate, bearing in mind that we have a rules freeze for two
years, it's a good thing.''
\Nsubheds:PIT STOPS
\Nsubheds:Petty passes on NHIS Long before NASCAR officials opted
to require carburetor restrictor plates for this weekend's Dura
Lube 300 at New Hampshire International Speedway, Kyle Petty
decided not to return this year to the track where his son, Adam,
was killed May 12.
</P>
<P>
   Petty announced in July that he would relinquish the seat in his
Winston Cup No. 44 Hot Wheels Pontiac to drive Adam's No. 45 Sprint
Chevrolet full time in the Busch Grand National Series beginning in
early September.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Petty, 19, was killed in a crash in Turn 3 at NHIS during
practice. Kyle Petty skipped the Winston Cup series' Jiffy Lube 300
at Loudon, N.H., on July 9, an event run two days after Cup regular
Kenny Irwin Jr., 30, died of injuries suffered in a crash in Turn
3, near where Adam was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle said the decision to stay away was a relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think it is,'' Petty said. ``I'm going to be honest
and tell you that when I heard the news from Kenny's accident, I
was devastated. I could not believe something transpired like that
again. I thank God I wasn't there ... same place, same time of day;
it was too close to home for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to not have to go there this year and let a year's
worth of time pass, I think it will be easier on myself and my
family.'' \Nsubheds:Gossage to talk CART Eddie Gossage is preparing
to attend his first CART promoter's meetings in Chicago on Tuesday
and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage, the executive vice president and general manager of
Texas Motor Speedway, said he will take notes as the speedway staff
begins integrating the Texas 600K into its 2001 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go and hear what some tracks do that works well, and
what didn't work,'' Gossage said. ``It's good to get together with
other promoters and listen, and I plan to do a whole lot of
listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gossage said he does not anticipate the first tests
by any CART teams here until December. Gossage said the 1.5-mile
TMS quadoval is booked every day in September and October, and all
but two days in November. \Nsubheds:Indy F1 a sellout Ticket sales

FAA TO ORDER REDESIGN, RETROFIT OF BOEING 737 RUDDER SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is ordering The Boeing Co.
to redesign the rudder system on its 737 and will require
modification of its entire 1,500-plane U.S. fleet starting in July,
a spokeswoman for the agency said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will pay all the costs, a bill some aviation experts have
said could easily top $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are likely to have at least five years to comply.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the agency next month will mandate additional
training for pilots to handle an uncommanded movement of the
plane's rudder.
</P>
<P>
   The action comes after years of questions and debate about the
safety of the rudder system on the world's most widely used
jetliner. More than 3,000 737s are in service around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Two fatal 737 crashes in the 1990s were blamed on a rudder
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rudder redesign will take this plane to the ultimate
safety level,'' FAA spokeswoman Diane Spitaliere said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   She stressed that the 737 has an excellent safety record and the
flying public should not be alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   But the redesign will ensure redundancy in the 737
rudder-control system, she said. That was one of the
recommendations made last year by the National Transportation
Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA plans to brief reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will hold a news conference afterward. A company
spokesman declined comment Wednesday night other than to note the
737's ``outstanding'' safety record.
</P>
<P>
   The 737 has an accident rate that is half the industry average
and the jet has the best safety record of any airplane in its
class.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will pay for the redesign and the fleet modifications,
Spitaliere said, though she could not confirm aviation experts'
estimates of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA will issue its order, in the form of an airworthiness
directive, in July after Boeing has completed the redesign of the
rudder mechanism and it has been certified, Spitaliere said.
</P>
<P>
   The twin-engine 737 is the world's most frequently flown jet,
with one taking off an average of every five seconds. The 737 fleet
has about 100 million flight hours. About 3,600 planes have been
delivered, with 3,200 still in service around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA can only order U.S.-registered operators to make the
rudder modifications. Other countries, however, usually follow the
FAA's lead. The fleet-modification work is likely to be
accomplished during regularly scheduled maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Spitaliere said Boeing will have to incorporate the redesign on
planes in production after the certification process.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the FAA will take more immediate action to make
sure 737 pilots are better trained on how to deal with an in-flight
rudder malfunction should one occur, Spitaliere said. She said
existing 737 pilot training procedures, which were put into place
after the fatal crash of a 737 near Pittsburgh in 1994, are
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Those procedures have been simplified, she said, and pilots can
easily commit them to memory rather than rely on a manual.
</P>
<P>
   The actions being taken by the FAA have been expected.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a blue-ribbon group of scientists and engineers
recommended that the 737 rudder system be redesigned to make it
safer, and the FAA said at the time that it was likely to go along
with the recommendation, even though the panel had not identified
any immediate safety problems with the 737.
</P>
<P>
   The group, formally called the Flight Control Engineering Test
Evaluation Board, has been meeting in Seattle for more than a year,
and includes scientists from NASA and the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing people are on the team, but they came from the company's
military Phantom Works program or from its Long Beach, Calif.,
division and had no previous involvement with the 737 rudder
system. The group has worked in a Boeing-owned facility known as
the integrated system laboratory at Boeing Field.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing leased a 737-200 from Purdue University and fully
instrumented the plane for flight testing. The university had
acquired the jet to train mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   The group's formation was one of the recommendations made last
year by the safety board when it issued its final report on the
probable cause of the USAir Flight 427 crash.
</P>
<P>
   Board Chairman Jim Hall said at the time the 737 rudder system
needed to be redesigned to make it ``reliable redundant'' like the
ones on Boeing's 757 and 767 aircraft. The rudder is the movable
part on a plane's tail that controls side-to-side movement.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, there have been many incidents in which 737
pilots have reported uncommanded rudder movements.
</P>
<P>
   After the longest investigation in its history, the NTSB said a
jammed rudder probably caused the crash of Flight 427 near
Pittsburgh that killed all 132 people on the 737.
</P>
<P>
   It also blamed a jammed rudder for the the 1991 crash of a
United 737 near the Colorado Springs, Colo., airport that killed 25
people.
</P>
<P>
   Since the two crashes, the FAA has issued several airworthiness
directives to make the 737 rudder safer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the FAA ordered U.S. airlines to replace the rudder
power-control units in 737s. The modification prevents a possible
jam. Airlines finished that task in August 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA also ordered that a new yaw damper coupler and a
hydraulic pressure reducer be installed on 737s. That work was
supposed to have been accomplished by last month.
</P>
<P>
   The hydraulic pressure reducer limits the amount of rudder
deflection that can occur. It would have prevented the full rudder
deflection that occurred in the USAir crash.

COLORADO COACH BARNETT SHOULD SAVE COACHING TRICKS FOR HUSKIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
Colorado coach Barnett should save coaching tricks for Huskies 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wily veteran that he is, Colorado coach Gary Barnett provided a
clinic in crisis control this week by blasting Big 12 officials for
force-feeding his beleaguered Buffaloes a ``brutal'' start to the
conference schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Colorado won't begin its three-week march
through league heavyweights Kansas State, Texas A&AMP;M and Texas until
Sept. 30. Never mind that the 2000 schedule was approved in 1997 by
league athletic directors, including the one at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   From Barnett's perspective, this was the perfect time to sound
off for one simple reason: It shifted the focus away from his 0-2
team. Somewhere, Jimmy Johnson _ master of the created controversy
_ must be smiling about Barnett's ploy to shine the spotlight in a
different direction while circling the wagons.
</P>
<P>
   Nice try, Gary.
</P>
<P>
   But we're more interested in how you plan to avoid posting the
first 0-3 start to a Colorado football season since 1986. And we
find it deliciously ironic that your team has reached a crossroads
moment to coincide with Saturday's game against No. 9 Washington in
Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies (2-0), lest anyone forget, are coached by Rick
Neuheisel, the man who preceded Barnett at Colorado. Neuheisel's
unexpected departure after the 1998 season, along with his verbal
volleys at school administrators on his way out the door, surely
will be acknowledged by the Folsom Field crowd when the prodigal
coach returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't anticipate a lovefest,'' Neuheisel said.
</P>
<P>
   Under different circumstances, Neuheisel's return might be a hot
topic in the Buffs' locker room. But not this week. Barnett's team
faces enough of a challenge in trying to salvage a season that
could gurgle down the drain unless the young Buffs begin receiving
positive feedback. And soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could get worse before it gets better,'' said Barnett, who
lists 18 underclassmen among his 22 starters. ``We can't let these
kids get discouraged ... but when you keep losing tight games, it's
got to take its toll a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, a talented team with a fragile psyche has fallen to
rival Colorado State, 28-24, and to No. 10 Southern California,
17-14. Colorado has disappeared from the Top 25 rankings. The
starting quarterback and kicker were benched Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Players are perplexed, said linebacker Jashon Sykes, because the
Buffs ``don't have 0-2 talent.'' But in college football, you are
only as good as your record. That means Colorado is winless, with
its next four games against teams with a combined mark of 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   To reach a bowl game, much less contend for a Big 12 title, a
confidence-building win is needed Saturday. No one in a Buffs'
uniform wants to risk the emotional scars of carrying an 0-3 mark
into next week's open date.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Washington game is not about Neuheisel. It's a big game
because we're 0-2, and 0-2 is a real strain on everybody,''
linebacker Andy Peeke said. ``It's wearing on us, and you can tell
it's wearing on the coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett has shown the strain by shifting into crisis-control
mode. He has tried to shift the pre-game focus onto perceived
slights from conference officials rather than ongoing shortcomings
in his players. It's a time-honored coaching trick. But deep down,
Barnett knows the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing two games after you've been in position to win both of
them creates a lot of frustration for the coaches and the
leadership of the team,'' Barnett said. ``We can't afford to get
caught up in any hype about \RNeuheisel's return\S. We need to
concentrate on getting better and taking care of assignments. We're
0-2. And we've got to find a way to turn things around.''

philosophy to pick it up and run with it.
</P>
<P>
   Tech's scoop mentality makes most of fumbles
Texas Tech defenders have squelched opponent's big plays often
enough that the Red Raiders lead the league in total defense,
allowing just 207.7 yards per game. But coach Mike Leach is just as
pleased by the big plays turned in by a group that is encouraged to
scoop and return loose fumbles rather than merely cover them.
</P>
<P>
   The ``super scooper'' mentality comes from Greg McMackin, Tech's
first-year defensive coordinator. Scoop-and-run drills are part of
Tech's daily practices. And they're paying dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Through three games, the Red Raiders (3-0) have averaged 39.5
yards on five fumble returns. They've scored two touchdowns. Each
game has featured either a fumble return for a touchdown or a
fumble return in excess of 50 yards. Defensive end Aaron Hunt
returned a fumble 63 yards for a touchdown in a 24-3 victory over
New Mexico on Aug. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's that unusual,'' Leach said of the daily
drills. ``But other teams I've been around tended to be a little
more conservative with it. Greg really stresses it.''
</P>
<P>
   McMackin's scoopers started strong against New Mexico, with Hunt
scoring and cornerback Antwan Alexander adding a 70-yarder.
Linebacker Dorian Pitts scored on a 6-yard return against Utah
State. Hunt had a 2-yard return against North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was cornerback Derrick Briggs' 54-yard return on
what Leach called the craziest play he has ever seen. That was the
deciding play in last week's 13-7 win over North Texas, when free
safety Kevin Curtis popped the ball loose from Eagles receiver
LaDarrin McLane at the Tech 12-yard line after a 50-yard
catch-and-run in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The ball rolled to the 2, where Briggs picked it up and returned
it 54 yards before falling to the turf with 1:44 remaining. In all,
the play covered 114 yards _ 60 in one direction, 54 in the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one hell of a play,'' Leach said. ``Kevin Curtis did
everything you ever coach, teach, preach and beg a player to do
about not quitting on a play and giving second effort. Then, he
pokes it loose and, for a couple of seconds there, I thought
Derrick had a shot to score.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, that's been a recurring feeling about Tech
defenders.
\Nsubheds:QUICK HITS Mission: Threepeat Iowa State quarterback Sage
Rosenfels, a fifth-year senior, said Saturday's game at Iowa holds
special significance for members of his class. Those seniors have a
chance to become the first group of Cyclones in two decades to post
a winning record in their careers against their in-state rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State (2-0) has won the past two games between the schools.
Before that, Iowa (0-2) won 15 in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would mean a lot to us if we could finish 3-2 against
them,'' Rosenfels said. ``Our seniors have talked to the
out-of-state guys to ask them to really step it up this week and
treat it like it's the biggest rivalry game they can imagine to
help us out.'' \Nsubheds:Comforting words Texas quarterback Chris
Simms phoned his father's hospital room Sunday morning to wish him
a speedy recovery from an emergency appendectomy. In the process,
he received an uplift as well.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and now a CBS television
analyst, advised his son to keep his head up despite being pulled
after the first two series in the Longhorns' 52-10 rout of
Louisiana-Lafayette. Simms, the starter, left with Texas facing a
10-0 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Hang in there and be confident. Everything is
going to be all right,''' Simms said. ``He didn't see the game, so
he didn't have any suggestions for me. But that's OK. I know what I
did wrong. I definitely like his input, but it's not a necessity
for me to get better. I'm fairly smart and can figure things out.''
\Nsubheds:Making the adjustment Texas A&AMP;M fullback Ja'Mar Toombs,
the team's leading rusher in 1999, has carried 13 times for 23
yards (1.8 average) this season. As a means of comparison, four
other A&AMP;M backs had 29 or more yards in last week's 51-3 victory
over Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   But coaches said they are more satisfied with Toombs' play now
than a year ago because he has improved his blocking and is
becoming a more well-rounded back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing what most fullbacks do. They don't make a lot of
headlines,'' A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said. ``He's fit into that role,
and we've been pleased with him. He's blocked better and he's in
better shape. He made a couple of key blocks in that \RWyoming\S
game.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Inside the numbers Working overtime Nebraska's 27-24
victory over Notre Dame last week boosted the Big 12's career mark
to 12-11 in overtime games since the extra sessions were approved
for the 1996 season. A breakdown: TEAM OVERTIME RECORD Nebraska 3-0
Missouri 3-2 Texas A&AMP;M 2-0 Oklahoma 1-0 Kansas 1-0 Colorado 1-1
Oklahoma State 1-3 Texas 0-1 Kansas State 0-1 Iowa State 0-1 Baylor
0-2 Texas Tech 0-0
\Nsubheds:BURCH's PICKS Staff writer Jimmy Burch picks (against the
line) this week's Big 12 games:
</P>
<P>
   Texas at Stanford (plus 13). Pick: Stanford. Longhorns will have
to earn this one against revenge-minded Cardinal to remain
undefeated.
</P>
<P>

another big number while building confidence in new, improved

on-again, off-again offense is due for another ``on'' week.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota at Baylor (plus 8 1/2). Pick: Minnesota. Texas heat
will bother the Gophers, but not as much as Minnesota's superior
talent bothers Baylor.
</P>
<P>

Oklahoma State. Cowboys ride roughshod over outmanned opponent from
Division I-AA.
</P>
<P>

SECOND WINSTON CUP DATE REMAINS ELUSIVE FOR TEXAS SPEEDWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The 2001 schedule at Texas Motor Speedway
will feature all three of NASCAR's top series, both American
open-wheel series, the nation's top dirt-track series and a
road-racing series.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the track that now officially bills itself as ``The
Great American Speedway'' will host five major weekends _ two in
March and one each in April, June and September.
</P>
<P>
   But missing again from a jam-packed schedule announced yesterday
by Eddie Gossage, TMS' executive vice president and general
manager, was the coveted second Winston Cup and stand-alone Busch
Grand National races. Even though both schedules have not been
released by NASCAR, it's well known that TMS will not have a second
Winston Cup date next year. But Gossage has not lost hope on a
second Busch race in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said he requested a second Busch race, mainly because
the series will not compete at South Boston, Va., and Myrtle Beach,
S.C.. He has yet to hear anything from NASCAR regarding the
request.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said he talked to Mike Helton, NASCAR's senior vice
president and chief operating officer recently, but Helton didn't
reveal much.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they say yes we're going to take it and we'll find a place
for it,'' Gossage said. ``I have no news on the second Winston Cup
race. This is a unique year because the TV deal has changed and
\RNASCAR\S is trying to sort it all out. They are not quite ready
to announce the schedule. \RHelton\S didn't say no and he didn't
say yes \Rto the Busch race\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with those two omissions, the track will host two events
for the Indy Racing Northern Light Series, its inaugural race in
the Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series and the American Le
Mans Series.
</P>
<P>
   The marquee event remains the April 1 DirecTV 500 NASCAR Winston
Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   The Cup week is billed as ``RPM Week _ Texas,'' and features
five days of racing, with events at the 1.5-mile superspeedway and
the four-tenths mile dirt track. The TMS Dirt Track will play host
to a Hav-A-Tampa Series race on March 28 and a two-day Pennzoil
World of Outlaws event March 29-30.
</P>
<P>
   A similar ``RPM Week _ Texas'' is scheduled Sept. 13-16. Along
with the season finale for the Indy Racing Northern Light Series,
the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series will run on Sept. 15. At the dirt
track, the Hav-A-Tampa Series will run the Wolf Brand Chili 100 on
Sept. 13. A two-day Outlaws program is set for Sept. 14-15.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule opens March 1-4 with the second ALMS Grand Prix of
Texas on the combined oval/infield road course. Gossage added
Monster Truck, Freestyle Motocross and dirt-track motorcycle events
to the schedule at the TMS Dirt Track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be pushing the envelope and we will find out what the
market will bear,'' Gossage said. ``But it's like Rick Mears once
told me, `Until you spin the car out you don't know where your
limit is.' We haven't spun out yet. Maybe we are in 2001 and,
again, we'll find out.''

MRS. CLINTON WINS ADMIRATION FOR FAIR-MINDEDNESS IN DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE GROSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORTLANDT MANOR, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton won the
admiration, and perhaps the support, of a small group of undecided
voters Wednesday night for what they called her assured,
substantive and good-natured performance in a high stakes face-off
with Rep. Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Taggart, vice president of a financial services company who
lives in this northern Westchester County suburb with his wife and
two daughters, was typical in his assessment of the first debate in
this pivotal race for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one were to say who was senatorial, it is she,'' Taggart
said of Clinton. ``He came off as a much more immature person, and
she came off very collected. And she was warmer than I've ever seen
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Taggart, one of a panel of undecided voters drawn from early New
York Times/CBS News polls, has been discussing his thoughts,
wishes, hopes and disappointments as this Senate race has unfolded.
And while the debate Wednesday night did not put him firmly in
Clinton's camp, it surely pushed him close to a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true for Tom and Barbara Smith, a struggling
working-class couple in Saugerties, who watched the debate from
their local firehouse and took great offense at Lazio's attacks on
his Democratic opponent. The Smiths, who have begged for a race
free of mudslinging, said Lazio had set out to ``destroy
character'' and ``put people down'' in a way that was both
``cruel'' and ``not constructive.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl Schwartz, a computer consultant on Staten Island whose view
of the race has been entirely driven by the fact that his wife has
cancer, said that he ignored ``the negative stuff from both sides''
and continued to lean toward Lazio, because ``he scores high in his
commitment to helping cancer patients.'' But Schwartz gave Clinton
high marks for her ``command of the facts'' and her ``comfortable
and professional'' demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that she can work effectively as a senator,
that she can express the issues well,'' Schwartz said, sounding
agonized that his ``one-dimensional'' approach to a decision might
be unfair to Clinton. ``I'll give Hillary one more chance to be
specific about cancer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two most dramatic moments of the hourlong debate, broadcast
from Buffalo, were the screening of Clinton's firm defense of her
husband on the NBC ``Today'' program in January 1998 during the
Monica Lewinsky scandal and Lazio's challenge, document and pen in
hand, that both candidates sign a pledge not to use soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Taggart, a well-read man of considered opinions, saw Clinton's
reaction to the ``Today'' tape, broadcast at a time when Clinton
said the president had lied to her as well as to the country, as a
demonstration of grace under pressure. ``It was obviously very
painful to witness and respond,'' he said. ``It made you feel for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Lazio's bravura move of presenting Clinton with a pledge
to eschew soft money was a no-win moment for her. She could not
sign a document she had not read, he said. So, instead, she held
firm that she would do so only if Lazio's supporters all avoided
future soft money donations.
</P>
<P>
   But moments of high drama aside, Taggart and the others were
impressed by Clinton's command of the issues and her self-control
when baited repeatedly by Lazio, who led off almost all of his
exchanges with an attack on her character. ``She didn't let it
become tit-for-tat,'' Taggart said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's task, as these voters saw it, was to present himself as
a credible candidate and to showcase what many describe as his
winning personality. Instead, Taggart and others said, he was
unimpressive on the issues and testy in his attitude. ``He had an
opportunity to get people who didn't know him to like him,''
Taggart said. ``I don't think he accomplished that, and it's a real
opportunity lost for him.''

<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rep. Rick Lazio
slashed into each other for nearly 60 minutes in a televised debate
Wednesday night, attacking each other's credentials, integrity and
political views. Near the debate's end, Lazio crossed the stage to
the first lady, waving a piece of paper in his hand as he
unsuccessfully challenged her to sign a pledge renouncing the use
of soft money in her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates for U.S. Senate, in their first debate,
engaged in what may well have been the most raucous meeting of two
candidates for statewide office in New York in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, viewing the debate as his best chance yet to introduce
himself to New York voters, took after Clinton from the very first
question and hammered her at virtually every opportunity for the
rest of the hourlong program. He attacked her as untrustworthy,
mocked her attempt to serve as a senator from a state where she has
never before lived, and at one point grew visibly angry as he
described her as ``beyond shameless.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, the first lady repeatedly sought to link Lazio to
the policies of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, noting that
Lazio voted with Republicans in shutting down the government in
1994. She attacked what she described as his ``reckless'' plan to
cut taxes by at least $770 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most striking moment of the evening came not
with Lazio and Clinton, but with the first lady and the moderator
of the debate, Tim Russert, the host of NBC's Sunday program ``Meet
the Press.'' He showed a videotape from the ``Today'' program of
Jan. 27, 1998, in which Clinton, just after the Lewinsky scandal
broke, defended her husband and denied the allegations that he had
had an affair with a White House intern. Russert asked Clinton if
she regretted ``misleading the American people'' and if she would
``now apologize for branding people as part of a vast right-wing
conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has declined to appear as a guest on ``Meet the
Press,'' appeared shaken by the question. Her eyes turned downward
and her face tightened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well you know Tim, that was a very, a very painful time for
me, for my family and for our country,'' she said quietly. ``It is
something that I regret deeply that anyone had to go through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to be as forthcoming as I could, given the
circumstances that I faced,'' she said, her eyes still downcast.
``Obviously I didn't mislead anyone. I didn't know the truth. And
there's a great deal of pain associated with that and my husband
has certainly acknowledged that and made it clear that he did
mislead the country as well as his family.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange came in a debate that had been viewed as a critical
juncture for both sides _ and particularly for Lazio, who seemed
intent on erasing any doubt among Republicans about the vigor he
might bring to this contest against Clinton. And there was no doubt
that Clinton and Lazio had arrived with the intent of getting out
one central charge against the other.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton mentioned Gingrich a half-dozen times. ``Time and time
again, when he's had a choice to make, particularly at the critical
turning point when our country was really on the line with Newt
Gingrich's Contract with America, he stood with the Republican
leadership and Newt Gingrich,'' Clinton said of Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's use of repetition revolved around the words ``trust''
and ``character,'' painting Clinton with the same broad accusations
that Republicans have used against her husband. ``At the heart of
this campaign are two critical issues: character and trust,'' Lazio
said in his closing statement. ``They've come up all night. Now,
the measure of someone's character and trust is not what you say;
it's what you actually do.'
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Lazio arrived with presidential-campaign-size
squadrons of aides and supporters, in a city where a
presidential-campaign-size squadron of reporters had descended.
Lazio's campaign kept up a constant patter of e-mails to reporters
attacking Clinton during the debate, and both candidates and their
aides _ not surprisingly _ declared victory once they were done.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Republicans had said that Lazio, who remains a
relatively unknown quantity in the state, had more to gain _ and to
prove _ with the presumably huge audience he found Wednesday night.
And Lazio fairly leapt from behind the lectern as he went after the
first lady, not even backing away when Russert gave him a chance to
follow up on Clinton's reply to her husband's infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that, frankly, what's so troubling here with respect
to what my opponent just said, is somehow that it only matters what
you say when you get caught,'' Lazio said. ``And character and
trust is about, well, more than that. And blaming others every time
you have responsibility? Unfortunately, that's become a pattern, I
think, for my opponent. And it's something that I reject and I
believe that New Yorkers reject. We can do well better.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady did anything but turn the other cheek, even
though Lazio attacked first. In answer to the initial question,
Lazio attacked Clinton's effort to advocate a national health care
system, saying that ``a New Yorker would have never made that
proposal'' and that ``the bottom line is, it would have been
terrible for New York.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used Lazio's response to introduce one of her dominant
themes of the evening. ``Well, you know Tim, listening to the
congressman's response reminds me of a word I've heard a lot of
this past year: chutzpah,'' she said. ``He stands here and tells us
that he's a moderate, mainstream, independent member of Congress.
Well, in fact, he was a deputy whip to Newt Gingrich. He voted to
shut the government down. He voted to cut $270 billion from
Medicare. He voted for the biggest education cuts in our history.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio returned to the attack two questions later, in response to
a question posed to him about the upstate economy. ``Well, I have
to go back to Clinton's last remark because it has to redefine the
word chutzpah,'' he said. ``Mrs. Clinton, you of all people
shouldn't try to make guilt by association. Newt Gingrich isn't
running in this race. I'm running in this race. Let's talk about my
record.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the debate seemed on the verge of spinning beyond even
Russert's control, particularly when Lazio yanked the soft money
pledge from his pocket. Debate organizers later said that Lazio
broke one of the debate rules against using props, though Lazio's
advisers said they would make no apologies.
</P>
<P>
   The pledge produced by Lazio called on the candidates to
renounce the use of soft money, the largely unregulated campaign
contributions that have proven to be a major benefit for the first
lady. Clinton has raised almost $22 million for her campaign, both
through millions in soft money and in direct contributions, and
Lazio has accumulated about $19 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has, so far, not set up any soft-money fund-raising
committees on his behalf. However, he has benefited from spending
by independent committees, which have been running ads in New York
attacking Clinton. The first lady has said that she is willing to
renounce the use of soft money, providing that Lazio obtains
``signed agreements'' from those committees promising not to
advertise in New York or those sending ``mean mail'' solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, a number of political analysts have suggested, Clinton
and Lazio were probably more interested in winning political
advantage than in actually changing campaign finance projects. At
the end of the exchange, the two talked over each nother, with
Lazio standing trying to press the piece of paper into Clinton's
hand, and Clinton trying to get Lazio to shake her hand on the
broader proposal she was making.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I admire that,'' she said. ``That was a wonderful
performance and I . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, why don't you just sign it?''' Lazio demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you, and you did it very well,'' Clinton said, ignoring
his demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not asking you to admire it,'' Lazio said. ``I'm asking
you to sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates seemed nervous, particularly at the start,
though both seemed to get looser as the night went along. For much
of the evening, Clinton was serious; she did not smile often. By
contrast, Lazio pulsated while smiling; one of Clinton's advisers
suggested later that he was almost smirking.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the squabbling, Clinton and Lazio offered clearly
different views of what government should do and what they would do
in the Senate. Lazio advocated large tax cuts as a way of
invigorating the economy, and school vouchers to help the nation's
education system. Clinton attacked those as a threat to the
nation's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   And they sparred, but steered around, the issue of whether a
convicted spy, Jonathan Pollard, should be granted clemency _ a
situation favored by many Jews. Both candidates said they did not
have access to classified information needed to offer an informed
opinion.

PARTY SWITCHER'S FUTURE IS IN DOUBT AFTER PRIMARY
</HEADLINE>
  By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLPORT, N.Y. _ When Rep. Michael Forbes of Long Island
switched from Republican to Democrat last year, Republicans put him
at the top of their hit list.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't imagine that a 71-year-old former school
librarian and former garden club vice president, a Democrat who
practices pro bono environmental law in her Bellport home, would
knock him off.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as both parties contemplate what appears to be a 39-vote
victory by Regina Seltzer, a former Brookhaven councilwoman, in
Tuesday's Democratic primary, it is unclear who defeated him: the
Republicans or the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Final results may not be available for several days. But if the
vote holds up _ and Forbes voiced no hope that it would not _ the
result could help the Republicans take back a critical seat in the
fight for control of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   A glum Forbes said Wednesday that a huge Republican effort to
support Seltzer had made the difference in the race. And even many
people who praised Seltzer were skeptical of her chances of
defeating the Republican candidate, Felix J. Grucci Jr., supervisor
of the town of Brookhaven. Grucci also has the support of the
Conservative, Independence and Right to Life parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's excellent,'' said Desmond M. Ryan, a veteran lobbyist
and executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island,
a developers' lobby. ``She's got a background. She's got a history.
She comes across like everybody's grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we won't send a grandmother to Washington, but
it's rather difficult for a 71-year-old woman to effectively
conduct a door-to-door campaign against a well-financed, formidably
entrenched opponent.'' He also faulted Forbes for ignoring the
importance of the primary.
</P>
<P>
   In a historically quirky district where Republicans outnumber
Democrats almost two to one, the New York State Republican
Committee fought long and hard against their former congressman.
They sent out eight pieces of glossy campaign literature,
criticizing Forbes' anti-abortion stance and asking voters, among
other things, ``Should buyers at gun shows have to pass a criminal
background check? Congressman Mike Forbes doesn't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes did not release figures on his primary campaign spending.
Seltzer, who keeps her law books in the garage with the Ford Escort
so they don't get moldy in her basement office, spent $40,000 in
campaign contributions and nothing from her own funds, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But without the financial aid she got from the opposing party in
the primary, Seltzer will have an uphill battle in November,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   In a Washington press conference , Forbes said that while he
would ask for a recount, he was not optimistic about its results.
He blamed ``venomous'' Republicans for beating him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a campaign against Michael Forbes, not for Regina
Seltzer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the Republicans considered the primary a grudge
match, and a lesson for defectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tempted to ask for a recount, because we were so looking
forward to beating Mike Forbes,'' said Tom Davis, chairman of the
National Republican Congressional Committee. ``But New York
Democrats beat us to it, and in the process destroyed Democrats'
hopes for a majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Allen, spokesman for the New York State Republican
Committee, said that other Republican groups had organized phone
calls to get out the vote against Forbes, and that his group was
pleased with the results of their mailings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we devoted a substantial amount of resources to assure
that all the families out in Suffolk County knew what kind of
congressman they had,'' said Allen, who would not say how many
pieces of mail were sent to Democrats, or the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Scarrow, a professor of political science at the SUNY
campus in Stonybrook, estimated that the party had spent $100,000
to beat Forbes. He personally received five pieces of anti-Forbes
mail and two or three phone calls about the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the Republicans should be very happy,'' Scarrow said.
``I guess they think Seltzer would be a much easier target for
Grucci than would be Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans accused Forbes of having the same positions on
gun control and abortion and something else as their own candidate,
Grucci. But of course that was beside the point.''

TO BE STARS CENTER MIKE MODANO IS TO BE LUCKIEST GUY AROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ Today, I'm Mike Modano. Say hello to the luckiest
guy in the world.
</P>
<P>
   I'm 30 years old and single. I'm Hollywood-handsome, I'm rich
and I play hockey for the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   I own that town.
</P>
<P>
   I'm at the top of my game, ranked among the top five players in
the NHL by ``The Hockey News'' recently, and there are those out
there who tell me I'm the best.
</P>
<P>
   They might be right.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't the name of Joe Namath's autobiography, ``I Can't Wait
Until Tomorrow 'Cause I Get Better Looking Every Day?'' Wish I'd
thought of that first.
</P>
<P>
   Today will put a wrap on a great week of training camp. I didn't
miss a day on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   I roll out of the sack in my three-bedroom condo around 8:30
every morning and walk over to the window. The mountains are right
there, almost close enough to reach out and touch, soaring into the
sky like green giants.
</P>
<P>
   The air is as cool and crisp as a fresh apple. The September sun
is so blindingly bright, I'm tempted to shave with my shades on.
</P>
<P>
   Except ... I look in the mirror and I kind of like it when I
don't shave for a day or two. Looks, you know, rugged. Maybe later,
after practice, I'll try the razor. Then again, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   My roommates are Shaun Van Allen, a new center we just signed in
the off-season, and a rookie, Ryan Christie. I've got closer
friends on the team, guys such as Grant Marshall and Brett Hull,
but this is the organization's way of helping everyone get closer,
and Shaun and Ryan are good guys.
</P>
<P>
   That's kind of what camp here is all about; guys hanging around
each other all the time, getting to know each other, eating three
meals a day together, practicing together, playing together a
little bit. I like the time we spend here, especially this year
because they've let the veterans ease up a little, do a little less
scrimmaging, but still work off-ice on conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   After practice _ they only get us three hours a day _ we'll walk
into town for lunch, then head to the golf course. Golf is so great
here. The courses are in terrific shape, everything's so green and
the weather's perfect. That you can hit the ball a mile doesn't
bother me, either.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I can play that game a little bit, too. Another putt drops
here or there, I'm a scratch golfer. I might even try out that
celebrity tour when I quit playing hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Like I said, I'm the luckiest guy going.
</P>
<P>
   People tell me I'm showing a lot more maturity and leadership
qualities. That worries me a little bit. All of a sudden 30 comes
and everybody expects you to be this kind of mentor and all that.
I'm not a rah-rah guy. I just try to keep guys loose and having
fun, especially the young kids.
</P>
<P>
   There's so much pressure and expectations on those guys, and I
was in the same boat not so long ago. I just try to relate to them
and show them you can play in the NHL and still have fun.
</P>
<P>
   If there's anything I'm better at than hockey, it's having fun.
When the finals were over last season and we'd lost to New Jersey
in six games, I just cut loose. Sensibly, of course.
</P>
<P>
   July was basically a travel month. I hit Cabo, one of my
favorite hangouts in all the world. I love the mountains, but at
heart, I'm a beach bum.
</P>
<P>
   There were a couple of trips to New York with my buddies,
because that's such a fun place to party.
</P>
<P>
   In Vegas, I went to a party that Mavs owner Mark Cuban was
throwing for one of his friends. He'd hired John Cougar Mellencamp
to play in this guy's back yard. How cool was that?
</P>
<P>
   My love life? Not much to tell, really. No, I mean it.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, I date a little now and then, play the field, but
there's nothing really hot going romance-wise. That part of my life
is at a stale point right now and that's OK with me.
</P>
<P>
   Honest.
</P>
<P>
   I've found when I get serious in a relationship, I kind of lose
my focus on hockey. So, I've told myself I've got four more years
on my current contract, and I want to have the four best years I
can possibly have.
</P>
<P>
   I really do want to be the best. I'd love to be the league's
MVP. Who knows, if I can play as well all season as I was at the
end of last season, the honors will come.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long time since a team went to the finals three
years in a row. We can do it and we can win it again.
</P>

TO BE STARS CENTER MIKE MODANO IS TO BE LUCKIEST GUY AROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ Today, I'm Mike Modano. Say hello to the luckiest
guy in the world.
</P>
<P>
   I'm 30 years old and single. I'm Hollywood-handsome, I'm rich
and I play hockey for the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   I own that town.
</P>
<P>
   I'm at the top of my game, ranked among the top five players in
the NHL by ``The Hockey News'' recently, and there are those out
there who tell me I'm the best.
</P>
<P>
   They might be right.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't the name of Joe Namath's autobiography, ``I Can't Wait
Until Tomorrow 'Cause I Get Better Looking Every Day?'' Wish I'd
thought of that first.
</P>
<P>
   Today will put a wrap on a great week of training camp. I didn't
miss a day on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   I roll out of the sack in my three-bedroom condo around 8:30
every morning and walk over to the window. The mountains are right
there, almost close enough to reach out and touch, soaring into the
sky like green giants.
</P>
<P>
   The air is as cool and crisp as a fresh apple. The September sun
is so blindingly bright, I'm tempted to shave with my shades on.
</P>
<P>
   Except ... I look in the mirror and I kind of like it when I
don't shave for a day or two. Looks, you know, rugged. Maybe later,
after practice, I'll try the razor. Then again, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   My roommates are Shaun Van Allen, a new center we just signed in
the off-season, and a rookie, Ryan Christie. I've got closer
friends on the team, guys such as Grant Marshall and Brett Hull,
but this is the organization's way of helping everyone get closer,
and Shaun and Ryan are good guys.
</P>
<P>
   That's kind of what camp here is all about; guys hanging around
each other all the time, getting to know each other, eating three
meals a day together, practicing together, playing together a
little bit. I like the time we spend here, especially this year
because they've let the veterans ease up a little, do a little less
scrimmaging, but still work off-ice on conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   After practice _ they only get us three hours a day _ we'll walk
into town for lunch, then head to the golf course. Golf is so great
here. The courses are in terrific shape, everything's so green and
the weather's perfect. That you can hit the ball a mile doesn't
bother me, either.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I can play that game a little bit, too. Another putt drops
here or there, I'm a scratch golfer. I might even try out that
celebrity tour when I quit playing hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Like I said, I'm the luckiest guy going.
</P>
<P>
   People tell me I'm showing a lot more maturity and leadership
qualities. That worries me a little bit. All of a sudden 30 comes
and everybody expects you to be this kind of mentor and all that.
I'm not a rah-rah guy. I just try to keep guys loose and having
fun, especially the young kids.
</P>
<P>
   There's so much pressure and expectations on those guys, and I
was in the same boat not so long ago. I just try to relate to them
and show them you can play in the NHL and still have fun.
</P>
<P>
   If there's anything I'm better at than hockey, it's having fun.
When the finals were over last season and we'd lost to New Jersey
in six games, I just cut loose. Sensibly, of course.
</P>
<P>
   July was basically a travel month. I hit Cabo, one of my
favorite hangouts in all the world. I love the mountains, but at
heart, I'm a beach bum.
</P>
<P>
   There were a couple of trips to New York with my buddies,
because that's such a fun place to party.
</P>
<P>
   In Vegas, I went to a party that Mavs owner Mark Cuban was
throwing for one of his friends. He'd hired John Cougar Mellencamp
to play in this guy's back yard. How cool was that?
</P>
<P>
   My love life? Not much to tell, really. No, I mean it.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, I date a little now and then, play the field, but
there's nothing really hot going romance-wise. That part of my life
is at a stale point right now and that's OK with me.
</P>
<P>
   Honest.
</P>
<P>
   I've found when I get serious in a relationship, I kind of lose
my focus on hockey. So, I've told myself I've got four more years
on my current contract, and I want to have the four best years I
can possibly have.
</P>
<P>
   I really do want to be the best. I'd love to be the league's
MVP. Who knows, if I can play as well all season as I was at the
end of last season, the honors will come.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long time since a team went to the finals three
years in a row. We can do it and we can win it again.
</P>
<P>
   I shake my head every day at the way my life has turned out. I
would have never thought that my game or my popularity would have
ever gotten to this point.
</P>
<P>
   You don't think about those things when you're 18, 19. You just
want to go and play and enjoy the game, but things happen; the team
plays well and good things start coming your way off-ice, too.

AS YANKS BEAT JAYS, CLEMENS STAKES CLAIM AS THEIR TOP STARTER IN
OCTOBER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Unless the Yankees experience a monumental collapse
this month, they will play their first postseason game in 19 days.
Manager Joe Torre has a feel for what his starting lineup will look
like that night. Bernie Williams should be healthy, Chuck Knoblauch
should be easing back at second base and Jose Canseco or Glenallen
Hill could start at designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a slight mystery about who will pitch Game 1 of a
potential Division Series, but Roger Clemens continues to make his
case. Clemens tamed and tormented his former team in steering the
Yankees past the Blue Jays, 3-2, on Wednesday night at Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had a robust fastball, precise control and growing
confidence as he surrendered eight hits in seven innings and won
his ninth straight decision. Clemens is 9-0 with a 2.21 earned run
average since being activated from the disabled list on July 2. He
has not lost since the Mets battered him on June 9, the night of
the Mike Piazza beaning incident.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While Torre said the Yankees would study the matchups and then
determine how to align the starters, he said it would be very
surprising if Clemens were not the No. 1 starter in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``For certain, he's been the most consistent pitcher for us
since the All-Star break,'' Torre said. ``He's been the most
overpowering. He's been everything El Duque has been for the last
year and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez led the Yankees with 17 victories last season and
started the first game in all three rounds of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Torre will not make it official until he needs to,
Clemens is also perfectly on target to start the first postseason
game on Oct. 3. Clemens is scheduled to start on Sept. 18, Sept. 23
and Sept. 28 in the regular season and would then have his normal
four days of rest for Game 1 of the Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays strung together three straight hits to start the
eighth, ending Clemens' night. Clemens received a thunderous
standing ovation as he sauntered back to the dugout. The cheers
increased as Clemens crossed the foul line and lifted his black
glove to the 29,083 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Yankees were in a tense spot with the potential tying
runs on first and second. Jeff Nelson whiffed Alex Gonzalez and
handed the baseball to Mariano Rivera. After Dave Martinez's bloop
single loaded the bases, Rivera induced Carlos Delgado, the triple
crown threat, to pop to catcher Jorge Posada in foul territory.
Rivera then retired Brad Fullmer on a liner to second. Rivera gave
up a run in the ninth, but left runners on first and third by
getting Gonzalez on a flyout for his 34th save.

DODGERS TO PICK UP OPTION ON HANSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ There are questions about where the Los Angeles
Dodgers payroll will stand next season, whether they'll be able to
afford re-signing Darren Dreifort, extending the contract of Chan
Ho Park and signing another free-agent pitcher to round out the
staff.
</P>
<P>
   There's an issue in the bullpen with right-hander Mike Fetters,
eligible for free agency, as is catcher Chad Kreuter.
</P>
<P>
   But such should not be the scenario with pinch-hitter Dave
Hansen, who has given the Dodgers one of the game's
most-sought-after yet underrated weapons _ left-handed power off
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen, making $500,000 this season, has a club option for 2001
that would play him $550,000. The Dodgers plan to pick that up,
team officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan would be to come back, stay here,'' Hansen said. ``I
like it here. This is my home, a great place to play. I love all
the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen is the most dangerous pinch-hitter in baseball. He set a
major-league record with his seventh pinch-hit homer of the season
Tuesday and he's been the most productive pinch-hitter in baseball
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen is batting .288 with eight homers and 26 RBI in 2000.
Seven of his homers (and six of his pinch-hit homers) have either
tied the score or given the Dodgers the lead. He also has 14 RBI
and is batting .271 as a pinch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen's 13 career pinch-hit homers are second to John Vander
Wal among active players and eighth all-time. Cliff Johnson's 20 is
the record.
</P>
<P>
   But an offseason squabble nearly kept him from another season
with the club. Hansen returned from Japan to play with the Dodgers
in 1999, but rather than pick up his club option for 2000, the
Dodgers renegotiated a contract that paid him less than the club
option.
</P>
<P>
   There was also discussion at the end of spring training about
not keeping Hansen on the roster so the Dodgers could carry three
shortstops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven pinch-hit home runs in one season, that's special,''
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``There was a lot of
conversation in the offseason. People in the organization didn't
want to bring him back. I said we have to have him back.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Dodgers center fielder Tom Goodwin extended
his hitting streak to a career-high 14 games with a single to right
on the game's first pitch. . . . Catcher Angel Pena and
right-handers Al Reyes and Mike Judd are expected to join the
Dodgers today from the minor leagues. . . . The Dodgers are poised
to sign a deal to have their Double-A affiliate in Jacksonville,
Fla., after a 24-year relationship with San Antonio of the Texas
League. . . . Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros reached the 100-RBI
mark for the fifth time in his career with a sacrifice fly on
Tuesday. . . . Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek returned to the
lineup after missing one game with a bruised right thumb.

 S.F. ARCHITECTS WIN CONTEST FOR MLK MEMORIAL  &HT;     By CHUCK SQUATRIGLIA 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A parklike memorial to Martin Luther King Jr. to
be built in Washington, D.C., will include ``a stone of hope,'' a
winding stream and other features illustrating the metaphors the
slain civil rights leader used in his speeches.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial was designed by ROMA Design Group of San Francisco.
The firm bested 870 others Wednesday in an international
competition to design the memorial, which will add King to the
American heroes memorialized on the National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial, the first accorded a private citizen, is slated
for a four-acre site near the Lincoln Memorial, where King
delivered his ``I Have a Dream'' speech in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited to have the opportunity to work on such an
important project,'' said Boris Dramov, ROMA Design Group
president.
</P>
<P>
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, attended Wednesday's unveiling
of the winning design in Washington and called it ``uniquely
beautiful and meaningful.''
</P>
<P>
   ROMA's design calls for a crescent-shaped memorial park hugging
the shore of the Tidal Basin, a pool formed by the Potomac River. A
20-foot-high profile of King, carved in stone, will gaze toward the
Jefferson Memorial from the center of a plaza lined with oak, pine,
cherry and magnolia trees.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial will feature a path lined with niches commemorating
other heroes of the civil rights movement, including Medgar Evers
and four young girls killed in the 1963 firebombing of a church in
Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will enter through two gigantic opposing stones
engraved with excerpts from a speech King delivered in 1963: ``With
this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a
stone of hope. Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness
like a mighty stream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to incorporate into the design notable references
from Dr. King's speeches such as the `mountain of despair' and the
`stone of hope,' '' Dramov said.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of 11 architects, landscape designers and artists from
around the world reviewed entries from 34 countries before
selecting three finalists earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ROMA's design best ``captured the essence'' of King, his message
and the movement he led, said Adrian L. Wallace, president of the
board of the Martin Luther King Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an awesome design,'' Wallace said. ``It is more of an
experience than a memorial. We believe it will speak to the viewer
on many different levels.''
</P>
<P>
   The design must be approved by the National Capital Planning
Commission, the National Capital Memorial Commission and the
Commission of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Construction could begin within three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Martin Luther King Memorial Project Foundation has been
pushing 16 years for a memorial. It took 12 years for the
organization to get Congress to approve the memorial, which was
originally slated for a site at Constitution Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial's cost has not been determined, and its supporters
are launching an aggressive push for corporate and private
donations. Fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger has promised at least $5
million to the project.
</P>
<P>
   ROMA Design Group was recently selected to renovate the San
Francisco Ferry Building. The firm also designed the Embarcadero
Promenade in San Francisco and the Third Street Promenade in Santa
Monica.

 WOMEN, GAYS SAY NADER NOT DEFENDING THEIR RIGHTS  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With some polls showing the presidential race a
dead heat between Democrat Al Gore and Republican George Bush,
women's and gay rights organizations are more aggressively
targeting a man who could make the crucial difference in the
election _ Green Party candidate Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week with The Chronicle, Patricia Ireland,
president of the National Organization for Women, called Nader
``ill-informed about abortion rights,'' and noted his 10-page
candidacy statement ``did not mention any explicitly feminist
issues, not birth control or abortion ... and not violence against
women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just an indifference,'' said Ireland in comments
mirrored in recent mailings by NOW, which has also criticized
Nader's handling of gay and lesbian issues. ``It's an ignorance
that's almost willful.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months before the election, the increasingly contentious
conversation over Nader's liberal credentials comes as the consumer
advocate returns for stumping in California whose 54 electoral
votes are crucial to Gore's campaign for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Nader is scheduled to speak at San Francisco State University
Thursday afternoon, then hold a press conference at Silicon
Valley's Cisco Systems Inc., a company in which he holds at least
$1 million in stock. He is also planning an early evening speech at
San Jose State University.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Amato, the longtime activist who heads Nader's
presidential campaign, says the criticism is unjust and that it
reflects how groups that traditionally back major political parties
are getting nervous about Nader's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're seeing massive turnouts for Ralph on the road, like
the 10,000 people who showed up in Portland, Ore.,'' said Amato.
``Unlike the other two candidates, (this) is a candidate who's
talking about the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Nader's threat appears to be diminishing in
California, with the most recent California Field Poll saying his
support is at 4 percent, down from 7 percent. National polls
routinely put Nader's support at around 3 to 4 percent, and the
race between Bush and Gore at a virtual tie.
</P>
<P>
   While the candidate has emphasized consumer issues, trade and
labor in his campaign, Nader _ in a recent interview with The
Chronicle, argued that there is no real difference between
Republicans and Democrats on the issue of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the difference, other than rhetoric?'' he said. ``You
know how many Republicans are telling me it's red meat for their
right wing? They don't want to destroy their party. It's not going
to happen,'' he said of the commonly expressed Democratic belief
that Bush could pick Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe
vs. Wade. ``I don't buy any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader argued that neither Bush nor Gore would make much of a
difference in protecting a woman's right to choose. ``(It's) all
rhetoric. The pro-choice people in this country do not understand
their power, because it's never been challenged,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such comments infuriate Ireland, who said they misrepresent the
grave danger posed to women's rights in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in Texas, Gov. Bush has signed 18 or 19 restrictive
laws'' affecting reproductive rights and funding, Ireland said.
``It would be one thing to say (Nader) hasn't worked on the issues;
it's another thing to be talking about issues you don't know
anything about.''
</P>
<P>
   Some gay rights advocates are also increasingly vocal about
Nader's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   David Smith, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, the
nation's largest gay, lesbian and transgender rights organization,
said the pivotal role Nader could play is one reason why he reminds
gay voters that Nader _ asked his position on abortion and gay
rights in 1996 _ said he wasn't interested in ``gonadal politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we're asked about it, we tell people a vote for Nader
is a vote for Bush,'' said Smith, whose organization endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Amato, the candidate's campaign manager, said she agrees with
Nader that Republicans would not overturn Roe vs. Wade, but argued
that Nader's credentials include ``a four-decade record of reform
and support of issues that women hold near and dear to their
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``As consumers, as taxpayers, as shareholders, as voters ...
he's been out there fighting for women,'' she said, adding that
Nader's Web site  &UR; (www.votenader.org)  &LR; details his support for
NOW's agenda. And unlike Gore and Bush, she adds, Nader chose a
woman to be his running mate _ Native American activist Winona
LaDuke.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing that voters, by a 2-to-1 ratio, support the
entry of Nader and Reform candidate Pat Buchanan in the
presidential debates, Nader's California press spokesman, Ross
Mirkarimi, said Nader's best chance of getting his message across
may be if Americans demand his participation so they can hear from
him on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't agree with Ralph, so be it,'' he said. ``The
point is, don't buy into this most anti-democratic behavior. Let
Gore be the man he says he is and debate Ralph Nader,'' Mirkarimi
said. ``It's time to demystify the fear.''

L.A. TIMES ABANDONS ITS COMMUNITY NEWS OPERATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Acknowledging it failed to attract readers and
advertisers and lost money on the enterprise, the Los Angeles Times
on Wednesday abandoned its community news operation, scuttling 14
Our Times sections and laying off 125 workers, mostly journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Times also eliminated 45 advertising department
jobs from the main newspaper, bringing the total number of job cuts
in one day to 170. It was not immediately clear what prompted the
ad department cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It is a wide-ranging retreat on the local news front and the
latest of several changes since the paper was acquired by Tribune
Co. of Chicago this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Our Times editions ceasing publication covered a huge chunk
of Southern California, from West Ventura County to San Juan
Capistrano in South Orange County. Editions in Santa Clarita,
Sherman Oaks and Simi Valley were closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will still cover the major local stories, but we'll leave
the block-by-block coverage of neighborhoods to others,'' said
Editor John S. Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   He characterized the move as playing to the paper's strength --
coverage of the Southern California region, nation and world. No
additional editorial cuts are planned at this time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll declined to say how much money the community news
operation lost but said the amount was substantial. The editions
were implemented two years ago by former Times Mirror Co. chief
Mark Willes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have practiced community journalism myself and I know it is
difficult to do and I have questioned openly whether a paper on the
scale of the Los Angeles Times can also practice a form of
journalism that deals with communities block by block,'' Carroll
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said extensive changes are planned for the local news section
of the Times in 2001.

<P>
   Publisher John Puerner said the local news cutback was made for
both journalistic and economic reasons. ``Our Times sections were a
two-year effort in community news that was unable to attract the
readership and advertising necessary to make them financially
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Puerner, ``We want to focus on what we do best, which is
covering big regional stories.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of rumors of Our Times' demise, staffers learned
their fate during morning meetings with human resources officials.
They were given until 5 p.m. Wednesday to clean out their desks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any idea,'' former Ventura County Our Times
reporter Stacy Brown, an Encino resident, said of the cuts. He said
it was an uncomfortable session and that some workers were upset
that senior editorial department managers were not present.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was in a hurry to get out. She didn't want to see us,''
Brown said of the personnel department executive who broke the
news. ``She told us we were no longer needed and our positions were
eliminated as of today. I thought that was kind of bush league, but
what can you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown worked at the company for two years and said his severance
is four weeks' pay plus 12 days.
</P>
<P>
   The Times will continue to publish the Burbank Leader, Foothill
Leader and Glendale New Press, formerly independent papers that are
operated by the company's community news division. In addition, the
company will continue to publish a six-day-a-week Inland Valley
section and weekly sections in the San Gabriel Valley, South Bay
and Westside areas.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Tribune Co. bought the paper, several key executives
have departed or been reassigned and the newspaper has had to
restate its circulation, lowering the average by some 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   It also recently abandoned a deal with the Spanish-language
newspaper La Opinion whereby readers could buy both at a discounted
price after questions about the practice were raised by the Audit
Bureau of Circulations. The Times attributed a gain of 69,559 in
circulation with that deal, according to an earlier filing.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also recently demoted three editors with the
hiring of Dean Baquet, former national editor at The New York
Times, as the paper's managing editor, the No. 2 job in the
newsroom. Baquet formerly worked for the Chicago Tribune. The Times
also replaced the top two editors in its Southern California Living
section.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper industry analyst John Morton noted that changes such
as the folding of Our Times reflects an effort by parent Tribune to
boost profits. ``I just don't think they have found it economical
to do what they have been doing and this is probably the first step
the Tribune Co. is taking to get profit margins up to a comfortable
level.''

KINGS GET TO WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Kings flew to Phoenix after
Wednesday's practice and will open the 2000 exhibition season with
a matinee this morning against the Coyotes at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The early game is designed to get kids hooked on hockey, a
promotion the Kings hope to use next season at the Staples Center.
For now, their own youngsters have them excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too early to point out players in particular,'' coach
Andy Murray said. ``But we have stepped up our training camp, made
it much harder, and the players have responded. As a result, we
will use more players than usual in our first exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Against Phoenix, the Kings are expected to hold out veteran
forwards Luc Robitaille, Bryan Smolinski, Glen Murray, Stu Grimson
and Bob Corkum; defensemen Mattias Norstrom, Mathieu Schneider and
Aki Berg and goaltender Jamie Storr.
</P>
<P>
   Corkum and Schneider experienced strained hip muscles earlier
this week and did not make the trip. Ian Laperriere and Craig
Johnson also remained in Los Angeles, but they will play Sunday
against the Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   With holdout Jozef Stumpel in Slovakia, the Kings will use a
first line of Brad Chartrand, Ziggy Palffy and newcomer Tomas
Vlasak.
</P>
<P>
   Vlasak, 25, was first drafted by the Kings in 1993, but he
played five years in his native Czech Republic and two in Finland.
During the past two seasons, he has scored 54 and 48 goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings will go with speed on the second line of Nelson
Emerson, Steven Reinprecht and Jason Blake. If Stumpel returns by
the beginning of the season, Smolinski will play center, with
Emerson and Murray on the wings.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Stumpel signed a one-month contract with Bratislava of
the Czech League, putting the Kings' negotiations on the clock. If
Stumpel plays there after the beginning of the NHL regular season,
there is a good chance he could miss the entire year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he plays with them after the season starts, even if he
signs, he would have to clear waivers and that isn't going to
happen,'' Kings GM Dave Taylor said. ``It is a situation we had
with Aki Berg (during the 1998-99 season).''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings will play two exhibition games at the Staples Center:
this Sunday against the Mighty Ducks and Sept. 26 against Phoenix.
They also play San Jose in Bakersfield on Sept. 23 and Colorado
Sept. 30 in Las Vegas. All games will be broadcast on KRLA-AM
(1110). The Sept. 26 game vs. the Coyotes will be televised on Fox
Sports Net.!dlim!

L.A. TIMES ABANDONS ITS COMMUNITY NEWS OPERATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Acknowledging it failed to attract readers and
advertisers and lost money on the enterprise, the Los Angeles Times
on Wednesday abandoned its community news operation, scuttling 14
Our Times sections and laying off 125 workers, mostly journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Times also eliminated 45 advertising department
jobs from the main newspaper, bringing the total number of job cuts
in one day to 170. It was not immediately clear what prompted the
ad department cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It is a wide-ranging retreat on the local news front and the
latest of several changes since the paper was acquired by Tribune
Co. of Chicago this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Our Times editions ceasing publication covered a huge chunk
of Southern California, from West Ventura County to San Juan
Capistrano in South Orange County. Editions in Santa Clarita,
Sherman Oaks and Simi Valley were closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will still cover the major local stories, but we'll leave
the block-by-block coverage of neighborhoods to others,'' said
Editor John S. Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   He characterized the move as playing to the paper's strength --
coverage of the Southern California region, nation and world. No
additional editorial cuts are planned at this time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll declined to say how much money the community news
operation lost but said the amount was substantial. The editions
were implemented two years ago by former Times Mirror Co. chief
Mark Willes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have practiced community journalism myself and I know it is
difficult to do and I have questioned openly whether a paper on the
scale of the Los Angeles Times can also practice a form of
journalism that deals with communities block by block,'' Carroll
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said extensive changes are planned for the local news section
of the Times in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher John Puerner said the local news cutback was made for
both journalistic and economic reasons. ``Our Times sections were a
two-year effort in community news that was unable to attract the
readership and advertising necessary to make them financially
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Puerner, ``We want to focus on what we do best, which is
covering big regional stories.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of rumors of Our Times' demise, staffers learned
their fate during morning meetings with human resources officials.

   ``We didn't have any idea,'' former Ventura County Our Times

</P>
<P>

BRUINS WILL PUNT FOR PLAYING TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA has been forced to punt on its first
possession against both Alabama and Fresno State. The results: a
71-yard return for a touchdown by Alabama's Freddie Milons and a
mishandled snap by Nate Fikse that handed Fresno State the ball on
the 6-yard line, leading to a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Another punt should have ended disastrously, but Fresno State's
Charles Smith, after returning the ball 75 yards, was tripped by a
teammate with no Bruins in sight at the UCLA 7-yard line. The
Bruins' defense rescued them by stopping Fresno State on downs.
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, the Bruins, who hadn't allowed a punt return for
a touchdown since Bob Toledo's first game as head coach _ by
Tennessee's Terry Fair in 1996 _ should have given up two in two
games.
</P>
<P>
   If the punt team is in need of a good swift kick, Toledo is
happy to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   The fullbacks, tight ends and linebackers who comprise most of
the punt team will see their playing time cut on offense and
defense if they don't begin performing better.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't play as much on offense and defense if they can't
give me better effort on the punt team,'' said Toledo, no doubt
aware that Michigan punt returner Ronald Bellamy is averaging 14.0
yards per return this season, with a long of 48 yards.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hot, hot, hot: When Michigan comes out to California, the
last thing it figured to have to worry about was the weather. Yet,
the National Weather Service is predicting highs of around 100 in
Pasadena for today and Friday, and Saturday isn't expected to be
much different.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan practiced in much milder conditions Wednesday, with
temperatures in Ann Arbor in the low 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, UCLA didn't do any conditioning work Wednesday and
Toledo told the team at the end of practice to begin hydrating
themselves and to get plenty of rest. But there were no plans for
UCLA to wear white jerseys and force Michigan to wear its
heat-absorbing dark blue jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like those baby blue jerseys,'' Toledo said. ``It makes us
look like we're not very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Big House West: A crowd of about 85,000 is expected for
Saturday's game, meaning it could be UCLA's largest home crowd for
a non-USC or Rose Bowl game in school history. The largest was the
1997 Washington game that drew 85,697.

TRY SAYING `GOOD NIGHT,' GEORGE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What everyone is missing about the George W. Bush campaign is
that the weird stuff isn't subliminable, it's intentional.
</P>
<P>
   Bush realizes that his only hope for election is to come off as
a guy who will be fun to have around.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't know the difference between a billion and a trillion?
Hey, he's one of us!
</P>
<P>
   He forgets that his microphone is live and says a nasty word?
Boy, the guys in the Cabinet meetings are going to razz him
something fierce!
</P>
<P>
   Bush is offering himself as the refreshing antidote to the
overintellectualization of America. Look, I just used a 23-letter
word and put half of my readers to sleep. I almost dozed off
myself.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is hoping Americans will decide it would be a hoot to have
a cross between Lucy Ricardo and Gracie Allen running the country.
</P>
<P>
   The roles of Fred and Ethyl Mertz could be played by Madeleine
Albright and Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   BUT I digress. Bush, in playing the ditz card, is on the right
track.
</P>
<P>
   Much is made of W's vaudevillian verbal pratfalls, but I have
received several items that seem to indicate a move toward
abandoning all the pretentious and nitpicky rules and conventions
of language.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hilltop Mall in Richmond, Kimberly Stigers saw a sign in
front of the Lane Bryant store: ``We sell women sizes 14-26.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that illegal?'' Stigers asks.
</P>
<P>
   On a ``60 Minutes'' segment about education in Gov. Bush's
Texas, W bragged about ``exemplarary'' Texas school tests.
</P>
<P>
   Yikes. Yet in the San Francisco Main Library, where some kind of
contest was in progress, Richard Kales saw this sign: ``Submit your
entrys here.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the Embarcadero Muni station, Kales took out a pen and
fixed a sign that read: ``Take the N Judah to the Giant's game.''
</P>
<P>
   ANONYMOUS caller Old Homeboy says he was watching the Giants on
TV, on KTVU Channel 2, when this message was flashed on the screen:
``If your looking for the news, it's on 36.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you're looking for the proper use of ``you're,'' you're
outta luck.
</P>
<P>
   At the Oakland Airport, Paul Giurlanda was struck (figuratively)
by an ad for a new parking lot: ``Park with us once and you will
never park anywhere again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like an offer you can't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   A guy named Larry picked up a bottle of pills for his cat Cleo
at a pharmacy. The label instructions: ``Take two a day until
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Cats have a Dr. Kevorkian?
</P>
<P>
   It's not just Republicans. Anne Cruikshanks attended the
Democratic National Convention as a Louisiana delegate and was
given a packet of buttons to wear with pride, with Louisiana
misspelled.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Anne went to a strategy forum in Rhode Island, where
attendees were given notepads imprinted ``Naval War Colege.''
</P>
<P>
   IN THE NEW spirit of freewheeling plain speech, newspapers make
fun mistakes, too.
</P>
<P>
   The S.F. Examiner has been sold to the Fang family, and the
Fangs are moving the editorial operation into the Fox Warfield
Building at Market and Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   So new security measures have been put in force at the building.
The new rules are posted at the building entrance, and see how many
errors you can spot:
</P>
<P>
   ``Attention to all tenants and clients. Doors are locked after
between 5 P.M. - 8:00 A.M. and all day weekends. Only tenants with
their registered keys can access to the building after hours. All
other client's must contact with the tenant ...''
</P>
<P>
   I count seven mistakes. That's more than I make in an entire
column. Usually.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO sometimes takes itself too seriously, too, but
that can be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Union Square Business Improvement District is holding an
open audition Thursday for Cable Car CASey. The CAS stands for
Clean And Safe.
</P>
<P>
   This delightful character will work the Square, giving
directions, helping old folks cross streets, breaking up
prostitution rings.
</P>
<P>
   The flyer says CASey will, ``with a style and flair that evokes
San Francisco's turn-of-the-century elegance, create a character
that will become a San Francisco icon.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, I thought that was Willie Brown's job.
</P>
<P>
   WILLIE HIMSELF was on the town Tuesday night, he dropped by the
VIP cocktail reception at Frette, the new luxury bed-linen shop on
Geary.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the squeamish of pocketbook, this place. One robe-like
female lounging garment had a price tag of $1,700. And look,
there's the hippest liquid in town _ a quart bottle of scented
ironing water, $20.
</P>
<P>
   George Shultz, with wife Charlotte Mailliard Shultz, obviously
thought the occasion was special. He sent a request to the
three-piece band to play ``Some Enchanted Evening.''
</P>
<P>
   My rule for gauging the VIP-ness of an event is that it is in
inverse proportion to the size of the hors d'oeuvres. Each of
Frette's delicate morsels could easily hide under a postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
   City arts czar Stanlee Gatti fell in love with a babe at the
party. It was the 3-week-old child of Summer Tompkins Walker. Gatti
gave the child's cheek a teeny mustache rash, but the wee one
smiled and forgave Uncle Stan.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S UP with public art in the city, by the way?
</P>
<P>
   Gatti says there are no feet, nor any other major public art
projects, on the horizon. It's been Slumpsville for Gatti and his
commission ever since the Board of Supes rejected the proposed
``The Foot'' sculpture for the Embarcadero.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Foot' was a setback,'' Gatti says, ``and so was the vote
to fund the Embarcadero Organ. Those two things undermined the Arts
Commission and the arts community.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody agrees on anything, so everybody gets nothing.

FEDS GIVE L.A. ULTIMATUM ON POLICE REFORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Justice Department lawyer spearheading the
demands for LAPD reform told the City Council in uncompromising
terms that the city faces two choices: Agree quickly to a federal
court consent decree or face a lawsuit that could mean stricter
controls.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Assistant Attorney General Bill Lann Lee, a former Los
Angeles civil rights attorney who heads the Justice Department's
civil rights division, issued the ultimatum Wednesday during a
brief presentation to the council as it prepares next week to go
over the 84-page document in a paragraph-by-paragraph review.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking softly but with a stern precision to an unusually quiet
council chamber, Lee said the city's problems with trying to reform
the Police Department date back a decade when it failed to fully
implement the Christopher Commission recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, police reform must remain at the top of the city's
agenda for as long as it takes to get the job done,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   To do so, he said, could only be accomplished with the city
agreeing to a consent decree monitored by the federal courts in Los
Angeles with an independent monitor overseeing the reform process.
</P>
<P>
   Lee took only two questions from council members and then rushed
off to catch a flight to Washington, D.C. Police officers blocked
off City Hall doors and hallways to prevent him from being
followed.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of a consent decree -- which Justice Department
officials want completed by the end of the month -- has been a
major stumbling block in the negotiations, with Mayor Richard
Riordan and Police Chief Bernard C. Parks pushing instead for a
different type of agreement known as a memorandum of understanding.
</P>
<P>
   City Attorney James Hahn has argued the city should sign the
consent decree, negotiated in secret since May, to avoid tougher
restrictions from a federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Nine council members -- one short of the number needed to
override a Riordan veto -- appear to support the consent decree
with Northeast Valley Councilman Alex Padilla undecided and Council
President John Ferraro too ill to attend a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Lee made clear he wants a consent decree and he wants it soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been negotiating with the city for four months,'' Lee
said. ``We have been investigating for four years. We need to get
this done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a solemn decision for me when it comes to filing
litigation. We do it because we mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the costs of reforms -- estimated at up to $45 million a year
-- as well as the need for a consent decree, Lee said the proposals
being made were not new.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken the best ideas from the city of Los Angeles and
put that in the consent decree,'' Lee said. ``As for costs, the Los
Angeles Police Department has a more than $1 billion budget. We
believe the funds can be found.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee also voiced confidence the federal government would win in
court based on the Rampart Division corruption case and the
admissions contained in an LAPD Board of Inquiry report into that
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem within the LAPD was its failure to implement
a computerized tracking system -- for which the federal government
provided seed money -- to track problem officers.
</P>
<P>
   If such a system had been in place, Lee said, he believes the
Rampart Division problems would have been either discovered earlier
or minimized.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said he appreciated the city's willingness to negotiate and
took note that several of the reforms called for in the consent
decree proposal are under way.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the consent decree was needed to assure the
reforms continued in a timely fashion along with other proposals,
including a racial profiling system for all motorist and pedestrian
stops by officers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said the agreement will provide for a
strengthening of the civilian oversight of the Police Commission,
expand Internal Investigations, provide a closer examination of the
department's disciplinary process and attempt to deal with
retaliation against officers who report allegations of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The council has scheduled to hold a special meeting and public
hearing at 10 a.m. Monday, where Council President Pro Tem Ruth
Galanter said she hopes review the agreement to try to develop
council consensus on the issues.

FLAME THROWER WRAPS GREAT MEET FOR BAFFERT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; DEL MAR, Calif. _ The last order of business at the Del Mar
meeting proved to be a mere formality.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert picked up the rubber stamp and put his name on the
$250,000 Del Mar Futurity again Wednesday, winning California's
biggest 2-year-olds race of the summer for the fifth year in a row,
this time with front-running Flame Thrower and jockey Jerry Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy. Flame Thrower, the even-money favorite, lost the
lead in midstretch and had to come back along the rail to beat
Street Cry by a head in 1:22 for 7 furlongs.
</P>
<P>
   But the result seemed routine as Baffert became the first
trainer in Del Mar's 64-year history to win the same stakes five
straight years, and capped his fourth consecutive Del Mar training
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert also won Wednesday's $77,300 CERF Handicap with Chilukki
and Bailey, and finished the 43-day season with 33 winners, the
most since Farrell Jones' 35 in 1963. Baffert set a Del Mar record
with 13 stakes victories.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he had anxious moments during the Futurity. Flame
Thrower, who had barely trailed in winning his first two starts,
had to battle Baffert-trained Arabian Light for the early lead this
time, and their half-mile split was a grueling 44 1/5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they turned for home, I saw 44-and-1 (on the clock), and
I thought, 'Oh, I'm in trouble,' '' Baffert said. ``But this horse
reached down and found something extra.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The good ones find a way to win, and this guy did,'' Bailey
said of the winner, a son of Saint Ballado.
</P>
<P>
   Arabian Light held on for third. Glorious Bid, another colt from
Baffert's barn, finished sixth in the field of eight.
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up, Street Cry, is trained by Eoin Harty, a former
Baffert assistant. Some thought Baffert would suffer after Harty
left in January to work for Godolphin Racing of Dubai. But Baffert
keeps winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost the battle, but we haven't lost the war,'' said Harty,
who's confident Street Cry will have the advantage in longer races.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert compared Flame Thrower to Silver Charm, the 1997
Kentucky Derby winner who was the first of the trainer's five
Futurity champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got guts, you know?'' Baffert said. ``That 'You're not
going to pass me' is what I like about him. You can't really judge
them until they get hooked, and he has the heart to keep running
when he's hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said Flame Thrower, owned by Gary Garber, will use the
Oct. 7 Norfolk Stakes at Santa Anita as his prep for the Nov. 4
Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Victor Espinoza finished with 52 victories and won his
first Del Mar jockey championship by a margin of 20 over Kent
Desormeaux. . . . Bailey's victories with Chilukki and Flame
Thrower were the first at Del Mar in the Hall of Fame jockey's
career. He rode the most famous loser in Del Mar history, 1996
Pacific Classic runner-up Cigar. . . . Pacific Classic winner
Skimming was named Horse of the Meeting in a press-box poll. . . .
Baffert's five consecutive Del Mar Futurity victories did not set a
record for the Southern California circuit. Charlie Whittingham
trained six straight winners of Hollywood Park's Sunset Handicap
(1978-83).

GONZALEZ TO BE FETED AT FAIR OPENING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; POMONA, Calif. _ The events of a year ago will be on
everybody's minds when the Los Angeles County Fair season begins
with 13 races this afternoon at Fairplex Park.
</P>
<P>
   Leading-rider contenders at the 18-day meet will be competing
for the J.C. Gonzalez Memorial Jockey Award, established after
Gonzalez was killed in a racetrack accident on opening day in 1999.
Gonzalez's memory will also be honored Saturday when his family
joins current and retired jockeys _ including Bill Shoemaker and
Johnny Longden _ for a winner's circle ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, the 1998 Fairplex riding champion, was 23 when he died
of head injuries Sept. 9, 1999, after his mount in the fifth race
broke down and fell, throwing the jockey in the path of trailing
horses.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gonzalez's parents filed a wrongful-death suit
against trainer Sandy Shulman, three co-owners and three
veterinarians, alleging that the ill-fated horse, Wolfhunt, was
allowed to race despite serious medical problems, and that
California laws on the reporting of medication use were violated.
</P>
<P>
   First post is set for noon all 18 consecutive days of the fair.
Racetrack admission is free with a $10 fair general admission
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The opening-day card begins with two appaloosa races. The
thoroughbred races include a pair of $50,000 stakes. Matt Garcia
rides favorites Grey Memo in the 6 -furlong Foothill Stakes for
3-year-olds and Sea Reel in the 6 -furlong Bustles and Bows for
2-year-old fillies.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Pedroza has 10 scheduled mounts today as he opens defense
of his 1999 riding championship. Mel Stute, Fairplex's all-time
leading trainer, and Paul Aguirre tied for the training title last
year.

STRIKING ACTORS TRY A 3RD TIME &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Take 3 of talks in the strike between commercial
actors and advertisers got under way Wednesday with no immediate
breakthroughs as Hollywood stars and union leaders pledged their
support to more than 1,000 striking actors in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the actors' unions and advertising industry
called the first day of negotiations ``businesslike'' but declined
to elaborate at the request of federal mediators who are trying to
end the nearly 5-month-old strike.
</P>
<P>
   Mediator John Muir said the two sides met for seven hours -- ``I
would characterize it as productive'' -- and that the talks should
resume today at the World Trade Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Similar talks have broken down twice before, in June and July,
with each side accusing the other of failing to budge from an
unreasonable position.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both instances we offered modifications and changes and
they refused to take it seriously,'' said Greg Krisman, spokesman
for the Screen Actors Guild, which launched the strike with the
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for the Association of National Advertisers did not
return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The strike is now in its 19th week, affecting 135,000 actors,
about a quarter of them from the San Fernando Valley. It has cost
Los Angeles County's economy an estimated $165 million, said Jack
Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very crucial day to see what the first blush is
from the negotiations back in New York,'' Kyser said. ``If the
negotiations break down, the reservoir of ill will continues to
build.''
</P>
<P>
   To mark the new round of talks, union leaders staged rallies in
New York, Chicago, Atlanta and elsewhere and picketed around the
country at plants of General Motors, the strike's main target for
repeatedly using nonunion actors during the strike.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles rally drew well over 1,000 people to La Brea Tar
Pits for speeches and a show of support from about 30 celebrities
including Tom Hanks, Patricia Arquette, Valerie Harper, Rob
Schneider and Julianna Margulies and Jack Klugman.
</P>
<P>
   With some stars leading the way, striking actors marched along
Wilshire Boulevard to picket outside three advertising agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to choose to use our talent to sell their
products, we only ask they pay us fairly,'' Hanks said. ``We
deserve an honest partner across the negotiating table to help us
get there.''
</P>
<P>
   For those in the crowd who've not seen work since the strike
started May 1, the financial squeeze is beginning to hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Matlock, 41, of Burbank said she had to take catering work
in the interim and forgo a summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about how much these companies and advertisers
make, it's not like we're taking food out of anyone's mouth here
just to make a living,'' Matlock said.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial actors have rejected a proposed contract by
advertisers that would eliminate residuals for ads that run on
network television and instead pay a flat fee, as is now the case
with cable ads.
</P>
<P>
   Actors call that a ``rollback'' that could cut their wages some
50 percent, while advertisers say it would represent a 17 percent
pay increase over the pay-per-play system.
</P>
<P>
   As a concession for Wednesday's talks, union officials said they
are now willing to take less residuals than previously requested
for ads on smaller cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides also want jurisdiction over Internet ads.
</P>
<P>
   Full-time commercial actor Michael French, 48, said he is
prepared to hold out until next year, when TV and movie actors and
writers may also go on strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will put a lot of pressure on them if the film and TV
industries would have to shut down,'' French said.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has accelerated production in advance of the feared
strike, as partly reflected in the record number of motion picture
and television jobs reported in Los Angeles County in August, Kyser
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strike is gaining momentum and the advertisers have been
impacted more than they're letting on,'' Todd Amorder, chairman of
SAG/AFTRA's member strike committee told the crowd in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He said the strike's impact can be seen in the low quality of
nonunion ads flooding radio and television.

 ENTERTAINMENT LEADERS SPAR WITH SENATORS OVER MARKETING  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The entertainment industry defiantly challenged
charges at a showcase Senate hearing Wednesday that it markets sex
and violence to children.
</P>
<P>
   The reception it received was not warm.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., emerged as Hollywood's lone
defender amid a cast of industry attackers that included Joe
Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential nominee; Lynn Cheney,
wife of Republican vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney; and
members of both parties on the Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Amid an intense election-year battle over values and families,
the hearing was a response to a Federal Trade Commission study
issued Monday that said the entertainment industry ``routinely''
targets children for ``violent movies, music and electronic games''
that its own ratings say are inappropriate for children.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties warned that the industry faces a federal crackdown
unless it stops marketing adult material to children.
</P>
<P>
   But industry representatives sharply disputed the FTC findings.
</P>
<P>
   Blasting the study and the hearing, Artemis Records Chief
Executive Officer Danny Goldberg said, ``So-called self-regulation
achieved by political intimidation is the equivalent of
censorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg argued that ``gangsta rap'' is the ``direct
descendant'' of the gangster movies of the 1940s, television
Westerns of the 1950s and ``critically acclaimed films such as `The
Godfather.' '' insisting, ``This country will cease to be free the
day one group of parents can tell all other parents how to raise
their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Strauss Zelnick, chief executive officer of record company BMG
Entertainment, said that ``violence is part of the world that
creates, buys and is influenced by our music'' and that ``the
ultimate responsibility for deciding what music our young people
listen to rests with parents in their homes, not public
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our artists legitimately express and comment on the
problems of our society,'' Zelnick said. ``We need to ensure that
their voices are heard ... I stand by our art, just as I stand by
our sense of taste and restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   But such defenses only seemed to elicit pointed comparisons
between the entertainment industry and tobacco company executives,
who in similar Senate hearings once denied marketing cigarettes to
children and disputed the linkage between smoking and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every member of the panel accused the industry of making
billions of dollars selling what Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., called ``the
glorification of killing'' and ``the debasement of virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Defending these market practices does not defend art or free
expression,'' said committee Chairman John McCain, the Arizona
Republican who made his own failed White House bid this year. ``It
defends the bottom line of your corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., agreed. ``It has never been the law
of the land, nor will it ever be, that those engaged in the sale of
a product that harms children will have an unfettered right to
cause that harm,'' Markey testified.
</P>
<P>
   The lyrics of hip-hop star Eminem, who recently won two MTV
awards, was of particular focus. Cheney, the former head of the
National Endowment for the Humanities, distributed the misogynistic
lyrics of Eminem's ``Kill You,'' which speak of his raping and
murdering his mother, gays and ``wives, nuns, sluts'' with ``the
machete from O.J.,'' among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., questioned how the executives could defend
such lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg argued that it it would be impossible to impose a
rating system on music, because unlike movie nudity or sex, lyrics
are words that ``are by their nature impressionistic and are often
used symbolically. No one really thought that the words to `killing
me softly with his song' referred to murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Rating lyrics would be like rating books, Goldberg insisted, and
violate constitutional protection of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney agreed that the First Amendment would make federal
regulation dubious and called instead for ``people of stature'' to
publicly hold industry executives responsible for selling such
material.
</P>
<P>
   In a swipe at her husband's opponents, Cheney added, ``Two
people of stature are Vice President Gore and Sen. Lieberman,''
suggesting they raise the issue at a  &LR; Thursday  &LR; fund-raiser they
are to attend with Miramax Films Co-Chairman Harvey Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, for his part, decried the ``culture of carnage'' in
the entertainment industry and demanded that companies impose ``an
immediate cease-fire in the marketing of adult-rated products to
children.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain blasted movie executives for failing to appear at the
hearing, sending in their place Jack Valenti, president of the
Motion Picture Association of America. McCain said nearly all the
studio executives claimed to be out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti maintained that the line between reasonable and
unacceptable marketing is imprecise. ``We are not dealing with
Euclid's geometry,'' Valenti said. ``We are dealing here with the
irregular passions of subjective judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives strongly challenged the FTC's
conclusion that entertainment companies are targeting children by
advertising adult material on television shows such as ``Xena:
Warrior Princess'' and ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the audiences of the television shows and magazines
cited by the FTC are primarily adult, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, this information in the report is misleading,''
said Peter Moore, president of SEGA of America, Inc., a San
Francisco video game maker. ``This type of speculation is
unconscionable in a document that has all the appearance of a
scientific survey.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said his industry uses a game-ratings system by the
independent Entertainment Software Ratings Board and has begun
following advertising guidelines set by the Advertising Review
Council established this year.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer was the only senator who spoke in the industry's defense,
acknowledging that the FTC report ``makes some very good points''
but questioned whether changing industry practices would ``cure the
violence problem in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Guns are a much bigger problem, Boxer argued, noting that
Detroit, Michigan and Windsor, Canada, are divided by only a river
and get the same movies, television, music and video games, but
Detroit had 354 gun deaths in 1997 while Windsor had just four.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also said they would avoid legislation, but expect the
industry to follow Walt Disney Co., which announced Tuesday that
its ABC television network would refuse advertisements for R-rated
films during prime time and prohibit theaters from showing trailers
for R-rated films before its movies.

JACOBS WITHDRAWAL CURIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ On September 5, a respiratory infection did
what no American at the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials could
accomplish: It caught up to Regina Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old L.A. native wasn't able to finish a workout on a
track near her Oakland home. Three days later, Jacobs, the U.S.
Trials champion in the 1,500 meters (and the newly minted
American-record holder in the 5,000 meters), announced she was
bowing out of the 2000 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released late Friday by one of her sponsors,
Jacobs cited an infection that had been gaining on her since mid-
August, when she first started having trouble breathing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped to get it under control before Sydney,'' said
Jacobs, a graduate of North Hollywood's Argyll Episcopal Academy,
``but we seem to have run out of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1,500-meter heats won't be run until Sept. 27, begging the
question: What was Regina's rush to withdraw?
</P>
<P>
   Kerri Strug had 90 seconds to decide whether or not to attempt a
second vault on her aching left ankle at the 1996 Olympics. Talk
about being up against a time constraint.
</P>
<P>
   Strug, of course, decided to do the vault and scored a 9.7 to
secure the U.S. team's all-around victory over the Russians as well
as her own Olympic legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Genter had less than 24 hours to decide whether or not the
emergency surgery he had just undergone for a collapsed lung would
keep him out of the 200-meter freestyle at the 1972 Summer
Olympics. One day isn't much time to mull over such a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Genter gingerly walked out of the Munich hospital and proceeded
to the pool. Tender stitches and all, he managed to lead the 200
final for the first 150 meters before being overtaken on the final
lap by Mark Spitz.
</P>
<P>
   Next to 90 seconds and one day, three weeks would seem an
embarrassment of hours in which to recover.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Jacobs needed to search far and wide for
inspiration. Camarillo High product Marla Runyan couldn't practice
in the days leading to the U.S. Trials because of a leg injury, yet
she managed to earn a berth to Sydney in the 1,500 meters by
gutting out a third-place finish behind Jacobs and Suzy Favor
Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Devers, a teammate of Jacobs on the past three U.S. Olympic
teams, competed in the 100-meter hurdles in 1988 despite suffering
from blurred vision and other symptoms that later would be
diagnosed as Graves disease.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Ludmila Engquist of Sweden, who refused to let
chemotherapy treatments for breast cancer keep her out of the World
Championships last summer, winning the bronze medal in the sprint
hurdles three months after undergoing a mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs doesn't concede one step to her opponents on the track so
it makes no sense for her to give a viral infection such a wide
berth.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping out of the Olympics when there still is time to get
well is not Jacobs' style. It's like watching her walk off the
track a few hundred meters before the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs' decision seemed all the more curious considering she
said she plans to travel to Sydney to cheer on the U.S. team. If
she will be in Australia, anyway, why not wait to see how she
feels, physically, in the next week or so before announcing her
race intentions?
</P>
<P>
   The track entry deadline for the Olympics was Monday, which
created some sense of urgency, we suppose. By making her decision
when she did, Jacobs enabled U.S. track officials to add Shayne
Culpepper, who was fourth in the 1,500 at the Trials, to the
Olympic team. A noble gesture, that, but let's be honest: Jacobs,
operating at less than her full breathing capacity, remains a
better bet to win a medal than Culpepper, who is the 63rd-best
performer in the event this year (Jacobs is eighth and Favor
Hamilton first, off her winning time in Oslo in July).
</P>
<P>
   The last thing we want to believe is that Jacobs had anything to
fear in Sydney besides not winning.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day as Jacobs' announcement, the office of White
House drug czar Barry McCaffrey released a report that stated well
over half the participants in some Olympic sports have used
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Olympic athletes will be tested for the
endurance drug EPO in Sydney. It's an absolutely essential step
toward assuring that the timing or times of someone as celebrated
as Jacobs will never be suspect.

   CORRUPT-NATIONS (United Nations) _ Transparency International's
annual index of the most corrupt countries focused this year on how

   REPUBS-CONGRESS (Washington) _ The Republicans' decision on
Capitol Hill to shift their message to debt reduction and away from
tax cuts in the waning weeks of the session is the latest example
that they are pursuing a campaign strategy independent of Gov.
George W. Bush. While refusing to criticize Bush's large tax plan,
Republican candidates and incumbents on the campaign trail instead
are sticking to a strategy they say has served House Republicans
well this year, emphasizing smaller bite-size tax cuts that target
married couples, small business owners and farmers. By Lizette
Alvarez.

   GORE-FUNDRAISING (Washington) _ Vice President Al Gore attended
a Houston dinner in November 1995 to promote a budding relationship
between the Democratic Party and a handful of powerful Texas trial

donations from the lawyers' firms since 1996. But it also produced
some heavy-handed fund-raising that has recently drawn the scrutiny
of federal campaign finance investigators. Exclusive. By Don Van

   FIJI-MAHOGANY (Suva, Fiji) _ A coup here a few months ago
toppled the government. Many accounts told of how ethnic tension
had once again exploded. But behind the cries for ethnic solidarity
and native Fijian supremacy was a struggle over land, money and
mahogany, a competition that involved American and British as well
as local business interests. Like diamonds in Sierra Leone and oil
in Nigeria, Fiji's mahogany helped prompt a struggle for political
power, inflicting damage to the nation's economy and political
system well in excess of the riches the commodity once promised. By

with a population comparable to Australia. So the Aussies set up a

OLDER, WISER ABORIGINE ABANDONS BITTERNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The dark-skinned men of Aborigine origin are
seated around a wooden table in the middle of Redfern Park, doing
what men do when they've almost finished a case of beer in the
early hours of a sun-glistened afternoon, laughing, joking,
teasing, philosophizing and offering instant remedies for
humankind's ills.
</P>
<P>
   They regard the reporter warily through bleary eyes, and wonder
what he's doing in south Sydney in a faded enclave of low-end
business establishments and mean streets that contrasts
dramatically to the teeming opulence and skyscraper splendor and
spectacular harbor vistas only a few miles away in the middle of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't give a damn about the Olympics,'' says Donald Morgan,
the youngest of the group at 22, as he sips a bottle of VB
(Victoria Bitters). ``All I'm going to do is march in the protests.
Why should I care?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Same for me,'' says Mark Wickey, an older man with a gnarled
face and a shock of thick, black hair. ``I'm not planning to watch
the Games. Not me. I'll just come to the park and drink and forget
the way my people have been treated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys are all wrong, and I myself am looking forward to the
Olympics,'' says Bruce Ellis, who, at 58, is the oldest person
present and the one who seems to command the greatest respect.
``I'm happy the Games are here. I'm proud the Games are here. I'm
not in support of any of the protests. I wouldn't do anything to
upset this great event. Our problem is not with the rest of the
world. Our problem is only with the Australian government.''
</P>
<P>
   There are murmuring concurrences and loud dissents, as other men
join the impromptu symposium to voice their views.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney is aglow at the moment, bursting with civic pride, the
entire city draped in Olympic banners bearing the five rings, signs
and billboards everywhere hyping this Olympiad.
</P>
<P>
   But, as expected in an international event of such stature,
there will be various groups protesting, and the grievances of the
Aborigines have received the greatest coverage.
</P>
<P>
   And in an area known as Redfern, where most of the Aborigines in
Sydney live, there are strong emotions on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him what they did to you, Bruce,'' says Wickey. ``Tell
him how they took you from your parents when you were 4 years old.
Tell him about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Ellis shakes his head slowly, and there is a wistful
sadness in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately it's true . . . they took me when I was 4 and
moved me 300 miles away to a home with other Aborigine children,''
says Ellis, referring to a shameful Australian policy of abducting
Aborigine children from their parents to assimilate, as orphans,
into white society. ``I was away when my dad died. I was away from
1949 to 1961. I try not to think of it. I'm not the only one. It
happened to thousands of us. It's just something that happened, and
you just have to live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, a retired cameraman for the ABC (Australian Broadcasting
Company) doesn't display even a hint of bitterness, even though he
was one of the victims of a ghastly experiment that wasn't
discontinued until 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitler got some of his ideas from what was done to the
Aborigine children here,'' Wickey says bitterly. ``The only reason
I wasn't taken is that my grandfather was Scottish.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when you're kids and your parents say to you, 'The
Boogie Man is going to get you!' Well, when we were kids, our
parents would say, 'The Welfare Man is going to get you!' And we'd
be scared to death. What they were referring to was the Aborigine
Welfare Department, which was responsible for the child
kidnappings.''
</P>
<P>
   Aborigine athlete Cathy Freeman has become an Australian icon,
the most famous Aborigine since Lionel Rose reigned as the world's
bantamweight champion in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I'm rooting for Jenny Thompson (American swimming
star),'' Ellis says. ``Of course, I want Cathy Freeman to win. But
I'm a big fan of Jenny Thompson.''
</P>
<P>
   His friends shriek protests, but Ellis, a patriarchal figure
with his gray hair, remains adamant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a free thinker,'' he says. ``I know we've been wronged.
But that doesn't mean I can't root for someone just because they're
white and from another country. I compare what's happened to us
here to what happened to the Indians in America. We were both born
on the land, and then the white man came and kicked us off it. But
that's a long time ago, and now we have to learn to get along.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Ellis points to the empty beer bottle he's holding in his
right hand, and that wistful sadness in his eyes suddenly returns. &QL;

BROADER DEFINITION OF `HATE CRIME' CLEARS HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ The House backed legislation Wednesday to expand
the definition of federal hate crimes to include acts of violence
based on a victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability.
<P>
   Though the House vote was non-binding, gay leaders hailed it as
a historic step for what has long been one of their top legislative
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by President Clinton and opposed by Republican
leaders, the measure now faces an uncertain future in a
House-Senate conference committee where legislators will decide its
fate. The Senate passed expanded hate-crimes legislation earlier
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a chance here to reaffirm America at its best,''
Clinton said at a White House event aimed at building support for
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The current law, passed in 1968, allows federal prosecution of
crimes that are based on the victim's race, color, religion or
national origin. The law limits federal involvement to cases in
which the crime is committed on federal property or while the
victim is engaged in a federally protected activity like voting.
</P>
<P>
   The new law would do away with those restrictions. In addition,
it would expand the definition of hate crimes to include violence
based on sexual orientation, gender or disability.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say that more than 10,000 hate crimes
are committed each year, ranging in severity from minor assaults to
murder.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional debate on the House floor, supporters repeatedly
brought up the brutal killing two years ago of Matthew Shepard, a
gay student at the University of Wyoming who was robbed before
being tied to a fence post and beaten to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a person is targeted, the assailant intends to send a
message to all members of that community,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi,
D-Calif. ``This is a different type of crime, and it demands a
different type of response.''
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers, D-Mich., called
Wednesday's vote the ``most important vote on civil rights in this
session of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argued that violent crimes should be universally
prosecuted without regard to the motives of the assailant or the
background of the victim.
</P>
<P>
   They said that local authorities do a fine job of going after
criminals motivated by hate, noting that in the Shepard case,
Wyoming authorities have already sentenced one of the attackers to
two consecutive life terms. If the law passes, they warned, some
perpetrators would try conjure a hate-based motive to their crime
in order to avoid local prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a better deal if you can get in the federal system
because you won't face the death penalty,'' said Rep. Lindsey
Graham, R-S.C., a former prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was endorsed by a comfortable 40-vote margin despite
opposition from Republican House leaders, who refused to bring the
actual legislation before the House for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Democratic supporters attached an amendment to a
defense bill that instructs members of the House-Senate conference
committee to adopt the Senate's hate-crime legislation.
</P>
<P>
   If members of the conference committee follow the House's
non-binding instructions, the hate-crimes measure will be a part of
the defense bill that will be before the House for an up-or-down
vote before it adjourns this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters were jubilant after winning support from the
Republican controlled House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it!'' declared David Smith, a spokesman for the Human
Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay lobbying organization.
``If the conference (committee) drops this language, they will be
thwarting the will of the House. It will fall squarely on the
shoulders of the Republican leaders of the House, and they will
have to pay the political price.''

U.S. STARTS STRONGLY

 c.2000 San Bernardino Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA, Australia _ After numerous false alarms, the
maturation of U.S. men's soccer might finally be at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Albright and Josh Wolff scored goals as the United States
dominated the Czech Republic but settled for an encouraging 2-2 tie
as soccer play began Wednesday in the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The soccer tournament kicks off before the Games officially
open, to allow for 16-nation tournaments to conclude before Closing
Ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the U.S. is considered a basketball country and a
gridiron (football) country,'' U.S. coach Clive Charles said. ``I
tell people all the time that we have young players in the United
States who can play well in any arena.''
</P>
<P>
   That arena Wednesday was Bruce Stadium, here in Australia's
capital 200 miles south of Sydney, where the faster and quicker
Yanks created scoring chances by the minute but took a tie when the
Czechs scored on a penalty in the 52nd minute before a well-bundled
capacity crowd of 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys came off the field disappointed, and that's good,
because they expected to win,'' Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   Three over-age players are allowed per team in what is
essentially an Under-23 tournament, and U.S. goalie Brad Friedel,
29, is one of the senior citizens. He also is one of the biggest
boosters of young American soccer talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it to you this way, that Czech team has lost, like,
twice in its last 17 games, and I think at times in the game we
played them off their butts,'' Friedel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I don't think young players in America get enough
credit. A lot of teams in Europe will go sign one of the Czech
players to a contract in Europe with a big club, and not one of our
players. Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Friedel, who plays in England for Liverpool, played for the 1992
Olympic team that was ushered out of the tournament after three
matches. He believes American soccer has undergone a sea change in
eight years _ in large part because Major League Soccer gives the
top college-age players a place to hone their skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is better than that team in 1992 in one big way _
we're all professionals here,'' he said. ``You can say what you
want about MLS, good or bad, but the MLS really, really helps
younger players. A lot of these players have played four years of
professional soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were there in '92, I think we had two professionals on
the team. We were all playing in college, and that doesn't compare
at all. So you're going out there and playing against a couple of
players who just got signed by (Italian clubs) and I'm going to go
back to UCLA to play San Diego State, and that doesn't compare.''
</P>
<P>
   Czech coach Karel Bruckner conceded the Americans surprised his
team, favored to win the four-nation Group C.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a wonderful team,'' Bruckner said of the U.S. ``We
had to defend them with all our might. There is much to be admired
_ their fast, counter-attacking offense, the way they closed on
defense. . . . We had to play for an even score.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Albright: ``I think we surprised them with our speed. We
were able to get wide and behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. is now in position to finish first or second in its
group if it can get favorable results vs. Cameroon and Kuwait,
considered inferior competition to the Czechs.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. men have never advanced to the second round of an
Olympic soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
   As Friedel noted, the MLS is the biggest change in U.S. Olympic
soccer. Forward Conor Casey, who assisted on Wolf's 44th minute
goal, was the only collegian on the field Wednesday.

   The MLS existed during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, but it was in
its first season. The lineup Charles used included several players
who contribute significantly on MLS clubs, including Ben Olsen and
Albright of D.C. United, Peter Vagenas and Danny Califf of the
Galaxy, Chad McCarty of Tampa Bay and Wolff of the Chicago Fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single one of these players who's here has a chance to
become a very, very good player on a very, very good team,''
Friedel said. ``No doubt in my mind. I haven't seen one player who
doesn't belong here. . . . Soccer in the United States for younger
players has gotten a lot better.''

NORTHERN ARIZONA ALWAYS KEY OPPONENT FOR CSUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's not just about Big Sky Conference
implications.
</P>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge's game against Northern Arizona on Saturday
is the home opener at North Campus Stadium and the first game of
CSUN's final season in the Big Sky.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always used NAU has a benchmark,'' CSUN coach Jeff
Kearin said. ``We respect their program. They've done it the right
way every year. We were newcomers and they used to beat us so bad.
Then we beat them (in 1997) and now we use them as a measuring
stick of where we've been, where we are and where we're going.''
</P>
<P>
   NAU leads the series 9-4 and is 5-3 in the 1990s but CSUN has
won the last three games, one by forfeit. The Matadors lost to the
Lumber Jacks 23-9 in 1993 and then it got much worse. NAU beat CSUN
60-7 in 1994, 68-7 in 1995 and 32-14 in 1996. The Matadors posted
21-13 and 41-10 victories the next two years but lost 31-10 last
year. NAU had to forfeit the win for using an ineligible player.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995 we lost 68-7 and it wasn't even that close,'' Kearin
admitted. ``They were first-and-goal inside the 10 with seven
minutes left and they took a knee four straight times so it
wouldn't be 75 something. The next year we played a great game and
lost. It was a really good game. We were in a position to win the
whole time. And the next year we beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the teams play in different states, Kearin considers
the Lumberjacks a rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's proven to be a game our kids get riled up over,'' Kearin
said. ``Traditionally, it's been Sacramento State and Cal Poly but
we haven't played Cal Poly over the years and Sacramento for some
reason or another hasn't materialized.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's offense hasn't been effective this season. That has
Kearin concerned because he believes NAU has a tough defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors are averaging 245.0 yards per game while their
opponents are averaging 530.5. And CSUN (1-1) has eight turnovers
in two games. The offense must improve to beat NAU, which beat
Chadron State 32-24 last week in its season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``(NAU) plays great defense,'' Kearin said. ``They're very
sound. I've always thought they've had a great plan and a great
scheme, especially against us. They've been effective against what
we do well. They try to discourage our run game. And their athletes
are fast enough to cover the pass. They're as effective as anyone
in the conference.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Amerson's absence: Wide receiver Drew Amerson will be missing
from the lineup against Northern Arizona with a severely bruised
right knee, leaving a struggling offense without its top receiver
for up to three to eight weeks. Amerson leads the team with 10
catches for 60 yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors have several quality receivers _ including D.J.
Hackett, Gil Rodriguez, Jason Stone and Jamaal Perry _ who will be
asked to pick up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about the guys coming in,'' Kearin said. ``I'm
nervous as heck about not having that big-play potential in there.
Drew is a constant threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Amerson also returned kickoffs and was averaging 29.4 yards per
return. Terrelus Wright and Perry both will return kickoffs.

FOR HERRONS, WINNING IS GENETIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim Herron can claim much of the glory in his decorated golf
family, including three PGA Tour victories.
</P>
<P>
   But the 30-year-old, fourth-year tour pro known as Lumpy, whose
father and grandfather both played in the U.S. Open, found himself
bettered again last summer by baby sister.
</P>
<P>
   Alissa Herron, 27, won the family's first U.S. Golf Association
title when she outlasted Leland Beckel 1-up in the 13th U.S.
Women's Mid-Amateur Championship _ with Lumpy as her caddie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only beaten Tim in two golf-related things,'' said
Alissa, a three-time Minnesota state amateur champion. ``I had a
hole-in-one before he did and I won a USGA championship before he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   She'll be defending her title next month at Big Canyon Country
Club in Newport Beach, remembering all that her hefty brother meant
to her during that inaugural national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to buy him a lot of dinners,'' she said, ``and did that
ever get expensive, because he does like to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lumpy also provided invaluable confidence for his sister
during an anxious week in which she shot 77-76 on the first day to
make the medal-play cut, then won two matches each of the next two
days to set up her 18-hole final with Beckel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I didn't know whether to check out of my room or
not,'' she said, recalling how she got increasingly more nervous as
she continued to survive. ``I'd ask him and he'd say like, 'No,
we're winning _ I went 36 yesterday and I'm planning on going 36
today.' '' Turned out, Alissa kept her nervousness along with her
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember having dinner the last night (before the
championship) and I'm getting sick to my stomach (with nerves) . .
. and I asked him, 'You've won so many times _ what do you think
the night before?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And he goes, `I thought of nothing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I told him, 'You're talking to a woman here _ a woman
can't think of nothing! That's the hardest thing she could possibly
do, is think of nothing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Lumpy's calming influence took hold in the final, when
Alissa took charge after losing the ninth hole and regrouped for a
winning birdie out of a fairway bunker on No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably the turning point,'' Beckel said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``What an honor it is to be a USGA champion,'' Herron said last
week during a visit to Big Canyon. ``The greatest thing is I get to
play in the Mid-Amateur for the rest of my life, and what that
means to me is I get to play great golf courses from here on until
I'm 90.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mid-Amateur, for women aged 25 and over, became the 13th
national championship offered by the USGA when it made its debut at
Southern Hills i 1987. It came about after the USGA determined it
was becoming increasingly more difficult for female amateurs to
compete equitably against college players. A career amateur has not
won the U.S. Amateur since Carol Semple Thompson in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   A record field of 533 entered this year, and Herron will face
approximately 130 survivors on Oct. 3-8 at par-72, 5.972-yard Big
Canyon, a course considerably more difficult than that short
yardage would indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is free to the event, which is open to all qualifiers
who reach their 25th birthday by Oct. 2 of this year and have a
handicap index not exceeding 9.4.
</P>
<P>
   __ Names in the game: Candie Kung of USC is the nation's
top-ranked women's player in the preseason Mastercard Collegiate
Golf Rankings. USC teammate Leila Chartrand is No. 17, and
Pepperdine's Michael Beard ties for 18th in the men's rankings. In
team rankings, the USC women open No. 4 and UCLA No. 18. The USC
men open No. 22. . . .

RANGERS' GLYNN ABSORBS A POUNDING FROM ORIOLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Nothing comes easy for the Rangers in this
season of misery. Even the few bright spots seem to have their
moments when they flare out.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates has been thrilled by Ryan Glynn
since the start of spring training, and one outing hardly changes
that. But Glynn suffered through his worst outing of the season
Wednesday night, giving up seven runs in 3 1/3 innings in the
Rangers' 9-4 loss to the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The loss snapped Glynn's two-game losing streak. He is now 5-4
with a 4.99 earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just couldn't get the ball down,'' Oates said. ``There were
a couple of balls that could have been, should have been, may have
been caught. But as far as Ryan was concerned, he was just a little
bit up.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said Glynn and Doug Davis are going to have nights like
this. Davis failed to go five innings in his last outing in Kansas
City. Both games are reminders that the Rangers' two young
pitchers, as excited as Oates has been about them, remain works in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night was only Glynn's 23rd major-league start, which
is less than a full season. Davis makes his 11th major-league start
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a reality check,'' Glynn said. ``I never took the
approach it was going to be easy. You can even ask \Rcatcher\S Bill
Haselman. Before the game I had great stuff. When I got out there,
I had good stuff and still got hit around.''
</P>
<P>
   Glynn didn't help matters by walking the leadoff hitter, Brady
Anderson. Glynn got the next two hitters, but Cal Ripken singled,
Chris Richard] lined a two-run double just over Rusty Greer's glove
in left-center and Brook Fordyce singled up the middle to make it
3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Richard added a two-run single in the third, and third baseman
Mike Lamb's throwing error led to two more runs in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes this happens,'' Glynn said. ``Sometimes you have to
take your spanking, deal with it and come back strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates expects that. Rick Helling and Kenny Rogers are still
expected to be the Rangers' No. 1 and No. 2 starters next season
but Glynn and Davis should be No. 4 and No. 5, with Darren Oliver
and/or Justin Thompson fitting in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Oates said there are a lot of teams that would love to have
Davis and Glynn as their No. 4 and No. 5 starters next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the Boston Red Sox,'' Oates said. ``Without Pedro
Martinez and his brother, Ramon, they're 18 games under .500. I'll
be willing to bet you anything Glynn and Davis aren't going to be
18 games under .500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rogers and Helling should be 18 games over .500. Glynn and
Davis should be four or five games over .500. But they're going to
get better and better. The biggest disappointment I've had this
season, other than losing, is not seeing \Rinjured center fielder\S
Ruben Mateo grow into a job. The most exciting thing is seeing how
far \RGlynn and Davis\S have come.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates even went so far as to say, ``I can see these guys winning
15 games next year. Who knows. It could be 15-10, it could be
13-12. But these guys have a better-than-average chance of winning
double-figures next year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Oates offered one caveat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to catch the ball,'' Oates said. ``We weren't too
sharp tonight defensively. We had a couple errors and there were
some balls in the outfield we didn't take good routes on. That's
the way it has been all year. As we finish this season and go into
next year, the one thing we have to do is get better defensively.''

TCU SOCCER PLAYERS STRIVE FOR THE PERFECT STRIKE AT THE BALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY PHILLIPS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The game is called ``butts up.'' Lose a
series of skills competitions, and your posterior becomes a willing
target for one of TCU midfielder Matt Groves' penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   This is not fun. Groves, a 5-foot-8 senior from Richardson, can
easily bruise one's backside with a soccer ball. His right foot
packs the hardest wallop of any TCU men's player.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Sherry Dick, a 5-10 sophomore forward on the TCU
women's team. At age 10, Dick had a shot timed at nearly 50 mph by
one of those carnival-game radar devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've always had that going for me,'' said Dick, a Sam
Houston High School graduate. ``We talk about it on the bus
sometimes, trying to figure out what makes me kick a ball so
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   How can average-sized athletes like Dick and Groves or football
place-kickers strike a ball with such force and momentum? Dick said
it has to do with form that comes naturally with time. Groves, who
has never used weights to improve his leg strength, credits years
of intense running and ball-striking repetition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knock balls at people just for fun,'' Groves said.
``I don't want to take anyone's head off, but you can get
frustrated out there and need to take it out on someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Groves, Dick and TCU men's and women's assistant coach Jay
Fitzgerald were put to a radar-gun test. Fitzgerald, a 6-6,
230-pound former goalkeeper at Creighton, can put some muscle
behind his kick.
</P>
<P>
   All three were asked to estimate how fast they could launch a
soccer ball from the 12-yard penalty spot. Dick guessed 70 miles
per hour. Groves figured in the mid-70s, and Fitzgerald's goal was
80.
</P>
<P>
   Carnac couldn't have guessed better. On their last tries, Dick
topped out at 70 and Groves at 75. Groves also broke a plastic
fastener that held the net and crossbar together.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald hit 80 on his third try before tailing off due to
fatigue. If 70-80 mph doesn't sound fast for a 12-yard soccer shot,
then consider this:
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Chicago Fire goalkeeper Zach Thornton set the Major
League Soccer record for a kicked ball at 86 mph. This season,
Thornton was timed at 81. In three seasons, Matt McKeon of the
Kansas City Wizards (78 mph) has come the closest.
</P>
<P>
   An ability to strike a ball hard can figure into the recruiting
equation, Fitzgerald said. It means a player can choose spots in
the net quickly and precisely, as well as score from longer
distances. In the beginning, Dick's unusual raw power attracted TCU
to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'd be hovering around 50,'' said TCU men's defender
Aaron Casey, who watched the experiment. ``I'd be way below
Sherry's kicks. I'd look pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Butts up.

OPTIONS PONDERED FOR DALLAS STARS' NEW CAMP SITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ The Stars might be swapping the Eco Challenge for
the I-35 challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Renovations to Dobson Ice Arena likely will prevent the Stars
from returning to Vail for training camp next September, and they
are considering conducting the camp at American Airlines Center in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Heber, who operates Dobson, said construction is scheduled
from April to November.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the case, in all likelihood, it won't be available
next year,'' Stars general manager Bob Gainey said. ``And we'll
have to find somewhere else. ... We've talked about Dallas as a
possibility with the new arena opening, but there is a lot of
variables there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The arena, which the Stars and Mavericks will begin playing in
for the 2001-02 season, needs to guarantee the ice would be ready.
Even if the arena is ready, the Stars haven't settled on Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Ken Hitchcock likes the effect that getting away has on
his team.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, ``we can tell players, `Well, stick together.' But if
you've got 30 different cars and people that live a long ways away,
they're not going to stick together,'' Hitchcock said. ``This
\Rbeing away\S forces everybody to be on the same page, and forces
everybody to act and behave as a group. At home, it's not \Rabout\S
distractions, it's just that there's no opportunity for chemistry,
because we have to plan it. It's not natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainey said the Stars considered not returning to Vail this
year, but simply ran out of time. The earliest the Stars are likely
to make a decision is December. \Nsubheds:Muller to see action Talk
about taking one for the team. Stars winger Kirk Muller is taking
60 for the team by playing in tonight's exhibition game against the
Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock hadn't planned on playing any of the 10 veterans, who
didn't scrimmage in camp, in the first two exhibition games. But
the NHL has a rule that each team must play at least 10 players who
played at least 30 games the season before. Without the veterans,
the Stars have nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muller is the 10th,'' Hitchcock said. ``We have specific goals
for all of our older players. When we play them is not as important
as how much we play them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars could have more stars in their lineup Saturday for the
exhibition home-opener against the St. Louis Blues, including
goalie Ed Belfour. They want to play him 240 minutes in the
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``However we go about that, I'm not sure yet. Really, it's up to
Eddie,'' Hitchcock said. ``We have an obligation to play a good
squad at home, too.'' \Nsubheds:Donato impressive Not a lot of the
veterans have been scrimmaging in training camp, so it's hard not
to notice the ones who are.
</P>
<P>
   But winger Ted Donato has been really good, Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really showing he's a good pro,'' Hitchcock said. ``He's
got speed. He can arrive on pucks that maybe last year we couldn't
arrive on.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato had a dandy goal Wednesday in a scrimmage, but said the
lack of defense probably helped. He had a wide open path to the
net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure would like one of those in April,'' Donato said. ``I
don't see it happening. I don't think \RColorado defenseman Ray
Bourque\S would bite on that one.'' \Nsubheds:Briefly Ken Hitchcock
said defenseman Darryl Sydor, who has been out with an injured
ankle, ``skated very aggressively'' Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Mark Wotton, who had abdominal surgery in the
off-season, has been skating and is set to join the team Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars will need to make decisions on some of their younger
players soon on whether they'll be joining their junior teams. One
of the youngsters who could stay a little longer is defenseman Dan
Jancevski. If he stays, Hitchcock said he'll play in some games.

TWO WILDFIRES FORCE EVACUATIONS IN L.A. COUNTY

   LOS ANGELES _ Dry brush, scorching heat and gusty winds fueled
two wildfires Wednesday in Castaic and Agua Dulce, north of Los
Angeles, burning three homes and temporarily closing the Golden
State Freeway because of thick smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Using a SuperScooper that arrived just Wednesday and a giant
Helitanker, firefighters fought the first big brush fire of the
season, which consumed 400 acres in Agua Dulce.
</P>
<P>
   The brush fires kicked off what officials predicted will be an
especially hazardous fire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we're alive,'' a teary-eyed Sandy Dawson said as
flames approached her home in Agua Dulce. ``It took us four years
to build this house with our bare hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the region, temperatures soared above 100 as air
conditioners strained the state's power reserves, triggering a
Stage 2 alert. No records were broken but temperatures were
recorded at 105 degrees in Chatsworth and 93 in Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures were expected to remain in the 100s in the San
Fernando Valley but diminish by 5 degrees by week's end, according
to the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Agua Dulce fire broke out about 2 p.m. and burned five
structures, as 20 mph gusts fanned flames fought by 350
firefighters, a Canadian SuperScooper bomber, an Erickson
Helitanker and four smaller choppers.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of rural Agua Dulce gathered their families, grabbed
pets, photographs, keepsakes and fled as flames stormed through
neighborhoods marked by dirt roads and ranch houses.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   North of Castaic, a line of 150 fighters saved the remote
Paradise Ranch mobile home park from a second fire. The fire was
sparked by a burning big rig on the nearby Golden State Freeway
(I-5) that spread to 300 acres of brush and forest.
</P>
<P>
   That fire forced the closure of the busy interstate highway at
Lake Hughes Road, backing up traffic about three miles. Two lanes
had reopened by 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the Wednesday fires, Los Angeles officials stood on
a sizzling runway at Van Nuys airport to celebrate the arrival and
demonstration of their latest firefighting aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The mammoth planes -- two CL-415 amphibious SuperScoopers and
two Erickson Aircrane Helitanker choppers -- were leased ahead of
schedule by city and county fire departments during the country's
worst fire season in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles fire season, which starts in June and normally
heats up next month when dusty Santa Anas blow offshore, extends
through February. Fire hazard conditions are high, according to Los
Angeles County fire inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aircraft are a very critical part of the arsenal for
firefighting in the region,'' said County Supervisor Zev
Yaroslovsky. ``There may be no place in the world like Los
Angeles'' -- with millions of residents surrounded by acres of
mountainous brush.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the planes renews debate over whether
firefighting agencies should lease or buy firefighting aircraft and
who should pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   For its fifth year, the Los Angeles County Fire Department
leased two SuperScoopers -- including pilots and crew -- from the
Province of Quebec for $1.5 million for 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a new one: $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-foot turbo-props can drop 1,600 gallons of foam or water
in one sweep, but have trouble navigating narrow canyons, fire
official say. The Helitankers, on the other hand, hold 2,500
gallons of water and can drop their loads into any crevasse.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles city and county fire departments each leased one
Erickson Aircrane for $900,000 for 90 days. Cost new: $15.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   The city, which leased the aircraft for the first time this
season, is studying whether to buy either the 88-foot-long
helicopter. The request was made by Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski.
</P>
<P>
   She and other officials will meet with Assemblywoman Sheila
Kuehl, D-Encino, in three weeks to discuss state funding for a
firefighting plane shared by many Southern California cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the state should pick up (the tab), because this
would be a regional solution for Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, San
Diego and some inland counties,'' said Richard Popper, deputy for
budget and finance for the Yaroslovsky's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a year-round solution for Southern California.''

EARLY PAIN TURNS INTO LATE GAIN

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels' biggest worry early on
Wednesday night was whether Mo Vaughn might step on the celebrated
Rally Monkey and crush it.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was having that kind of game in the field, playing first
base as if it were on a skateboard. Or maybe he was.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Vaughn got back his footing just fine, the Rally Monkey
turned up OK, and the Angels avoided the embarrassment of losing to
the American League's poorest outfit, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
Anaheim wiped out a four-run deficit and won 8-4 before an Edison
Field crowd of 16,686.
</P>
<P>
   Red-hot rookie Adam Kennedy slammed a three-run homer, the
highlight of a five-run uprising in the fifth inning. And the top
of the Angels' order _ namely, Darin Erstad, Orlando Palmeiro,
Vaughn, Tim Salmon, Garret Anderson and Troy Glaus _ which,
combined, had hit just .222 (16 for 72) the first five games of the
homestand, came to life. The group kknocked in three of the runs,
including the tying and go-ahead runs.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Ortiz survived the Angels' stumbling start to pitch into
the seventh inning, strike out six and come away with his second
consecutive win to improve to 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Angels' sixth win in their last eight games, the sort
of pace they're going to have to maintain if they sincerely have
designs of heating up the race in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of major roadblocks, however.
</P>
<P>
   One, the Angels now head out on a four-city, 13-game trip, their
longest of the season. Not good. They're 29-39 away from Edison
Field, the poorest road record by far of any of the half-dozen AL
wild-card contenders.
</P>
<P>
   And, two, the Devil Rays' next six games are against Oakland and
Seattle, the two teams the Angels are trying to overtake in the AL
West.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay, mind you, has been outscored 60-22 on its
just-completed 10-game trip and is hitting under .200 for the
month.
</P>
<P>
   None of which seems to shake manager Mike Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said, it's not where you're playing or who you're
playing that's important,'' Scioscia said. ``It's how you're
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia was probably choking on his own words the way the
Angels stuttered through the first couple of innings Wednesday
night. Vaughn in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Twice he missed tagging the bag. Another time he threw late to
the plate when all he had to do was tag the runner at first. He
also threw a ball away at third. The game wasn't 30 minutes old
when Vaughn had two errors and a strikeout. And Tampa Bay had a 4-0
lead against Ortiz, due in part to Fred McGriff's thunderous homer,
his 23rd, in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the Angels' ``attack'' the first four innings against
Cory Lidle consisted of a bunt single by Kennedy and a
strikeout-wild pitch that enabled Glaus to reach first. Then,
suddenly, in the fifth inning, the Angels got serious.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus walked, Bengie Molina singled and Kennedy slammed his
ninth home run into the right-center seats. It was his fourth
consecutive hit over two games and he has six RBI in those four
at-bats. It also earned Kennedy uncommon respect for a rookie
second baseman: His next time up the Devil Rays intentionally
walked him.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing: It quickly got the Angels close, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Benji Gil and Erstad followed with successive doubles, and the
Angels were even 4-4. And when Palmeiro bounced a single to center
to score Erstad, the Angels had the lead 5-4 and Lidle was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were at it again in the sixth, with Gil and Erstad
driving in runs and the Devil Rays helping out with an error by
right fielder Steve Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, with two RBI, now has 94 for the season, only six shy of
becoming the first player to reach the 100-RBI plateau from the
leadoff position.

RUNNING, RELIEF COST DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by YTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson was
criticized by management for not bunting more, not manufacturing
enough runs.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the debacle on the basepaths in the eighth inning
of an eventual 3-2 Dodgers loss when Arizona scored with two outs
in the bottom of the ninth, many questions about Johnson's policy
on bunting were easily answered.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers pulled to within 2-1 on Adrian Beltre's solo homer
to start the eighth inning. Then, with Hiram Bocachica at first and
Paul LoDuca at third with one out, Tom Goodwin was asked to safety
squeeze. He read the sign as a suicide squeeze and just laid the
bat on the ball, bunting directly to Diamondbacks third baseman
Matt Williams.
</P>
<P>
   That's not enough for the fundamentally challenged Dodgers.
LoDuca broke from third and headed toward the plate. Williams threw
home and LoDuca got caught in a run down before being tagged out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a safety squeeze, but unfortunately (Goodwin) thought
it was a straight squeeze,'' Johnson said. ``And it's OK if he goes
that way (with the bunt), but LoDuca's got to trail the third
baseman on it. It wasn't a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Dodgers (75-71) back into fourth place in
the National League West by a half-game behind Colorado, which
opens a four-game series today in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to do something different and shake things up, but it
doesn't matter what we do, it always seems wrong,'' Dodgers second
baseman Mark Grudzielanek said. ``We try to generate something and
then something else happens.''
</P>
<P>
   That mishap became more significant in the ninth inning when
Beltre singled in Shawn Green with two outs to tie the game 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   But, on a night when the defense was strong, starting pitcher
Kevin Brown threw well and Beltre came through with a clutch hit,
it was just time to move down on the checklist of negative
happenings until the Dodgers found something to mark off.
</P>
<P>
   The baserunning was one check mark, and the failure of the
bullpen was another.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Terry Adams allowed a pair of singles to start the
ninth and not even a double play could get him out of trouble. He
walked Craig Counsell with two outs and Jason Conti on third.
Pinch-hitter Rob Ryan, who spent the season between the minors and
Arizona, singled through the middle on the first pitch from Adams
to give the Diamondbacks the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We caught a break and got a double play, and that's huge, and
then with two outs we walk a guy and the pinch-hitter gets it,''
Grudzielanek said. ``The kids are going up there with an idea of
getting something over the plate and looking to drive the ball, so
they're swinging early, especially the young guys.''

GATOR WRESTLING: NO EXPERIENCE NEEDED 

</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bored with your job? Career going nowhere? Envious of people
with missing digits? Perhaps you should consider becoming an
alligator wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminole Indians are looking for a few good men or women
willing to jump into a swimming pool and wrestle a 7-foot alligator
for the amusement of paying customers. Pay is $12 an hour, plus
health and life insurance. No experience is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The logical question to ask at this point is: What happened to
the previous alligator wrestlers? Did they retire? Were they eaten?
Did they move on to more lucrative careers in e-commerce?
</P>
<P>
   The correct answer is C, according to tribe spokesman Chuck
Malkus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, Seminoles have done this,'' Malkus told the
Associated Press. ``The reason why we have job openings is because
tribe members are now going into banking, communications,
e-commerce and law school. We have a shortage of candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   (Let us pause at this point for a moment and say a silent prayer
for a world populated by lawyers with backgrounds in alligator
wrestling Thank you.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrestling'' is probably not the best word to use in describing
this particular type of alligator/human encounter. There are no
flying drop-kicks, pile-drivers or forearm shivers and a folding
chair almost never figures in the outcome of the contest. The goal
is to simply (or not so simply) drag the gator out of the pool, sit
on its back and pry open its mouth. Those of you with teenagers may
have some familiarity with this procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The next logical question to ask is: Why? I have been in the
(too) near vicinity of alligators on many occasions and not once
did I get the urge to drag it by its tail, sit on its back or pry
open its jaws with my hands. One does not need to be a student of
reptile psychology to suspect that an alligator may not enjoy being
treated in this manner and might even attempt to show its
displeasure by biting off a finger, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Seminole Indian Chief James Billie lost a finger
while wrestling an alligator in front of about 100 tourists in the
Everglades. Billie started wrestling alligators at age 5 but hadn't
tussled with one for the past 10 years. The lesson here,
apparently, is that alligator wrestling is not something you pick
up, put down and pick up again like golf or bridge. Whether the
alligator's skills grow rusty with disuse is a question the
literature has thus far failed to address. My guess is that they do
not.
</P>
<P>
   I'm pretty sure I'm right when I say the reason the Seminoles
are having so much trouble finding and keeping alligator wrestlers
is not the irresistible lure of banking and e-commerce but rather
the very real possibility that the wrestler will find himself
suddenly and violently disengaged from one or more body parts.
</P>
<P>
   Looking outside the reservation for people stupid enough to do
this is not the solution. (Though sufficient quantities of stupid
people will certainly be found.) The solution is to ditch alligator
wrestling altogether and replace it with something safer like
alligator debating, alligator admiring or, safest of all, alligator
dreaming. There is no reason to think an alligator would object to
any of these exercises, though in the case of the debate it would
probably be wise to steer clear of topics having to do with
trapping or skinning or things that taste like chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Whether 100 tourists will come to the Everglades to watch
someone dream of alligators, I do not know. It would probably
depend on how vivid the dream was. Either way, having a casino
nearby probably wouldn't be a bad idea.

 &HT;    DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE COLUMN
 &HT;    Aunt Bert's shanty house was a haven when dad went to war
 &HT;    (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
 &HT;    By Patricia Spork
 &HT;    c. 2000 Special to Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When my father went to Vietnam in the '60s for his first tour of
duty, I was only 9 years old. Even at such a young age, I knew the
possible consequence.
</P>
<P>
   Tears and prayer took up many of my waking hours, and it was one
of the worst years of my childhood.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also one of my fondest because of the weekends my
mother, younger brother and I spent at my Aunt Bert's house in
Three Creeks, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Her home was no grand affair. Its peeling paint gave it the look
of a rustic barn. You might even call it a shanty.
</P>
<P>
   Dilapidated front steps leading to a large porch and a torn
screen door greeted us, along with Aunt Bert and my five cousins.
</P>
<P>
   There was no running water. You took a bath in a metal wash tub
with water that had been hauled from the well and heated on the
stove.
</P>
<P>
   A small wooden outhouse sufficed for toilet needs. We considered
ourselves extremely lucky if there was store-bought toilet tissue
in place of the usual pages of newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper had other uses. Crunched tight, it packed many holes
in the walls of that old farm house, helping to keep out red wasps
during summer and keep in the heat during winter.
</P>
<P>
   A stone fireplace in the living room was the only source of
heat. The warmth never ventured from that one room.
</P>
<P>
   Two double beds in my cousins' bedroom slept six of us kids --
three girls in one bed and three boys in another. Homemade quilts
and shared body heat kept us from freezing.
</P>
<P>
   But the house was wonderful in its own special way. Sitting deep
in the country and surrounded by hay fields and dense wood, it was
a child's paradise.
</P>
<P>
   We spent our days trekking across pastures dotted with cow pies,
navigating creek beds, swinging from ropes hung in trees, sliding
down a barn's tin roof onto hay piles and playing hide-'n'-seek
</P>
<P>
   in skeleton cars junked in the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   Night brought the sing-alongs. My mother and aunt played guitar
and sang gospel tunes such as ``I'll Fly Away'' and honky-tonk hits
like ``Rattlesnakin' Daddy.'' When we ran out of songs, we would
invent new lyrics for the old ones. Christmas carols were sung year
round.
</P>
<P>
   Food only entered our minds when our stomachs started growling.
</P>
<P>
   When we came to visit, mom always brought an ice chest filled
with lunch meat and soda pop.
</P>
<P>
   If we were fortunate, my uncle might have shot down enough
copper wire from electric lines to sell for scrap _ something we
kids were not supposed to know about _ and treat us all to a smoked
turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Thoughts of sliced turkey fried in butter still make my mouth
water.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all I remember the laughter and glee that filled
that old shanty at each visit.
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Bert's house, poor though it was, became my salvation
during my father's absence. I'll always be thankful for the time we
spent there.

Castellanos finally couldn't forswear pride of craft. The word was
slipped in, he suggested, to emphasize the word ``bureaucrats'' in
the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has repeatedly denied being party to any ``subliminable''
advertising. (This campaign must be a daily embarrassment to Yale.)
Which raises an interesting existential question. Can a candidate
be subliminal when it isn't entirely clear that he's even liminal?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Going Hollywood . . .
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole ran against Hollywood four years ago as the Republican
presidential candidate, denouncing wanton movies. The hustle got
him elected poster boy for Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood, understand, no longer means just Hollywood. The word
has become political shorthand for any popular entertainment a
politician dislikes. For Republicans, that usually means a
suspicion that someone, somewhere, is making whoopee in a way not
officially sanctioned by the party. Democrats usually don't much
mind the sex stuff (see: Clinton, Bill) but are shocked, shocked at
the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Like lions on a gimpy gazelle, Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman have
pounced on a Federal Trade Commission report exposing the
entertainment industry's practice of pitching adult movies, CDs and
video games to teens who are supposedly barred from them by the
industry's own code.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says that if the industry doesn't stop that, he, as
president, will sic the FTC on them with a legal strong arm, a
terrible idea. The industry should live up to its own rules, but
all it would have to do to dodge any federal policing is scrap the
standards, which are voluntary, and the government would have no
constitutional authority to enact its own. And then where would we
be?
</P>
<P>
   We've been told for years by the hell-in-a-handbasket crowd that
Hollywood _ personified by fellow-traveling Clinton _ is leading
the nation and especially its youth to ruin.
</P>
<P>
   How so? Teen pregnancy rates have fallen through the mid-and
late '90s and by last year the teen birth rate was at a 60-year
low, down 20 percent from '91. Teen drug use dropped 21 percent
over the last two years. Major crime rates are at historic lows and
last year's National Crime Victimization survey recorded the
biggest drop in its 25-year history. The lowest abortion rate since
1978 was logged three years ago, the latest figure. Divorce rates
over the last five years are down from 5 in 10 to 4, a 20 percent
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, there's something to be said for virtue, at least in
moderation. (As there is for vice. Without it, virtue wouldn't even
have a name.) But maybe it's time to rethink the glib
cause-and-effect game politicians of both parties play.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1996, a friend ran across Madeleine Albright at
the Democratic National Convention as she strolled down Chicago's
Miracle Mile with her security guards in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear you've got a good shot at being secretary of state,''
the friend said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright pressed a finger to her lips. ``Don't talk about it,''
she pleaded. ``It could screw things up.''
</P>
<P>
   That encounter came to mind at a recent dinner party attended by
Richard Holbrooke, Albright's successor as U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations and a leading candidate to succeed her as secretary
should Al Gore move into the White House next year.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Helms, the crusty Republican chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, kept Holbrooke's nomination dangling
for two years. But in the 13 months since Holbrooke moved to New
York, he has zealously courted Helms, initiating frequent visits
and phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   These friendly dealings with Helms are part of a pattern:
Holbrooke treasures a warm letter from Richard Nixon, which Nixon
wrote a few weeks before his death, while Holbrooke was the U.S.
envoy to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Holbrooke pumps plenty of private advice the vice
president's way. In 1996, Gore strongly favored Holbrooke for the
top job at State. But Hillary Clinton believed that Albright, her
fellow Wellesley alumna and globe-trotting companion, should get
the nod.
</P>
<P>
   Among insiders, Holbrooke is known for the brilliance of his
ideas, for his prodigious work habits (he molded the Dayton peace
accords on Bosnia) and for the prickliness of his personality. Ever
since he was a junior staff officer in Vietnam, Holbrooke has also
assiduously courted the press.
</P>
<P>
   Several ideas about all this surfaced at the dinner party, which
marked a face-lift for Foreign Policy magazine, a journal that
Holbrooke had edited briefly during its infancy some 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   One was that, if tapped for the post, Holbrooke would be a
dominant figure in the foreign policy arena _ quite a different
sort of political animal than, say, Albright and more in the mold
of Henry Kissinger and the late John Foster Dulles.
</P>
<P>
   Another was that Gore, who is well versed in international
issues, would want to run the show himself. That would mean putting
a lesser figure at State, akin to what President John F. Kennedy
did in 1961 when he chose Dean Rusk, a mild-mannered veteran
foreign service officer from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Among the invited no-shows at the party were Albright (who was
in New York) and Leon Fuerth, Gore's national security adviser.
It's widely presumed that Fuerth would advise Gore to keep a tight
hold on the reins, far from Holbrooke's nimble fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it could be argued that George W. Bush would make a
better foreign policy president than would Gore. Since he knows
less about these issues, he would tend to be more cautious, which
is a good thing. Bush would also rely heavily on his secretary of
state-in-waiting, former Gen. Colin Powell.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush should win, Holbrooke would be only too glad to take on
special tasks between his money-making bouts on Wall Street.

 SLURS NOT ENOUGH TO SILENCE PEDRO
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Shortly after 7 tonight, Pedro Martinez will throw
his first pitch to a Cleveland batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' said Martinez, ``nothing will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But the buildup to Martinez's first start at Jacobs Field since
he was suspended for hitting Cleveland's Roberto Alomar April 30
has been electric.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland manager Charlie Manuel disagrees with the common
belief that too much is at stake for the Red Sox and Indians, teams
battling each other for a wild-card berth, for personal feelings to
take over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's more likely something will happen just because the
games are so important,'' said Manuel.
</P>
<P>
   In Martinez's mind, though, no scene could be as electric as
when he headed to the Jacobs Field bullpen in the fourth inning of
the fifth and deciding game of the American League playoff series
against the Indians last October. Wednesday, Martinez carefully
described what happened then; the media listened and wrote his
words down in near disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect whatever (tonight),'' Martinez began. ``I remember
being told when I was warming up in the bullpen for the playoff
game that I was going to get shot if I got to the mound. That came
from fans who probably wanted me to just get out of there or go
panic.''
</P>
<P>
   These were new words. Martinez said he had never reported the
death threat, either to the Sox or Major League Baseball. Kevin
Shea, the Sox director of communications, said, ``This is the first
we've heard of it and it's very disconcerting.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea said the Sox will promptly bring Martinez's report of the
threat to MLB security.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez went on. The Indians have never beaten him, and
last October, sore shoulder and all, death threat or no death
threat, Martinez took the mound and pitched six innings of hitless
ball, sending the Indians home for the winter. It was an amazing
performance, even more amazing considering what Martinez said
Wednesday of that night's events.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The fans) said so many discriminating stuff to me that it
sound unreal,'' Martinez went on. ``They call me `Beaner,' they
say, `Go back to your country' and `You don't belong in America.'
All the things that you have to hear from fans. It was the first
time I had ever heard those things, and I heard them here in
Cleveland. But I understand also that it was a playoff game, and a
lot of people (were) upset because of the success that I had
against this team. They saw their chances were more limited if I
came in.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Martinez would go out of his way to say this incident
happened in Cleveland, but he did not want to indict the city of
Cleveland. The heart and soul of the Indians, after all, is made up
of Latin players, from pitcher Bartolo Colon to slugger Manny
Ramirez and infielders Roberto Alomar and Omar Vizquel, some of
whom are his friends and all of whom, said Martinez, tell him how
well they are treated in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   And the threat? Perhaps Martinez had taken it too literally, the
Sox pitcher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been about baseball, you know, `Shot by the
Cleveland Indians,' '' said Martinez. ``It could have been. Cumby
(Sox bullpen coach John Cumberland) was more upset than I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Very true, said Cumberland, who said he heard the slurs but did
not hear a death threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't upset by it. It bothered me more than it bothered
him,'' Cumberland said. ``It started right away once he started
warming up. That was a big game, and they'll do anything to try and
get the opposing pitcher, no matter if it's Pedro or whoever. But
the things that were said were uncalled for. It was personal and it
was racial.''
</P>
<P>
   Cumberland said he was so upset at the small group of fans,
``and especially one guy who was doing most of the shouting,'' that
he did what he shouldn't have done _ shout back at the fans. But,
Cumberland wanted to point out, ``That's not the only city where
you hear this stuff in the bullpen. No matter where you go, New
York and even in the Boston bullpen,'' fans can be vile toward
opposing pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the racial words, Martinez replied, once again,
``They call me `Beaner.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez is Martinez, intelligent and able to weigh all the
emotions that were rampant in Jacobs Field that night 11 months
ago. It was the deciding game of the playoff series, and the
Cleveland fans were fretful and fearful their Indians might give up
a playoff series they once had led, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't take it personal. It was a playoff game and it meant
a lot to the fans,'' said Martinez. ``I don't know . . . I guess
people forgot about just being fans. They took it personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he hurt by what he heard? ``No . . . no . . . no . . . I
know I don't belong in America,'' said Martinez. ``I'm from Latin
America . . . but that's OK. Like I said, they probably said those
things because they knew I could probably beat the Cleveland
Indians. And they were fans. They were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never do I care what the crowd does _ not here, not in Fenway,
not in Yankee Stadium, nowhere. Fans are out there to have fun and
watch what happens. I am inside the field. And I don't care what
they do and I don't care how they feel, and I just care about my
game and give the fans what they deserve: a good game of
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez will take the mound tonight with his reputation set
for his baseball life, he conceded. He's a ``headhunter,'' known to
one and all for throwing inside. But the player he hit, Roberto
Alomar, bears him no grudges, said Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Since that incident, for which Martinez was suspended five games
after throwing close to catcher Einar Diaz and hitting Alomar,
Martinez said his and Alomar's paths have crossed twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Robby at the All-Star Game and we talked like always,''
said Martinez. ``He said it was the right thing to do (hitting him)
when I did it and I did it right. He told me that personally, in
front of some other guys. Then (Tuesday at Jacobs Field), I was in
the weight room and he came over as he always does, and he asked
how I was doing and talked to me for five or six minutes. We hugged
each other, we talked . . . just like always. Robby understands
what I did. There was nothing wrong doing it the way I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   But all the frustrations of Cleveland, all the memories of what
Martinez has done to the Indians _ the win in the fifth game of the
playoffs, the hitting of Alomar, the 3-0 shutout by Martinez of the
Indians at Fenway Park back on June 8 _ all will mesh tonight. The
Indians shouldn't be frustrated, said Martinez. They should take
his approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was them, I would be antsy to go out there again against
me,'' said Martinez. ``And again and again and again until I get my
goal. Those guys are some of the best guys in the game, and those
guys know that sometime they can get just lucky and score 20
runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky?
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleveland knows if I'm on, then I don't need to hit anybody to
beat them,'' were the next straight-forward but fiery words from
Martinez's lips. ``And I know if they're on, they don't need to do
any type of cheating to beat me, because they're that good. But I'm
going to pitch inside, I'm going to pitch away, I'm going to pitch
up, I'm going to pitch down, I'm going to pitch everywhere I have
to pitch to beat somebody. And It's not just against the Cleveland
Indians, it's against the league. I've done it my whole career.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite clearly in Martinez's mind, neither opposing batters,
opposing managers, nor even baseball disciplinarian Frank Robinson
can do anything to change his aggressive style of pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't want me to pitch inside,'' said Martinez with
determination, ``if they don't want me to pitch my game the way I
do, then they'll have to kick me out of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   So you're not changing your style, Martinez was asked, no matter
what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I? Would you if you had the results I'm getting?''
answered Martinez. ``If you were the manager of any other team, and
you had me on your team, would you change me? Would you allow me to
change? Then it's obvious. The answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially after Martinez's disclosures Wednesday. Even though
he said he heard a death threat, even though he said he heard
racial slurs for the first time, Martinez still came out of that
bullpen and pitched hitless ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anybody like him,'' said Cumberland. ``He's on
a mission when he takes the mound.''

   Actually, what she said was that she wished I'd stop acting like
I was in high school. Indeed, a person older and wiser than I
observed once that the way we act in high school is the way we'll
act through life. So those guys you thought were jerks in high
school are most likely jerks now and will be forever. Same applies
for those who were nice in high school. Nice then; nice forever.
Living right here in the town where I was born and reared, I see a
lot of folks I knew in school. The theory is amazingly accurate.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, I feel the same inside as I did when I was
18. Too bad that teen-ager's soul is trapped in a body that's 100
pounds heavier, more wrinkled and a lot grayer.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, I have my children to keep me young.
</P>
<P>
   While most of my friends are dealing with the empty nest
syndrome, at my house we have a new hatchling. Our young son is 10
months old and yes, thank you very much, I've already done the
math. When he graduates from high school, I'll be ready to draw
Social Security. My concern is that I don't want him to grow up
with an ``old'' dad, because that's what happened to me. My dad was
40 years old when I was born and I spent most of my growing up
years thinking he was so old fashioned and out of date. How little
I knew.
</P>
<P>
   God has a funny way of teaching us lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Here I am, older than my dad was when I was born, bringing a son
into the world. I wouldn't change a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Taking care of this baby has been one of the greatest joys in my
life. I am both amazed and fascinated by every gurgle and coo. It's
enough to keep me young for years.
</P>
<P>
   But reality has a way of rearing its head.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:30 on a Monday morning, the baby woke up and decided he
wanted a bottle right then. His crib is in our bedroom and so his
routine is to clutch the siderailing of the bed, jump up and down
and bawl. Being the lighter sleeper, I normally get up, get his
bottle and put him back down.
</P>
<P>
   This morning I decided to see if he would quiet down by himself,
but after a few bellows, my wife got up, got his bottle and soothed
him. When she came back to bed, she put her hand on my back for a
moment and then poked me good with her finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``What'd you do that for?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just wanted to make sure sure you weren't dead,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Happy birthday to me.

 &HT;    Want to talk campaign issues? It'll take more than 30 seconds
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Rats.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few days ago the presidential campaign had been almost
miraculously issues-based. This week it is officially off-base.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the ``issue'' was subliminal rodents. Last week it was a
caught-on-tape vulgarity. And more and more we hear media
recitation/speculation about 30-second jabs.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, people. Hey, press. You've got some substantial policy
differences here. No need for subliminal analysis (debunked as
hokum by reputable research). Just listen to what the candidates
say. Then discuss among yourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Take education, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Many people rate it the No. 1 issue. That's an odd ranking,
because Washington's role is small. Federal funds amount to only 6
percent of the total spent on public schools.
</P>
<P>
   However, in this presidential race a federal role is not seen as
small by either major candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore wants to spend an additional $115 billion on education,
including initiatives aimed at universal access to preschool, more
classroom teachers and higher teacher pay.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush wants to spend $45 billion, including new
after-school programs and education savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   VOUCHERS AS LEVERS
</P>
<P>
   Pricetags aside, it could be argued that Bush's proposal would
entail a greater federal role in public schools than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that case was made by two former state school board
members, Republicans themselves, during the GOP primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush promotes local control of decision-making. However, his
proposal to punish low-performing schools by awarding their Title I
money to families as school vouchers portends to affect how every
school district behaves. Obvious questions: How to judge who's
low-performing? A national test? A standard chosen by each state?
If so, how to make state standards comparable?
</P>
<P>
   The choice between Gore and Bush is several national referenda
in one: on abortion rights; on campaign finance reform; on
across-the-board tax cuts. But as much as any issue, it is a
national referendum on school vouchers. What say, America?
</P>
<P>
   Without question, even though rank-in-file Republicans appear to
support vouchers, Bush's proposed federal activism on education
veers from the party line.
</P>
<P>
   Bush prevailed to remove from the national GOP platform a plank
to abolish the Department of Education. Support for that
abolishment, and for a federal hands-off policy on public schools,
has been the party mantra since Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans now find a federal role in schools alluring
if it means realizing such goals as vouchers or sexual abstinence
programs.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESSIONAL RACE
</P>
<P>
   In the race for the District 11 seat in Congress, we have a more
traditional distinction on education. Republican challenger Ramsey
Farley, a former Temple school trustee, said he wants federal aid
to have few or no strings attached. He favors block grants over
targeted programs aimed at specific purposes such as hiring new
teachers. He wants school districts to determine how the money is
spent.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbent Chet Edwards calls that a ``blank check'' approach.
``There has to be accountability'' when public schools receive
federal funds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards supports Title 1, grants targeted at low-achieving
students and weighted heavily toward inner-city schools. He also
supported the Clinton spending initiative to help school districts
hire more classroom teachers. The GOP wants that money parceled
into no-strings block grants.
</P>
<P>
   You see? There are real issues related to real problems. Just
listen to what the candidates say.

 &HT;    The man with the answersBy Elizabeth Barchas
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If you ask Jack Myers a question, you'll likely
be met with silence. As senior science editor at Highlights for
Children magazine, his job is to answer queries, but he never
purports to know all the answers. Instead, he pauses. Mentally
chews on words, thoughts, ideas. Thinks about what to say, how to
say it, why it's so. And then, just as you think he didn't hear
you, or perhaps doesn't know, he delivers an answer.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it's been for 40 years, when Myers first began
responding to children's science questions in the magazine his
parents, Garry and Caroline Myers, founded. At the time, Myers was
a professor of zoology and botany at the University of Texas with
no experience catering to the under-12 audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pop was of a mind that, `You can do this. You're a
scientist aren't you?' '' Myers said. ``I have to admit that my
first attempts were pretty lousy.''
</P>
<P>
   Years of experience addressing everything from how cats purr to
why snakes flick their tongues honed Myers' skill in writing for
children and taught him some tricks along the way. He uses
analogies to help readers understand a difficult science topic
through something they're already familiar with, and his vocabulary
is a finely tuned kid-friendly without being condescending. When he
talks about an upcoming Highlights article on why there are no
giant insects, for example, Myers becomes especially animated.
``The answer is that an insect doesn't have a very good breathing
mechanism,'' he said. ``It works OK for the little guys, but it
won't work for the big guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Replying to children occupied much of Myers' time, but he also
managed to pursue some questions of his own. A renowned expert on
photosynthesis, Myers developed a method of studying algae in a
closed environment that is now used at labs across the world. He
was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1975, and
continues to stay abreast of new advancements by reading several
journals in his office at UT. It was only last year that he finally
gave up his research lab at the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had things in it that I built and made myself and used for
50 years, so that's kind of hard to walk away from,'' he said.
``But it's also true that a university can't provide laboratories
for old guys to play around, so when I wasn't really learning
anything new, it was time for me to fold up, and that's what I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   But Myers keeps busy addressing the dozen or so science
questions that come to Highlights each month, and he recently
published his seventh book of short essays about animals, ``What
Happened to the Mammoths?'' (Boyds Mill Press, $17.95). ``Kids deal
in pure curiosity,'' Myers said. ``I know that if you want to grab
them, talk about big, furry animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers responds to every question sent his way and digs into his
memory trove of scientific knowledge and his collection of
textbooks and journals to find the answers. If an explanation is
especially elusive, he'll turn to scientist friends for help,
including Norman Hackerman, who worked with Myers at UT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get together over coffee and talk about all kinds of
things,'' Hackerman said. ``Science, world affairs, the heat, where
are you going to park on campus and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at age 87, Myers has no plans to stop writing for the
magazine. He works closely with Andy Boyles, the Highlights science
editor, in approving essay contributions and editing stories, and
he's involved in all major decision with the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past 40 or 50 years Jack has shaped the way we do
science at Highlights,'' Boyles said. ``If we're ever going to take
a new direction and try something different, we touch base and see
what he thinks about it.'' Boyles said Myers is the most highly
respected member of the company, especially as he continues to
remain so active. ``I know it's hard for me to keep up with him,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Myers has been tackling kids' questions long enough to notice
trends, and while technology and new research continually alter the
fluid scientific world, he says the things that interest children
have remained fairly constant. The most frequent question he
receives is: ``When I take a warm bath, why do my hands crinkle
up?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are still taking baths like they did before,'' Myers
said. ``I don't think much has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   WHOLESOME FUN
</P>
<P>
   This could be a theme for the entire Highlights magazine
business. The family-owned corporation has managed to satisfy
generations of children with the same ``wholesome fun'' it used
from the very beginning, like twins Goofus and Gallant who teach
proper manners and Hidden Pictures that require concentration.
</P>
<P>
   The family element has always been important to Highlights,
based in Honesdale, Pa., and Columbus, Ohio. When Garry Myers, a
child psychologist who had written a syndicated newspaper column
about parenting, and Caroline Clark Myers, who had been involved in
family welfare causes, announced they were going to start their own
magazine, their children were ready to help where necessary. They
printed an initial batch of 20,000 copies of Highlights in 1946,
trying to captivate children _ and their parents _ by relying on
fun games and stories with a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling magazine was suffering business-wise in 1954, so
Myers' brother, Garry Jr., moved his family to Ohio to help save
Highlights. ``It was the gutsy thing that an engineer would do,''
Myers said. ``You know, engineers figure there isn't any problem
they can't handle.'' In just a few years, Highlights was a
self-supporting entity, and now there are more than 2 million
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the business became a full-fledged success, Garry Jr.
and his wife died when a United Airlines flight collided with
another plane over New York in 1960, leaving their five children
orphaned and the family devastated. With four daughters of their
own, Myers and his wife, Evelyn, welcomed the nephews and nieces,
ranging from ages 8 to 15, into their already full home. ``People
always tell you what a wonderful thing that was to do, but the
facts of life are you just do it because it was something you
needed to do,'' Myers said. ``Every family has its own culture and
putting them together was pretty hard, but we all worked at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong family foundation and common dedication to Highlights
helped keep the Myers clan on track. ``It was a traumatic time in
our lives, but he gave us lots of attention and he was a very good
father figure,'' said Fred Myers, a nephew who was 8 when he came
to live with the family. ``There's a sense of mission about the
magazine in the family and it keeps us all involved.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the current editor of Highlights is Myers' nephew, and
many family members serve on the board of directors. Every year,
they gather in Pennsylvania for a family council meeting to discuss
the magazine. As the oldest living member of the family, Myers'
opinion is highly valued. ``He's definitely the man that everyone
looks up to for advice in the company,'' said Myers' granddaughter
Carrie Holland. ``Whenever I have a question about something he's
the first person I would think to ask because he has such a great
knowledge about things.''
</P>
<P>
   UNCLE JACK
</P>
<P>
   Even nonfamily members in the company regard Myers fondly,
calling him Uncle Jack around the office. ``The editorial staff
here has great respect for Jack as a scientist and an editor and a
writer who speaks to kids in a very honest, forthright way, and we
also have great affection for him,'' said Chris Clark, managing
editor of Highlights. ``He is just a wonderful man, and you always
have the sense that he is going to be very fair with you, even if
it means telling you your judgment's flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   While Myers' research and accomplishments earn respect from
family and friends, what really stands out about him, they say, is
his sense of humor. After raising four daughters he has plenty of
jokes about being outnumbered in a house full of women _ ``It
doesn't take them long to convince you that you have to put the
toilet seat down,'' he said _ and his deep belly laugh completely
envelops listeners. ``Daddy starts every single day with the funny
papers,'' said Myers' oldest daughter, Shirley Wendlandt. ``That's
the first thing he reads, before the news or anything else, and he
almost always finds something to really laugh out loud about.''
</P>
<P>
   This genuine joy for life stems from the fact that he's had a
great one, Myers said. He had such a fulfilling career at UT he
says he often can't understand it when he asks older people how
they stay busy and they say they worked all their lives so they
could retire and do nothing. ``I'm very grateful for being so
lucky,'' Myers said. ``I am grateful that I could be part of a
family endeavor, and that I had 60 years with a great lady who was
my wife. I was able to work as a scientist in an era which I think
was the golden age of science. There was always another challenge
because there was always another question.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Myers to stop answering them anytime soon.

 &HT;    Expect adventure, human drama and 162 1/2 hours of details when
Costas takes the anchor's chair at the Olympics
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bob Costas, bright-eyed and bearing tons of useful and
not-so-useful information, will bound kangaroo-like into our living
rooms for a two-week visit beginning tonight.
</P>
<P>
   As anchor of NBC's prime-time telecasts of the Summer Olympics,
Costas will spend 162 1/2 hours on the air, starting with tonight's
4 1/2-hour coverage of the Opening Ceremony in Sydney. This is his
fourth Olympics for NBC and third as prime-time host. It would not
be stretching the truth to say he enjoys these assignments quite a
lot. His first love may be baseball, but the Olympic Games get his
blood pumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the appeal of the Olympics,'' Costas said in a recent
teleconference, ``is that it's an international adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Costas is legendary for his Olympics preparation. In
anticipation of the Atlanta Games, he pored through hundreds of
books, profiles and interviews. He's done the same thing this time,
prepping himself for an event that is equal parts sports
competition, human drama and travelogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The setting is always important,'' Costas said. ``To an
American audience, there's absolutely no intrigue about showing
scenes from Atlanta. But in Barcelona in '92, there was a
travelogue element. . . . It was almost impossible to show an event
in Barcelona without the backdrop looking like a picture
postcard.''
</P>
<P>
   Costas' boss, NBC sports executive producer Dick Ebersol, calls
Sydney ``the best place the Olympics have ever been.'' The natural
beauty of the land Down Under, coupled with the intimacy of the
various venues, make for another potentially ``picture postcard''
setting. Americans are keenly interested in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the No. 1 destination for American tourist travelers,''
said coordinating producer Lisa Lax, ``and we're going to make sure
we show off the country.''
</P>
<P>
   `OUR MANTRA IS STORYTELLING'
</P>
<P>
   The goal of NBC's Olympics coverage, as always, is to connect
viewers, especially those who may not be sports fiends, with
athletes from all over the world. ABC perfected the art with the
``Up Close and Personals'' created by sports producing genius Roone
Arledge and delivered by avuncular host Jim McKay in the 1960s and
'70s, and the tradition has continued ever since from year to year
and network to network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mantra is storytelling, and we do that primarily through
telling these unique, individual stories,'' Lax said.
</P>
<P>
   The profiles are now part of the Olympics experience because
they are such a big part of the TV experience. The theory is that
to know the athletes is to love them, and to love them is to want
to watch them _ whether they're racing around a track, spiking a
volleyball or pressing a few hundred pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be aware that 95 percent of the competitors who
come to an Olympic Games are not aspiring professionals who will
become fabulously wealthy,'' said Costas, 48, and still oozing
boyish charm and enthusiasm. ``This is their be-all and end-all.''
</P>
<P>
   Costas has had a happy, healthy career covering professional
baseball, basketball, football and hockey _ team sports that
function on yearly cycles, often with the same participants
returning from year to year. Famous folks, popular sports. For most
Olympic athletes, the once-in-a-lifetime experience raises the
competition to a heightened level that Costas finds thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of the preparation, the sacrifice and the anticipation
that go into that moment,'' Costas said, nearly breathless at the
prospect. ``And the nature of many events is that they are very
quick _ boom, it's over in 10, 20 seconds. Those moments have such
clarity, and knowing that the world is watching brings everything
to a peak. That's tremendous sports drama.''
</P>
<P>
   And although American viewers may have never heard of athletes
from other countries, sometimes these lesser-knowns have a greater
impact than our home-grown stars such as Michael Johnson and Marion
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``An athlete, such as a runner from Ethiopia, can lift the whole
country's spirit,'' Costas said. ``That's the way it works at the
Olympics, and I find that compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   HOURS AND HOURS OF COVERAGE
</P>
<P>
   NBC's prime-time coverage is being touted by the network as the
``traditional family coverage,'' featuring premiere events such as
track and field, gymnastics, swimming and diving. And lots of
profiles. NBC's cable outlets, MSNBC and CNBC, are targeting more
ardent sports enthusiasts with a total of 279 hours of
wall-to-wall, start-to-finish coverage of team sports and boxing.
And for the total sports fanatic, there's NBCOlympics.com, which
will be laden with statistics and other insider sports stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the Complete Olympics,'' Costas said of the
whopping 441 total hours planned on the Peacock's broadcast, cable
and Internet empire.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the 15- to 18-hour time difference between Australia
and the United States, all of NBC's coverage will be tape-delayed.
The network figured very few viewers would watch the main events at
3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney Games are the first of five Olympics that NBC won the
rights to televise with a bid of $5 billion for the package, $705
million for the 2000 Summer Olympiad. Unless a koala kidnaps him in
Australia, we can probably expect to see Costas at the helm of at
least a couple more.

become fabulously wealthy,'' said Costas, 48, and still oozing
boyish charm and enthusiasm. ``This is their be-all and end-all.''
</P>
<P>
   Costas has had a happy, healthy career covering professional
baseball, basketball, football and hockey _ team sports that
function on yearly cycles, often with the same participants
returning from year to year. Famous folks, popular sports. For most
Olympic athletes, the once-in-a-lifetime experience raises the
competition to a heightened level that Costas finds thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of the preparation, the sacrifice and the anticipation
that go into that moment,'' Costas said, nearly breathless at the
prospect. ``And the nature of many events is that they are very
quick _ boom, it's over in 10, 20 seconds. Those moments have such
clarity, and knowing that the world is watching brings everything
to a peak. That's tremendous sports drama.''
</P>
<P>
   And although American viewers may have never heard of athletes
from other countries, sometimes these lesser-knowns have a greater
impact than our home-grown stars such as Michael Johnson and Marion
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``An athlete, such as a runner from Ethiopia, can lift the whole
country's spirit,'' Costas said. ``That's the way it works at the
Olympics, and I find that compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   HOURS AND HOURS OF COVERAGE
</P>
<P>
   NBC's prime-time coverage is being touted by the network as the
``traditional family coverage,'' featuring premiere events such as
track and field, gymnastics, swimming and diving. And lots of
profiles. NBC's cable outlets, MSNBC and CNBC, are targeting more
ardent sports enthusiasts with a total of 279 hours of
wall-to-wall, start-to-finish coverage of team sports and boxing.
And for the total sports fanatic, there's NBCOlympics.com, which
will be laden with statistics and other insider sports stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the Complete Olympics,'' Costas said of the
whopping 441 total hours planned on the Peacock's broadcast, cable
and Internet empire.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the 15- to 18-hour time difference between Australia
and the United States, all of NBC's coverage will be tape-delayed.
The network figured very few viewers would watch the main events at
3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney Games are the first of five Olympics that NBC won the
rights to televise with a bid of $5 billion for the package, $705
million for the 2000 Summer Olympiad. Unless a koala kidnaps him in
Australia, we can probably expect to see Costas at the helm of at
least a couple more.

 &HT;    It's no honeymoon driving a Hummer
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After 2,600 miles with a Hummer, the ultimate SUV, I'm
not sure it qualifies as the ultimate ``all-terrain'' vehicle.
Interstate highways are simply not its forte. But who was to know?
</P>
<P>
   When the opportunity arose to take the vehicle on an extended
trip to Dubuque, Iowa, and Minneapolis, my husband and I thought,
``Hey, cool!''
</P>
<P>
   We soon learned that living with a Hummer is in many ways like a
man lusting over a gorgeous woman and finding out after he marries
her that she can't cook.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt in military service, for which it was originally
designed, the Hummer is the ultimate vehicle. It can climb any kind
of steep grade, ford river crossings and pull through the mire and
the muck with the best of them. But don't expect it to cruise down
the interstate and keep up with today's rapid traffic pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Hummer's gearing is such that it is really ``happy'' at a
maximum speed of somewhere between 68 and 70 mph. That meant that
we were a roadblock on today's roadways.
</P>
<P>
   It's really frustrating riding along in a $98,000 vehicle and
being blown away by motorhomes and minivans. The ultimate insult
was the minivan pulling a trailer loaded down with household goods
and flapping bedspreads that roared past us. The four kids waving
out the back window only added insult to injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Hummer is also not a good vehicle for conversation. Look
inside one and you will see a large, flat platform between the
seats. While it serves as a wonderful dining table, it really
houses all of the Hummer's sophisticated four-wheel-drive
mechanism. Combined with the 6.2-liter diesel engine, it creates
quite a noise.
</P>
<P>
   Add two slightly deaf baby boomers, and you have a couple that
rode 2,600 miles with only an occasional yell over the roar.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, for those couples who might not want to
converse with one another, it is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first tank of fuel, our honeymoon with the
idea of using a Hummer was rapidly fading. But everywhere we went,
people just loved it. You'd pull into a fuel station to find a
chorus line of curious gapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much does it cost?'' ``Is it amphibious?'' ``Man, that is
sooo cool!'' ``Can I look inside?'' ``Can I sit in it?'' ``I don't
suppose there is any chance you'd take me for a ride?''
</P>
<P>
   It was an endless barrage of questions. One 14-year-old was so
bold as to ask, ``How about letting me drive it around the parking
lot. I'd be really careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   When the deliveryman dropped off the Hummer at our house, he
said, ``You won't meet yourself coming in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. We didn't see just one other Hummer, in a place
appropriately named Soldiers Grove, Wis., we met a convoy of 44
military Hummers. We did have better paint _ theirs ranged from
conventional camouflage to the Desert Storm variety.
</P>
<P>
   People _ especially guys and kids _ love the look of the Hummer.
We concluded it was because it was a combination of its looks and
because it allows middle-aged men to play GI Joe.
</P>
<P>
   There is an alternative for those who are drawn to playing
either GI Joe or GI Jane but don't want to shell out nearly
$100,000 for an uncomfortable gas-guzzler. General Motors bought
the rights to the name from American General, which builds the
Hummer, to produce a little brother.
</P>
<P>
   GM's H2 will hit the market in 2002 as a 2003 model. For those
of us who don't have the same grit as our fighting men and women in
the armed services, we'll be able to look like it while enjoying
the interior and other amenities one would expect in a well-dressed
Suburban.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ There's something to be said for virtue. But,
given the goings-on along the campaign trail, maybe it's time to
rethink the glib cause-and-effect game politicians of both parties
play. (Tom Teepen is national correspondent for Cox Newspapers).
</P>
<P>
   JOEMURRAY-DREAMSVILLE _ Another in an occasional series of
Dispatches from Dreamsville columns: What Aunt Bert's shanty house
in Three Creeks, Ark., lacked in modern conveniences and upkeep, it
more than made up for in laughter and glee that became my salvation
while my dad was away at war. (Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   ERNESTMURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ I'm about to mark another
birthday. Note I didn't say celebrate. It just doesn't seem right
that I should celebrate something that comes along about as often
as a full moon. And besides, I don't feel (unintelligible) years
old. In fact, my wife told me the other day I reminded her of a
teen-ager. (Ernest Murray is managing editor of The Lufkin Daily
News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   BORDERS-COLUMN _ Cats can keep a yard free of most critters, but
forget about fending off armadillos. (Gary Borders is editor and
publisher of the Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel.) EMBARGOED for Sunday.
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ WACO, Texas _ Rats. Until a few
days ago the presidential campaign had been almost miraculously
issues-based. This week it is officially off-base. Tuesday the
``issue'' was subliminal rodents. Last week it was a caught-on-tape
vulgarity. And more and more we hear media recitation/speculation
about 30-second jabs. (John Young is opinion page editor of the
Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

allowed to donate. The development of improved AIDS tests and a
recent rise in HIV cases among heterosexuals is leading officials
to reconsider the ban. The advisory panel is likely to vote on the

Atlanta and local blood banks.(Staples, Atlanta

pauses. Mentally chews on words, thoughts, ideas. Thinks about what
to say, how to say it, why it's so. And then, just as you think he
didn't hear you, or perhaps doesn't know, he delivers an answer.

 &HT;    The man with the answersBy Elizabeth Barchas
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If you ask Jack Myers a question, you'll likely
be met with silence. As senior science editor at Highlights for
Children magazine, his job is to answer queries, but he never
purports to know all the answers. Instead, he pauses. Mentally
chews on words, thoughts, ideas. Thinks about what to say, how to
say it, why it's so. And then, just as you think he didn't hear
you, or perhaps doesn't know, he delivers an answer.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it's been for 40 years, when Myers first began
responding to children's science questions in the magazine his
parents, Garry and Caroline Myers, founded. At the time, Myers was
a professor of zoology and botany at the University of Texas with
no experience catering to the under-12 audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pop was of a mind that, `You can do this. You're a
scientist aren't you?' '' Myers said. ``I have to admit that my
first attempts were pretty lousy.''
</P>
<P>
   Years of experience addressing everything from how cats purr to
why snakes flick their tongues honed Myers' skill in writing for
children and taught him some tricks along the way. He uses
analogies to help readers understand a difficult science topic
through something they're already familiar with, and his vocabulary
is a finely tuned kid-friendly without being condescending. When he
talks about an upcoming Highlights article on why there are no
giant insects, for example, Myers becomes especially animated.
``The answer is that an insect doesn't have a very good breathing
mechanism,'' he said. ``It works OK for the little guys, but it
won't work for the big guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Replying to children occupied much of Myers' time, but he also
managed to pursue some questions of his own. A renowned expert on
photosynthesis, Myers developed a method of studying algae in a
closed environment that is now used at labs across the world. He
was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1975, and
continues to stay abreast of new advancements by reading several
journals in his office at UT. It was only last year that he finally
gave up his research lab at the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had things in it that I built and made myself and used for
50 years, so that's kind of hard to walk away from,'' he said.
``But it's also true that a university can't provide laboratories
for old guys to play around, so when I wasn't really learning
anything new, it was time for me to fold up, and that's what I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   But Myers keeps busy addressing the dozen or so science
questions that come to Highlights each month, and he recently
published his seventh book of short essays about animals, ``What
Happened to the Mammoths?'' (Boyds Mill Press, $17.95). ``Kids deal
in pure curiosity,'' Myers said. ``I know that if you want to grab
them, talk about big, furry animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers responds to every question sent his way and digs into his
memory trove of scientific knowledge and his collection of
textbooks and journals to find the answers. If an explanation is
especially elusive, he'll turn to scientist friends for help,
including Norman Hackerman, who worked with Myers at UT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get together over coffee and talk about all kinds of
things,'' Hackerman said. ``Science, world affairs, the heat, where
are you going to park on campus and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at age 87, Myers has no plans to stop writing for the
magazine. He works closely with Andy Boyles, the Highlights science
editor, in approving essay contributions and editing stories, and
he's involved in all major decision with the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past 40 or 50 years Jack has shaped the way we do
science at Highlights,'' Boyles said. ``If we're ever going to take
a new direction and try something different, we touch base and see
what he thinks about it.'' Boyles said Myers is the most highly
respected member of the company, especially as he continues to
remain so active. ``I know it's hard for me to keep up with him,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Myers has been tackling kids' questions long enough to notice
trends, and while technology and new research continually alter the
fluid scientific world, he says the things that interest children
have remained fairly constant. The most frequent question he
receives is: ``When I take a warm bath, why do my hands crinkle
up?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are still taking baths like they did before,'' Myers
said. ``I don't think much has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   WHOLESOME FUN
</P>
<P>
   This could be a theme for the entire Highlights magazine
business. The family-owned corporation has managed to satisfy
generations of children with the same ``wholesome fun'' it used
from the very beginning, like twins Goofus and Gallant who teach
proper manners and Hidden Pictures that require concentration.
</P>
<P>
   The family element has always been important to Highlights,
based in Honesdale, Pa., and Columbus, Ohio. When Garry Myers, a
child psychologist who had written a syndicated newspaper column
about parenting, and Caroline Clark Myers, who had been involved in
family welfare causes, announced they were going to start their own
magazine, their children were ready to help where necessary. They
printed an initial batch of 20,000 copies of Highlights in 1946,
trying to captivate children _ and their parents _ by relying on
fun games and stories with a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling magazine was suffering business-wise in 1954, so
Myers' brother, Garry Jr., moved his family to Ohio to help save
Highlights. ``It was the gutsy thing that an engineer would do,''
Myers said. ``You know, engineers figure there isn't any problem
they can't handle.'' In just a few years, Highlights was a
self-supporting entity, and now there are more than 2 million
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the business became a full-fledged success, Garry Jr.
and his wife died when a United Airlines flight collided with
another plane over New York in 1960, leaving their five children
orphaned and the family devastated. With four daughters of their
own, Myers and his wife, Evelyn, welcomed the nephews and nieces,
ranging from ages 8 to 15, into their already full home. ``People
always tell you what a wonderful thing that was to do, but the
facts of life are you just do it because it was something you
needed to do,'' Myers said. ``Every family has its own culture and
putting them together was pretty hard, but we all worked at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong family foundation and common dedication to Highlights
helped keep the Myers clan on track. ``It was a traumatic time in
our lives, but he gave us lots of attention and he was a very good
father figure,'' said Fred Myers, a nephew who was 8 when he came
to live with the family. ``There's a sense of mission about the
magazine in the family and it keeps us all involved.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the current editor of Highlights is Myers' nephew, and
many family members serve on the board of directors. Every year,
they gather in Pennsylvania for a family council meeting to discuss
the magazine. As the oldest living member of the family, Myers'
opinion is highly valued. ``He's definitely the man that everyone
looks up to for advice in the company,'' said Myers' granddaughter
Carrie Holland. ``Whenever I have a question about something he's
the first person I would think to ask because he has such a great
knowledge about things.''
</P>
<P>
   UNCLE JACK
</P>
<P>
   Even nonfamily members in the company regard Myers fondly,
calling him Uncle Jack around the office. ``The editorial staff
here has great respect for Jack as a scientist and an editor and a
writer who speaks to kids in a very honest, forthright way, and we
also have great affection for him,'' said Chris Clark, managing
editor of Highlights. ``He is just a wonderful man, and you always
have the sense that he is going to be very fair with you, even if
it means telling you your judgment's flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   While Myers' research and accomplishments earn respect from
family and friends, what really stands out about him, they say, is
his sense of humor. After raising four daughters he has plenty of
jokes about being outnumbered in a house full of women _ ``It
doesn't take them long to convince you that you have to put the
toilet seat down,'' he said _ and his deep belly laugh completely
envelops listeners. ``Daddy starts every single day with the funny
papers,'' said Myers' oldest daughter, Shirley Wendlandt. ``That's
the first thing he reads, before the news or anything else, and he
almost always finds something to really laugh out loud about.''
</P>
<P>
   This genuine joy for life stems from the fact that he's had a
great one, Myers said. He had such a fulfilling career at UT he
says he often can't understand it when he asks older people how
they stay busy and they say they worked all their lives so they
could retire and do nothing. ``I'm very grateful for being so
lucky,'' Myers said. ``I am grateful that I could be part of a
family endeavor, and that I had 60 years with a great lady who was
my wife. I was able to work as a scientist in an era which I think
was the golden age of science. There was always another challenge
because there was always another question.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Myers to stop answering them anytime soon.

 &HT;    It's no honeymoon driving a Hummer
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After 2,600 miles with a Hummer, the ultimate SUV, I'm
not sure it qualifies as the ultimate ``all-terrain'' vehicle.
Interstate highways are simply not its forte. But who was to know?
</P>
<P>
   When the opportunity arose to take the vehicle on an extended
trip to Dubuque, Iowa, and Minneapolis, my husband and I thought,
``Hey, cool!''
</P>
<P>
   We soon learned that living with a Hummer is in many ways like a
man lusting over a gorgeous woman and finding out after he marries
her that she can't cook.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt in military service, for which it was originally
designed, the Hummer is the ultimate vehicle. It can climb any kind
of steep grade, ford river crossings and pull through the mire and
the muck with the best of them. But don't expect it to cruise down
the interstate and keep up with today's rapid traffic pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Hummer's gearing is such that it is really ``happy'' at a
maximum speed of somewhere between 68 and 70 mph. That meant that
we were a roadblock on today's roadways.
</P>
<P>
   It's really frustrating riding along in a $98,000 vehicle and
being blown away by motorhomes and minivans. The ultimate insult
was the minivan pulling a trailer loaded down with household goods
and flapping bedspreads that roared past us. The four kids waving
out the back window only added insult to injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Hummer is also not a good vehicle for conversation. Look
inside one and you will see a large, flat platform between the
seats. While it serves as a wonderful dining table, it really
houses all of the Hummer's sophisticated four-wheel-drive
mechanism. Combined with the 6.2-liter diesel engine, it creates
quite a noise.
</P>
<P>
   Add two slightly deaf baby boomers, and you have a couple that
rode 2,600 miles with only an occasional yell over the roar.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, for those couples who might not want to
converse with one another, it is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first tank of fuel, our honeymoon with the
idea of using a Hummer was rapidly fading. But everywhere we went,
people just loved it. You'd pull into a fuel station to find a
chorus line of curious gapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much does it cost?'' ``Is it amphibious?'' ``Man, that is
sooo cool!'' ``Can I look inside?'' ``Can I sit in it?'' ``I don't
suppose there is any chance you'd take me for a ride?''
</P>
<P>
   It was an endless barrage of questions. One 14-year-old was so
bold as to ask, ``How about letting me drive it around the parking
lot. I'd be really careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   When the deliveryman dropped off the Hummer at our house, he
said, ``You won't meet yourself coming in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. We didn't see just one other Hummer, in a place
appropriately named Soldiers Grove, Wis., we met a convoy of 44
military Hummers. We did have better paint _ theirs ranged from
conventional camouflage to the Desert Storm variety.
</P>
<P>
   People _ especially guys and kids _ love the look of the Hummer.
We concluded it was because it was a combination of its looks and
because it allows middle-aged men to play GI Joe.
</P>
<P>
   There is an alternative for those who are drawn to playing
either GI Joe or GI Jane but don't want to shell out nearly
$100,000 for an uncomfortable gas-guzzler. General Motors bought
the rights to the name from American General, which builds the
Hummer, to produce a little brother.
</P>
<P>
   GM's H2 will hit the market in 2002 as a 2003 model. For those
of us who don't have the same grit as our fighting men and women in
the armed services, we'll be able to look like it while enjoying
the interior and other amenities one would expect in a well-dressed
Suburban.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Oprah Winfrey teased a segment on Monday's show by saying
we would soon see a side of Al Gore we'd never seen before, I
cringed.
</P>
<P>
   Did she mean it literally? Was the veep going to give us a rear
view by donning some Lycra bicycle shorts and doing a spin or two
for the benefit of the studio audience and the voters at home?
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't discount such a wacky possibility. Hey, Oprah can get
people to do things on her show that they wouldn't do after six
Cosmpolitans on New Year's Eve at a private party_and Gore for
years has been looking for ways to prove he's the not a Disney
animatronic creation, to wit, smashing ashtrays with David
Letterman in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But when Oprah returned from the commercial break, we found out
we were going to learn more about Gore in a segment that could have
been titled, ``These Are a Few Of Al's Favorite Things.''
</P>
<P>
   (Similar Q-and-A sessions appear in magazines like Vanity Fair.
My favorite question is, ``What are you reading?'' No matter how
dimwitted the sitcom star or monosyllabic the jock, the answer is
always something along the lines of, ``The Evan Thomas biography of
Robert F. Kennedy is awe-inspiring,'' when you know the honest
reply would be, ``Huh? Reading? I just read the room-service menu
and they don't have the egg-white omelette I always order!'')
</P>
<P>
   Actually, we have seen this side of Gore already. Last November,
the New York Times asked Gore to list his favorites in a dozen
categories. For example, Gore told the Times his favorite book was
Stendahl's ``The Red and the Black'' _ a choice he reiterated on
Monday, and a choice I daresay you'll never see trumpeted on
``Oprah's Book Club.''
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned the art of Christo, the wrap-happy environmental
artist who gained some recent pub when Dennis Miller used him as a
punchline on ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   Jazz greats Thelonius Monk and Miles Davis, country artists
Kathy Mattea and Garth Brooks, ``Les Miserables,'' backyard
barbecues and the TV show ``Futurama'' (for which his daughter
Kristin writes) also garnered plugs from Gore in the New York Times
article.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not as if Oprah's quiz caught Gore by surprise _
although she did toss in a few soft curveballs. Some of the
territory Oprah covered:
</P>
<P>
   Favorite movie: ``Local Hero.'' For suckup points, Gore could
have gone with Oprah-involved efforts such as ``The Color Purple,''
``Beloved'' or even ``Oprah Winfrey Presents 'Tuesdays With
Morrie,''' as the Emmy-award winning mini-series was officially
titled. Had he wanted to demonstrate his self-effacing wit, he
could have blurted, '''Love Story.' It's about me!''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore stuck with the answer he's given before. ``Local Hero''
is a 1983 charmer from writer/director Bill Forsyth about a young
man (Peter Riegert) who is sent to a tiny, eccentric village in
Scotland to secure the rights for an oil refinery. Whimsy and
romance ensue.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder Gore is a fan of this environmentally correct gem,
but I must point out this isn't Riegert's best work, as it cannot
compare to his magnificent performance as Boone in ``Animal
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Meal. ``Chinese,'' said Gore. Get specific, dude!
</P>
<P>
   Cereal. The host and the studio audience were stunned silent by
Gore's first reply: ``Oprah.'' Was he making a joke? Did he have
inside knowledge that the ubiquitous Oprah name would soon be
gracing boxes of breakfast bran?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I said 'favorite cereal,''' Oprah finally said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I thought you meant serial like a television serial,''
Gore replied, apparently under the impression that a daytime talk
show falls into the same category as a 1950s soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   He then said ``Wheaties,'' and good for Oprah for expressing her
doubts about that response. God bless Wheaties, but they taste like
... Wheaties. You just know Billy Clinton would have chuckled and
sheepishly said, ``Ah can't help it, Oprah, I still love those
Lucky Charms. They're so magically delicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Band. ``The Beatles,'' Gore said. Until recently I would have
concurred, but these days I'd have to go with O-Town. They've won
my heart.
</P>
<P>
   Quote. Do you have a favorite quote you can spout from memory?
Do you know anyone who has a favorite quote? Me neither. But with
barely a hesitation, Gore quoted Bob Dylan: ``Those who are not
busy being born are busy dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone applauded. They might not have known the line is from
Dylan's ``It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding),'' a hardcore
protest song about war, government propaganda, commercialism and
``false gods.''
</P>
<P>
   Another line from the song: ``Even the president of the United
States sometimes has to stand naked.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently this was Clinton's favorite tune as well!
</P>
<P>
   Childhood memory. ``Playing baseball with my dad,'' said the
vice-president, and you could read the sincerity on this face.
</P>
<P>
   I have no joke for that, as I would have said the exact same
thing.

   If you have an itch to fly into space and half a million dollars
to spare, you may soon be able to nip down to the store and buy a
spaceship in kit form. Once assembled, the craft, called the
Kitten, will take you and two friends 200 kilometers up at a top
speed of Mach 4. It's not quite Earth orbit, but who's counting?
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be as reliable as any other kit _ a boat, a
helicopter or a small private sub,'' says James Hill, president of
Cerulean Freight Forwarding Company, based in Oroville, Wash.,
which plans to sell the kits.
</P>
<P>
   Cerulean is the latest of 19 entrants into the X Prize
competition, a contest which will award $10 million to the first
private group to launch a reusable vehicle into space, defined as
100 kilometers up. In marketing the Kitten as a kit that
enthusiasts can buy, Cerulean is going one better than its
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The idea may not be as far-fetched as it seems. Amateurs already
use kits to build and fly all kinds of aircraft, including
helicopters and jet planes. The Kitten will be built from many
off-the-shelf components that already have safety accreditation
from the Federal Aviation Authority. This makes it easier to make
sure the craft is safe, says Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The ship will use engines made from ceramic materials and burn a
mixture of methane and liquid oxygen, generating a maximum 3g of
thrust. This should propel the craft through a suborbital hop,
after which it will glide back to Earth like NASA's X-24 lifting
body. To save weight, compressed nitrogen will both cool the
engines and power hydraulic systems, while a laptop computer with
special software will help the pilot fly the craft. Because the
Kitten won't reach orbit, it won't need a heavy heat shield for
re-entry.
</P>
<P>
   Hill says universities might buy the kit to run zero-gravity
experiments or other space research. The first Kitten could even be
ready in three years, if additional investors step forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``An amateur-built spaceship would probably face tough scrutiny
from regulators,'' cautions Dick Knapinksi, a spokesman for the
Experimental Aircraft Association, an enthusiasts' group based in
Oshkosh, Wis. ``At the very least, the United States would have to
waive the 18-kilometer ceiling that limits private pilots now, he
says. &QL;

   Find liquid water on Mars, and life may not be far behind. Many
scientists believe that this water can only exist thousands of
meters beneath the planet's surface. So a team of engineers at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, is
developing a robotic mole that can drill deep into Mars and return
samples to the surface through a tube that it constructs as it
digs.
</P>
<P>
   JPL's Martian mole moves through the ground like a pile driver,
repeatedly raising an internal weight and then hammering it into
the ground. On Mars it will be wired up to a set of solar panels on
the surface that provide only enough power to illuminate a few
light bulbs. So the designers had to make a machine that could
penetrate the ground using only this meager power.
</P>
<P>
   The JPL design has a hammer head that spins at up to 20,000
revolutions per minute before engaging a central thread that drives
it into the ground. This delivers roughly twice the force of a
sledgehammer blow on Earth, and enables the mole to burrow at up to
10 meters per day.
</P>
<P>
   As it digs, the mole extrudes a tiny tube containing two
passageways that provide a link to the surface and back. Liquid
xenon circulating through these tubes will carry samples that can
be sieved and analyzed on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   One possible target for the mission is a potential aquifer that
many scientists believe may exist about 5 kilometers down near the
Martian equator, says Brian Wilcox, the project leader. Another
option is to aim for one of the planet's polar ice caps and study
Mars' climate history over the past few million years by examining
ice samples.
</P>
<P>
   The group has already built a prototype of the hammer mechanism
and is now planning the tube extruder. In 2002, Wilcox plans to
test the complete system in the Alaskan permafrost. He says his
team could be ready to tackle Mars within a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drilling may well be the only way we can get to places that
have a chance of having life on Mars today,'' says Michael Carr, a
geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey, who is reviewing NASA's
Mars program.  &QL;

   Human activity in coastal areas is responsible for killing
coral, say a pair of researchers who've been tracking coral
disease. This means that local measures such as reducing soil
run-off or sewage discharges might help save corals that fall ill.
Sick coral also provides an early warning that entire ecosystems
are in danger, according to the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, marine biologists have watched in dismay as corals
succumbed to a dozen apparently new infections. Now a global map of
coral diseases has pointed the finger at human development of
coastal zones.
</P>
<P>
   Most coral diseases are known by their symptoms, such as white
band or yellow pox. According to Laurie Richardson of Florida
International University in Miami, only three of these coral
ailments have a known cause.
</P>
<P>
   The diseases can be devastating. During the 1980s, white band
disease, caused by a bacterium related to cholera, nearly wiped out
Acropora corals across the Caribbean, where they had dominated
coral communities for at least 4,000 years. The soil bacterium
Aspergillus causes waves of mass mortality among gorgonian corals,
or sea fans.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, no one understood the pattern of disease: why
Caribbean reefs were the hardest hit, for example. So to learn more
about the causes of coral disease, Ed Green of the World
Conservation Monitoring Center in Cambridge and Andrew Bruckner of
the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service in Silver Spring,
Maryland, mapped coral diseases in the same way human epidemics are
plotted.
</P>
<P>
   They conclude that human activity is probably the major factor
in areas already predicted to be suffering environmental stress. In
the Caribbean, they found disease was most prevalent in areas
threatened by a range of human activities including intense coastal
development and overfishing.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggest sick coral might be a good early warning
signal for creeping damage to entire marine ecosystems, which can
be hard to detect. ``Coral diseases are big and visible,'' says
Green. ``If the relationship holds, they could signal when
protective measures are needed.'' He likens corals around the world
to canaries in coal mines. ``And this canary is singing,'' he
warns.  &QL;

   Humpback whales change their tune according to the season, and
now researchers think they know why.
</P>
<P>
   In response to changes in sea temperature, the whales adapt
their calls so they can be heard by other humpbacks over the
longest possible distance. The discovery may help naval ships and
submarines spot enemy vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Humpbacks sing over different frequency ranges depending on the
time of year, says Eduardo Mercado of Rutgers University in New
Jersey. Scientists had attributed this to the way whale behavior
changes with the season: in the summer, humpbacks are mainly
concerned with feeding, while winter is primarily a breeding
season. But Mercado felt something else was making humpbacks change
their tunes.
</P>
<P>
   To investigate, he ran computer simulations of how far whale
songs travel through water in different seasons. Sound propagation
depends on seasonal factors such as the temperature of the sea. His
results were unambiguous. ``To achieve maximal propagation ranges,
humpbacks should use lower frequencies in summer environments and
higher frequencies in winter,'' he says. When he compared his
results with published frequency ranges for humpback whales in
different seasons, he found this was exactly how the whales vary
their song.
</P>
<P>
   Mercado announced his results this week at the Oceans 2000
conference in Providence, R.I. He says that a better understanding
of whale song could allow the military to spot enemy vessels
covertly, as the sound waves alter their frequencies when they
bounce off an object.
</P>
<P>
   Mercado concedes that his method has its limitations _ not least
that whales have to be in the waters the military want to patrol.  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY ROB WALKER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Page 11 of his new book, George Gilder suggests that those
readers looking for investing advice might want to skip the next
140 pages. This isn't a bad piece of advice, in my opinion, but
it's a little surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The new book is called ``Telecosm: How Infinite Bandwidth Will
Revolutionize Our World,'' and my understanding had been that it
would deliver the ultimate vision of George Gilder as worldly
philosopher, not ``Nine Stocks to Buy Now.''
</P>
<P>
   I suppose Gilder would say that he has always been a worldly
philosopher, but really the current book represents a kind of
fourth phase in his public thinking. Certainly, he was not always a
tech guru. Born into an old East Coast family, Gilder is a graduate
of Exeter and Harvard and a friend and fan of the Rockefeller
family; The New Yorker described David Rockefeller as ``a sort of
substitute father for Gilder when he was growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   His earliest books, in the 1970s, established him as a
thoroughgoing cultural reactionary, impatient with the notion that
sexism or racism even exist. At one point he was branded ``Male
Chauvinist Pig of the Year'' by Time and the National Organization
for Women.
</P>
<P>
   Phase 2 came in the form of the 1981 book ``Wealth and
Poverty,'' which gave his social ideas and supply-side economics a
proper Christian wedding; by this point he was writing speeches for
Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The New Republic convincingly argued that Gilder's handle on
macroeconomics was ``more poetical than analytic,'' but the book
became a best seller anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Gilder, meanwhile, was moving on to Phase 3, as a technology
worshipper. ``Microcosm,'' which appeared in 1989, was his ecstatic
appraisal of the potential of microchips to change the world. In
particular, he zeroed in on a guy named Andy Grove at a company
called Intel, which he predicted would be a force to reckon with.
He also predicted that television would disappear in the 1990s, but
it's the semiconductor stuff, and particularly his incredible
prescience about Intel, that people remember. Just imagine if you'd
loaded up on Intel stock in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to ``Telecosm,'' the opening line of which is,
``The computer age is over.'' Gilder's new idol is bandwidth: ``New
technologies of sand, glass, and air will form a web with a total
carrying power, from household to global crossing, at least a
million times larger than the network of today.'
</P>
<P>
   Running against current wisdom that sees bandwidth shortage as a
problem, he sees hope in technology that will make more and better
use of fiber-optic networks, he sees those networks growing, and he
sees vast bandwidth potential in the electromagnetic spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he foresees an embarrassment of bandwidth. Power (and
big payoffs for investors) will migrate away from computers and
switches and routers, and toward the network itself. All of this
leads to, as he (poetically) sums up a few paragraphs later,
``networks of light linking cathedrals of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith in bandwidth might not sound particularly controversial.
But when Gilder prognosticates, he doesn't simply do so in the
startling-but-vague manner of the typical futurist. He can be
extremely specific. For instance, one of the great causes
championed by his writing in his Technology Report newsletter, in
Forbes ASAP, and in this book is a wireless standard called code
division multiple access (CDMA), which he has argued is superior to
and will eventually brush aside the time division multiple access
standard (TDMA) that a slew of telecom giants have bet on.
</P>
<P>
   On this score, there's an important point to make about Gilder:
I have a hard time believing that there's another tech writer in
America who is as deeply immersed in truly understanding the
technology he writes about. That's what makes the book, especially
those first 150 pages or so, rather heavy going.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sentence picked more or less at random, in which Gilder
summarizes the strength of a strategy pursued by the telecom firm
Qwest: ``Qwest's WDM systems and erbium-doped amplifiers don't care
what kind of packets are traveling down the pipes.'' WDM stands for
wave-division multiplexing--does that help?
</P>
<P>
   Being a writer who can master the engineering behind
cutting-edge technology is impressive. But it seems unlikely that
Gilder's dizzying command of jargon is what's going to sell this
book, and I suspect that it will sell briskly. So what's the
attraction?
</P>
<P>
   There are two possibilities. The first is that a reader might be
interested in Gilder's conceit that the path through the
technological details leads to meaning and enlightenment. Certainly
in interviews Gilder seems anxious to play up the idea that he's a
tech futurist who not only embraces religion but ties it all
together. Thus, the final part of his book is grandly titled ``The
Meaning of Light.''
</P>
<P>
   But while his ``cathedrals of light'' theatrics will probably be
quoted by everyone who writes about ``Telecosm,'' what's surprising
about the book's climax is how pedestrian it is. Central to his
closing is a riff about a family of the future tapping into the
mighty Telecosm to check stock prices, shop for groceries, and a
take a ``virtual walk'' on a Hawaiian beach.
</P>
<P>
   Is that it? Sounds like the 1964 World's Fair. The closest he
gets to a wild utopian fantasy is the kind of half-hearted
declaration that the Web will make everyone more efficient.
``Liberated from hierarchies that often waste their time and
talents, people will be able to discover their most productive
roles and pursue them more effectively.'' Sure.
</P>
<P>
   Either that, or they'll watch more ``South Park.'' (Whoops! No
they won't: Television, Gilder predicts again, won't survive.)
</P>
<P>
   The other possible motivation for this book's readership may be
found in Appendix B: ``Nine Stars of the Telecosm.'' These nine
stars are public firms such as JDS Uniphase and Qualcomm, which
Gilder has previously touted in his newsletter--a newsletter that
has shown an increasing ability to move stocks.
</P>
<P>
   What Gilder really seems to tacitly admit in Telecosm is that
his ultimate role in American discourse is basically as a
stock-picker, and he's OK with that. It turns out there's a greater
market for his investing advice than there is for his social ideas,
supply-side theories, or worldly philosophy. And the market, as
Gilder would be the first to tell you, is never wrong.

REPUBLICANS TRY TO SPIN AWAY FROM THEIR BELIEFS

   &UR; BY MICHAEL KINSLEY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Understandably eager to win back the White House now and worry
about doctrinal niceties later, the Republicans may have gotten
carried away. They have maneuvered themselves into a situation
where their leaders _ including their presidential candidate _ are
required to be disingenuous on almost every topic.
</P>
<P>
   On social issues, Republican leaders pretend to be hard-core
conservatives, when most are actually far more cosmopolitan than
they let on. Meanwhile, on domestic policy issues, they endorse new
spending and regulations like drunken liberals, while their inner
conservative surely writhes in agony.
</P>
<P>
   Only on foreign and military policy does their public postur _
an incoherent mix of pugnaciousness and isolationism _ accurately
reflect their actual beliefs, which are sincerely confused.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush met with gay Republicans in April and declared
that he was ``a better person'' as a result. I doubt it. The
specific person Bush wished to be thought better than is the one
who had previously refused to meet this group because that would be
``divisive.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I don't doubt at all that Bush is a better person than
this fatuous bigot. What I doubt is that anything has changed. He
was always a better person at heart, just pretending to be a
fatuous bigot. One danger of disingenuous posturing is a tendency
to overshoot the mark.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is a yuppie, for all his Texas twangery. He also, on all
public evidence, has inherited his father's WASP values, under
which a general obligation to treat people decently is very
important but particular ideological passions are vulgar and
boring. Who can believe that such a person would have any sincere
objection to simply meeting a group of equally nice,
well-brought-up Republicans because they are gay? But he fabricated
an objection and then had to fabricate a small moral awakening to
get out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago Hendrik Hertzberg, now of The New Yorker, coined a
term for politicians who pretend to extreme social-conservative
views they don't really share. He called them ``closet tolerants.''
Ronald Reagan, after a lifetime in Hollywood, almost surely had no
moral objection to homosexuality. But he pretended to share the
views of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion is an even better example. Raise your hand if you think
that George W. Bush _ or George H.W. Bush or Trent Lott or
whatsisname the speaker of the House _ actually believes that
abortion is the murder of an innocent child. But they feel they
must pretend to believe it. Then they must try to explain why the
murder of innocent children should not be a ``litmus test'' for
admission to their party's ``big tent.'' It cannot be done.
</P>
<P>
   As with gay rights, a double pretense _ abortion is murder, but
that's OK _ gets them pretty close to where their sincere beliefs
might bring them anyway. But the round trip must be tiring for
those with any capacity for reflection.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Republicans wax enthusiastic about new regulations
on HMOs or a prescription drug subsidy program for seniors, you
might suppose that the Republican-controlled Congress would be
pushing for things like this even if the Democratic Party didn't
exist. Who believes that?
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans tend to clothe their ideological nakedness with
a lot of talk about privatization, using market forces, or simply
doing it smaller. They also claim to be doing it better, and they
may be right in some cases. But this doesn't explain why they're
doing it at all, or relieve the near-certain suspicion that in
their hearts they'd rather not.
</P>
<P>
   Well, so what? Hypocritical posturing greases the wheels of
change. If you favor HMO regulation, isn't insincere support better
than sincere opposition? Intellectual dishonesty is a pretty
recherche complaint. Maybe factual honesty is enough to ask from
politicians. Forget the fancier stuff. Or, to put it another way,
maybe John Mitchell (``Watch what we do, not what we say'') had a
better philosophy than George Bush the Elder (``Read my lips'').
</P>
<P>
   And yes, of course, disingenuousness is not a Republican
monopoly. The Democratic candidate, Al Gore, is disingenuous in his
new role as a fire-breathing us-against-them populist. Either that
or he was disingenuous during his entire previous political career
as a self-described ``raging moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians of all stripes reposition themselves within their
slice of the political spectrum as the demands of national vs.
local office, or primaries vs. general elections, dictate.
</P>
<P>
   Spin _ the native language of politics _ is inherently
disingenuous: It is based on the premise that words are moves in a
game of strategy. Every politician says he is ``saddened'' by some
stupid action or remark by his opponent, when he is actually
delighted. And they all love the word ``frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   With this easy-to-use device, not available in stores, you can
repackage an unobjectionable or toadying remark as an act of verbal
courage. These rhetorical tricks are so ingrained in political
culture that you can't even call them lies. But even when spin is
the truth, it is insincere.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, though, what's going on is the minimizing or
exaggeration of a pol's devotion to a few small issues. Even in the
Age of Spin, it's pretty special to watch a party basing an entire
presidential campaign on the systematic betrayal of its true
beliefs in both directions simultaneously. And the strain seems to
be showing.

   &UR; BY CHRIS SUELLENTROP &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Texas is no longer dominated by oil rigs, cattle ranches and a
gun-toting, yee-hawing citizenry, the New Republic's Benjamin
Soskis reports. It's a diverse place of suburbs and urban sprawl,
utterly transformed by high-tech industry and out-of-staters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is becoming more like the rest of the nation than
anyone, Texan or non-Texan, wants to admit,'' he marvels in the
cover story now on the newsstands, ``Why Texas Isn't Texas
Anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Soskis isn't the first political reporter to discover the
``new'' character of the provinces beyond the Beltway and
Manhattan. During the 1988 campaign, the Washington Post's Henry
Allen stumbled upon the ``new New Hampshire,'' a state that had
gone ``malltown from milltown.'' The same year, the AP gasped at
New Hampshire's ``high-tech companies'' and ``suburban sprawl.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 2000 campaign, The Los Angeles Times' Maria L. LaGanga
was among the first reporters to rely on the ``new'' boilerplate.
The ``New Iowa,'' she wrote, was now home to more high-tech
businesses, more immigrants, and fewer cornfields. Susan Feeney of
The Dallas Morning News offered the ``new New Hampshire'': a
booming high-tech economy dominated by urban sprawl and
out-of-state workers. Feeney put a scholarly gloss on the cliche by
quoting a political scientist who said, ``New Hampshire is becoming
a little bit more like the rest of the country,'' presaging Soskis'
Texas findings.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Eaton of The New York Times and Mark Sappenfield of The
Christian Science Monitor also found Cow Hampshire overrun by
high-tech industry and outsiders. Sappenfield dug up his own
poli-sci expert to say, ``New Hampshire is going to grow closer to
America.''
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign moved to other states, the journalistic pack
detected signs that these places, too, were becoming more like
America. David Von Drehle of The Washington Post wrote that the
``new South Carolina'' was more than ``the old birthplace of the
Confederacy.'' It was a ``showplace for the global economy'' with a
``burgeoning suburbia.'' Steven Thomma of the Knight-Ridder
Washington bureau gaped at South Carolina's ``congested highways,''
``chain stores and malls,'' and ``new suburbs and condos,'' not to
mention the out-of-state newcomers and the concerns about sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The popular perception that Michigan elections are still
dominated by legions of auto workers toting lunch pails is as dated
as a Chevrolet Citation,'' wrote The New York Times' Keith
Bradsher. The new Michigan had a ``new economy'' with ``high-tech
professionals,'' many of whom were, you guessed it, newcomers (but
no mention of whether they were concerned about sprawl).
</P>
<P>
   And on and on it has gone, through Virginia and Washington,
through New England and the South on Super Tuesday, until reaching
Texas, where Kenneth T. Walsh of U.S. News &AMP; World Report beat
Soskis to the ``new Texas'' punch in May: More diversity, more
urban residents and, lo and behold, high-tech workers and a booming
economy. ``It used to be that Texas was considered very different
from the rest of the country,'' historian Michael Beschloss told
the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Who are these hacks? Why do they insist on filing these ``new''
stories every four years? One possibility is that they're coastal
provincials whose understanding of the flyover territory is so
superficial they don't realize they're debunking long-discredited
stereotypes. Another is that they're just too lazy to bother
checking the archive before writing a story.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, where are their editors, who are supposed to serve
as a publication's institutional memory? They're the ones who
should be telling bored reporters tired of listening to stump
speeches that suburbs and strip malls just aren't newsworthy.
</P>
<P>
   The real shame is how easy it would be to give these stories the
perspective they lack. As a March Des Moines Register editorial on
Iowa's changing countryside put it: ``There is nothing new about
the New Iowa. Although its cumulative effects are more visible now,
the shift in population from rural to urban areas has been an
inexorable trend for at least a half century.''
</P>
<P>
   Is one sentence of depth too much to ask?

   Some Olympics fans may never come up from Down Under thanks to
the ambitious television coverage of this year's Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   More hours of the Games than ever before will be telecast by NBC
and its cable networks, MSNBC and CNBC: 441.5 total hours of events
from Sydney, Australia _ more than double the 171.5 hours carried
on NBC during the Atlanta games of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The opening ceremony, to be helmed by prime-time Olympics host
Bob Costas and ``Today'' host Katie Couric, airs from 7:30 p.m. to
midnight EDT Friday on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Expect pageantry and musical majesty similar to former Olympics
kickoffs. Though the network has tried to keep the surprise element
alive, one detail did escape: Aussie-born Olivia Newton-John of
``Grease'' fame will be among the performers.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday through Oct. 1, prime-time and late-night hours as well
as various daytime blocks on NBC will be devoted to the games.
</P>
<P>
   None of the events will be carried live because of the 15-hour
time difference between the East Coast and Sydney; the events will
be presented on tape.
</P>
<P>
   To explain the delay, NBC cites the gymnastics finals, which
will begin at 7 p.m. Sydney time, but at 4 a.m. EDT. In fact, most
finals of the major Olympic sports will happen in the middle of the
night in the United States when, according to NBC, less than 10
percent of the viewing audience is available.
</P>
<P>
   For the ``true fanatics,'' the moniker suggested by NBC Olympics
Executive Producer Dick Ebersol for Olympics junkies, instantaneous
results will be available on the Web at www.nbcolympics.com.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings for an overseas Olympics such as this one are not
expected to approach the record-breaking 21.6 prime-time rating of
the Games from Atlanta. NBC anticipates a 17.5-18.5 prime-time
rating for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   However, NBC does predict that total viewership of the Games
will break the 1996 record: 215 million viewers vs. Atlanta's 209
million.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC's Olympics host Pat O'Brien, in an interview from Sydney
last week, predicted this could be the greatest Olympics ever based
solely on the dramatic look of the location. ``The Sydney Harbour
has to be the most beautiful harbor in the world,'' he said as an
illustration, adding that NBC will use the sailing competitions to
show that off.
</P>
<P>
   He added that with all the exposure during the games, Sydney
and, really, all of Australia, ``will become a huge star.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyish NBC Sports announcer Costas, a veteran of two previous
Olympics, will act as prime-time host on NBC, weekdays and
weeknights. He'll also host the late-night segments, which will air
from 12:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. on weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's coverage will focus on a human-interest, storytelling
approach. That way, said David Neal, NBC's head of Olympics
production, the network can make that all-important connection
between the viewer and the athletes. The goal is to make people
care about the competitors, even if the sporting event they're
competing in normally holds no interest for the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That coverage is primarily geared to putting the whole family
in front of the television set,'' Ebersol told a recent news
conference, ``which is, as you know, a rarer and rarer
occurrence.''
</P>
<P>
   He characterized the cable coverage as ``wall-to-wall'' and as
being for the ``pure ... sports fan.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC will concentrate on the major sports of the Olympics:
swimming and diving, track and field, gymnastics, volleyball,
basketball, triathlon and wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's swimming analyst will be Rowdy Gaines, a gold medalist in
that sport. He predicts that ``this Olympics, for swimming, anyway,
will leave a legacy of the greatest in history ... The
USA-vs.-Australia rivalry could be the greatest story of Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said NBC will do its best not to do a cheerleading act
for the Americans by emphasizing every country's strengths. ``We
know back home, viewers will be cheering for Michael Johnson and
Marion Jones, but we're not going to go in for such jingoism.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lampley, a veteran of 10 Olympics, will host MSNBC's
coverage, which will begin each day at 10 a.m. This channel will be
the home of team sports: men's and women's soccer, baseball and
softball.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, a past late-night host of the Winter Games on CBS and
co-anchor of ``Access Hollywood,'' will anchor CNBC's daily
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the latter coverage, which will run from 4 p.m.
to 9 p.m. weekdays (it begins an hour earlier on weekends), will be
two hours of boxing each day. This treat for fight fans wasn't
available before cable channels offered coverage assistance.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien described these events as faster-paced than professional
boxing. ``There's a lot of punching and jabbing,'' he said, adding
that though Cuba seems to have a lock on this sport, viewers may
see some surprises from the United States this go-round.
</P>
<P>
   He said the best thing about the extended cable coverage is that
every sport, from archery to weightlifting, will get its moment in
the sun. ``You'd be surprised how many people like to watch these
little guys lift 5, 6, 800 pounds,'' he said, defending this and
other less-hyped events.
</P>
<P>
   Other signature voices will be aplenty at the Olympics. Andres
Cantor's ``GOOOAL!'' call (which was made famous on the World Cup
broadcasts) will be heard on both women's and men's soccer
telecasts (primarily on MSNBC). Marv Albert will do Olympic boxing
and Tom Hammond will once again do track and field.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature of this Olympics that is widely anticipated is
``Twice Born,'' the short film about Muhammad Ali, which is
scheduled to air the second Saturday night of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was generated just one month after the Games in
Atlanta, when Ebersol learned from Ali's kin how the ex-boxer felt
about lighting the Olympic flame. According to Lisa Lax, NBC's
Olympics senior profile producer, Ebersol was told that Ali sat in
his hotel room that night holding his torch and could not sleep a
wink. ``He stayed up the entire night. There were receptions by the
people in the stadium and ultimately by everyone around the world
that were just overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   The film shows, Lax said, ``how he first was introduced to the
world on an international level at the Rome Olympic Games in 1960,
and how he was almost reborn in 1996 when he lit the Olympic flame
in Atlanta.''

 &HT;    CANDIDATES WOO HIGH-TECH WORLD WITH SIMILAR STANDS
 &HT;    With TECH-ISSUES and TECH-MONEY. Moving in the (w) Washington,
(f) financial and (p) political categories for release Sunday,
Sept. 17.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When it comes to high-tech issues, who would make
the better president: George W. Bush or Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   While the race for the White House won't be won by the candidate
who best clears the high technology hurdles, those concerns are
playing an ever-larger role in shaping the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next six years, the U.S. Commerce Department reports,
nearly half the U.S. work force will be employed by makers or users
of information-technology products or services. This sector already
contributes about 35 percent of overall economic growth and about
10 percent of gross domestic output.
</P>
<P>
   An in-depth look at what Bush and Gore have had to say on the
technology front reveals fewer conflicts than similarities.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, however, appears more focused on reaching
out to a wide circle of tech-savvy players, while the vice
president seems more reliant on his long-standing expertise in
these areas. Gore, for example, was deeply involved in the drafting
of a 1997 policy paper that calls for limited government
involvement in Internet e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Key figures helping Bush in the Republican political effort
include fellow Texan Michael Dell, chief executive of Dell Computer
Corp., and Cisco Systems chief executive John Chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Republicans have made jokes about Gore saying he
created the Internet, but the fact is that he really believes that
government created the Internet,'' said Floyd Kvamme, a partner at
the Silicon Valley high-tech venture capital firm of Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers and one of California's 324 delegates to
the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush,'' Kvamme adds, ``believes the Internet was created by
the entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Gore cites his long involvement with high-tech issues
and tills the grassroots soil for like-minded community activists,
Bush reaches out to such leading technology industry figures such
as Dell and Kvamme, who act as both his financial backers and
informal advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is a much newer figure on the political scene,
so for many months he has been trying to organize key leaders,''
noted Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology
Association of America. While Miller identifies himself as a
Democrat, he says he is pleased with the positions that both the
candidates have taken on key high-tech issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of technology executives are in the Bush
camp,'' said William Coleman III, a founder and chief executive of
BEA Systems, a software firm based in San Jose, Calif. Coleman also
participates in the 350-member ``Bush for President High-Tech
Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, the Gore campaign sought to gather up as
many high-tech business leaders of its own as possible, asking them
to sign a joint letter of support for the Democratic candidate. The
letter is due to be released Monday to coincide with a Silicon
Valley Gore fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supporters already include such chief executives as Eric
Schmidt of Novell, Steve Jobs of Apple Computer and Meg Whitman of
eBay.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Gore often links technology issues to such broader
themes as the need ``to help American workers beat the foreign
competition to 10 million new high-tech jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   A blurb on the Gore Web site says: ``From early in his
congressional career, Al Gore has focused on the potential of the
information technology age. Al Gore has worked to connect every
classroom in America to the Internet, promoted privacy on-line,
advocated faster Internet connections and he has become a prime
advocate for the development of the Next Generation Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also favors targeted tax cuts aimed at increasing
investment in high-tech research and development, open markets in
cyberspace and better educational opportunities for young people
that would make them fit to assume their place in the ``work force
of tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice the vice president recognizes that high-tech creates
high-paying jobs,'' said Tom Stohler, director of work force policy
for the American Electronics Association. ``But,'' he added, ``it
would take a massive restructuring in the education system and a
tremendous investment in training. We don't have the people to fill
those jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also often uses a wide economic lens to examine the items
that matter most to technology mavens. He stresses his support for
a permanent ban on Internet taxation and the need to offer more
corporate tax credits to enhance technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic platform is silent on the Internet tax,'' says
Tucker Eskew, a senior communications adviser for the Bush campaign
who specializes in technology issues. ``And we view that as our
opponent's lack of commitment to coming down against new taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't delved deeply into high-tech at all,'' counters
Dagoberto Vega, a Gore campaign spokesman, referring to Bush's
views. ``They have not addressed any of the 'digital divide'
issues, such as connecting those in disadvantaged areas to the
information highway.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, has made educational reform a centerpiece of his
campaign, stressing the need to achieve ``the promise of high
standards and accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   To further his goal of ``encouraging continued growth of the New
Economy'' and ensuring that ``all Americans share in its
benefits,'' Bush would dramatically raise the cap of H-1B immigrant
visas; reduce frivolous lawsuits imposed on high-tech companies and
small businesses; strengthen math and science curricula while
creating community technology centers, and provide ``assistive''
technology to the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may not think of education as a high-tech issue, but it is
the most important issue to high-tech companies,'' said Toni Casey,
the mayor of Los Altos Hills, Calif., who also serves as a
consultant to several Internet firms.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the candidates, however, has had much to say about
such high-tech-related issues as intellectual property and Internet
copyright law, which has triggered strong judicial pressure against
the Napster music distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   David Foote, the managing partner of an information technology
compensation and workforce research firm in New Canaan, Conn., also
notes that both campaigns have ignored what some industry figures
see as a pressing need for Congress to reform employment-related
labor and tax laws ``that haven't fundamentally (been) changed in
four decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Foote: That's very disturbing (because) these laws will
choke our nation's attempts to field an Information Age work force
to meet the enormous challenges of the New Economy and maintain
America's competitiveness globally.''

Telegraph.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY ANNE APPLEBAUM &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   LONDON _ In Wales, a 62-year-old man died early this week while
waiting in a long line for gasoline. Doctors said afterward that he
had expired from ``stress and heat.'' Elsewhere in Britain, more
than a quarter of the nation's ``petrol stations'' ran dry after
panic-buying Monday; truck drivers blockaded most of the country's
major refineries Tuesday; protesters banged on Tony Blair's Jaguar
shouting ``shame on you;'' a rogue Texaco station in Derby was
found to be selling gas at more than $16 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, over in Brussels, more than 2,000 trucks, buses and
taxis were blocking the city center, with German, Dutch and Italian
drivers threatening to follow suit in their own cities.
</P>
<P>
   France, where protests have naturally been the most extreme, is
only now recovering from the trucker strikes of the last few weeks.
They joined with boat drivers to block the Seine and with taxi
drivers to choke off several cities. Along the Channel they
prevented access to ports and left tourists stranded for days.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the ``coming oil crisis,'' as the American media refer
to it, has already arrived over here in Europe, bringing with it a
wave of 1970s nostalgia: the gasoline lines, the specter of
inflation, the fond memories of the Carter administration (remember
those peanut cartoons?), the return to currency of old-fashioned
words like ``recession.''
</P>
<P>
   But before everyone gets all weepy and starts humming Bee Gees
tunes, it might be worth looking at how different, this time
around, the international impact of the apparently unstoppable rise
in oil prices is going to be. None of the villains is going to be
quite the same _ and none of the victims either.
</P>
<P>
   Look, for example, at the relatively understanding attitude
toward the Old Villains: If the Gulf Arabs were the prime focus of
angst and anger last time around, this time they won't be, or
anyway not to the same extent. It's a different OPEC we're dealing
with these days, post-Desert Storm: less dominant of the oil
market, more open (it even has a Web site), anxious not to hurt its
biggest buyers too much.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as last February, Saudi Arabia issued a joint
statement with U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, agreeing that
``price volatility in world oil markets is detrimental to both
producing and consuming nations'' and promising to ``avoid harming
the world economy.'' Nor is it so clear that high prices are its
fault, given that on Monday OPEC agreed to raise its output by
800,000 barrels a day _ and in response, unimpressed markets pushed
the price of crude up further.
</P>
<P>
   Neither are the Old Victims quite the same. High oil prices
remain big trouble for Japan and Western Europe, of course, but
while the last oil crisis notably altered the balance of power in
the Arab-Israeli conflict, it's hard to see how the current
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations will be affected. The questions
of, say, whether it is feasible to put an international border
between the mosque on the Temple Mount and the Wailing Wall just
below (yes, that's a real possibility) won't really be answered
differently if Saudi Arabia becomes even richer.
</P>
<P>
   But this time around, there are some New Victims too, most
notably in Eastern Europe. No longer propped up by subsidized
Soviet oil prices, all the newly emerging democracies, or whatever
you want to call them, are especially vulnerable, thanks to their
greater susceptibility to inflation and their near-total dependence
on Russia for oil. In the case of some, this might have big
political implications.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine, for example, already reliant on its larger neighbor for
most of its trade, will be made seriously destabilized by high oil
prices, thereby propelling the country further into Russia's
geopolitical embrace.
</P>
<P>
   As this week's events prove, New Villains are emerging too. In
Europe, virtually all the consumer anger and anxiety is focused,
this time around, not on the Arabs but on European governments;
consumer groups like Boycott the Pumps, which have been calling for
regular gas station boycotts since August are gaining ground, and
they are mostly blaming their own leadership for high fuel taxes
that are the real cause of high consumer fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Tax revolt is such a rare thing here that no one even knows
quite how to respond to it. Tony Blair tried to deflect the blame
onto OPEC, for example, but that only made things worse. He was
immediately caught out by editorialists and columnists who pointed
out that 80 percent of the retail fuel price in Britain is in fact
accounted for by taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Only the French government, so far, has bowed to what is
developing into one of the greatest European tax revolts of all
time: French truckers finally agreed to stop blocking the streets
only when the French government agreed to lower fuel taxes by 15
percent _ a deal worth about $2,000 per truck per year. Concessions
from others may follow, with concurrent damage to any plans
Europe's mostly left-wing governments may have had for
welfare-state expansion.
</P>
<P>
   There are also, this time around, New Victors, although that
distinction may be a dubious one. Russia, whose entire economy is
now propped up by oil, stands to gain in a big way _ but is this
really the best thing for the country? A long-term boom in oil
prices would allow President Vladimir Putin to put off reforms
indefinitely, would give him extra cash to pump into his tattered
army, would enable him, in other words, to keep on going as if
nothing had changed _ just as high oil prices enabled his Soviet
predecessors to go on as if nothing had changed in the 1970s _
thereby setting the stage for an even more dramatic collapse when
oil prices go down again.
</P>
<P>
   One can also imagine, if things get really bad, that high oil
prices could conceivably help Iraq. Sooner or later, someone may
well call for a lifting of sanctions, although a reliable source
tells me that Iraq isn't really in a position to start pumping huge
quantities of oil at the moment anyway. Years of investment would
be required-nothing would happen fast enough to change the current
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, sustained high prices could bring with them New Trouble
Spots To Watch. As a reliable source of international tension and
unrest, the Caspian Sea region may well turn out to be the new
Middle East. Already disturbed by the Chechen war, the
Armenian-Azeri conflict and a staggering array of weak governments,
the region could easily be plunged into political chaos by a rapid
and dirty race to develop the oil resources of the region.
</P>
<P>
   These are the sort of places no one would bother developing if
oil was $5 a barrel, the political risks being too high. But if
it's $35 _ and if it's going to stay $35 _ then it suddenly looks
interesting to compete, even _ especially _ for the Russians, not
to mention BP and Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   Not, again, that this will necessarily do the locals any good:
Following the Nigerian model of development can't be the best
medicine for regimes of dubious stability. Let's face it _ oil is a
curse for any country. Too bad we can't all use less of it.

 &HT;    TRAGEDY AT SEA RENEWS HEATED DEBATE OVER CUBAN IMMIGRATION TO
U.S.
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 17
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS

<P>
   COLON, Cuba - Tears fill Daisy Bueno's(cq) eyes as she opens the
faded greeting card that holds the precious photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Her two handsome sons kneel in one of the pictures, each with a
hand on their beloved boxer, Chester.
</P>
<P>
   Daisy Bueno has only the photographs _ and Chester _ as
reminders of her boys, Juan Carlos, 23, and Alexei(cq), 20.
</P>
<P>
   In early August, the youths became the latest casualties of the
40-year-old cold war between Cuba and the United States. Sneaking
away from home, they boarded a raft along Cuba's north coast and
headed for what they hoped would be new lives of freedom and
opportunity in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, fishermen off Key West spotted their shark-eaten
remains on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't understand it,'' said Daisy Bueno, 41. ``They were
such happy boys. Everybody here knew them and liked them. My heart
is broken. I've lost my sons.''
</P>
<P>
   The shocking deaths led to a fresh volley of accusations between
the governments of Cuba and the United States, each blaming the
other for policies they say encourage Cubans like the Bueno
brothers to risk their lives in the treacherous journey across the
Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can calculate just how many have lost their lives this
way, and how many more will do so,'' said a recent editorial in
Granma, the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party. The
newspaper has labeled the U.S. Cuban Adjustment Act, which grants
automatic asylum after one year to any Cuban reaching U.S. shores,
``The Killer Law.''
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials say the blame falls at the feet of the Cuban
government. In late August, the State Department sent a blistering
note to the head of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington,
accusing the Cubans of blocking people with visas from leaving the
island, and thus encouraging them to take to the sea in
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cuban government has consistently failed to take effective
action in response to our continuing and legitimate humanitarian
concerns,'' said the note, which was addressed to Fernando
Remirez(cq), chief of the Cuban diplomatic mission.
</P>
<P>
   The note specifically mentioned the Bueno brothers, saying their
tragic end ``highlights the growing propensity of Cubans denied the
means to migrate in a safe, orderly and legal fashion to risk their
lives in desperate sea voyages.''
</P>
<P>
   The war of words comes in the wake of a stepped-up campaign by
the government of Cuban leader Fidel Castro to focus world
attention on U.S. immigration policies. Castro began the campaign
during the long-running tug-of-war over 6-year-old Cuban rafter
Elian Gonzalez, who survived a tragic crossing of the Florida
Straits that left his mother and 10 other people dead.
</P>
<P>
   After a tortured court case in the U.S., the boy returned to
Cuba with his father in July, much to the anguish of his relatives
in Miami. It was also a devastating blow to Miami's Cuban exile
community, which for decades had exercised powerful influence over
U.S. policy toward the island.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness of the Cuban exiles to separate Elian from his
father over political beliefs stunned many Americans, bringing
unprecedented attention to U.S.-Cuba relations.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's case is credited with playing a significant role in the
passage of a bill in the U.S. Congress in July that was a major
break with past policy. Although differences in House and Senate
versions of the bill must be resolved in a conference committee
before gaining final approval, it would ease the 40-year-old
embargo against Cuba by allowing the sale of food and medicine to
the island, and would withhold money for enforcing restrictions
barring most U.S. citizens from visiting Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But the angry rhetoric over the immigration issue now appears to
threaten the momentum for a warming of relations.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration has long been the powder keg underlying the
U.S.-Cuba relationship, with several massive waves of Cubans
fleeing by boat triggering crises in the U.S., especially in South
Florida. The most famous exodus, from the Cuban port of Mariel, saw
more than 100,000 Cubans come. The economic crisis sparked by the
fall of Cuba's communist patron, the Soviet Union, prompted a
smaller but longer-running wave in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   After some 38,000 Cubans risked the high seas in 1994 to reach
the United States, the governments reached a new set of agreements
in 1995 that granted 20,000 U.S. entry visas each year to Cubans.
The deal also changed the long-standing U.S. policy of accepting
any Cubans rescued at sea, instead sending them back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But those who reach U.S. soil are still allowed to stay in the
United States, and after the one-year waiting period specified
under the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act, they are able to win permanent
U.S. residency.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides now say the 1995 agreements are threatened by the
renewed tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The recent State Department note documented 117 cases of Cubans
with U.S. visas who were blocked from leaving the island. The Coast
Guard has also found small but increasing numbers of Cuban rafters
with U.S. visas who said they weren't allowed to leave legally and
finally took to the sea in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans continue to insist it is U.S. policy that encourages
the risky boat trips. Tragedies like that of the Bueno brothers
only give them more ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The two young men were popular in their rural village, which has
not seen a great exodus by raft to Florida, their relatives said.
The farming town is about 150 miles east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Carlos Bueno worked at a local radio station as a
technician, while his younger brother Alexei was a carpenter.
Alexei loved to dance, and both youths were popular in town.
</P>
<P>
   Family members shook their heads when asked if they knew the two
were plotting a trip to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had everything here,'' said their sister, Niobelo
Gonzalez (cq), 27. ``They had jobs, family and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bueno family is left with only questions _ and a sense of
loss tinged with anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law of the United States encourages people to go to the
sea,'' Gonzalez said. ``If not for that, my brothers would be alive
today.''

   WASHINGTON _ When it comes to high-tech issues, who would make
the better president: George W. Bush or Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   While the race for the White House won't be won by the candidate
who best clears the high technology hurdles, those concerns are
playing an ever-larger role in shaping the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next six years, the U.S. Commerce Department reports,
nearly half the U.S. work force will be employed by makers or users
of information-technology products or services. This sector already
contributes about 35 percent of overall economic growth and about
10 percent of gross domestic output.
</P>
<P>
   An in-depth look at what Bush and Gore have had to say on the
technology front reveals fewer conflicts than similarities.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, however, appears more focused on reaching
out to a wide circle of tech-savvy players, while the vice
president seems more reliant on his long-standing expertise in
these areas. Gore, for example, was deeply involved in the drafting
of a 1997 policy paper that calls for limited government
involvement in Internet e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Key figures helping Bush in the Republican political effort
include fellow Texan Michael Dell, chief executive of Dell Computer
Corp., and Cisco Systems chief executive John Chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Republicans have made jokes about Gore saying he
created the Internet, but the fact is that he really believes that
government created the Internet,'' said Floyd Kvamme, a partner at
the Silicon Valley high-tech venture capital firm of Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers and one of California's 324 delegates to
the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush,'' Kvamme adds, ``believes the Internet was created by
the entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Gore cites his long involvement with high-tech issues
and tills the grassroots soil for like-minded community activists,
Bush reaches out to such leading technology industry figures such
as Dell and Kvamme, who act as both his financial backers and
informal advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is a much newer figure on the political scene,
so for many months he has been trying to organize key leaders,''
noted Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology
Association of America. While Miller identifies himself as a
Democrat, he says he is pleased with the positions that both the
candidates have taken on key high-tech issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of technology executives are in the Bush
camp,'' said William Coleman III, a founder and chief executive of
BEA Systems, a software firm based in San Jose, Calif. Coleman also
participates in the 350-member ``Bush for President High-Tech
Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, the Gore campaign sought to gather up as
many high-tech business leaders of its own as possible, asking them
to sign a joint letter of support for the Democratic candidate. The
letter is due to be released Monday to coincide with a Silicon
Valley Gore fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supporters already include such chief executives as Eric
Schmidt of Novell, Steve Jobs of Apple Computer and Meg Whitman of
eBay.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Gore often links technology issues to such broader
themes as the need ``to help American workers beat the foreign
competition to 10 million new high-tech jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   A blurb on the Gore Web site says: ``From early in his
congressional career, Al Gore has focused on the potential of the
information technology age. Al Gore has worked to connect every
classroom in America to the Internet, promoted privacy on-line,
advocated faster Internet connections and he has become a prime
advocate for the development of the Next Generation Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also favors targeted tax cuts aimed at increasing
investment in high-tech research and development, open markets in
cyberspace and better educational opportunities for young people
that would make them fit to assume their place in the ``work force
of tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice the vice president recognizes that high-tech creates
high-paying jobs,'' said Tom Stohler, director of work force policy
for the American Electronics Association. ``But,'' he added, ``it
would take a massive restructuring in the education system and a
tremendous investment in training. We don't have the people to fill
those jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also often uses a wide economic lens to examine the items
that matter most to technology mavens. He stresses his support for
a permanent ban on Internet taxation and the need to offer more
corporate tax credits to enhance technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic platform is silent on the Internet tax,'' says
Tucker Eskew, a senior communications adviser for the Bush campaign
who specializes in technology issues. ``And we view that as our
opponent's lack of commitment to coming down against new taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't delved deeply into high-tech at all,'' counters
Dagoberto Vega, a Gore campaign spokesman, referring to Bush's
views. ``They have not addressed any of the 'digital divide'
issues, such as connecting those in disadvantaged areas to the
information highway.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, has made educational reform a centerpiece of his
campaign, stressing the need to achieve ``the promise of high
standards and accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   To further his goal of ``encouraging continued growth of the New
Economy'' and ensuring that ``all Americans share in its
benefits,'' Bush would dramatically raise the cap of H-1B immigrant
visas; reduce frivolous lawsuits imposed on high-tech companies and
small businesses; strengthen math and science curricula while
creating community technology centers, and provide ``assistive''
technology to the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may not think of education as a high-tech issue, but it is
the most important issue to high-tech companies,'' said Toni Casey,
the mayor of Los Altos Hills, Calif., who also serves as a
consultant to several Internet firms.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the candidates, however, has had much to say about
such high-tech-related issues as intellectual property and Internet
copyright law, which has triggered strong judicial pressure against
the Napster music distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   David Foote, the managing partner of an information technology
compensation and workforce research firm in New Canaan, Conn., also
notes that both campaigns have ignored what some industry figures
see as a pressing need for Congress to reform employment-related
labor and tax laws ``that haven't fundamentally (been) changed in
four decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Foote: That's very disturbing (because) these laws will
choke our nation's attempts to field an Information Age work force
to meet the enormous challenges of the New Economy and maintain
America's competitiveness globally.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here's a rundown on how the Democratic and
Republican presidential candidates stand on key high-tech issues:
</P>
<P>
   Internet taxation: Both Al Gore and George W. Bush favor
extending the current moratorium. But Bush, citing the problems of
trying to collect sales tax from millions of customers in thousands
of jurisdictions, would make the ban permanent, while Gore favors
an keeping it place ``for at least two more years.'' Gore also
would pursue an international accord making cyberspace ``a
permanent duty-free zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Online privacy: Bush is highly sensitive to privacy concerns,
employing a policy that the campaign will use data provided by
visitors to his campaign Web site only if they ``opt in.'' But many
Republicans in Congress favor allowing business to regulate itself,
which federal regulators argue won't work. Gore often stresses the
need for Internet privacy as part of his broader consumer-oriented
message.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech foreign policy: After a long delay, the Clinton
administration aggressively scaled back export controls, a policy
stance for which Gore takes some credit. Bush distances himself
from both old Cold War hawks and intelligence figures in government
who argue that less regulation carries more security risks. Both
candidates would take further steps to combat piracy of American
ideas and intellectual property and promote the development of
internationally compatible standards for e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   H-1B visas: Both Bush and Gore favor increasing the number of
visas for high skilled foreign workers, which many business leaders
feel are needed to keep U.S. companies from falling behind the rest
of the world in the technology race. But organized labor, a vital
Democrat constituency, opposes any increases.
</P>
<P>
   Tort Reform: Gore is politically tied to the trial lawyers
community, which opposes any changes in current laws, citing the
need to protect the rights of wronged consumer litigants. However,
Gore's running mate, Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut has broken
with party regulars to support for securities litigation reform. As
Texas governor, Bush compiled a strong record on this issue, which
concerns many high-tech entrepreneurs, and can be expected to press
for major reforms as president.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent R&AMP;D tax credits: They are supported strongly by Bush,
by most congressional Republicans and by such ``New Democrats'' as
Lieberman. But a President Gore would likely encounter strong
opposition from tradition-bound Democrats in Congress, who have
blocked all such legislation for research and development subsidies
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Government information reform: Bush favors naming a
government-wide chief information officer and providing a $100
million fund to support interagency information sharing and
electronic procurement initiatives. Gore's vice presidential
``re-inventing government'' effort did not include those
initiatives.

with party regulars to support for securities litigation reform. As
Texas governor, Bush compiled a strong record on this issue, which
concerns many high-tech entrepreneurs, and can be expected to press
for major reforms as president.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent R&AMP;D tax credits: They are supported strongly by Bush,
by most congressional Republicans and by such ``New Democrats'' as
Lieberman. But a President Gore would likely encounter strong
opposition from tradition-bound Democrats in Congress, who have
blocked all such legislation for research and development subsidies
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Government information reform: Bush favors naming a
government-wide chief information officer and providing a $100
million fund to support interagency information sharing and
electronic procurement initiatives. Gore's vice presidential
``re-inventing government'' effort did not include those
initiatives.

&HT;     A GOOD SEASON TO THINK ABOUT YOUR FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Getting up and deciding that you're going to
keep the same job you had yesterday is a career decision. Sure, it
might not feel like one because there is no drum roll or blare of
internal trumpets, but if you don't appreciate that you have a
crucial choice in your hands each morning, you might as well be a
lemming.
</P>
<P>
   For the next year at least, change your mental ``default''
position. Instead of automatically staying in your job unless you
can find a good reason to leave, plan to quit your job unless you
can find a good reason to stay. If you're talented and willing to
learn, this job market is too good for you to keep rotting away.
</P>
<P>
   People rarely get into miserable careers because of one stupid
decision, like not going to college or calling a boss a fool or
having an affair with the boss. Usually it's because they make the
same stupid ``little'' decision to go to the same job each day,
even though the job gets a little worse and their options get a
little more limited as each month passes.
</P>
<P>
   This might be the best time of year to quit your job, because
your internal procrastinator could well be in hibernation. Wait a
couple of months and you're close to Thanksgiving and Christmas,
and who wants to be job hunting during the holidays? Summer is out,
because you want to take a family vacation, and spring gets tough
because you're already thinking about the family vacation, and
either a new job or unemployment could spoil those plans.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you could do it after the first of the year, but your
internal procrastinator will gladly point out that the groundhog
just might see his shadow on Feb. 2, and that would lead to six
more weeks of winter. And who wants to be out pounding the street
looking for work when it's so damp and cold, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   So get moving now, before all those falling leaves block your
path.
</P>
<P>
   If you've already made the same little decision 10,000 times or
so in your career, finding the exit door can be so intimidating
that it feels impossible. We were brought up learning that careers
had a logical progression, and that you could have a great career
if you found a quality company and stuck with it.
</P>
<P>
   And if you did change jobs, it was part of a logical
progression, too. You landed a promotion or found a more
prestigious company or got a big raise _ sometimes all of the
above. Leaving wasn't all that tough of a decision.
</P>
<P>
   But now it is. Many careers don't offer the kinds of
opportunities they used to, and sometimes the only way you can get
ahead is to make a leap of faith. You might have to change careers
or at least tweak yours, and often that forces you to settle
temporarily for less pay or longer hours or a less prestigious
company.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, too, people are so overwhelmed that they never have
any time to hunt for a job. If you're in that situation and don't
see any logical way out, you might have to make the ultimate leap
of faith: Quit without having anything else lined up.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that sounds incredibly scary. But it's probably not nearly
as scary as you think it is, especially in this market.

&HT;     OLYMPICS COMMMITTEE TO SEEK DAMAGES FROM MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The U.S. Olympic Committee has dropped its
attempt to scrap a magazine's ``Olympics USA'' issue after being
assured the publication is scheduled to be removed from store
shelves on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But a USOC lawyer said Wednesday the committee still plans to
seek damages for violation of its exclusive rights over Olympic
terminology and symbols.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher of the magazine called the lawsuit an
unconstitutional interference with freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
   The 76-page magazine was published last month by American Media
Inc., which also publishes the National Enquirer, Globe and Star
tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Committee said the magazine's repeated use of the
word ``Olympics,'' along with stylized depictions of the Olympic
torch and medals, violated the trademarks granted to the committee
by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   American Media Inc. said the law does not _ and, under the First
Amendment, could not _ apply to journalistic coverage of the
Olympic Games, which begin Friday in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   At a federal court hearing Wednesday in Oakland, the publisher's
lawyer, Roger Myers, displayed the latest Newsweek cover and an
Olympics section of the New York Times, both of which featured
Olympics words and symbols. He said his client's publication, which
contains a disclaimer of any Olympic sponsorship or official
connection, is no different from more established media and is
equally protected from USOC interference.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong seemed unpersuaded.
</P>
<P>
   In the Newsweek and Times editions, she said, ``it's very clear
what the origin of the publication is.'' Although the name ``AMI
Specials'' appears in a corner of the magazine cover, Armstrong
said, the ``Olympics USA'' inscription and photos of athletes are
much larger, giving the USOC a ``legitimate concern'' that it will
be mistaken for an official publication.
</P>
<P>
   USOC lawyer Jeffrey Benz insisted the Olympic Committee was not
trying to interfere with news reporting, only commercial
exploitation of the names and symbols the committee licenses for
revenue to support the U.S. Olympic team. However, Benz withdrew
the request for a restraining order against distribution of the
magazine after Myers said virtually all copies would be taken off
the shelves by Friday, as previously scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Benz said the committee would continue with its damage suit for
trademark violation. The suit contends the magazine harmed the USOC
economically by cheapening its trademarks and encouraging others to
use the names and symbols without paying for them.

   EVERETT, WASH. _ George W. Bush was overshadowed again Wednesday
morning, not by the fast-fading ``RATS'' brouhaha, but by a thick
bank of fog hanging over the Skykomish River, where he came to
deliver a speech on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign's news management techniques were much more
successful, however, and the candidate mostly escaped the shadow.
Bush's staff delayed his speech for an hour, during which time the
fog cleared enough to make the backdrop greenery visible, rescuing
the day's chief photo-op. And after Bush was done speaking, they
didn't set him free to make any message-burying statements to the
press.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the Pacific Northwest is ``in play'' in the
election makes the campaign much more varied and picturesque than
it would be otherwise. In the battleground states of the Midwest,
the presidential candidates harp endlessly on mundane issues like
jobs, the economy, education, and health care _ at schools, union
halls, and American Legion posts. In Florida, they debate Social
Security and Medicare at retirement homes and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington and Oregon, presidential candidates argue
about fish in front of gorgeous vistas. It makes for a nice change.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush has portrayed himself as a moderate, ``different
kind of Republican'' on many issues, he takes an uncompromisingly
conservative, pro-industry line on the environmental issues of the
Northwest such as salmon preservation, logging, and the expansion
of national parkland by the Clinton administration, which he
opposes. But Bush also tries to make himself out to be a
tree-hugger while he does this. Dressed in a regionally appropriate
fleece jacket, he told an audience of 100 supporters gathered at a
cattle farm that he loves to fish and that he wants an environment
``as pristine as it can possibly be.''
</P>
<P>
   But the main point he made in his speech was that he is
unalterably opposed to the idea of breaching the dams along the
Snake and Columbia Rivers. This scheme, which many
environmentalists favor, would allow endangered species of salmon
to swim upstream again but deny the region low-cost hydroelectric
power and flood acres of farmland. Bush tried to smoke out his
opponent on the issue, which Gore has so far ducked, by saying he
wants to hold a ``Salmon Summit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's alternative plan for saving salmon was supposed to be
exemplified by the farm he was visiting. According to the governor,
it is the site of a voluntary, cooperative effort to restore salmon
runs. Bush noted that salmon had returned to the stretch of river
after several decades of absence thanks to efforts to breed them on
a pond on the property (with the help of $300,000 in state and
federal money). To Bush, this illustrates a larger theme of his
campaign: that he trusts the people more than he trusts rats _ I
mean bureaucrats _ to do what's best for the environment, just as
he trusts the people and not ``Washington'' to figure out how to
spend their tax money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you own your own land, every day is Earth Day,'' he said,
repeating a favorite line.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting separately with a smaller group of people involved in
salmon restoration, Bush told a personal story to underscore this
point. He described being visited on the 900-acre ranch he recently
purchased outside Crawford, Texas, where he is now building a
house.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bush, a federal official came to tell him that
golden-cheeked warblers, an endangered species, might nest in cedar
trees on the edges of his property. Bush said the bird had not yet
been spotted on his property, but that he ``agreed [not to chop
down the cedar trees] after listening to the man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand what it means to sort of cross the bounds of
trust between landowners and the government,'' Bush added. I
believe he meant establish bonds of trust between landowners and
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the idea that environmental protection can simply
be a matter of voluntary compliance falls short of reality. One of
the best illustrations of this comes from Texas, where Bush's
voluntary plan to reduce emissions from industrial plants that
predate the Clean Air Act has yielded singularly unimpressive
results.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Texas's abysmal environmental record overall is an
illustration of why voluntarism doesn't work without the help of
regulation. But for Bush, opposition to environmental laws appears
to be a rare matter of ideological conviction.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of Bush's speech, the sky was clear enough that you
could see across the river. It was a gorgeous view, marred somewhat
by a gravel- and sand-mining operation on the opposite bank _ the
property, no doubt, of someone for whom every day is Earth Day.

 (One B&AMP;W image of the symbol for the Sydney Olympics is
available.) 
 By DAVID EWING DUNCAN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    If U.S. athletes bring home gold from the Sydney Olympics, a lot
of the credit may be owed to the accelerating presence of high
technology, which is radically remaking the Games that just a few
years ago were proudly amateur and lacking in the gee-whiz science
that can shave seconds off event times.
 &HT;    ``Technology is reshaping most sports,'' says Lance Williams,
program administrator at the United States Olympic Committee's $2.2
million, state-of-the-art sports science division.
 &HT;    Employing more than 25 people to assist 45 U.S. teams, the
division's biomechanists, physiologists, engineers and
psychologists are augmented by dozens of tech-smart specialists on
individual teams and at such equipment makers as Nike, Adidas, and
GT Bicycles.
 &HT;    Critics contend that technology's cutting edge is fast
overtaking the human edge in creating stellar performances. But
coaches, officials and sports scientists insist that old-fashioned
talent and grit remain the most important ingredients.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SLIP SLIDING AWAY
 &HT;    
 &HT;    When U.S. breaststroker Ed Moses flings himself into the
cornflower-blue water of the Sydney International Aquatic Center,
the only skin showing will be on his face and below his elbows and
knees.
 &HT;    Looking like a sleek Teletubby in his Teflon-coated, formfitting
bodysuit, Moses will glide through water with greater efficiency
and more speed than did former Olympians clad in skimpier suits.
 &HT;    His Adidas-made supersuit is designed to put pressure on
appropriate spots on the body to maintain proper technique. The
tight-fitting fabric around his biceps and thighs reduces muscle
vibration, and hence fatigue.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    IT'S IN THE BAG
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Olympian boxer David Jackson's punch power is measured using an
instrumented heavy bag, exclusive to the U.S. team, which looks
like a normal punching bag. Except engineers at the USOC workshop
in Colorado Springs have embedded a PVC pipe inside running the
length of the bag.
 &HT;    It houses a device called an accelerometer, a three-inch wafer
of circuitry and wires that translates the pounding of a jab or a
hook into schematics displayed on a computer screen.
 &HT;    Videotape shot while the boxer bashes the souped-up bag is run
on the same screen in tandem with numbers and graphics, a
juxtaposition that allows coach and athlete to critique the
athlete's punch effectiveness _ his stance, arm motion and
attitude.
 &HT;    ``I think the boxers are getting stronger and better because of
this bag,'' says David Lubs, director of programs for the U.S.
boxing team.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    PIERCING THE WIND
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Come September in the down-under world of Sydney, the air blows
with ferocity, averaging 24 miles per hour. At nearby Homebush Bay,
where archers will compete, winds frequently gust up to 50 mph.
Such force can play havoc with a slender shaft zipping along at
more than 130 mph toward a target 230 feet away.
 &HT;    ``Oh, baby, the wind was impressive,'' says Don Rabska, a former
archer and the coach of movie-star archer Geena Davis, who competed
in an Olympic test tournament in Sydney a year ago.
 &HT;    ``On one of the practice days, when I was standing with Geena, I
was literally blown off the line. It was howling!''
 &HT;    To help the arrows fly true, U.S. archers will be using weeny
one-fifth-inch diameter shafts weighted in the front with
heavier-than-steel tungsten points.
 &HT;    Manufactured by Easton Archery of Salt Lake City, Utah, the X-10
arrows are made from the latest aluminum-carbon hybrid, with
slippery carbon-graphite coatings that help reduce drag.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    STRAIGHT SHOT
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Last January Olympic shooter Bob Foth was off his usual mark
while firing his .22 caliber rifle in the prone position. To find
out why, he visited engineer Tim Conrad at the U.S. Olympics Center
in Colorado Springs. Conrad clipped a tiny 120-gram diode laser to
the bottom of Foth's weapon.
 &HT;    As Conrad demonstrates, when the weapon is fired, a laser beams
along the exact trajectory of the bullet as it zings at 750 miles
per hour to the target, situated 50 meters (165 feet) away. The
beam is concentrated to strike at the bullet's exact point of
impact.
 &HT;    The laser is used concurrently with videotape to check shooters'
aim before and during a shot and how much they sway while pulling
the trigger. Heart monitors strapped to the gunners' chests also
measure the impact of pulse rates on accuracy.
 &HT;    For optimal results, shooters must remain as still as a stone
while firing; one minute of arc can make the crucial difference
between a gold medal and no medal at all.
 &HT;    For Foth, a three-time Olympian, the lasers revealed that his
stance, pulse rate and gun harness were fine. The trouble was that
his ammunition was firing slightly off: ``Using good ammo, he
improved,'' Conrad says.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I'M GONNA LEARN HOW TO FLY
 &HT;    
 &HT;    For the pole vault, biomechanists are testing the bend and
verticality of poles in an effort to further thwart gravity. They
videotape vaulters and use the tape to build computer models that
analyze the bend and motion of poles and the style and placement of
the athletes in order to help heave humans ever higher.
 &HT;    The garb worn by track-and-field athletes has undergone some
radical remodeling to enhance performance. When Florence Griffith
Joyner broke the world record for the 100-meter dash, her body was
moving at close to 22 miles per hour. But her legs whipped back and
forth at up to 50 mph.
 &HT;    ``The legs are in a different airflow environment, so we are
focusing on making the legs more aerodynamic,'' says USOC
biomechanist Jeff Broker.
 &HT;    This year in Sydney some runners and jumpers will be wearing
special bodysuits by Nike that will cut down on the wind resistance
of skin against air, with the possibility of improving times by
valuable fractions of seconds, depending on the competition.
 &HT;    To cut times in sprint and hurdle events, athletes' shoes have
been pared away so that they now amount to lightweight ``socks with
spikes attached,'' according to triple-jump coach Dick Booth.
 &HT;    At Sydney, his jumpers plan to use another innovation:
ultralight spikes made of ceramics rather than metal that help
launch athletes off the rubber tracks more easily and efficiently.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN
 &HT;    
 &HT;    At the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, cyclists with teardrop-shaped
helmets and ultratight bodysuits rode machines only vaguely
resembling anything hitherto called a bicycle.
 &HT;    As if tiny front wheels, ultralight Kevlar frames, and almost
paper-thin chain casings and tubes were not enough, engineers of
the SuperBike also placed the handlebars so radically far forward
that cyclists crouched with buttocks high in the air, thus reducing
wind resistance and cutting some times by several seconds.
 &HT;    The SuperBike stirred an uproar _ few teams could afford its
high price _ and the Union Cycliste Internationale, the sport's
governing body, banned it from competition.
 &HT;    In Sydney, the old bicycle or something very close to it is
back. According to the UCI's regulations, cycles must have a
diamond-shaped frame, equal-sized wheels, and handlebars closer to
the oldfangled, upright position.
 &HT;    Many U.S. Olympians will be riding GT's new SuperBike III (the
1996 SuperBike was actually number two in the series), a machine
that pushes the UCI regulations to the max. Although it looks like
the older ``bike,'' it has a more aerodynamic frame and silk tires
pumped to 250 pounds pressure per square inch.
 &HT;    U.S. cyclists also will be wearing improved suits with the seams
sewn out of the airflow to reduce friction. The
slipperier-than-skin suits may cut times by as much as one to three
seconds.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    STICKING TO YOUR OARS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    To train Olympic eight-person rowing crews, scientists mounted a
plastic box the size of a paperback book and weighing just 1.4
pounds right behind the coxswain's seat.
 &HT;    As muscles strain and water spews in a spray from the ends of
the oars, the box pings a signal that relays sensor-collected data
through a small antenna to a fancy laptop on the coach's boat.
 &HT;    Attached to the oars and their mechanisms, the sensors help
create a biomechanical profile of each crew member's contribution
to the boat's speed and acceleration.
 &HT;    ``We are looking for force, power, curve and synchronicity,''
says USOC biomechanist Jeff Broker.
 &HT;    The sensors assess each oar's force and angle, producing charts
that reveal who is pulling more than the others.

US GYMNASTICS COACH PETER KORMANN HAS THE SPIRIT OF '76 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The house on Elm Street was their screening room, their place to
study, to dream. In the grainy, scratchy, and often-choppy visions
that would come to life on the living room wall in Braintree,
Mass., through the miracle of Super 8mm film, the four friends
would take apart the tumbles and vaults of the world's best
gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and the Soviet Union were the powers of the day. Peter
Kormann and his childhood pals knew every athlete by name, envied
their every move, rolled the 8mm frames to and fro until they could
copy every twist and turn of their routines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere you walked in that house, there were little pieces
of film,'' said Kormann. ``There was nothing like it. We had a
splicing machine and we'd chop the film up to pieces and watch
these guys, day in, day out. We wanted to be the best. We had quite
the study group. I only wish I'd spent that much time on my school
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 44 years old, Kormann is the head coach of the USA men's
Olympic gymnastics squad. His days of cinematic home study are some
30 years behind him, but he is as immersed in the sport today as he
was before and during his years at Braintree High School.
</P>
<P>
   In the Summer Games of '76, inside the Montreal Forum, the
20-year-old Kormann surprised the world when he won a bronze medal
in floor exercise, the first American male to win an Olympic
gymnastics medal since 1932. For the near quarter-century since, he
has not stopped tumbling, although he suspects Sydney will mark the
conclusion of his tour as the head of the men's program with USA
Gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is it for me. My term is up here,'' said Kormann,
just before his squad folded its Olympic training camp in San Diego
and headed to Sydney. ``Maybe I'll go run a gymnastics club.
Ultimately, my goal would be to get back to Massachusetts, but
we'll see where all this leads. Right now, my whole focus is on the
Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   There is focus, and then there is Kormann focus, nothing short
of riveting when it comes to gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one,'' said longtime pal Kent Anderson, ``loves the sport
like Peter.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, now a veterinarian in rural Orwell, Vt., helped
introduce Kormann to the sport in the mid-1960s when they were
school friends in Braintree. Kormann remembers it as somewhat of
accidental introduction. The boys were awaiting a ride after
swimming lessons at the YMCA. Rather than sit on the sidewalk, they
wandered upstairs to the Y's gymnasium, where instructor Jimmy Hutt
was watching over the pommel horse, rings, and parallel bars.
Anderson was the one who pushed the door open and found the gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really knew what gymnastics was,'' said Kormann. ``And
there was this guy (Hutt) standing there, and he says to us, `Hey,
you want to try this, try that? Come over here, try this.' I just
remember doing a handstand on the floor. That was it. If our
parents had been on time to pick us up, who knows, maybe we never
would have done gymnastics.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutt, who owns and operates a Lakeville, Mass. gymnastics club,
the Gym Hutt, remembers the day the two walked into his gym. It was
not an epiphany. He wasn't aware that a future Olympic medalist had
entered the room. Music didn't play. A ray of sunshine wasn't cast
on Kormann's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't work that way,'' said Hutt. ``I wish it did, but I
can tell you, it doesn't. Peter was one of those rare kids who had
a natural ability _ the ability, right away, to know where he was
when he was upside-down.''
</P>
<P>
   What eventually separated Kormann from a billion and one other
tumblers and vaulters, said Hutt, was an obsessive work ethic. From
that brief introduction in the YMCA gym, Kormann took off down a
path of total, if not addictive, dedication to his sport. Roughly
10 years later, from that standing start in the Quincy (Mass.)
YMCA, Kormann was standing at the top of Olympus, bronze draped
around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of success in gymnastics has something to do with a
burning desire to do something that's crazy,'' said Hutt, who
considers himself the first in a long line of Braintree gymnasts.
``But it's hard work that gets everything done. Peter had it in
him. He wanted it _ really, really bad. And he was willing to work
for it. Hey, there's a lot of people out here with talent. The
problem is, most people sit on it and don't do anything with it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kormann wasn't a sitter. In fact, all of Mary and Marty
Kormann's kids seemed born to tumble. Sitting in her living room
recently, Mary Kormann looked out onto Middle Street, laughing as
she recalled the astonished looks on the faces of passersby when
they happened to glance toward the house's large picture window.
</P>
<P>
   ``From out there,'' said Mary, ``all they could see was sets of
feet going by the window in here. It would be Peter and the other
kids walking on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   By Mary's account, Peter instantly became hooked, ``totally
addicted,'' to the sport. His closest pals all loved it, too. There
were the Ellis brothers, Dave and Rich, over on Elm Street, where
the charter school of gymnastics cinematogrpahy eventually would be
formed. Anderson was just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the four of them ate, drank and, in the rare instance
that fatigue set in, slept the sport. The Ellis brothers _ Dave
some eight years older than Kormann _ built a backyard gymnasium on
Ellis Street. Kormann did the same behind his house. Eventually,
the gymnastics coach at Braintree High, Joe Schuhwerk, retired the
school's old pommel horse, allowing Kormann to make it a carry-home
claimer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pommels on it were gone,'' said Schuhwerk, recently
retired as the school' athletic director. ``It was an old beast.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about 4 a.m., recalled Marty Kormann, that he tied that
old pommel horse to the back of the family station wagon and
steered it through Braintree Square. Peter stood with it in back,
making certain it wouldn't tip when they rounded a corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went by a cop in the Square,'' said Marty, an ex-Marine,
``and he didn't know what the hell to think.''
</P>
<P>
   All through his high school years, Kormann, along with his three
close friends, made gymnastics the core holding of his life. Dave
Ellis, an accomplished gymnast at Springfield College, took the
boys to countless meets around the country. They traveled to Penn
State. They traveled to Illinois. Dave would get summer jobs at
sports camps, teaching gymnastics, and Kormann, Anderson, and
brother Rick always came along as junior counselors/freeloaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never had to pay,'' said Dave Ellis, who now runs the
Ellis School of Gymnastics in Braintree. ``All of us had a love for
it. It was just a fun, very innocent time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dave Ellis was in the stands at Montreal when Kormann won the
bronze. He says he still gets goosebumps when he thinks of the
``the skinny little kid from Braintree'' standing up on the medal
platform, shoulder to shoulder with Russia's Nikolai Andrianov and
Vladimir Marchenko.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost unbelievable,'' said Ellis. ``Here's a kid from
our hometown, standing there with those guys. I mean, you can't
dream that dream.''
</P>
<P>
   A celebration immediately followed. Kormann and his teammates
headed out on the streets of Montreal. By the time he got back to
the Olympic village, the gates were locked, the tragedy of Munich
four years before forever altering the free spirit surrounding the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, after all those trips to all those camps, Kormann,
the medal around his neck, bunked down in the back of Dave Ellis's
van and slept until the village reopened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome to be an Olympic medalist,'' said Kormann. ``I
mean, I don't think that much about it anymore, but for that period
of my life . . . I won the first medal for the United States in 44
years, so that was very special for all of us in gymnastics.''
</P>
<P>
   Kormann can't remember the exact whereabouts of the medal today
(``It's in limbo _ somewhere in the house,'' he said), but Steve
Randall, his pal from Southern Connecticut State can recall every
step of Kormann's floor routine in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Full in . . . double back,'' said Randall, who now runs the
Maine Academy of Gymnastics in Westbrook, Maine. ``How could I
forget? I used to watch him every day in college. And with each
move, I was in the stands, thinking, `Stick! Stick! Stick!' A
straddle `L' . . . press handstand . . . `Stick! Stick! Stick!'
What a performance.''

<P>
   Randall made his way to Montreal by car, with legendary Southern
Conn. and Olympic coach Abie Grossfeld at the wheel. In 1973,
Kormann was hoping to go to gymnastic powerhouse Penn State out of
Braintree High, but was dismissed out of hand by Penn State coach
Gene Wettstone. It was Schuhwerk, his high school coach, who
introduced Kormann to Grossfeld and Wettstone the same day,
following a meet at Southern Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abie was great,'' said Kormann. ``He said, `Yeah, we'd love to
have you on our team. We've got no scholarship, but we'd love to
have you.' And Gene, who's a great guy, he says to me, `Yeah, I saw
your scores and I don't think you're Penn State material. We don't
need a floor specialist.'''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Wettstone was the assistant coach on the
men's team when Kormann won the medal .
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great for me,'' said Kormann, refusing an opporutnity
to gloat. ``And I've got to say, during my college years, I always
had my best meets against Penn State.''
</P>
<P>
   Following his freshman year at Southern Conn., during the summer
of '74, Kormann went to Japan to study gymnastics. The Japanese had
powerful teams and Kormann had long studied the best performers at
the Ellis Home Theater. He wrote a blind letter to the College of
Physical Education in Japan, asking the gymnastics coach if he
could train with the nation's elite team in Tokyo over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him in the letter that I'd clean the gym, teach
English, whatever they wanted, I'd do it,'' said Kormann. ``He
wrote back and said I could come.''
</P>
<P>
   For four months, Kormann lived in a near-monastic gymnastics
bubble. A few members of the Japanese squad spoke bits of English,
but virtually all of his communicating for four months was done by
sign language on the gym floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``So four four months, there was nothing else for me to do but
gymnastics,'' said Kormann. ``I couldn't talk to anybody. Total
commitment there was mandatory. I loved every second of it.''
</P>
<P>
   His devotion in those days almost baffles Kormann now. He was so
intent on beginning his college workouts, he left for Southern
Conn. the day after his final class at Braintree High. His BHS
diploma arrived in the mail. The day he packed up for college, he
told his high school sweetheart (and now wife), Linda Nelligan,
``Linda, I'm busy, I won't have time to see you.'' They saw each
other only three times during their college years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't care about anything else in life,'' he said.
``At that time of my life, all I wanted to do was gymnastics. Of
course, I was proud to graduate from high school . . . but I was on
a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The task at hand now is Sydney. The Kormann mission now entails
trotting six Americans to the gym floor, hoping that at least one
of them can head for home with the feeling of accomplishment and
honor that he felt in '76.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be awesome to do it as a coach,'' he said. ``That
would be, in my opinion, more awesome than what happened in '76. To
be honest, I'd feel I worked harder for this. When you train as an
athlete, you just focus on yourself and you work hard and you know
what to do. But as a coach, there are so many variables, so many
things that have to get done. It's a constant process of coming up
with ways to get our guys better.''
</P>
<P>
   Up in Orwell, Vt., Anderson will be paying close attention.
Almost 35 years ago, he was the one who nudged the door open at the
YMCA, discovered the gym, and began the odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a cool thing we had in Braintree,'' said Anderson.
``Guys like Jimmy Hutt, Dave Ellis, Joe Schuhwerk, they took care
of us. We're all like family. Pete made the most of it. He had such
a passion. He threw tricks in high school that no one had ever
done. You need a talent for that, but you also need the hard work
and guts. Peter had all of that. More than anyone.''

Telegraph.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY ANNE APPLEBAUM &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   LONDON _ In Wales, a 62-year-old man died early this week while
waiting in a long line for gasoline. Doctors said afterward that he
had expired from ``stress and heat.'' Elsewhere in Britain, more
than a quarter of the nation's ``petrol stations'' ran dry after
panic-buying Monday; truck drivers blockaded most of the country's
major refineries Tuesday; protesters banged on Tony Blair's Jaguar
shouting ``shame on you;'' a rogue Texaco station in Derby was
found to be selling gas at more than $16 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, over in Brussels, more than 2,000 trucks, buses and
taxis were blocking the city center, with German, Dutch and Italian
drivers threatening to follow suit in their own cities.
</P>
<P>
   France, where protests have naturally been the most extreme, is
only now recovering from the trucker strikes of the last few weeks.
They joined with boat drivers to block the Seine and with taxi
drivers to choke off several cities. Along the Channel they
prevented access to ports and left tourists stranded for days.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the ``coming oil crisis,'' as the American media refer
to it, has already arrived over here in Europe, bringing with it a
wave of 1970s nostalgia: the gasoline lines, the specter of
inflation, the fond memories of the Carter administration (remember
those peanut cartoons?), the return to currency of old-fashioned
words like ``recession.''
</P>
<P>
   But before everyone gets all weepy and starts humming Bee Gees
tunes, it might be worth looking at how different, this time
around, the international impact of the apparently unstoppable rise
in oil prices is going to be. None of the villains is going to be
quite the same _ and none of the victims either.
</P>
<P>
   Look, for example, at the relatively understanding attitude
toward the Old Villains: If the Gulf Arabs were the prime focus of
angst and anger last time around, this time they won't be, or
anyway not to the same extent. It's a different OPEC we're dealing
with these days, post-Desert Storm: less dominant of the oil
market, more open (it even has a Web site), anxious not to hurt its
biggest buyers too much.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as last February, Saudi Arabia issued a joint
statement with U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, agreeing that
``price volatility in world oil markets is detrimental to both
producing and consuming nations'' and promising to ``avoid harming
the world economy.'' Nor is it so clear that high prices are its
fault, given that on Monday OPEC agreed to raise its output by
800,000 barrels a day _ and in response, unimpressed markets pushed
the price of crude up further.
</P>
<P>
   Neither are the Old Victims quite the same. High oil prices
remain big trouble for Japan and Western Europe, of course, but
while the last oil crisis notably altered the balance of power in
the Arab-Israeli conflict, it's hard to see how the current
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations will be affected. The questions
of, say, whether it is feasible to put an international border
between the mosque on the Temple Mount and the Wailing Wall just
below (yes, that's a real possibility) won't really be answered
differently if Saudi Arabia becomes even richer.
</P>
<P>
   But this time around, there are some New Victims too, most
notably in Eastern Europe. No longer propped up by subsidized
Soviet oil prices, all the newly emerging democracies, or whatever
you want to call them, are especially vulnerable, thanks to their
greater susceptibility to inflation and their near-total dependence
on Russia for oil. In the case of some, this might have big
political implications.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine, for example, already reliant on its larger neighbor for
most of its trade, will be made seriously destabilized by high oil
prices, thereby propelling the country further into Russia's
geopolitical embrace.
</P>
<P>
   As this week's events prove, New Villains are emerging too. In
Europe, virtually all the consumer anger and anxiety is focused,
this time around, not on the Arabs but on European governments;
consumer groups like Boycott the Pumps, which have been calling for
regular gas station boycotts since August are gaining ground, and
they are mostly blaming their own leadership for high fuel taxes
that are the real cause of high consumer fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Tax revolt is such a rare thing here that no one even knows
quite how to respond to it. Tony Blair tried to deflect the blame
onto OPEC, for example, but that only made things worse. He was
immediately caught out by editorialists and columnists who pointed
out that 80 percent of the retail fuel price in Britain is in fact
accounted for by taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Only the French government, so far, has bowed to what is
developing into one of the greatest European tax revolts of all
time: French truckers finally agreed to stop blocking the streets
only when the French government agreed to lower fuel taxes by 15
percent _ a deal worth about $2,000 per truck per year. Concessions
from others may follow, with concurrent damage to any plans
Europe's mostly left-wing governments may have had for
welfare-state expansion.
</P>
<P>
   There are also, this time around, New Victors, although that
distinction may be a dubious one. Russia, whose entire economy is
now propped up by oil, stands to gain in a big way _ but is this
really the best thing for the country? A long-term boom in oil
prices would allow President Vladimir Putin to put off reforms
indefinitely, would give him extra cash to pump into his tattered
army, would enable him, in other words, to keep on going as if
nothing had changed _ just as high oil prices enabled his Soviet
predecessors to go on as if nothing had changed in the 1970s _
thereby setting the stage for an even more dramatic collapse when
oil prices go down again.
</P>
<P>
   One can also imagine, if things get really bad, that high oil
prices could conceivably help Iraq. Sooner or later, someone may
well call for a lifting of sanctions, although a reliable source
tells me that Iraq isn't really in a position to start pumping huge
quantities of oil at the moment anyway. Years of investment would
be required-nothing would happen fast enough to change the current
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, sustained high prices could bring with them New Trouble
Spots To Watch. As a reliable source of international tension and
unrest, the Caspian Sea region may well turn out to be the new
Middle East. Already disturbed by the Chechen war, the
Armenian-Azeri conflict and a staggering array of weak governments,
the region could easily be plunged into political chaos by a rapid
and dirty race to develop the oil resources of the region.
</P>
<P>
   These are the sort of places no one would bother developing if
oil was $5 a barrel, the political risks being too high. But if
it's $35 _ and if it's going to stay $35 _ then it suddenly looks
interesting to compete, even _ especially _ for the Russians, not
to mention BP and Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   Not, again, that this will necessarily do the locals any good:
Following the Nigerian model of development can't be the best
medicine for regimes of dubious stability. Let's face it _ oil is a
curse for any country. Too bad we can't all use less of it.

CREATING KIDS WHO ARE HIP TO THE HYPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When advertising honchos gather inside the Grand Hyatt Hotel in
New York this week to bestow the third annual Golden Marble awards
for children's advertising (Best Breakfast Food Commercial, Best
Video Game Commercial, etc.), health-care professionals and
educators will be protesting outside.
</P>
<P>
   They argue there is no such thing as a good advertisement
pitched at a child.
</P>
<P>
   Their reasoning boils down to this: Children are unable to fend
off advertising, making them vulnerable to any marketing aimed at
them. Because so much is aimed at them, the cumulative message they
get is a warped one, that happiness comes from consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Children have been marketing targets since radio days, of
course, but the exposure for previous generations pales in
comparison to the doses our children get, says psychologist Susan
Linn, associate director of the Media Center at the Judge Baker
Children's Center, which is spearheading the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why, she says: Corporations spend $2 billion a year on
print and TV ads aimed at children, 20 times more than 10 years
ago. What's more, she says, that figure swells to $12 billion when
you add in sales promotions and product placement in movies and TV,
as well as increasingly popular in-school advertising. In a report
released earlier this week, the Federal Trade Commission concluded
that Hollywood media systematically target children in advertising
and marketing even when the products in question contain parental
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   From a marketing perspective, aiming ads at children is smart
business. Not only do they spend $8 billion of their own money each
year, but they also weigh in heavily on what their parents buy:
Estimates of children's purchasing influence range from $130-$500
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of many psychologists, aiming ads at
children is unethical.
</P>
<P>
   ``What parents need to know is that the sheer amount of
advertising children are exposed to is emotionally harmful, above
and beyond the impact of any single ad or product or whether the
product is good or bad,'' says psychologist Allen Kanner of
Berkeley, Calif., who studies the impact of advertising on
children. He is calling for the American Psychological Association
to censure psychologists who advise companies on how to market to
children, and is particularly appalled that even babies aren't
off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that companies gear ads to baby viewers per se, but
that they tie products to baby and toddler programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your 15-month-old watches `Teletubbies.' She gets a warm
feeling from it. When she sees the toy, she gets excited: It's
familiar, it's secure,'' says early childhood educator Diane Levin
of Wheelock College, a coorganizer with Linn.
</P>
<P>
   If the toy has a logo on it (and what toy doesn't these days?)
and the logo is shown on the screen, the baby makes the connection.
Voila: ``Brand loyalty even in a 15-month-old because he associates
that familiar logo with that warm, happy feeling,'' says Levin.
</P>
<P>
   It's precisely for that warm feeling that big companies like
Ford advertise in Sports Illustrated for Children. An 8-year-old
can't buy a car, but he can nag dad to buy a Ford, says media
researcher David Walsh. (Indeed, advertisers commonly rate ads on
the ``nag factor,'' the extent to which an ad motivates children to
pester parents.) Meanwhile, by the time a child can buy a car, Ford
feels as safe and comfortable to him as the baby toy did.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that most young children can't tell the
difference between commercials and programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take it all at face value,'' says educator and filmmaker
Jean Kilbourne, whose documentary on advertising, ``Killing Us
Softly,'' is shown around the world.
</P>
<P>
   When a toy that looks giant-size and magical on TV turns out to
be small and boring in real life, it never occurs to a 3-year-old
that there's something wrong with the toy; he doesn't have the
cognitive skills to form that thought. Here's what he's more likely
to think, says Levin:
</P>
<P>
   `` `On TV, kids playing with this toy were happy, so if I'm not
happy, too, there must be something wrong with me.' '' When the
next toy is no better, she says, he moves on to the next and the
next.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does this set up consumerism as a positive value, but
it also equates it to happiness and success in a child's mind, says
Linn. A typical 3- to 6-year-old might conclude, for instance, ``I
won't play with you because you don't have that wrestling toy, and
that means we won't have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   As children become older and increasingly anxious to fit in with
peers, advertisers not only feed into insecurities but help create
them, says Kanner, on the faculty at Wright Institute in Berkeley.
One ad that particularly riles him is for Corona beer. He saw it
air in California during Saturday morning cartoons, when viewers
are typically younger than 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows two teens dressed in bikinis carrying a bucket of ice
and beer down the beach to a group of other happy-looking teens.
The message, even to little kids, is clear,'' he says: `` `This is
how to be cool when you grow up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For a child in a have-not family, the constant drumbeat of
consume, consume can fuel inadequacies as well as resentment of his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertising drives a wedge between parent and child without
parents even realizing it,'' says Walsh. He is president of the
National Institute on Media and the Family, a nonprofit group that
looks at media's effect on children, and author of ``Selling Out
America's Children'' (Fairview Press).
</P>
<P>
   Levin says the wedge first gets lodged in the preschool years:
``A 4-year-old looks at an ad for a toy and says, `This is a toy,
toys are for kids, I want this.' '' When parents say no, she says,
``a child can't see the distinction between a good toy and a bad
one. All she sees is, `You're a mean parent: Can't you see this is
a toy, and toys are for kids?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most disturbing marketing trend is the proliferation
of advertisements in schools. Kilbourne says fiscally strapped
districts are increasingly taking money and equipment from
corporations like Pepsi or Coca-Cola in exchange for ads on school
buses, scoreboards, or book covers, or for exclusive rights to put
soda machines in hallways. So far, about 8 million children are
affected.
</P>
<P>
   For Kilbourne, this is unconscionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``School is a place for learning, for facts,'' she says. ``An ad
on school property legitimizes the product in a way nothing else
can, making the ad's claim true.'' Kilbourne wrote ``Deadly
Persuasion, Why Women and Girls Must Fight the Addictive Power of
Advertising'' (Free Press).
</P>
<P>
   With the trend obviously toward more advertising, Walsh hopes
protests like the one in New York will raise public awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Linn says the group's goal is for a White House conference on
the dangers of marketing to children, as well as legislation to ban
ads for products known to be harmful to children. Kilbourne says
other countries, including Belgium, Norway, and Denmark, outlaw
radio and TV advertisements aimed at children.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who don't want to wait for legislation, there
are steps we can take at home to insulate our children against
advertising messages, beginning by not leaving the room when
commercials come on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay and analyze it, even with a 3- or 4-year-old,'' says
Levin.
</P>
<P>
   Start by defining advertising for her. For instance: ``Do you
know what the job of a commercial is? It's to get us to buy
something that isn't as special as the ad makes it seem or that we
don't really need, even though the ad makes us think we do. Ads use
clever tricks, so the fun is to figure out the trick each ad has.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity endorsements have a lot of power for 5- to
8-year-olds. Ask, ``Do you know why Nike has Michael Jordan wear
their sneakers? Because they want you to think that if you buy
them, you'll play like him. Isn't that silly?'' Be sure to say that
celebrities are paid to make a commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are some good ads for good products out there, and
it's fine to acknowledge them when you see them, says Kanner. But
over all, he says, ``The message of consume, consume, is behind
them all. That's what adds up as the over-riding message.''

MASTER CHEF FOR SISTER'S WEDDING EATS HIS CAKE, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes recipes)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE YONAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was up to my ears in corn. Shucking, plunging, boiling,
scraping. Kernels were flying everywhere, and water foamed over the
pots.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I had hours to go before I would be through, I was
already worried about how to get this borrowed kitchen, now flecked
from top to bottom with corn and corn juice, back into condition by
the time its owner came home from work.
</P>
<P>
   The next day was my sister Rebekah's home-grown Maine wedding,
and my gift to her was the food, including a white
chocolate-pistachio wedding cake, for 60 guests. No caterer here.
Twenty-four hours later, the feast would be a success, but not
without glitches, not without help, and not without plenty of
lessons learned for a first-timer like myself.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling off a meal for 60 people requires an extraordinary level
of planning, plenty of advance work, the assistance of as many
skilled friends as you can find, and the flexibility to roll with
the punches when things don't go as planned. Believe me, they
won't.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the wedding, in a borrowed kitchen, as I
struggled alone with 45 ears, stripping them with my cook's knife,
soaking every towel and mitt in sight, and dotting the kitchen with
yellow, the first lesson hit me like corn flying off the cob: Do as
much in advance as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Why hadn't I done all this corn ahead of time, over several
days, freezing the kernels as I went? It would've made much
smoother going on this particular dish, individual corn flans with
a tomato-corn relish. I could have even mixed the custards in
advance. That way, when I left wedding-prep central at my sister's
house in North Berwick, Maine, where my friends were working on
recipes I had left them, I wouldn't be gone long. Instead, I blew
most of the day, alone and covered with corn.
</P>
<P>
   I should've followed the example I had set for myself with the
cake, a creation I designed using recipes adapted from the
Cambridge School of Culinary Arts, from which I graduated last
year. Following Rose Levy Beranbaum's invaluable advice from ``The
Cake Bible,'' I had frozen the layers weeks earlier, so all that
was left was the frosting, assembly, and decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson two: Choose recipes carefully. Take into account not only
taste and presentation but ease of preparation and service. That
means testing the recipes to familiarize yourself with the steps,
then remembering that what is easy for four isn't necessarily easy
for 60.
</P>
<P>
   This one I had down. For such a do-it-yourself wedding in
mid-August, outside a tiny house, I knew I wanted dishes with bold
summer flavors, bright colors, and few ingredients, most of which
would come out of the garden or chicken coop right on the property.
I settled on a collection of recipes gathered from Gourmet
magazine, Boston Globe food pages, Paula Wolfert's ``Mediterranean
Greens and Grains,'' and the recesses of my mind. The lineup: an
appetizer table of smoked fish, cheese, cumin-dried tomatoes, and a
celery Nicoise salad, and a dinner of cold cucumber and avocado
soup, rosemary-grilled chicken, corn flans, Tuscan kale with garlic
and white beans, potato and green bean salad with blue cheese, and
Asian beet salad.
</P>
<P>
   The chickens, raised by the bride and groom, could be cooked on
a large cement-block grill in the outdoor kitchen set up by my
future brother-in-law, Peter Kellman, and almost everything else
could be served cold. After the appetizers, we'd sit for the soup
course; the remainder of the dinner would be buffet-style.
</P>
<P>
   Advance recipe testing proved crucial. Before I settled on the
corn flans, for instance, I wanted to know if they were sturdy
enough to be moved from a serving platter to a plate without
falling apart. I also made sure the flans and the soup could be
held for a day or so without losing flavor or, in the case of the
beautiful light-green soup, without changing color to a
less-appetizing shade.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson three: Get help from experienced friends, and then be
nice to them. Stephen Powell and Edouard Fontenot were my
workhorses. They've worked in catering and at restaurants, and
Stephen was professionally trained at Anne Willan's La Varenne
cooking school. That meant, for example, that he instinctively knew
to ``French'' the green beans, or cut them on an angle, without any
direction from me. And when Edouard was arranging the smoked fish
on a plate, he naturally had a basket of herbs and flowers at the
ready. He beautifully fanned out the pieces of fish and garnished
them with nasturtiums.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson four: When things go wrong, don't be afraid to take
charge, but ask for input and be flexible.
</P>
<P>
   While we were scrambling, one of my friends discovered there
were no small plates for appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slice more bread, and put out more napkins,'' I said. The
guests didn't notice a thing. They ate right off the platters or
put the tomatoes, fish, and cheese on pieces of bread.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson five: Try to enjoy yourself. If possible, arrange for
others to be in charge of such things as table settings and
cleanup. As the proud brother of the bride, I wanted to make sure
that, after the food was finished, I could take my place at the
table and eat, drink, and celebrate with family and friends. That
meant depending on another sister, Teri, to handle such crucial
elements as the table decorations, menu cards, buffet setup, and
cake cutting, and letting others haul away dirty dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if the feast is a success (which this was), it's nice
to be sitting when the bride and groom toast your efforts and the
satisfied guests break into applause (which they did).
</P>

 FALL-BLOOMING ANEMONES CAN MAKE ANY GARDENER LOOK LIKE A PRO.  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fall-blooming anemones are little-known garden treasures of the
season that are ripe for discovery by a broader audience. Though
some of these rare and beautiful flowers are finicky, others are so
easy to grow that they bestow the illusion of green-thumb genius to
the gardener clever enough to employ them.
</P>
<P>
   All of autumn's anemones are eye-catching conversation pieces.
Vita Sackville-West, who created the famous Sissinghurst Garden in
England, called them ``a queer reminder of spring'' and she was
right. These flowers do suggest the delicacy of spring flowers in
both form and color.
</P>
<P>
   There are 70 species of anemones (pronouced uh-nem-oh-nees), but
for the home gardener's purposes, there are three general
categories.
</P>
<P>
   Florist's anemones are those sophisticated, wicked-looking
blooms beloved by French impressionists for their stunningly
saturated blue or red petals and soot-black centers, often haloed
with rings of white. They are best purchased as cut flowers, as
they grow poorly here except in greenhouses.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are many species of petite spring woodland anemones.
Most are white, unassuming charmers, though I would recommend the
little blue wood anemone, A. nemerosa var. robinsoniana, which can
be ordered now through some bulb catalogs (such as Scheepers,
860-567-0838).
</P>
<P>
   Then there's our autumn surprise, the dramatic fall anemones now
blooming in local gardens. Their cup-like flowers are mostly dusty
shades of pink and seldom larger than 2 inches. But floating 2 to 4
feet above their clumps of sturdy foliage on slender stalks, they
are both dainty and awesome, like a ballerina dressed in pink
making athletic leaps above the garden stage.
</P>
<P>
   Autumn anemones effortlessly maintain their height without
staking, while dahlias and asters crash down around them or stand
gracelessly tied to supports. The freshness, poise, and airiness of
fall anemones can make them look like visitors, a bit out of place
among the coarser giants of the fall garden. The dusty pink flowers
can clash with the warm colors of mums and fall foliage, though
they look good with purple foliage plants such as smokebush,
cimicifuga, or Euphorbia dulcis Chameleon, and especially the
popular new Rupatorium rugosum Chocolate, a maroon-leaved selection
of our local wild Joe-Pye weed.
</P>
<P>
   I think they look best growing in a bed by themselves, as do
Sensation Mix cosmos, which they superficially resemble, at least
in the way that diamonds resemble zircons.
</P>
<P>
   When they are happy, fall anemones are perennials that rise
effortlessly. In fact, garden writers in England and the Pacific
Northwest are always complaining about their invasive tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, winter mortality rates are high among the hybrids
most commonly sold in catalogs and local nurseries. There are some
wild types that have the toughness to thrive in our climate,
however, and they are the plants to start with.
</P>
<P>
   The grape leaf anemone from Nepal has three to four flowers on
strong scapes about 2 feet above the foliage. The plants are
stoloniferous and even spread out into my lawn, where they get
either mowed or dug up and given away. My spreading clump looks
wonderful in bloom and yields many flowers for cutting. It goes by
two names, Anemone vitifolia, which refers to grape leaf-like
foliage, or Anemone tomentosa, which refers to the wooliness of the
attractive buds and winter seedheads. The only name you need to
know, though, is Robustissima, the selected form that's sold in
nurseries. Its leaves are lobed instead of divided like other fall
anemones.
</P>
<P>
   I grow Robustissima in its own half-shady bed behind the garage,
where it thrives on neglect and indeed offers a surprise on the
route to the compost pile.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McGowan of Blue Meadow Farm, an exceptional nursery in
Monteque Center in the Connecticut River Valley, says Robustissima
is the only fall anemone that survives his winters.
</P>
<P>
   The other great naturalizer in the family is Anemone hupehensis
September Charm, which has larger pink flowers but is just as
tough.
</P>
<P>
   Both bloom in August and September, which means their flowering
is not cut short by October frosts, as happens almost every year
with the later-blooming hybrid garden anemones. They also survive
transplanting and division better than the more common Anemone x
hybrida.
</P>
<P>
   Hybrid anemones are often called Japanese anemones, though
they're a cross between Anemone vitifolia, introduced to England
from Nepal about 1829, and Anemone hupehensis, originally from the
Chinese provence of Hupeh. The later plant was sent from Shanghai,
where it was found flowering in cemeteries in November, to the
Royal Horticultural Society in 1844 by famed plant explorer Robert
Fortune.
</P>
<P>
   I've grown several of these and they have survived many years
but not thrived here. The plants are not much bigger than when I
bought them 10 years ago. The varieties with multiple rows of
petals are messy looking and especially to be avoided. I agree with
early-20th-century British horticulturalist E. A. Bowles, who
wrote, ``There's a charm in the simple form of a single anemone
that goes straight to my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The one anemone x hybrida that is inarguably worth trying, and
which has done well for me, is the single white-flowered garden
hybrid called Honorine Jobert. This great plant originated in a
French nursery in Verdun-sur-Meuse in the 1850s, when one
root-branch of the common pink hybrid produced large stunning white
flowers. It was quickly detached and propagated under the name of
the nurseryman's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Honorine Jobert is a very tall plant with ramrod-straight,
4-foot stalks with clouds of furry round buds that open into 2-inch
white flowers. The petals are not dry and papery like those of most
fall flowers, but instead fleshy like magnolias or tulips, and
there's something about the way they capture light that makes them
glow.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their height, they don't require staking, though they
may lean a bit to one side. After the slow start typical of all
fall anemones, my single Honorine Jobert survived a relocation, and
spread through off-sets into a large clump.
</P>
<P>
   White goes with everything and Honorine Jobert is such a queenly
presence in any border where she thrives that she transforms sunny
mums, stolid sedums, towering purple Joe-Pye-weed, and crashing
asters into her courtiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a new one called Andrea Atkinson, which is a lovely
white that looks like Honorine Jobert except that the center is a
bright orange yellow. I'm impressed with it,'' says Tracey of Avant
Gardens (508-998-8819) ``I like the single white ones.''

FOR STATUS-SEEKERS, BOWLING IS SPORT OF THE MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Bowling can be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   That is the vague subliminal message sent by the stern security
guards who search belongings and send clients through a metal
detector at the Asteroid Bowling Club, one of the hot spots driving
Moscow's bowling craze.
</P>
<P>
   Danger is not the only message. Bowling, it turns out, can also
be luxurious, glamorous and sexy, a favorite pastime not only of
guys with ``Larry'' stitched in red cursive letters on the breast
pockets of their denim shirts, but also of the rich, hip and
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   This is what is going on in Moscow, and across Russia, where
bowling alleys have become happening nightspots with postmodern
decor and an upscale atmosphere. Affluent Russian families bowl by
day, but after business hours, executives, politicians, and
celebrities stay up all night, drinking expensive cocktails to the
roar of high-speed dance music and the rumble of bowling balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a rather prestigious pastime,'' Karina Nikiferova,
general director of Asteroid, noting the tony nature of Russia's
tenpin trend as she sipped an espresso at the establishment's
well-appointed restaurant and bar, which features fine cognacs and
Cuban cigars, along with the bowler's traditional libation, beer.
</P>
<P>
   Prestigious, indeed. Prices for lane times at Asteroid, a
12-lane complex designed to look like a space shuttle rocketing
through luminescent galaxies, soar to almost $30 per hour. The
lanes have fully computerized scoring, and waiter service from the
restaurant. There are VIP rooms (``for bowlers who have important
meetings,'' Nikiferova said), and special events, including karaoke
nights and striptease bowling.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow Tax Police has its own tournament, , as do officers
of the Federal Security Service, the former KGB. Nikiferova has
recognized former and current Cabinet ministers, movie stars and
theater actors among her clients, as well as members of organized
crime gangs, whose presence helps explain both the metal detectors
and the club's no-photography rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people come here to relax who are incognito, or not
really legal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   No one can say for sure what made bowling boom in Moscow, which
had been home of only one bowling alley until 1997. Some of the
sport's aficionados in Moscow cite the huge popularity here that
year of Ethan and Joel Coen's film ``The Big Lebowski,'' in which
the main characters (guys with their names stitched in red cursive
letters on their shirts) do and say darkly funny things while
spending much of their time at the lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Others credit the Moscow city government, which pushed to have
bowling included as an exhibition sport at the 1998 World Youth
Games in the Russian capital. In any case, soon alleys, sporting
Brunswick automatic pin-setters and AMF balls, shoes and other
equipment from the United States, were opening ``like mushrooms
after a rainstorm,'' as Alexander Yefimov, manager of the swank
Bi-Ba-Bo complex in central Moscow, put it.
</P>
<P>
   Bi-Ba-Bo, derived from Beer-Bar-Bowling, has bowling until 5
a.m., a nightclub atmosphere, and usually, a waiting list to get a
lane. Other bowling alleys have 24-hour saunas, jacuzzis,
discotheques and casinos to go along with the pool tables and
coin-operated games. Hourly rates can run as high as $45, which
tends to whittle the client base to the privileged few in a country
where many people do not make that much in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Even middle-class Russians cannot really afford to bowl. Gleb,
who makes $500 a month repairing cars, brought some out-of-town
friends to Sport Line Bowling, where day rates are $30 hours per
lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show them a good time,'' said Gleb, who said he
was ``embarrassed'' to give his last name. ``But we can't come here
often.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian bowlers do not mind their sport's unlikely image as
pastime for the rich and famous. But they would like to attract
more people like Gleb.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task of the federation is to show that bowling is for
everyone, that this sport is not only for the rich,'' Sergei
Lisytsin, president of Russia's four-year-old bowling federation,
said in a recent issue of Bowling Sport, a glossy trade magazine
devoted to the ``bowlingification of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowling Sport reports that 67 bowling facilities have opened
across Russia, including a complex on Sakhalin Island in Russia's
Pacific Far East that offers free bowling for students from 12 to 2
p.m. (wonder how that affects class attendance?).
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can say with certainty that all of Russia is bowling,''
the magazine declared. Russia now sends a men's and women's team to
international competitions, and will host the 2001 European Cup
individual championship; Bowling Sport runs the ratings of Russia's
top 30 men and women bowlers, along with tips for amateurs on how
to improve their scores. (``Synchronization is the main component
of success.'')
</P>
<P>
   Tournaments have hooked some Russians who otherwise would not be
able to afford the cost, like Vasily Syrtsov, 20, who starting out
bowling a year ago when friends invited him out, but recently has
begun playing for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to earn a living doing this,'' he said as he
practiced at the Sport Line Bowling Club in central Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Oleg Turok, commercial director at a Moscow factory,
made frequent calls on his cell phone as he puffed on a cigarillo
and downed cups of espresso brought to him by smartly clad
waitresses. Turok has been playing for about 10 months, and just
learned how to throw the ball with the hook that pros use. He said
he still bowls for pleasure, but the prospect of making money has
occurred to him.
</P>
<P>
   Nikiferova of Asteroid Bowling Club says professional Russian
bowlers can earn up to $25,000 a year, although her club attracts
dozens of competitors at amateur tournaments that offer prizes of
as little as $300. The level of competition is high in Moscow:
Nikiferova, whose best score is 187, says she dares not enter. But
the farther from the capital one travels, the easier it is for
accomplished bowlers to clean up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I travel a lot and play wherever I go,'' said Vasiliy Ryabov,
29, a director of a Moscow telecommunications company, who has
bowled in Rostov and Krasnodar in southern Russia, and in
Vladivostok in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they don't know how to play and I always go away the
champion,'' he said.

SUMMER GAMES STAFF ALERT TO TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Eric Rudolph is presumably dead or still cowering in
the dense forests of North Carolina, but the suspected Atlanta
bomber continues to haunt the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   When the 2000 Summer Games begin with Friday's opening
ceremonies, a small army of men, women, dogs and machines will be
on high alert to protect the Olympics and preserve Australia's
terrorist-free reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Southern Hemisphere's Fort Knox,'' Olympic
spokeswoman Elsie Hasting said during a tour of Olympic Park, the
Games' main venue. ``Nothing will move around here without security
people being aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities expressed confidence they can keep the Games free
from a repeat of the bloody 1972 siege by Palestinian terrorists in
Munich. They say they are also prepared to counteract more than 100
other nightmare scenarios, such as the use of ``biological,
chemical or radiological'' weapons, the pirating of ocean liners,
or the purposeful crash of a hijacked jet.
</P>
<P>
   Added to that list in recent days are possible clashes with
anti-globalization protesters en route from Melbourne, where they
staged three days of demonstrations at the Asia Pacific Economic
Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ryan, police commissioner for the state of New South Wales
and head of Games security, promised that security teams would deal
`'very, very firmly'' with demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have applied the most sophisticated security approach to
these Olympic Games ever,'' Ryan told reporters earlier this month.
``We have done all we can humanly possible to ensure there is a
trouble-free Games,''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Ryan and other officials acknowledged that a lone
bomber _ particularly one who chooses a target near but not within
the Olympic venues, as happened in Atlanta _ poses a potentially
unstoppable threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real danger will come, rather than from some huge,
well-financed, well-resourced terrorist group ... but from the
individual nutter making a bomb in the basement or garage,'' Graham
Richardson, who oversees the Olympic Village, told a news
conference. ``That would be the kind of thing a police department
would find almost impossible to prepare against.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say they aren't trying.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic organizers have mounted what they call the largest
security operation in Australian peacetime history. At the top of
the security pyramid is Joint Task Force Gold, consisting of 1,000
elite army commandos, navy divers, a Black Hawk helicopter squadron
and other military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Olympic security force includes nearly 5,000
state police, 4,500 civilian security guards, 4,000 army troops,
3,500 fire and emergency service personnel, up to 3,500 volunteers,
and a pack of bomb-sniffing labradors. So many police have been
called in that three dozen police stations in New South Wales will
be effectively closed during the Games.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster the response to any security threats, Australia's
Parliament last week gave the military broad powers to help police
combat civil unrest. Military involvement in domestic affairs had
been limited to national emergencies such as direct threats to the
government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to general security, special precautions will be
taken to protect about 60 VIPs, including heads of state, sports
ministers, and royalty expected at the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The main Olympic precinct, the 1,877-acre site at Homebush Bay,
underwent a painstaking search before being sealed off Sept. 1.
Since then, access has been limited to people with proper
accreditation, all of whom must undergo vehicle and bag searches as
well as inspections with metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   The same treatment awaits the estimated 500,000 people expected
to converge here daily during the Games, which last through Oct. 1.
Even the movements of most staff and volunteers will be limited to
specific areas of the site.
</P>
<P>
   Public concern about security has increased recently in the wake
of several well-publicized incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In May, police arrested a man with a Nazi fixation after finding
explosive materials in his home near the Olympic site. Some of the
materials were similar to those used in the 1995 Oklahoma City
bombing that killed 168 people.
</P>
<P>
   Then last month, New Zealand police said they had evidence of a
plot by Afghan refugees to blow up a nuclear research reactor in
Sydney; Australian authorities said an investigation determined
there was ``no credible threat.''
</P>
<P>
   International police and security agencies have been helping
Australia prepare for the Games, and US agents are on hand from the
Secret Service and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Matthews, a special agent in the FBI's Salt Lake City
bureau, said the FBI agents will be acting both as observers and
liaisons with Australian authorities. Salt Lake City will be home
to the 2002 Winter Games, and Matthews said the FBI is focusing on
preventative measures for large-scale terrorism and violent acts by
``lone wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You do the best you can to prepare against anything, but it is
the irrational individual acting on his own who is hardest to
prepare against,'' Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   That was allegedly the case four years ago in Atlanta, where a
pipe-bomb explosion in Centennial Park killed one woman and injured
more than 100 others. Federal authorities are still searching for
Rudolph, who in early 1998 disappeared into North Carolina's
rugged, half-million-acre Nantahala National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The only other Olympic-related terror act, and the only one on
Olympic grounds, was the 1972 hostage-taking by eight Palestinians
that caused the deaths of 11 Israelis. A stainless-steel panel
inscribed with the names of the slain Israelis has been installed
on a light tower outside the Olympic Stadium. Extra security has
been devoted to the Israeli Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading up to the Olympics, security officials
have focused on expected protests by Aborigines, indigenous
Australians who have suffered two centuries of persecution.
Aboriginal leaders have been seeking a government apology for a
now-defunct policy of removing indigenous children from their
families to be raised in institutions or by whites.
</P>
<P>
   The government's refusal to apologize had prompted some
Aborigines to suggest disruptive uprisings during the Olympics, but
in recent weeks Aboriginal leaders have been unanimous in urging
loud but peaceful demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Protest leaders at the Asia Pacific Economic Summit have said
they plan to join Aborigines in demonstrating at the opening
ceremonies, but it is not clear whether disruptions are planned.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the security mix, there is one non-human concern:
sharks in Sydney Harbor, site of the swimming portion of the
triathalon. Prompted more by media alarms than actual danger _
death by asteroid is statistically as likely as a fatal shark
attack in the harbor _ six divers equipped with electrical prods
will patrol the waters during the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Under the broadest definition of security, Olympic organizers
say they have ordered 100,000 condoms for free distribution in the
Olympic Village, which will house about 15,000 athletes and coaches
for the two-week Games.
</P>
<P>
   Other than staging the competitions, security is the biggest
remaining challenge for Olympic organizers who are eager to prove
their competence after years of often-farcical missteps.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven years since Sydney won its bid to host the Games,
organizers have stumbled into embarrassments over ticket
distribution schemes, medal designs, and nepotism in the choice of
torch-bearers. Then there were repeated cost overruns, a dispute
over the inclusion of foreign youths in marching bands at the
opening ceremonies, and seemingly endless reminders of the
influence-peddling scandal that led to the resignation or expulsion
of 10 members of the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a certain amount of Olympic fatigue even
before the first race is run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to avoid it like the plague,'' said Michael Hays,
20, a scaffold builder on his lunch break at Sydney's Manly Beach.
``They don't even have surfing in the Olympics, and that's what
it's all about here.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all are quite so cynical.
</P>
<P>
   George Eldred, 63, a retired executive who lives two miles from
Olympic Park, said he attended the 1956 Games in Melbourne, ``every
event, for 13 pounds, nine shillings.'' Tickets for Sydney's
opening ceremonies range from $70 to $900.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been seven years of build-up, and the excitement wore off
for a time,'' Eldred said, ``but now we can't wait for the world to
come to Australia.''

SUMMER GAMES WILL BEAT THE GRIPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Welcome to the 2000 Olympics, where the unofficial
motto (in one of the two official languages) is ``Plus ca change,
plus c'est la meme chose,'' which basically means, if you take the
Olympics, you take 'em, warts and all.
</P>
<P>
   As near as I can tell, much of the griping that punctuated the
1996 Olympics in Atlanta has resumed here. Drugs remain an Olympic
nightmare. Security is a major, major concern. And transportation
is dicey, at best, amid reports that the bus system is a colossal
disaster waiting to happen. ``ORGANIZERS OWN UP TO BUNGLING ON
BUSES'' blared the Sydney Morning Herald. It all sounds so
familiar. Many of the bus drivers have to be imported from
far-flung regions of the country. They barely know their way
around. They have been promised things that aren't being delivered.
Food, for example. ``The reality is that if this doesn't improve,
the drivers will simply leave,'' harrumphed Tony Sheldon, a
Transport Workers Official.
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee itself cannot stay out of
the news. Arrogance, pomposity, an innate sense of entitlement and
sheer shamelessness continue to characterize the governing body of
the Olympics, which is fond of referring to its members as the
``Olympic family.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, apparently, nothing the IOC won't do for one of the
clan. One of the ongoing sagas making daily headlines is that of
IOC member Mohamad ``Bob'' Hasan, who languishes in an Indonesian
jail, charged with defrauding the state of $75.5 million. Perhaps
you recall the horrendous fires emanating from the destruction of
Indonesian rain forests a few years back. Indonesian authorities
maintain that companies controlled by Hasan were the culprits.
</P>
<P>
   But since Hasan is a member of the IOC family, president Juan
Antonio Samaranch has been lobbying to have Hasan sprung from jail
in order that he might come to Sydney for the Games. Nor does it
stop there. Monday's Morning Herald headlined thusly: ``ENTRY BAR
LOWERED FOR GAMES CROOKS.'' According to the paper, ``In the spirit
of agreement with the IOC to facilitate the entry of Games
visitors, the Government has given visas to between 20 and 40
people who on character grounds would have been routinely barred.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch can't understand why anyone should be put off by this.
Is he not, he reasons, the equivalent of a head of state?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the matter of venues. Some are good; some are not
so good. The headline-maker in the Wednesday newspapers was the
rowing venue. The Sydney International Regatta Centre was
constructed in the Penrith Lakes, some 70 kilometers west of the
city, at a cost of $36 million (Australian). Now we learn that it's
as if someone had come up with the bright idea to stage an Olympic
event on top of Mount Washington. According to the Daily Telegraph,
``Team managers from 48 countries will meet (Wednesday) and are set
to place on the agenda the horrific (wind) conditions that are
forcing crews to cancel training sessions and Wednesday night led
to a two-time world champion (Italian Carlo Mornati) labelling the
situation a `joke.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, it seems, is that it is actually late, late winter
here. It can get very, very windy. Traditionally, the winds in
question blow in August. According to the Sydney Bureau of
Meteorology, they are blowing a month late this year. Perhaps his
Excellency, Mr. Samaranch, can appeal to the Almighty.
</P>
<P>
   The drug thing never goes away. In the matter of drug masking
vs. drug testing, take the former and the points, every time. In
this matter, at least, one IOC official seems to have his head on
straight. According to IOC executive Jacque Rogge it is
``preposterous'' and ``naive'' to believe these Games will be free
from drug cheats. So expect a fair share of drug headlines,
although it's doubtful there will be anything to match the Atlanta
soap opera that was Michelle Smith de Bruin.
</P>
<P>
   The American public, we are told, is not remotely prepared for
these Olympics, which are up against professional and college
football and the climax of the baseball campaign. You folks are not
hanging around the proverbial water coolers worrying about whether
the ``Pocket Hercules'' (real name, Naim Suleymanoglu) can win a
fourth gold in weightlifting, or whether Aleksandr Karelin will
extend his 13-year undefeated streak in the 130 kilogram class in
Greco-Roman wrestling. I understand that.
</P>
<P>
   For it is undeniably true that in order for any American to
embrace the Olympics, he or she must become interested in
world-famous people we've never heard of. And it is, quite frankly,
these people who make it fun. We can scoff at some of these sports,
but who are we to say that there is anything more intrinsically
noble about our meat-and-potatoes Big Four than there is in
hoisting three times your body weight or tossing 290-pound
opponents out of the ring? OK, maybe you've got to be there; I'll
grant you that. Well, I happen to be lucky enough to be here.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the deal: Yes, the Olympics are a huge business
affair, fraught with deceit and overkill. Yes, having the Olympics
in your city means a painful disruption of your daily life (e.g. a
complete street parking ban for the next two weeks in downtown
Sydney). Yes, there are all sorts of spoiled and pampered athletes,
not all of whom are multimillionaire American basketball players.
Yes, there will be scandalous judging decisions, dripping with
political implications.
</P>
<P>
   But yes, there are scores of athletes with stories that will
warm your heart. Yes, there are guaranteed to be upset stories that
will justify years of hard work and sacrifice. Yes, there will be
footwide grins on the faces of athletes marching into the stadium
at the Opening Ceremonies, because simply to be here is the
fulfillment of a true dream.
</P>
<P>
   All this will take place in one of the great cities in the
world, a spectacular place that is a combination of San Diego and
Chicago. That is to say, Sydney has San Diego's climate, mixed with
Chicago's level of buzz (as opposed to, say, New York's).
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics will never, ever be perfect. They are, after all,
organized and run by fallible human beings. But flawed as they are,
not to have them would be unthinkable. The good really does far
outweigh the bad.

WOMEN'S TEAM FEELS AT HOME ON GOLDEN ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE _ The last Olympic tournament _ the first _ was on
home soil, and it was incredible, they say. Last year's World Cup
was nothing but pressure, right up until Brandi Chastain made The
Kick. This time, all the US women's soccer team has to do is play a
few soccer matches halfway around the world in front of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Australia, it'll be relaxing,'' said forward Tiffeny
Milbrett, whose team will take on nemesis Norway in its Olympic
opener Thursday afternoon at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. ``We
won't have to worry about selling our game or selling tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Just defending its title will be work enough. Though the
Americans are still the clear favorites in the eight-team field,
their top rivals have closed a gap that was never that great to
begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Though the United States went undefeated at the 1996 Games,
virtually every match was a grinder. In last year's World Cup, the
Americans had to come from behind to beat both Nigeria and Germany
and played 120 scoreless minutes against the Chinese before winning
on penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they have a rugged draw (Norway, China, and Nigeria)
and an opener against the only team with a winning record (14-12-2)
against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They respect us, but they're not afraid of us. So they'll come
right after us,'' said forward Shannon MacMillan, who scored the
golden goal against the Norwegians that put her mates into the last
Olympic final.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians, who've shored up their roster around keeper
Bente Nordby, defender Gro Espeseth, midfielder Hege Riise, and
forward Marianne Pettersen since losing, 5-0, to China in the World
Cup semifinals, have defeated the United States three times in six
meetings this year, allowing only one goal in five of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already beaten the USA this year and we are
well-prepared for this tournament,'' said coach Per-Mathias Hogmo.
``The team has spent 60 days together this year. They're in good
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have spent nearly nine months together,
crisscrossing the globe while coach April Heinrichs reworked the
roster. Though most of the key faces are the same ones from last
summer's Rose Bowl victory pigpile, there will be a couple of
critical absentees from Thursday's starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Akers, the fierce holding midfielder who'd been with
the team literally since the creation 15 years ago, retired last
month after a decade-long battle with chronic fatigue syndrome,
multiple knee surgeries, and countless concussions. And keeper
Briana Scurry, who blocked the penalty kick that gave Chastain her
victory window in the Cup final, has been scratching for form after
missing most of the year with shin splints and probably will ride
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   That means Siri Mullinix, who wasn't one of the squad's top
three keepers last year, will be making her global debut in a
high-stakes match. Mullinix, a 22-year-old Carolina grad, is a
daring rover who'll roam from end line to the edge of the box and
beyond, looking to squelch danger before it develops.
</P>
<P>
   Defending, though, won't be the Americans' prime concern.
Scoring will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense can be back there stopping goals,'' said
MacMillan, ``but we've got to put the ball in the back of the
net.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Americans could sweep through the tournament
unbeaten, they could also go three-and-out in this top-heavy group
and they understand that.
</P>
<P>
   Enough of them _ Carla Overbeck, Joy Fawcett, Kristine Lilly,
and Mia Hamm _ have been around long enough that this could be
their last global tournament. So going home with only a stuffed
koala is unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we come out of this with a gold medal,'' said Milbrett, ``I
can guarantee you that most people who thought they were retiring
won't be retiring.''

MEMORIES OF THE LAST ENERGY CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oil prices are near a 10-year high. No one is sure there will be
enough heating oil this winter. The Europeans are rioting.
Politicians here are looking for someone to blame.
</P>
<P>
   It all brings back memories. We are old enough to remember the
days when the word ``energy'' was inevitably followed by the word
``crisis.'' In fact, we cut our teeth as business reporters in the
days of the energy crisis.
</P>
<P>
   We bring this up, not to wallow in nostalgia or to feel ancient
but to make a point. The energy crisis taught some valuable lessons
that are still applicable _ about how volatile markets can be,
about how difficult it is to predict the future, and about how
expensive it can be when you bet wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Set the ``wayback machine'' for 1973, Sherman. Following the
Arab-Israeli war that fall, the oil-rich countries of the Middle
East vented their anger at the United States by cutting back on oil
production. The price of a barrel of oil, which had hovered around
$3 for more than a decade, shot up to the unheard-of level of $10.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978-'79 the ouster of the Shah of Iran led to another oil
shortage and another spike in prices, this time to more than $30 a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Both oil shocks caused recessions. And the second one brought on
a gloom about the future that is hard to imagine in today's can-do
America. Part of that gloom was a belief, broadly accepted, that
higher oil prices were here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 Business Week announced we had entered ``the beginning
of the end of the petroleum age.'' The book ``Energy Future,'' a
well-respected work published the same year, came to a similar
conclusion. ``The days of easy and cheap oil are truly over,'' the
authors said.
</P>
<P>
   We bought into the pessimism too. In the early 1980s, we were
asked to write a story about the economics of the Seabrook nuclear
power plant, then under construction in New Hampshire. Seabrook was
planned to reduce our dependence on ``costly foreign oil.'' To
figure out if Seabrook was worth building, you had to have some
idea how expensive oil would be in the future.
</P>
<P>
   So we asked some experts for advice. They suggested we use two
scenarios to make our comparison: one with oil prices climbing
moderately _ 5 percent per year _ and a second with prices climbing
more steeply, at 10 percent per year. In both cases we used $30 a
barrel as the starting point. Under the first scenario, oil would
have reached $60 a barrel by the mid-1990s; in the second, it would
have topped $100 a barrel. Either way, Seabrook would have been a
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one problem: By the mid-1990s, oil sold for $18 a
barrel. Suffice to say we were a little off target.
</P>
<P>
   But we had plenty of company back then. Consider the fate of our
publisher. He launched a magazine about wood stoves, an industry he
was sure was going to catch fire as consumers scrambled to dump
their oil burners. Like the Internet enterpreneurs of today, he was
universally applauded as bold and far-sighted. The only question
was how rich he would become.
</P>
<P>
   The US government was in the same boat. It proposed spending $15
billion _ real money in those days _ to finance expensive projects
that would extract oil from shale and turn coal into gas.
Continental Illinois, then one of the nation's leading banks, put
40 percent of its loan portfolio into energy projects.
</P>
<P>
   Seabrook proved to be a bust, not a bargain. Our publisher's
magazine ultimately failed. The government threw in the towel after
wasting billions on so-called synthetic fuels. Continental Illinois
lost a bundle.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit was the same in each case: oil prices. They leveled
off in the early '80s, dropped sharply in the mid-1980s, and since
then have stayed pretty flat at around $18 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high oil prices of the '70s translated into lower demand
and they also spurred more oil production,'' said Joseph Stanislaw,
president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting
firm based in Cambridge. Throw in better technology, which made it
easier and cheaper to extract oil from the ground, and the
predicted oil shortages turned into gluts.
</P>
<P>
   Stanislaw expects the current mini-crisis to be short-lived. He
says that by spring oil prices should be significantly lower. We
have no reason to doubt him.
</P>
<P>
   But our experience during the energy crisis days taught us to be
wary of sweeping predictions. Will the Internet change everything?
Will the record companies all be put out of business by Napster? Is
the United States destined to leave its rivals in the dust in the
race to the economic future?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But maybe not. We're still waiting for the end of the
petroleum age.

 CANDACE BUSHNELL: DON'T CONFUSE MY LIFE WITH MY NOVELS 
</HEADLINE>

 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She's got a millionaire British boyfriend and a new book, yet
Candace Bushnell, author of ``Sex and the City,'' and now, ``4
Blondes,'' is annoyed because people keep mixing fact and fiction.
</P>
<P>
   They think, Bushnell complains, that she and that Carrie
Bradshaw character are the same person. They think she actually
chronicled real-life accounts of her friends' sex lives for her
columns in the New York Observer, which spawned the novel ``Sex and
the City,'' which led to the hit HBO series of the same name. And
they think a lot of what goes on during the show is a reflection of
her own struggles when she was a single woman in her 30s, living in
Manahattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't put other people's personal lives in the paper. People
told me stories about things that have happened to them. These are
kind of general stories. Sex and the City (the column) was really
fiction, OK?'' Bushnell, 41, says over lunch as a quick flush of
temper colors her high-boned cheeks. ``The stories would be quite
changed, and I always showed them the stories before they were
published. It's really fiction written as journalism. I want to
clear that up.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lecture does not end there.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really ignorant. And for some reason people don't
seem to be able to understand the concept of fiction anymore.'' Her
new novel _ ``4Blondes'' _ ``is completely fiction. I do get these
questions, `Oh, well, is this person so and so? Or who is this
person based on? They're fictional characters that came out of my
head! And that's it! I happen to be the kind of writer who, I
think, is a good enough writer so when you read it, it feels
real,'' she says, spearing an oyster with a tine. ``That's what an
artist does.''
</P>
<P>
   Bushnell continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't write about sex. And I don't write about the sex act.
It's not very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that the word popped up in the title of her column,
book, and TV show, and that explicit sex acts are detailed in ``4
Blondes,'' she demurs. ``I think the kind of sex that people have
informs the characters,'' Bushnell explains.
</P>
<P>
   One problem for this misconception, she observes, is that the
show ``Sex and the City'' features more sex than her writing ever
did. And some nights, she hopes that her parents at home in
Glastonbury, Conn., aren't tuned into HBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to push myself away from it in any way. I can't;
the show's part of my life,'' Bushnell says. ``The only thing
that's annoying to me, occasionally, is when people compare my book
to the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, she wants to point out that her first novel is not
about four single women in New York. It's about one: Her.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's bound to be more confusion if _ or when _
Universal Studios makes a film based on a vignette in ``4 Blondes''
that explores the life of a regular girl who marries a prince and
practically goes insane from the pressure and publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask if the character is based on Carolyn Bessette Kennedy
or Princess Diana. Fiction. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Don't ask &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And don't ask if Hollywood, where she's spending more time
lately, is filled with characters as seemingly shallow as the ones
she writes about in ``4 Blondes,'' including a vapid model who is
determined to sleep with men just so she can spend the summer at
their houses in the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it's human nature to put down what you don't know
and what makes you insecure,'' she says, bristling at the
suggestion that Los Angeles _ and some New York social circles _
are phony.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Bushnell, who proclaims she's starving, has her
entree of short ribs set before her.
</P>
<P>
   ``God. Like one rib?'' she huffs, her blue eyes directed at the
plate. (But in the end, she didn't finish the Lilliputian portion.)
</P>
<P>
   The conversation turns to her boyfriend, Stephen Morris, and how
he's handling the big kickoff of her two-month book tour and all
this talk about sex. Perhaps even theirs?
</P>
<P>
   ``His sex life isn't out there,'' Bushnell says irritably. ``So
that's not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris is the ex-boyfriend of her ex-best friend, Kate Bohnner,
an author and Bushnell's roommate for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Morris saga was chronicled on Page 6 of the New York Post,
which reported in June 1999 that Bohnner was ``devastated to learn
Candace was sleeping'' with him. Apparently, Bushnell and Morris,
then 34, broke the news to her over dinner. ``It was a real
ambush,'' one friend told the tabloid. ``And when Kate went to his
apartment to move her stuff out, Candace's stuff was already
hanging in the closet.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Bushnell said Bohner and Morris had been broken up
for five weeks before she made a play for him.
</P>
<P>
   Don't confuse any of this with the last vignette in ``4
Blondes,'' about a New York sex columnist who goes to England and
falls in love with a British businessman on the flight back.
Fiction.
</P>
<P>
   But in real life, Bushnell has also dated former Republican
Senator Al D'Amato, Penthouse heir Bob Guccione Jr., and Michael
Bergin, Bessette Kennedy's ex-boyfriend. However, she does confirm
that the ``Sex and the City'' character Mr. Big is based on the
relationship she had with Ron Galotti, one-time publisher of Vogue
who is now an executive at Talk.
</P>
<P>
   Bushnell says she's not sure if marriage with Morris in the
works. And besides, she explains, ``A lot of people say when you
get married, you trade one set of problems for another.''
</P>
<P>
   Would she sign a prenuptialagreement, the way TV character
Charlotte did on a recent episode?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I would,'' she says, ``just to protect myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But one gets the sense Bushnell can take care of herself just
fine. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scuffed Gucci years &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bushnell grew up in Glastonbury, a town she has dubbed
Glastonboring. It was, in her words, a place devoid of a movie
theater, where people (including herself) loved horses, and where
parents drank gin and tonics at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   For fun, she would write plays and have her two younger sisters
perform in them. After graduating from Glastonbury High School, she
attended Rice University for two years, then moved to New York,
where she enrolled in acting school and went to casting calls for
Coke or Burger King commercials. ``I hated it.''
</P>
<P>
   She also plunged into the social scene and was a regular at
Studio 54, where she did not have to wait in line behind a velvet
rope. ``Like, if you didn't get in right away, you wouldn't get in.
Which is always hard to explain to people from out of town, you
know? I mean there would be, like, 500 people outside the door.
You're like, `You're not. Gonna. Get. In. Go. Hooooome.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bushnell also started writing short interviews for Night, a
publication filled, she says, with pictures of her friends from
Studio 54. She was just 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents were like, you should get a job. I was a little
taken aback _ because I thought I could just write novels. My whole
life. But then you start writing for those women's magazines and
that's it. You can't make enough money to stop doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bushnell landed a job at Ladies' Home Journal. ``Believe it or
not,'' she says in an embarrassed, confessional tone.
</P>
<P>
   That lasted a year. She then jumped to Good House Keeping,
writing occasional ``blurbs,'' before becoming a staff writer at
Self covering health and beauty for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   But she found office work restrictive, and searched for
freelance opportunities, which led to writing about relationships
for Mademoiselle. (Next came the New York Observer, where she wrote
profiles, and then the column).
</P>
<P>
   Other assignments at Mademoiselle, she fondly recalls, included
pieces on migrant farm workers and homeless and runaway teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always wearing my beat-up Gucci shoes,'' she says, a
faraway look in her eyes. ``I'd be walking through fields . . .''
Asked if the Guccis were a sound footwear choice for such gritty
reporting, she doesn't skip a beat: ``They were pretty old and beat
up.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vintage Bushnell &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, Bushnell cut her teeth on her mother's Vogue
magazines and modeled in the punk scene when she moved to New York
in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   She may be a style maven, but she has nothing to do with the
fashions on the HBO show. ``They comb the city for vintage
things,'' Bushnell says, noting that she rarely wears other
people's used frocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a couple of months ago, I wore a Micheal Kors dress that I
bought 10 years go. And everyone was going vintage! Vintage Michael
Kors! I can't believe I would, like, in my lifetime, have my own
vintage clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kors is one of her favorite designers, although she's partial to
Italian fashion houses Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, Gucci, Versace, and Prada.
She's dressed head to toe in Versace, from her
button-all-the-way-down, cinched-at-the-waist dress _ graphically
striped like swirls of mocha and fudge soft-serve ice cream _ to
her caramel-colored shoes with dark heels. On her thin arm hangs a
burgundy Prada bowling bag, the most hyped designer accessory of
the season. Her perfectly tanned legs are bare. And her thong was
only faintly visible from the back.
</P>
<P>
   When she read Vogue as a young girl, she recalls, ``everyone
felt like, if you could wear those glamorous clothes, you could
have that glamorous life.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that she seemingly has both, Bushnell snaps back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasy isn't reality.''

FOOD SITE SEEKS PARTNER WITH GREENS 
</HEADLINE>

 By ALEX BEAM

<TEXT>
<P>
   What does Skip Gates have that New York Times food writer Molly
O'Neill wants? A deep-pocketed buyer for a special-interest Web
site that isn't really clicking.
</P>
<P>
   The Skipper (a.k.a. Harvard African-American studies impresario
Henry Louis Gates Jr.) managed to unload his africana.com Web
business onto Time-Warner earlier this month for a reported $10
million, even though, as he hilariously admitted, ``the revenue
model was slow to develop.'' Now the O'Neill site, trumpeted in
this space as a potential ``category-killing'' food site, is
looking for a partner, according to O'Neill's husband and business
partner Arthur Samuelson: ``We're trying to figure out how to
survive in an Internet-unfriendly world. We're involved in some
talks that could lead to a merger.''
</P>
<P>
   The O'Neill site, initially called At-table.com and then
redubbed Onebigtable.com never really got off the ground. The dream
of creating a soup-to-nuts ``multimedia encyclopedia'' proved to be
punitively expensive. Celebrity chefs, such as Julia Child or Anne
Willan, weren't interested in turning over electronic rights to
their work. The only real celebrity on the demo site is O'Neill,
author of the ``New York Cookbook'' and other best-selling food
books. At its peak, the company had 26 employees. The online
service Inside.com has reported two rounds of layoffs, bringing the
head count down to a skeleton crew of 6.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few deals Onebigtable did pull off was a partnership
with Amazon.com's new Kitchen web site, launched this summer. But
it is a deal that seems to favor only Amazon. The Kitchen site is
like an Internet roach motel: You can click in but you can't click
out. Amazon carries content from O'Neill's site, and from the
successful Brookline-based journal Cook's Illustrated. But the
Seattle-based Amazon provides no direct links to their partners'
own Web sites sites. ``I guess we cut a pretty good deal,'' one
Amazon executive told me.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Premature articulation?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Standards are important in journalism, and I intend to enforce
them. Which is why I have decided to mount a campaign of harassment
and intimidation against Sports Illustrated, until they agree to
publish a cover-length retraction of their March 27 cover story,
``Why the Red Sox Will Win the World Series.'' Most of its staff
has run off to Sydney, Australia _ Is something going on there? _
but they can't hide. Spokesman Joe Assad told me that a
cover-length retraction was ``unlikely,'' even though he let slip
that the March story was clearly erroneous. ``The prognostication
business is never an exact science,'' he said. ``The Red Sox were
in it until last weekend.'' He then tried to retract that last
statement, but that's not the retraction I'm looking for.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, I can look forward to telephoning the editors
of TV Guide, and asking them to explain their Sept. 2 cover story,
``Patriots Pride! Why New England Can Win This Year.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bring it on
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hate mail is pouring in from WGU _ Wellesley's Greatest
University _ reacting to Wednesday's brief, upbeat profile I wrote
about the college's only resident male student. Let the sputtering
begin. A senior: ``The language used was degrading and
disrespectful to the amazingly brilliant and intelligent women that
(sic) have come here for 125 years as well as their remarkable
achievements.'' A junior: ``You even managed to make a direct
sexist comment, saying _ to paraphrase _ that women don't have an
interest in weight equipment.'' A freshperson: ``You seem to be
painting my new home as some kind of brothel, and I find it rather
rude.'' A recurring theme: We're not lesbians! I don't recall
writing that the students were all lesbians, not that there would
be anything wrong with that.

LEXUS IS300 IS SNEAKY FAST ENOUGH TO SLIP INTO SEDAN CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The answer: 2001 Lexus IS300.
</P>
<P>
   The question: Is there a Toyota product that can appeal to
young, aggressive drivers for whom the Camry or the Echo just
aren't enough, image-wise and zippy-wise?
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Toyota will tell you they've been struggling to
come up with a car that will appeal to younger drivers. The Camry
is a fine car, but you don't find it tricked out the way you do
Honda Accords and Civics. The Echo doesn't seem to have created any
youthful buzz, and the ad campaign for this low-end Toyota is being
revamped in the shadow of highly successful ads for the Ford Focus,
which has youthful buzz all about it.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Lexus _ out of Toyota's luxury division _ is not a car
most 18-year-olds will be able to afford (at $30,000-plus), but
given the number of 25-40-somethings with good incomes in this
high-tech economy, the IS300 may be just the rig to challenge BMW,
Saab, and Audi in the compact sport sedan class.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great-looking car, from its gaping fascia, up over its
steeply sloped front, big windshield, solid roofline and down to
its short, chopped rear deck. It's downright Saablike.
</P>
<P>
   But if the outside says Sweden, the inside says Switzerland, as
in fine watches. Especially cool is the chronograph watch style of
the center gauge. Its circumference is toothed like a gear and
inside it sit the tachometer, speedometer, and smaller gauges for
temperature and fuel readings.
</P>
<P>
   And you get downright German with drilled aluminum pedals,
aluminum doorsills, and a sculpted aluminum shift knob. It's billed
as a five-passenger, but realistically, it will hold four adults.
</P>
<P>
   The leather front bucket seats on the test model were firm and
gripped especially well at the sides of the thighs and up the back
during hard cornering. A small steering wheel added that certain
race car feel that young drivers (and crazy older ones) seem to
crave.
</P>
<P>
   But looks, of course, won't fool many people who know what they
want in a sports sedan. You've got to show them performance.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Lexus has equipped the IS300 with an in-line six,
3.0-liter engine that delivers 215 horsepower. It's not as powerful
as the 300-horsepower plant introduced three years ago for the
GS400, but this is a smaller, lighter car, and this engine propels
it around just fine, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is a sneaky fast car. You stomp the gas, expecting
to hear some sign of surge: a roar, a burble, a guttural gush. You
get none of that. But then you look at the speedometer and realize
you have leaped forward and are rapidly gaining speed. The Lexus
engine is that quiet. So quiet, in fact, that you pick up tire
noise instead of engine sounds as you roll down the highway. In a
week of driving, the IS300 got about 21 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it comes only with an automatic, electronic, five-speed
transmission. It does a good job of shifting up _ for an automatic
_ as you accelerate. A manual option _ buttons on the steering
wheel a la Porsche _ lets you take over the shifting, but only to a
point. Use the manual option and try to run the car close to red
line and it won't let you. The automatic takes over and shifts up
for you. I hope they offer this with a good five-speed manual as
soon as they can come up with one.
</P>
<P>
   So how's it handle?
</P>
<P>
   Just the way a good sports sedan should.
</P>
<P>
   On the highway, it's nimble and firm, moving in and out of
traffic with a solid feel from the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   On corners, it flat out carves turns and there is virtually no
sense of weight being thrown around or body roll. That, no doubt,
owes to a sport-tuned suspension that has upper and lower control
arms, coil springs, and anti-roll bars front and rear.
</P>
<P>
   The price you pay, of course, is stiffness on rough roads, but
even here it's not a cowl-shudder tremor that ripples through the
cockpit as you get in some tight sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   It's got ABS operating four-wheel disc brakes that bring the
IS300 to confident, quick stops _ though I'd like a little more
feel from the brake pedal.
</P>
<P>
   Add that to the manual transmission I long for _ and there
again, you'd get more feel for the car _ and you'd have an almost
perfect compact sports sedan, something the folks at Toyota have
been striving for in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The tuck-and-roll look of the leather-coated dashboard. Hey,
it's a fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --They did such a great job designing that chronograph gauge
setup. Too bad they didn't encircle the dash knobs with the same
thing: geared real metal.

<TEXT>
<P>
   No hay muchos genios que hayan cambiado el mundo de manera tan
profunda, y hayan recibido tan poco reconocimiento como
Joseph-Nicephore Niepce.
</P>
<P>
   Muchos piensan que quien invento la fotografia fue otro frances,
Daguerre de alli la palabra daguerrotipo-- pero Daguerre obtuvo la
idea de Niepce.
</P>
<P>
   La camara de Niepce era una caja de madera en forma de cubo, de
unos 30 centimetros por lado. Su film constaba de placas de
hojalata recubiertas con asfalto, que se endurecian cuando eran
alcanzadas por la luz. Con ese aparato Niepce tomo las primeras
fotografias de que se tenga memoria, en 1824, desde una ventana de
una mansion en Borgona.
</P>
<P>
   Los resultados fueron de una gran nitidez. A traves de un patio,
detras de un palomar, puede verse un peral con una brecha en su
follaje.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aunque la placa fotografica estaba recubierta de asfalto,
sigue siendo la antecesora de todos los procesos que usamos en la
actualidad'', dice Jacqueline Belloni, quimica de la universidad
del sur de Paris, en Orsay.
</P>
<P>
   A finales de la decada del ochenta, Belloni contribuyo a
dilucidar los aspectos fundamentales del revelado de un film. Ahora
ha desarrollado un nuevo metodo de combinar emulsiones para mejorar
la captura de la luz en un rollo de celuloide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Si puede aplicarse en gran escala, sera uno de los mayores
inventos de la fotografia en los ultimos 60 anos'', dice el quimico
Rolf Steiger, que trabaja para Ilford, un fabricante de rollos de
pelicula.
</P>
<P>
   Daguerre (al cual tambien hay que darle credito por sus aportes
al desarrollo de la fotografia) fue quien cubrio con nitrato de
plata las placas a ser expuestas a la luz. Y a partir de su
invento, el film es basicamente gran cantidad de cristales de
nitrato de plata suspendidos en gelatina, con un soporte de
plastico.
</P>
<P>
   Cuando se abre el diafragma de una camara, fotones de luz
atraviesan el lente, se depositan en algunos de los cristales y
desalojan los electrones de los iones del nitrato.
</P>
<P>
   Algunos de los electrones tocan cercanos iones de plata,
transformandolos en atomos neutrales. Los atomos se arraciman y
forman diminutos puntos negros de plata en cada cristal expuesto.
Millones de esos puntitos constituyen la imagen.
</P>
<P>
   Pero para que la imagen se haga visible, un fotografo debe lavar
el film en un producto quimico que lo revela. Y esa es otra
contribucion de Daguerre.
</P>
<P>
   ``El revelador da electrones a los cristales que mas los
necesitan, y no a otros'', dice Belloni.
</P>
<P>
   Los cristales reaccionan de manera individual porque la gelatina
los aisla uno de otro.
</P>
<P>
   El resultado es que cuando los cristales no revelados son
lavados, aparece un negativo. Areas brillantes de un objeto
producen concentraciones de cristales negros, en tanto las zonas
oscuras se hacen transparentes.
</P>
<P>
   Para imprimir un positivo, hay que hacer pasar luz de un
negativo a un papel especial cubierto con el mismo tipo de emulsion
del filme, y luego revelarlo.
</P>
<P>
   ``El primer paso determina la cantidad de informacion que puede
capturarse en el celuloide'', dice Jon Kapecki, un quimico de la
empresa Kodak. ``A partir de ese momento, nada puede hacerse para
cambiar la imagen''.
</P>
<P>
   La mayoria de los fotones que alcanzan el film se despilfarran.
Los electrones que liberan, un electron por foton, caen en los
``agujeros'' de los iones de nitrato. De ahi que el rollo de
pelicula de la actualidad requiera 10 o mas fotones para crear su
cuota de cuatro atomos de plata por cristal. Esto significa que un
60 por ciento de la luz se pierde.
</P>
<P>
   ``Es por eso que cuando disenamos un producto quimico para
capturar toda la luz'', dice Belloni, ``muchas personas quedaron
impresionadas''.
</P>
<P>
   Puesto que el problema era la desaparicion de electrones en los
agujeros, Belloni penso que la respuesta consistia en cubrir el
film con un elemento que bloqueara los agujeros. Belloni considero
que iones de formiato podrian resolver la dificultad.
</P>
<P>
   Fue una corazonada que dio resultado. Experimentos hecho por
Rene De Keyzer, un quimico de Agfa-Gevaert, la empresa germano-
belga que financio las investigaciones de Belloni, indicaron que el
formiato elimina todos los agujeros producidos por la luz en una
emulsion de bromuro de plata.
</P>
<P>
   Aun mas, cada vez que un ion de formiato neutraliza un agujero,
la reaccion libera un segundo electron que oscurece un segundo ion
de plata. En lugar de requerir 10 fotones para exponer un cristal
de nitrato de plata, o cuatro, o inclusive tres el previo limite
teorico-- un cristal combinado con formiato concreta la tarea con
apenas dos fotones.
</P>
<P>
   Uno de los beneficios de esos nuevos rollos de pelicula es que
son de alta velocidad y las fotografias aparecen mucho menos
granuladas que en rollos convencionales. A fin de atrapar 10
fotones por cristal en escasa luz, los rollos de 400 ASAS deben
tener cristales cuatro veces mas grandes, y por lo tanto, menos
numnerosos, que los rollos de 100 ASAS. Si el formiato puede
reducir a dos los fotones requeridos, entonces un rollo de 400 ASAS
tendra cristales mas pequenos y mas nitidez que los rolls de 100
ASAS de la actualidad.
</P>
<P>
   De Keyzer y sus colegas de Agfa necesitan aun demostrar que esas
nuevas emulsiones permitiran conservar durante mucho tiempo los
rollos sin revelar, que los rollos podran ser manufacturados a
escala industrial, y que el formiato actuara sin problemas con el
nitrato de plata usado en la fotografia.
</P>
<P>
   Pero De Keyzer es optimista: estima que Agfa podra lanzar los
nuevos rollos al mercado en un lapso de cuatro anos. Y Belloni cree
que el formiato sera reemplazado por otros productos quimicos en el
mediano plazo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Es probable que logremos nuevos avances combinando formiato
con otros elementos'', dice. ``Pero lo que resulta seguro es que
hemos descubierto una puerta que nadie habia abierto antes''.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Si los atletas norteamericanos traen medallas de oro de las
Olimpiadas de Sydney, gran parte del credito se debera a la
tecnologia.
</P>
<P>
   ``La tecnologia esta remodelando muchos deportes'', dice Lance
Williams, administrador de programas de la division de ciencias del
Comite Olimpico de Estados Unidos.
</P>
<P>
   La division emplea a mas de 25 personas en la asistencia a 45
equipos de atletas. Entre los funcionarios figuran bioquimicos,
fisiologos, ingenieros y psicologos, ademas de docenas de
especialistas en tecnologia.
</P>
<P>
   Los criticos alegan que la tecnologia esta dejando de lado al
factor humano en la creacion de performances estelares. Pero los
entrenadores y expertos insisten en que el talento y el coraje
siguen siendo los principales ingredientes de una buena actuacion
deportiva.
</P>
<P>
   TRAJES DE BANO ESPECIALES
</P>
<P>
   Cuando el nadador norteamericano de estilo pecho Ed Moses se
zambulla en una de las piscinas del Centro Acuatico Internacional
de Sydney, la unica piel que estara expuesta sera la de su rostro y
aquella debajo de sus codos y rodillas.
</P>
<P>
   Moses usara una malla enteriza con capa de teflon que le
permitira deslizarse por el agua con mayor eficacia y velocidad que
los nadadores provistos de trajes de bano tradicionales.
</P>
<P>
   La nueva malla esta disenada para poner presion en sitios
apropiados del cuerpo a fin de conservar la tecnica mas apropiada.
El material sintetico en torno a sus biceps y muslos reducira la
vibracion muscular, y por lo tanto, la fatiga.
</P>
<P>
   LA BOLSA Y LA VIDA
</P>
<P>
   El poder de los golpes del boxeador olimpico David Jackson es
medido usando una bolsa similar a las usadas en los entrenamientos,
pero con instrumental tecnologico disenado por ingenieros del
taller del comite olimpico norteamericano en Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Dentro de la bolsa hay un aparato que ``traduce'' los golpes en
esquemas desplegados en una pantalla de computadora.
</P>
<P>
   Una videograbacion registrada mientras el boxeador golpea la
bolsa es exhibida en la misma pantalla junto con numeros y
graficos. De esa manera, un entrenador puede analizar la eficacia
de los golpes del atleta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creo que los boxeadores se estan haciendo mas fuertes y
mejores gracias a esta bolsa'', dice David Lubs, director de
programas del equipo de pugilistas norteamericanos.
</P>
<P>
   RASGANDO EL VIENTO
</P>
<P>
   Las rafagas de viento en Sydney suelen alcanzar los 40
kilometros por hora. Y en la cercana bahia Homebush, donde
competiran los arqueros, los vientos pueden llegar a los 80
kilometros por hora. Eso afecta la trayectoria de una flecha que
avanza a mas de 200 kilometros por hora hacia un objetivo situado a
70 metros de distancia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ciertamente el viento era impresionante'', dice Don Rabska, un
ex arquero y entrenador de la actriz Geena Davis, que compitio en
una prueba en Sydney hace un ano.
</P>
<P>
   Para ayudar a que las flechas vayan directo al objetivo, los
arqueros norteamericanos usaran fustes rematados en tungsteno, un
material mas pesado que el acero.
</P>
<P>
   Fabricadas por Easton Archery de Salt Lake City, Utah, las
flechas X-10 estan hechas de un hibrido de aluminio y carbon con
una capa de grafito que reduce el arrastre.
</P>
<P>
   DISPARO CERTERO
</P>
<P>
   En enero pasado, el tirador olimpico Bob Foth tuvo mala punteria
cuando disparaba su rifle calibre .22 en posicion tendida. Para
descubrir la razon, visito al ingeniero Tim Conrad en el Centro
Olimpico de Estados Unidos situado en Colorado Springs. Conrad
coloco un diodo laser de 120 gramos de peso en la parte posterior
del arma de Foth.
</P>
<P>
   Tal como lo demuestra Conrad, cuando un arma es disparada, un
rayo laser recorre la exacta trayectoria de la bala al avanzar a
1.200 kilometros por hora hacia el objetivo, situado a 50 metros de
distancia. El rayo es concentrado para que apunte al sitio donde se
alojara la bala.
</P>
<P>
   Aparatos laser son usados en la actualidad junto con
videograbaciones para analizar la punteria de los tiradores antes y
durante el disparo, y cuanto balancean su cuerpo en el momento de
apretar el gatillo.
</P>
<P>
   Para obtener optimos resultados, los tiradores deben estar
inmoviles como una piedra mientras disparan. Un minuto de arco
puede representar la diferencia crucial entre una medalla de oro y
un fiasco total.
</P>
<P>
   En el caso de Foth, tres veces campeon olimpico, las pruebas con
lasers indicaron que su posicion era impecable. El problema era con
la municion. ``Una vez uso buena municion, su punteria mejoro'',
dice Conrad.
</P>
<P>
   APRENDIENDO A VOLAR
</P>
<P>
   Para el salto con garrocha, biomecanicos estan probando la
verticalidad de las pertigas y su flexibilidad, en un ulterior
esfuerzo por desafiar la gravedad. Entre sus tareas esta la de
registrar en videograbadoras a los atletas y usar la grabacion para
construir modelos de computadoras que analizan la flexibilidad y
movimiento de las varas y el estilo y ubicacion de los atletas.
</P>
<P>
   En cuanto a la vestimenta de los atletas de campo y pista,
tambien ha sufrido cambios para mejorar la performance.
</P>
<P>
   Cuando Florence Griffith Joyner rompio el record mundial en los
100 metros llanos, su cuerpo se desplazaba a unos 35 kilometros por
hora, en tanto sus piernas se movian a unos 80 kilometros por hora.
</P>
<P>
   ``Las piernas se hallan en un medio ambiente distinto en
relacion al flujo de aire'', dice el biomecanico Jeff Broker. ``Por
lo tanto, nos estamos concentrando en hacer las piernas mas
aerodinamicas''.
</P>
<P>
   Este ano en Sydney algunos atletas vestiran ropas especiales que
reducen la resistencia del viento contra el cuerpo. Eso podria
mejorar el tiempo de los corredores en valiosas fracciones de
segundo.
</P>
<P>
   En cuanto a los saltadores de garrocha, el entrenador
norteamericano Dick Booth dice que sus pupilos usaran en las suelas
de sus zapatos puas hechas de ceramica en lugar de metal, a fin de
saltar con mas facilidad y eficacia.
</P>
<P>
   NADA QUE SE PAREZCA A UNA BICICLETA
</P>
<P>
   En los Juegos Olimpicos de 1996, celebrados en Atlanta, muchos
ciclistas manejaron maquinas que apenas si recordaban una
bicicleta.
</P>
<P>
   Ademas de tener pequenas ruedas delanteras y marcos muy livianos
de Kevlar, las bicicletas tenian cadenas y tubos del espesor del
papel y los manubrios mucho mas adelante, para reducir la
resistencia del viento.
</P>
<P>
   La llamada ``Superbicicleta'' causo un escandalo y la Union
Ciclistica Internacional la prohibio en las competencias.
</P>
<P>
   Ahora, en Sydney, retorna algo parecido a la vieja bicicleta.
Segun el reglamento de la UCI, las bicicletas tienen que tener un
marco en forma de diamante, las dos ruedas del mismo tamano, y los
manubrios situados mas atras.
</P>
<P>
   Muchos ciclistas norteamericanos utilizaran un modelo reformado
de la Superbicicleta. Aunque luce como una ``antigua'' bicicleta,
tiene un marco mas aerodinamico y neumaticos cuya presion es de 250
libras por pulgada cuadrada.
</P>
<P>
   Los ciclistas estadounidenses tambien usaran trajes especiales
para reducir la friccion del viento. Se calcula que con esos
trajes, puede aminorarse el tiempo en una competencia entre uno y
tres segundos.
</P>

MARK DONOHUE: A BOY'S ENTHUSIASM IN THE SOUL OF A DRIVER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   First, know this: Speed is a science.
</P>
<P>
   So, as they say, let's go racing. The proposition? We race five
races, and the night before each race we draw from a hat the type
of auto we will be racing the next day. Could be an Indy car. Could
be a Winston Cup car. Could be a Formula 1 rocket. Could be an old
Corvette. Whatever we pick, we'll run on an appropriate track or
course. You get points depending on where you finish, as long as
it's in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   The catch? We each get one driver to handle our cars. You can
hook up with a current star _ that Gordon boy from NASCAR has a
reputation for flexibility in what and how he drives, for instance
_ or you can reach back in time, even back through mortality, and
pick a great from the past.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is my column, I pick first. I choose Mark Donohue,
the best driver and one of the greatest race/engineering minds who
ever lived. He, probably better than any driver, understood the
science of speed.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't matter what he was in. He let the car do its thing and
interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel what I'm doing is the obvious, natural thing to do,''
he wrote in his autobiography. ``The driver is simply doing what
the car wants to be done.'' If the driver has the guts to go for
the ride, he did not add.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that in ``The Unfair Advantage,'' which he authored
more than a quarter-century ago and which has be reissued by
Bentley Publishers of Cambridge. Having just read the book, I'm not
sure what was ``unfair'' about his advantages, given they were
inside the rules and the product of his own genius _ things like a
faster system for changing brakes during a race, better fuel
intake, even a gravity-feed fueling station (later outlawed) for
pit stops.
</P>
<P>
   You want to know how broad was Donohue's driving ability?
Consider only the cars he drove and mentions in chapter headings.
Among them, beginning in 1958, the Corvette, the Elva Formula
Junior, Daimler, Cooper-Offy, MGB, and Ferrari 275, Cobra, Lotus
20, Mustang, Ford Mark II, and Mark IV, Lola T70, Camaro,
Eagle-Chevrolet, McLaren M6-B, Lolas T70, T152, T163, T150,
Javelin, Matador, Lola-Ford, Ferrari 512, Mclaren M16, Mclaren M19,
Eagle-Offy, Lola T330-AMC, Porsche 917-10, Porsche 917-30, Porsche
911 Carerra.
</P>
<P>
   In these cars he won endurance races, Formula 1 tests, set a
closed track world speed record at Talledega, and, by God, won both
the Indianapolis 500 and a Winston Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   What he drove, how he drove it, and the modifications he made
ripple like waves on the pond of racing. His sons, Michael and
David, say in the preface to the book, that ``Even though racing
has taken him from us, it continually keeps giving him back to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a return journey that began in 1958, when he was, of all
things, an engineering student at Brown University (and you thought
all good drivers were Southern boys with home brew and lightning
chases through the woods in their blood) and entered his 1957
Corvette in a hill climb in Belknap, N.H. The bugger won that race
and kept winning ever after.
</P>
<P>
   And he did it with the soul of a true garage rat. In 1963, he
was approached by Bob Holbert, known to run Porsches but with a
Cobra on his hands. First sponsored driving for Donahue, listen to
him describe it and don't get a chill: ``The Cobra didn't seem to
corner . . . it was much more powerful than anything I'd ever
driven . . . and what a great noise it made. VAROOOM-VAROOM.''
</P>
<P>
   A boy's enthusiasm in the soul of an engineer who was also a
fantastic driver.
</P>
<P>
   Go back in time and check him out, pre-Cobra, way pre-Porsche,
and hear him prep an MGB for a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cut the springs and bent the arms . . . until the car was
inches off the ground.'' Then, he bled the spring-loaded valves in
the shocks, shimmed them up, and refilled them with heavier oil.
Nice, hard ride.
</P>
<P>
   He drove what the world tossed at him. Couldn't afford the
race-prepared Shelby, so he took a road-ready GT 350, fixed its 600
pounds of aerodynamic lift on the front (talk about driving a boat)
and beat the hotter cars.
</P>
<P>
   Hooked up with a guy named Penske and wrote racing history.
Helped engineer Lolas and McLarens, got AMC, of all companies, into
the winner's circle though the Javelin team he inherited, he said,
had as its most valuable asset, its International tow truck.
</P>
<P>
   He helped Porsche, as engineer and driver, develop the 917-10,
917-30, and Carerra 911.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to quit driving, but money and the lure of competition
drew him back. He ends his autobiography discussing this decision,
saying of his return, ``Of course, there were some negative
concerns. For one thing, I'm putting my life on the line again.''
But then he added, ``hopefully, in a few years, I'll have another
story to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Months later, he was dead, killed by a test run on an F1 track
in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   He's my guy. Who's yours? Let's go racing.

<P>
   Did you know?
</P>
<P>
   Corn tortillas have no added fat and are more healthful than
flour tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   Tortillas are one of the fastest growing segments of the baking
industry worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, United States residents consumed more than 75 billion
tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   If 75 billion tortillas were laid end to end, they would stretch
across the United States 1,178 times, or circle the Earth 338
times.
</P>
<P>
   It's perfectly good manners to roll a tortilla and use it as a
pusher or scooper for food on the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Flour tortillas originated in Northern Mexico. In Mexico, flour
tortillas are generally not served with southern Mexican cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Lime (calcium oxide) acts as a preservative in corn tortillas.
The more lime, the yellower the tortilla. If tortillas are ochre,
too much lime was added.
</P>
<P>
   Spain also has a tortilla, but it's similar to a thin omelet.
</P>
<P>
   Homemade masa without preservatives keeps less than six hours
unrefrigerated. Refrigerated, it keeps less than two days.
</P>
<P>
   Variety of uses
</P>
<P>
   Totopos, chilaquiles, tortilla soup and migas are great ways to
use leftover corn tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   Leftover flour tortillas can be cut in triangles, fried in hot
oil, and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Wrap sandwiches using flour tortillas have fused U.S., Mexican
and other cultures. Some possibilities: Fill cilantro tortillas
with spicy chicken salad; fill spinach tortillas with sliced
Italian deli meats, cheese and arugula and dress with light Italian
dressing; brush one side of a flour tortilla with mayonnaise and
wrap around bacon, lettuce and tomato; fill a sun-dried tomato
tortilla with goat cheese and black olive tapenade or pesto.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritional facts
</P>
<P>
   Flour tortillas are a low-fat food and contain iron along with B
vitamins. A 7-inch tortilla has 115 calories, 3 grams protein, 20
grams carbohydrate, 2.5 grams fat and 44 milligrams calcium.
</P>
<P>
   Corn tortillas do not contain gluten, making them an alternative
for those who are gluten intolerant.
</P>
<P>
   Corn tortillas are a low-fat, low-sodium food and contain
calcium, potassium and fiber. A 7- inch tortilla has 60 calories, 1
gram protein, 12 grams carbohydrate, 1 gram fat and 44 milligrams
calcium.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mexican cooks believe crisp tortilla halves sprinkled with
salt are good after-dinner digestive aids.
</P>
<P>
   History
</P>
<P>
   Historic evidence says tortillas or similar flatbreads have been
around for 12,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mayan legend, tortillas were invented in ancient
times by a peasant for his hungry king.
</P>
<P>
   The first tortillas, food of the ancient Mayans and Aztecs, were
made of native corn.
</P>
<P>
   In the central highlands and west central Mexico, as well as
parts of New Mexico, you'll find tortillas made of blue corn. The
difference is more in color than taste.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Aztec word for tortilla is tlaxcallim.
</P>
<P>
   Tortilla trends
</P>
<P>
   Flavored tortillas, including spinach, jalapeno, sun-dried
tomato and cinnamon-sugar, offer new tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Wrap sandwiches and hors d' oeuvres made from rolled-up
tortillas are taking the tortilla in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   Tortillas come in all sizes, ranging from silver-dollar
varieties to thin, platter-sized ones, used for cheese crisps and
burritos.
</P>
<P>
   Prep tips
</P>
<P>
   When making your own corn tortillas, butter your hands as you
pat the tortilla to keep it from sticking.
</P>
<P>
   If making tortillas with a press, put the ball of masa in a
plastic bag larger than the press to expedite removal.
</P>
<P>
   Microwave ovens are great for reheating tortillas. Wrap a dozen
tortillas (no more!) in plastic wrap and heat for about a minute.
Turn it over and heat for another 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to use tortillas the day you buy them, they
don't need to be refrigerated. They taste best when freshest. For
longer storage, refrigerate or freeze _ days in the fridge, months
in the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Soften tortillas for enchiladas by dipping them quickly in hot
oil. (Fat-gram counters may want to substitute hot broth or sauce
for oil, or warm them quickly in a lightly oiled skillet.)
</P>
<P>
   Warm tortillas on a hot skillet or comal or wrap several at a
time in aluminum foil and heat in a 250- to 325-degree oven for 10
minutes.

WOOD IS BETTER THAN RUBBER FOR GARDEN EDGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The rubber edging I am using in my garden just doesn't work
very well. It is too shallow to stick in the ground properly, and
also tends to work itself out of the ground. I was thinking of
pressure-treated wood, something like a 2-by-4 or 2-by-6. And to
save money, would a 1-by-6 do?
</P>
<P>
   DANIEL O'NEILL, Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Any wood board will do, but pressure-treated will last
indefinitely, without affecting what's in the garden. Cedar will
last up to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   For good staying-in-the-ground power, use the deeper boards; a
1-by-6 will be fine. The only disadvantage to long boards is that
they do not turn corners or curve. To do that, use shorter, 2-foot
lengths.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barbara McGurl of Belmont, Mass. called recently with several
questions, which were duly answered, and she came up with this one
for the handyman.
</P>
<P>
   When she asked if she could find any ready-made corner cabinet
of a certain size, the handyman suggested several sources. ``I went
to the Woodworkers Store ... and they sent me to a carpenter who
built the corner cabinet.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it pays to check things out, and the handyman is pleased
to put this in his file, for anyone who wants it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wrought-iron furniture is a bit rusted. It is white, and
not peeling. A beloved member of the family wants me to paint it
green. Would that work?
</P>
<P>
   S.D., Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure it would work, but I strongly suggest that you not
change color. If the green starts to peel, revealing the white
underneath, the contrast will be glaring, and shouting to be fixed
in a big hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, stick with white, but you have to remove all the rust
whether you repaint white or green. Sand off the rust with medium
sandpaper. If you cannot get all the rust off by sanding, paint the
remaining rust with Rust Reformer (that and other brands are sold
in paint and building stores). It contains phosphoric acid, which
turns the rust black and makes it paintable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to make a concrete platform for my 8-by-16-foot shed
that I am moving to a new site. Can I mix the concrete myself and
pour it?
</P>
<P>
   LEVON CHORBAJIAN, Billerica, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, but if you make the slab 4 inches thick, you will be
using more than 3 yards of concrete, which is one heck of a lot of
concrete to mix by hand. You can rent a portable mixer, but even so
you will be handling all that sand, stone, cement, and water
anyway. Concrete weighs more than 3,000 pounds per yard, so you are
going to be handling 9,000 pounds (4 1/2 tons!).
</P>
<P>
   It would be better to have a ready-mix concrete company deliver
it to the forms you will be building for it. If you have the
concrete delivered, be prepared to smooth it out and finish it.
Concrete truck drivers deliver the concrete, but that is all,
unless you get a friendly guy to help. But they don't have to. No
matter how you pour the slab, put reinforcing rods in it. It will
float on the ground but will stay in one piece that way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a fine old Boston rocker that was in my cousin's
house, but I can't use it because it reeks of cigarette smoke. I
washed it with Mr. Clean, which helped some, but not enough. What
else can I do? It really reeks.
</P>
<P>
   G.Y., Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, it is amazing how smoke of any kind can penetrate so
many things, including finished or painted wood. One thing you can
try is to treat the whole chair, especially the unfinished seat
bottom, with Febreze. Made by Proctor &AMP; Gamble, it's a deodorizer
that oxidizes the smoke residue rather than disguising the odor.
While it was designed to treat fabrics and other soft goods, it can
work on wood and other hard surfaces. It is sold in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   If this doesn't work, you will have to strip it and refinish or
repaint it, including the seat bottom. You might be able to simply
sand it and repaint, but I don't think that is as effective as
stripping.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The roofing crew finishing my roof took up a garden hose to
test for leaks and, wouldn't you know, dropped the nozzle, a piece
of brass about 6 inches long, down the vent pipe. They said it is
impossible to retrieve. What can I do? There have been no symptoms
of a blocked vent or sewer pipe since this happened two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   WORRIED, in Danvers, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The handyman has been taking in weird and wonderful tales for
34 years now, but this one takes the cake. That's exactly what the
Godfather did with the pistol he killed his first victim with.
Broke it up and dumped it down a vent.
</P>
<P>
   If there have been no symptoms in two weeks, all you can do is
wait. The nozzle is simply a tube, and is unlikely to block the
vent pipe. But if it turns a corner from the vent pipe to drain
line, it could wedge itself in and cause a blockage. Even if it
doesn't, it is unlikely to go far down a gently sloping drain,
pushed by water.
</P>
<P>
   If you get a blockage, start looking for it where the horizontal
drain exits from the vertical vent pipe.
</P>
<P>
   The roofing crew should give you more than just a new nozzle.
</P>

   Call it cyber clutter. Or messy Web weaving. Or just plain
ugly-wire networking. The wires from computer monitors, keyboards,
speakers, printers, faxes, scanners, and phones that swoop around
rooms, dangle under desks, and loop along desktops in an all-out
scramble to get to the nearest electrical outlet are, for some, a
visual nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   There's no uniform color or girth to them, and they are as prone
to tangling as a mop of wet hair. They also seem to multiply
overnight. There are the big, fat, hose-like ones from the monitor;
the skinnier, more flexible ones from the keyboard and mouse; the
tangled mass of them to and from the CPU (computer power unit); and
the strays from the printer, fax, and surge protector. There are
silver ones, white and grey ones, and black.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, this mess is mysteriously absent from photographs of
computer stations in catalogs, and wires never snake along the rugs
or dangle from desks in furniture showrooms. They seem only to lurk
and lurch around private homes and apartments like a veritable
cyber invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Eben Scanlon, 25, a graduate student at Harvard Business School,
is trying to make his new apartment as wireless as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other apartments, I've hidden wires under sofas and rugs
but I'm planning to be pretty wireless this time by using LAN
(local area network) cards and a Linux box (a piece of computer
equipment) that serves as a (wireless) bridge between my
computers,'' says Scanlon.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has five computers, Scanlon is planning to use only
two in his new digs. What he's most excited about, he says, are the
wireless homes that some friends are building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people I know who are building new houses are putting in
ethernet drops,'' he says. ``That means all the wires are in the
walls and the drop is like a phone jack.''
</P>
<P>
   For those still with old-fashioned exposed wires, however, help
is available. With 60 percent of American homes now equipped with
computers and 70 percent of all home computers purchased by
first-time buyers, according to a recent Microsoft survey, the
furniture, interior-design, and industrial-design industries are
tackling wire management and techno-clutter problems.
</P>
<P>
   According to SoHo Today magazine, an industry trade publication
based in Greensboro, N. C., today's residential computer furniture
industry is one of the fastest-growing segments of the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of falling PC prices, ongoing corporate
downsizing, and the growing number of Americans spending time in
their home offices proved to be key ingredients in the recipe for
success enjoyed by the small office/home office segment in 1999,''
according to a recent issue of the magazine. ``Last year, the
Business Industry Furniture Manufacturers Association indicated
that the wholesale demand for domestic office furniture is at
approximately $12.7 billion. This year the group says it expects
that number to reach between $13 billion and $13.5 billion, which
would represent an increase of between 4 percent and 6 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Designers say that although many clients seem willing to spend
money on space planning and decorating for his, hers, theirs, and
the children's computers, there are still the holdouts who'll pay
thousands for a little-used dining room set but a pittance on
computer stations. This, even though a recent Harris poll found
that of the 63 percent of adults who use computers, 26 percent use
one both at work and at home and the average weekly use is 15
hours, six of which are spent on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   One need not hire a decorator or buy an expensive wall unit to
achieve solutions to the wire mess. A few dollars buys a handful of
large cup hooks at the hardware store. Screw them into the back of
the computer desk or table, gather the wires in a bunch and string
them through the hooks, then bring them all straight down to the
outlet. Alternatively, buy a roll of duct tape and tape the bunched
wires along the underside or back of the desk. Or, create neat
bundles by grouping wires together and binding them with nylon ties
or Velcro wraps or ``twisties'' from bread wrappers. Then herd them
toward an inexpensive power strip with four or five outlets.
</P>
<P>
   To hide the wires, try plastic corrugated tubing from a store
like Hold Everything (roughly $16 for 8 feet of flexible tubing).
The tubing comes split down the middle so it can be opened and
wrapped around a set of wires. This gives a one-lane,
all-inclusive, covered-bridge route to an outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Klein, president and chief executive officer of Media
Systems, headquartered in the Boston Design Center, says that when
it comes to wires, ``it's a matter of detail, not budgetry. It's
about dressing and creating harnesses with your wires so that there
is one single run of cable.''
</P>
<P>
   He also emphasizes planning, planning, and more planning when
branching into more expensive home-office setups, armoires, and
high-end desks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be fooled by the lovely photos in the catalogs,'' he
says. ``There are never any wires in the pictures. So be careful.
However, most cabinets and desks can be modified to a person's
needs. A home office should have, and can have, the functionality
of a business office.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein's company works on the big picture of prewiring new homes
with the most sophisticated communications systems available. He
also assures that eventually, these wires (and this article) will
be obsolete. The wireless computer is on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Kasrel, senior analyst at Forrester Research, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is going to happen is that networking technology will
allow scanners and printers to communicate with a computer without
being in the same room,'' says Kasrel. ``There will be just one
power cord. Ultimately, there may be no need for even a power cord.
A technology called Bluetooth may someday allow a printer to talk
to a computer without the need for a cable.''
</P>
<P>
   Wirelessness, however, will not be available in the next year or
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were building a new home and I was a high-tech person, I
would special-wire the house because that's going to be the best
solution for the next two to five years,'' says Kasrel. ``Within 10
years, we won't need special wiring.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For now, cleverly housing computers and their wires and
accessories in various rooms has become a top priority in the
design industry, mainly because computers are not relegated to just
one room anymore. A recent Microsoft poll found 33 percent of home
computers are in the playroom, den, or family room; 28 percent are
in the office, library, or study; and 16 percent are in the master
bedroom, followed by the living room, child's bedroom, and other
rooms set aside for cyber working.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Pelissier, an interior designer and owner of Robin's Nest
in Hingham, Mass., custom designs armoires and wall units for
clients but also takes far less expensive routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get decent armoires or desk units in catalogs like
Pottery Barn,'' says Pelissier. ``An armoire is great because it's
a good-looking piece in a room and you can close it up and hide the
computer when you're not using it. Just be careful about the
measurements and that there's a roll-out piece for the keyboard and
spaces below for a fax and speakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitchens are becoming an increasingly popular place for a
computer, designers say, as it tends to be the hub of the house.
This is usually the wife's computer. The husband's, they say, often
remains in the den or library.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men like their desks facing the door, they don't like their
backs to the door,'' says Pelissier. ``So I'll put the computer
along the wall behind the desk because you don't want to see a
bunch of wires falling off a desk as you enter a room. A swivel
chair makes everything accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   For children, Pelissier likes to convert a small bedroom closet
into a computer center. She upholsters the inside of the door and
hangs a bulletin board on it, puts a wide piece of wood or a
formica-topped piece on two sawhorses as a desktop for the monitor,
keyboard, and printer, and places the computer in a cabinet
underneath.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get an inexpensive cabinet from Home Depot and drill
holes in the back for the wiring,'' says Pelissier. ``If you don't
want a cabinet, drill holes in the formica top, snake the wires
through the holes, and then put them in tubing for a clean look.
You can add bookshelves on the facing wall or put up another
bulletin board. When the child is not using the computer, just
close the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelissier does not always try to hide a computer or large-screen
television, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, the computer or television is the most expensive
thing in the room and people want to show off their techiness,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   For a more luxurious look, Charles Spada of Charles Spada
Interiors, also in the Design Center, has custom-built commodes and
buffets with pull-out drawers for monitors, keyboards, and faxes.
Increasingly, clients are asking for ``his and her'' work stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Husbands really don't care what their computer station looks
like,'' says Spada. ``They just want leg room and surface space.
Women want their work space pretty and practical. They don't want
to see a lot of electronics. They want their space free and clean.
They are neatniks. Men are more comfortable with everything at
their fingertips. They don't care if everything is out in the open.
They want to see their toys.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of toys in the Fish house in Weston, Mass.
Ellen Fish said her husband, Ted, who works with Peabody
Construction, ``sometimes works out of the house and needed a room
for a computer, fax, and copy machines, but I didn't want the room
to be a total office. I wanted to be able to sit in there, watch TV
with my son, Eddie, and just relax. I hate the way wires and things
hang off desks. They're so ugly. Some of them are just huge,
especially those big black ones that MediaOne puts in. They make
for a visual disaster. So we tried to hide the wires as much as
possible by putting in plenty of strip outlets placed high enough
off the floor so you don't see them.''
</P>
<P>
   It works. Sitting in the office that Spada designed, a few wires
are visible snaking across the desk area to the wall, but no wires
dangle beneath the desk. They are bunched together and plugged into
the above-knee-level strip outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Glossmann-Smith of Design Creations Inc. in Boston's
North End has made a specialty of custom office design, both
residential and commercial, and often uses inexpensive materials to
keep costs down.
</P>
<P>
   She uses plywood covered with laminate, for example, sometimes
edged in cherry or maple, and attaches the desktop to the wall by
anchoring it on a 2-by-4. To further support the desktop, she puts
filing cabinets underneath. As for the wire problem, she drills
holes or grommets in the laminate, groups and tapes wires
underneath the desktops, then drops them down behind the filing
cabinets to an outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Pelissier says she urges her clients to pick up magazines and
decorating books, and to go on house tours and to show houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I get my ideas,'' she says. ``So why shouldn't my
clients?''

AN ELMENTAL CHANGE FOR US, KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (f and i coding)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Magnesium is about as friendly as an element gets. From homey
laxatives like grandma's milk of magnesia, to furnaces for making
steel, to the very latest in environmental technology, most all its
uses are benign.
</P>
<P>
   Now it may become the element that opens normal trading
relations between the United States and North Korea after 50 years
of war, distrust, and a tough US embargo.
</P>
<P>
   An alliance of businessmen and academics has put together the
first joint venture between US and North Korean interests _ a deal
struck quietly in Pyongyang in late August to produce and export
magnesia, a processed form of the mineral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real importance of this is it is a first step in
confidence building,'' said Greyson Bryan, a California-based Asia
Society official and specialist on North Korean business law.
``Confidence for North Korea that it can benefit from closer
relations with the rest of world, and for the rest of world that
there is something worth investing in in North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is significant for several reasons: It marks the
apparent beginning of a special zone for US investment in North
Korean mines, south of Korea's Rajin-Sonbong free trade zone, and
it provides a striking illustration of how private citizens, rather
than government, are leading the United States into better
relations with the North.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture is no sure thing. Nowhere in international
politics and business are the commitments less certain than in US
dealings with what generations of American diplomats have demonized
as the world's most isolated Stalinist regime, and a significant
part of the US partners' obligation is to recruit investment to
modernize North Korea's magnesium industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the US partners _ a Harvard-based specialist in business
law, a Korean War veteran who made millions in gold mining, and a
scholar who serves as a go-between for the United States and Korea
_ are as interested in geopolitics as in profit. All have an
abiding interest in northeast Asia, and all believe US policy often
has heightened tensions in a region where Chinese, Korean, Russian,
Japanese, and American interests easily can come into conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korea, its people, and its 10 million divided families are the
unfortunate victims of a US policy dominated by Cold War
thinking,'' said Robin Radin, 58, who joined Harvard Law School's
international law program in 1996 after nearly a decade as a top
corporate executive in Japan and China. ``I want to make a positive
change in relations between the United States and North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Birl Worley, 69, who became a mining executive after serving in
the Korean War, put it more gruffly. ``I was one of those nice
people who helped make a mess of China and North Korea,'' he said.
``I thought I'd make a little amends.''
</P>
<P>
   The third US partner is K.A. Namkung, a China-born Korean,
raised in Japan, educated and naturalized in the United States. He
refuses to discuss the venture.
</P>
<P>
   The deal targets an emerging market in North America and Japan
for environmentally benign methods for disposing of the nasty
byproducts of mines and coal-burning power plants. Magnesium
products are coming into use in place of lime to absorb the sulphur
and carbon compounds produced in these industries. The resulting
magnesium sulphate is non-caustic and easy to handle compared to
the gooey, unusable gypsum that results from using lime on
sulphur-polluted mine water. And magnesium sulphate can be used as
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to create a door-opening venture with North Korean
interests grew out of the friendship Namkung and Radin formed in
the late 1960s, when they were graduate students in Asian and
Japanese history at the University of California-Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   They fell out of touch for nearly 20 years, reconnecting by
chance just before Radin moved to Tokyo as a Morgan Stanley
executive. Their business dealings became frequent, and Namkung
became deeply involved in back-channel communications between
Pyongyang and Washington _ which led to the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   Namkung and former President Jimmy Carter were key players in
the prolonged crisis in 1994 over allegations that North Korea was
developing the capacity to manufacture nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After the crisis was defused, to the fury of Clinton
administration officials who had advocated a new round of sanctions
against the North, relations among countries with interests in
northeast Asia gradually warmed, despite setbacks over North
Korea's missile development and testing, and ``in 1996, Tony
(Namkung) advised me that his contacts in North Korea had an
interest in attracting US investment, particularly in the mining
sector,'' Radin said.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed that the moment to realize their ambition to improve
North Korea's relations with the world was at hand.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, both participated in the first exchange between US and
North Korean legal experts; during the meetings, the Koreans
broached the idea of creating investment opportunities for US
investors in the Danchon mining region.
</P>
<P>
   But when the idea was pitched to the US mining industry,
``interest was tepid, to say the least,'' as Radin put it. So he
and Namkung organized a second trip in spring 1998 in an attempt to
persuade mining experts to join them in a venture.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Worley, president of Golden Cycle Gold Corp.,
one of the oldest gold mining companies in the United States. After
retiring from Golden Cycle last year, he co-founded of Aurora
Partners Ltd. to undertake the joint venture. When US sanctions on
North Korea were partially lifted this summer, the trip that led to
the magnesium deal was arranged.
</P>
<P>
   Still, much can go wrong, particularly in the financing. Because
the United States still considers North Korea a terrorist nation,
conventional access to international capital is barred.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Korea is no pasture to bring your cash cows into,''
Worley said. ``But if somebody doesn't lead the way, nobody will
follow. . . . One of the main reasons we're there is to show it can
be done.''

TOO DEEP FOR MOST OF US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's just what I needed _ more Web search results.
</P>
<P>
   As if the thousands of pages turned up during the typical
AltaVista search weren't enough, I now find out that this mighty
search engine is just skimming the surface. The same goes for all
of the other market leaders _ Yahoo, Lycos, Google, Hotbot. These
guys just don't get it _ or at least, not most of it.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't breaking news, of course. I'm looking at a ticker at
www.cyveillance.com, which purports to display the total number of
unique documents online. It was at 2,571,377,000 when I began this
paragraph and 2,571,386,000 when I finished.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest search engines only claim about a billion pages
indexed. So the rest of the Web might as well not even be there,
since nobody can see it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But this seeming ocean of data is little more than a kiddie
pool. Step out a little farther, and you'll sink into ``the deep
Web,'' a Marianas Trench of information that contains 550 billion
documents and counting.
</P>
<P>
   So say the researchers at BrightPlanet.com LLC, a tiny company
in Sioux Falls, S.D., where the workers probably have time to read
every single document. Instead, they've been writing code that does
it for them. For you, too, if you're willing to part with $90.
</P>
<P>
   So what's this deep Web anyway? Well, you've probably taken a
dip now and then. Say you want to buy the (wretched) new Tom Clancy
novel at Amazon.com. Go there and look it up. The Web page you'll
see didn't exist till you asked for it _ at least, not as a Web
page. What you're seeing is a collection of information stored in
databases. When someone asks about the book, software pulls
together the required data, assembles it into a Web page, and sends
it to you. This is called a ``dynamic Web page,'' because it's
created on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that a huge amount of Internet data is handled this
way, because it's so efficient. You write one set of code to
automatically design Web pages. These pages assemble themselves
based on visitor requests and the contents of the database. To
change the site, you need only change the data. No page design
changes are needed.
</P>
<P>
   But since these Web pages don't exist till you specifically ask
for them, they're invisible to standard search engines. If you want
to search the Amazon database, crammed with useful information
about thousands of books, you have to go to Amazon.com, not Yahoo.
And the same is true for thousands of other deep Web databases,
full of good stuff unknown to the computers at AltaVista.
</P>
<P>
   Enter BrightPlanet.com, with its LexiBot software. It's sort of
like Copernic, an old favorite of mine that feeds my queries to a
dozen standard search engines at once. LexiBot goes quite a bit
further. Run a search, and it'll target up to 600 databases, most
of which aren't indexed by the search engines.
</P>
<P>
   Say you want medical information. You might start at Yahoo, but
the information you desire could be hidden in the databases of the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A savvy
searcher would go there directly, and use its search feature.
LexiBot can be programmed to search this database as a matter of
course, and dozens of others besides.
</P>
<P>
   There's a price to be paid, of course _ the aforementioned $90
for the LexiBot client software. There's a 30-day free trial if you
want to dip a toe in first. Company officials admit that they don't
sell many copies of the software, but they don't care. Their main
product is server software that companies can use to do deep
searches of topics that interest them _ finding every single Web
site that mentions Heinz Baked Beans, for instance. The LexiBot
client is mainly a way to give researchers a taste of deep Web
searching, and get them interested in buying their own servers.
</P>
<P>
   That's just as well. Deep Web searching sounds like a fine idea
for corporate researchers and librarians, but I don't see the
concept catching on with consumers. It's not just the price either.
LexiBot doesn't solve the biggest problem of most Web surfers. We
don't want more Internet data; just the data we truly need. We try
to tailor our searches to find the two or three pages that can
really help us. Instead, today's search engines, LexiBot included,
serve up a surfeit of sites, with thousands of times more data than
we have time for. Now we're in for thousands more hits, from
databases we never knew existed. I can hardly wait.

   1. REPUBLICANS TRY TO SPIN AWAY FROM THEIR BELIEFS, by Michael
Kinsley
</P>
<P>
   Understandably eager to win back the White House now and worry
about doctrinal niceties later, the Republicans may have gotten
carried away. They have maneuvered themselves into a situation
where their leaders _ including their presidential candidate _ are
required to be disingenuous on almost every topic.
</P>
<P>
   On social issues, Republican leaders pretend to be hard-core
conservatives, when most are actually far more cosmopolitan than
they let on. Meanwhile, on domestic policy issues, they endorse new
spending and regulations like drunken liberals, while their inner
conservative surely writhes in agony. Only on foreign and military
policy does their public postur _ an incoherent mix of
pugnaciousness and isolationism _ accurately reflect their actual
beliefs, which are sincerely confused.

   2. GEORGE BUSH GOES FISHING, by Jacob Weisberg
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the Pacific Northwest is ``in play'' in the
election makes the campaign much more varied and picturesque than
it would be otherwise. In Washington and Oregon, presidential
candidates argue about fish in front of gorgeous vistas. It makes
for a nice change.
</P>
<P>
   Though George Bush has portrayed himself as a moderate,
``different kind of Republican'' on many issues, he takes an
uncompromisingly conservative, pro-industry line on the
environmental issues of the Northwest such as salmon preservation,
logging, and the expansion of national parkland by the Clinton
administration, which he opposes. But he tries to make himself out
to be a tree-hugger while he does this.

   3. NEW VICTIMS AND NEW VILLAINS IN THE OIL CRISIS, by Anne
Applebaum
</P>
<P>
   The ``coming oil crisis,'' as the American media refer to it,
has already arrived over here in Europe, bringing with it a wave of
1970s nostalgia: the gasoline lines, the specter of inflation, the
fond memories of the Carter administration (remember those peanut
cartoons?), the return to currency of old-fashioned words like
``recession.''
</P>
<P>
   But before everyone gets all weepy and starts humming Bee Gees
tunes, it might be worth looking at how different, this time
around, the international impact of the apparently unstoppable rise
in oil prices is going to be. None of the villains is going to be
quite the same _ and none of the victims either.

   4. TECH-FUTURIST GILDER CONTEMPLATES THE TELECOSM, by Rob Walker
</P>
<P>
   George Gilder's ``Microcosm,'' which appeared in 1989, was his
ecstatic appraisal of the potential of microchips to change the
world. In particular, he zeroed in on a guy named Andy Grove at a
company called Intel, which he predicted would be a force to reckon

   Texas is no longer dominated by oil rigs, cattle ranches, and a
gun-toting, yee-hawing citizenry, the New Republic's Benjamin
Soskis reports. It's a diverse place of suburbs and urban sprawl,
utterly transformed by high-tech industry and out-of-staters.

anyone, Texan or non-Texan, wants to admit,'' he marvels in the

   Who are all these people filing these ``new'' stories every four

realize they're debunking long-discredited stereotypes. Another is
that they're just too lazy to bother checking the archive before

   1. REPUBLICANS TRY TO SPIN AWAY FROM THEIR BELIEFS, by Michael
Kinsley
</P>
<P>
   Understandably eager to win back the White House now and worry
about doctrinal niceties later, the Republicans may have gotten
carried away. They have maneuvered themselves into a situation
where their leaders _ including their presidential candidate _ are
required to be disingenuous on almost every topic.
</P>
<P>
   On social issues, Republican leaders pretend to be hard-core
conservatives, when most are actually far more cosmopolitan than
they let on. Meanwhile, on domestic policy issues, they endorse new
spending and regulations like drunken liberals, while their inner
conservative surely writhes in agony. Only on foreign and military
policy does their public postur _ an incoherent mix of
pugnaciousness and isolationism _ accurately reflect their actual
beliefs, which are sincerely confused.

   2. GEORGE BUSH GOES FISHING, by Jacob Weisberg
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the Pacific Northwest is ``in play'' in the
election makes the campaign much more varied and picturesque than
it would be otherwise. In Washington and Oregon, presidential
candidates argue about fish in front of gorgeous vistas. It makes
for a nice change.
</P>
<P>
   Though George Bush has portrayed himself as a moderate,
``different kind of Republican'' on many issues, he takes an
uncompromisingly conservative, pro-industry line on the
environmental issues of the Northwest such as salmon preservation,
logging, and the expansion of national parkland by the Clinton
administration, which he opposes. But he tries to make himself out
to be a tree-hugger while he does this.

   3. NEW VICTIMS AND NEW VILLAINS IN THE OIL CRISIS, by Anne
Applebaum
</P>
<P>
   The ``coming oil crisis,'' as the American media refer to it,
has already arrived over here in Europe, bringing with it a wave of
1970s nostalgia: the gasoline lines, the specter of inflation, the
fond memories of the Carter administration (remember those peanut
cartoons?), the return to currency of old-fashioned words like
``recession.''
</P>
<P>
   But before everyone gets all weepy and starts humming Bee Gees
tunes, it might be worth looking at how different, this time
around, the international impact of the apparently unstoppable rise
in oil prices is going to be. None of the villains is going to be
quite the same _ and none of the victims either.

   4. TECH-FUTURIST GILDER CONTEMPLATES THE TELECOSM, by Rob Walker
</P>
<P>
   George Gilder's ``Microcosm,'' which appeared in 1989, was his
ecstatic appraisal of the potential of microchips to change the
world. In particular, he zeroed in on a guy named Andy Grove at a
company called Intel, which he predicted would be a force to reckon
with.
</P>
<P>
   The opening line of ``Telecosm,'' his new book, is, ``The
computer age is over.'' Gilder's new idol is bandwidth. Running
against current wisdom that sees bandwidth shortage as a problem,
he foresees an embarrassment of bandwidth. Power (and big payoffs
for investors) will migrate away from computers and switches and

all week. Tonight that means this tasteless but funny 1994 comedy
with Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels.

   ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' WB at 8: Fans of this ordinarily
excellent show were divided by this episode, which features the

&HT;     FOR SALE: LUMBER TOWN AND ALL ITS TRAPPINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By EMILY GURNON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAMOA, Calif. _ This historic company town, where timber workers
and their families once filled all the homes and traveled by ferry
to the ``mainland'' of Eureka, is for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The current owner, Simpson Samoa Co., a subsidiary of the
Seattle-based Simpson Timber Co., has offered the entire town _
including its 98 houses, a well-known restaurant, post office,
playground, restored hostelry and a handful of commercial buildings
_ for sale through a sealed-bid auction that closes Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson has owned the fog-shrouded property since 1998, when the
company bought it and 70,000 acres of redwoods from
Louisiana-Pacific. The 60-acre town came as part of the package and
was not something the company had sought, said Tom Elfers,
controller of Simpson's timber operations in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not our business to run a town,'' Elfers said. ``We're a
timber company. We hope someone can buy it, make an investment,
make it thrive.''
</P>
<P>
   Humboldt County officials are optimistic that the sale will
inject new economic juice into the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potentially, it would be a huge component to the economic
development of the region,'' said Michael Richardson, senior
planner for the county. ``There aren't that many parcels out there
that are suitable for high-intensity development.''
</P>
<P>
   The site boasts one of the few pieces of coastal land in the
area that is neither developed nor protected, Richardson said. It
also features access to roads, a railroad and a water supply.
</P>
<P>
   If it continues to lease the houses and other buildings, the new
owner will collect some $540,000 a year in rental income, according
to the sales brochure.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched between the Pacific Ocean and Humboldt Bay on the
North Coast, the narrow peninsula once housed a gas station,
company store, sawmill, shipyard, butcher shop and community
theater.
</P>
<P>
   All those have since closed. The two public schools have been
replaced by one, Peninsula Elementary, whose 90 students in grades
K-8 come from surrounding communities like Eureka, Arcata and
another peninsula town, Manila, as well as Samoa.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the town's quaint wood-frame homes, built in the 1920s,
have missing shingles, peeling paint and sagging frames.
</P>
<P>
   But for some of Samoa's 300 residents, about half of whom are
current or former timber workers, this latest change is the most
unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows what's going to happen,'' said Rose Rogers, 49,
who moved here with her husband and son 10 years ago. ``It's
wonderful, and I don't want to see it change at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideas for a Samoa of the future include affordable housing, a
new industrial park for technology companies, artists' lofts,
offices and a tourist resort.
</P>
<P>
   The restored Victorian-style hostelry, a beautiful 11-room guest
house built in 1908 for the Vance Redwood Co.'s owner, could become
a bed-and-breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Samoa is already a tourist destination: Visitors fill the long
tables once occupied by lumbermen at the famous Samoa Cookhouse,
which includes a museum and gift shop. These properties are
included in the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Since the homes are included in one parcel of land, the new
owner would have to get county supervisors to approve a new
subdivision before selling individual homes, officials said. The
land also would have to be rezoned from industrial to residential
before any new homes could be built.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson has invested a substantial amount of money for
improvements to the town, according to the auction brochure
published by Realty Marketing/Northwest, which is managing the
sale.
</P>
<P>
   About half the homes have fresh paint, new roofs or new doors.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the property has been keen. Since announcing the
auction two months ago, at a minimum bid of $1.75 million for the
town, his company has sent out more than 100 bid packages, and 50
potential buyers have visited, said John Rosenthal, president of
Realty Marketing/Northwest of Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had everything from affordable housing companies to real
estate developers to people representing pension investors,''
Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the residents, ``I'm just taking it one day at a time,''
said Dolores Weatherbee, 70, who has lived in Samoa for 55 years as
the daughter of one lumberman and then the wife of another. ``What
are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   She and others said they hoped the town would stay much as it
is. Residents have long enjoyed the quiet, close-knit atmosphere
and crime-free streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a Neighborhood Watch, but all we do (at the meetings)
is drink coffee and eat cookies,'' Rogers said. ``You can walk
around this town at midnight and be safe.''

&HT;     PEARS CAN BE THE APPLE OF YOUR EYE, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUTH FANTASIA  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union

<P>
   Although they ripen and are harvested the same time of year,
pears have been playing second fiddle to apples since Eve plucked
that fruit in the Garden of Eden. While the apple was being touted
as too inviting to resist, the pear was just another fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Things haven't changed much since Genesis.
</P>
<P>
   Americans ate roughly 3.5 pounds of pears per person in 1999,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National
Agricultural and Statistics Service, but they ate 18.7 pounds of
apples per person in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   While apples have been used for everything from pies to archery
practice to gifts for teachers, it seems like people only do two
things with pears: eat them raw or eat them poached. Maybe that's
because many cookbooks don't include anything other than poached
pear recipes. Or maybe it's because pears are so tasty when eaten
alone that they don't stick around long enough to be used in
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   But pears are just as good as apples in many recipes and even
have a few shining uses of their own.
</P>
<P>
   When buying pears of any type, look for firm fruit that is
well-shaped and free of blemishes. Since the color of pears varies
greatly, it is not a good indicator of quality.
</P>
<P>
   The texture of pears will become grainy if allowed to ripen on
the tree; therefore, pears are harvested when mature but unripe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pears in stores are usually conditioned to be one to three
days from ripeness, so buy pears about three days before you want
to eat them,'' according to the Fort Valley State University
College of Agriculture in Fort Valley, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   To ripen pears, place them in a paper bag and let them sit at
room temperature, says the USA Pear Bureau. When the pear yields
slightly if you apply gentle thumb pressure near the base of the
stem, it's ready to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett pears are one of the few varieties that signal ripeness
by changing color. Yellow Bartletts, at first green, turn bright
yellow. Red Bartletts change from a dark color to a brighter, more
brilliant red, often with some light vertical striping, according
to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are hundreds of varieties of pears, five are most
commonly found in supermarkets. They are:
</P>
<P>
   YELLOW BARTLETTS:
</P>
<P>
   Available from August through December. Aromatic and perfect for
eating fresh, this pear is very sweet and juicy. It is also
excellent for canning or cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bartletts:
</P>
<P>
   The only difference between the red and yellow versions is the
color. Red Bartletts have the same texture, flavor and uses as the
yellow version.
</P>
<P>
   Green Anjou:
</P>
<P>
   Available from October to June, these have abundant juice and a
sweet flavor. Anjous do not change color as they ripen.
</P>
<P>
   BOSC:
</P>
<P>
   This highly aromatic pear is the one often used for poaching
since it has a classic pear shape and dense flesh that stands up to
cooking. Boscs are the brownish pears, usually available from
August through February.
</P>
<P>
   SECKEL:
</P>
<P>
   These are the little, maroon- and olive-colored gems with a
sweet flavor. They are great to use in children's lunches or as a
garnish.

MEXICAN MODERN: BACK TO A FUTURE THAT FELL BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 17)  
 By VICKI GOLDBERG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a point between the two world wars when
politics and economics pushed experimental modernism in the visual
arts into a corner or simply squashed it in the Soviet Union,
Germany, Italy and America. For a while in the 1920s the modernist
adventure was still going full throttle. Although many artists in
Europe and the United States pulled back toward stylistic reason
and classicism immediately after the chaos of World War I,
avant-garde experiments like Dada, Suprematism, abstraction and
Surrealism continued to strike sparks in much of Europe and the
USSR in the 1920s and even in the 1930s where dictators did not
forbid them or social causes overshadow them. Mexico was a special
case. Early 20th-century art movements had a negligible influence
there before the 1920s. Just when they began to have an effect, the
Mexican muralist movement spread across the country's walls and by
its artistic power, nationalistic appeal and its very size and
visibility, marginalized the modernist currents pulsing through the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The muralist movement, set in motion by a government plan for
the ``Salvation and Regeneration of Mexico Through Culture'' in
1920, ignored European currents like Cubism and abstraction. Diego
Rivera, who had been a Cubist for several years in Europe before
turning away from it, devised a mural style that combined realism,
primitivism, myth and politics. Neither Jose Clemente Orozco nor
David Alfaro Siqueiros paid any more attention to Cubism or
abstraction than he did.
</P>
<P>
   And yet experimentalism did spring up and never died in Mexico;
it just stayed in the shade. A glimpse of vanguard modernism in
photography, which has been studiously neglected (and probably
largely unknown) by historians, may be caught in the gallery of the
Mexican Cultural Institute on East 39th street, in a quiet and
elegant little show called ``Otras Cosas: Abstract Photography.''
Malin Barth is the curator of this exhibition of 27 images by
Emilio Amero, Lola Alvarez Bravo, Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Augustin
Jimenez and Rosa Covarrubias, most from the late 1920s and early
1930s, a few from the 1950s. A brief catalog is available.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez Bravo, born in 1902 and by far the best known of the
five, is widely recognized as a major player in early modernist
photography as well as a vital influence on Mexican photography.
His most familiar images, taken on the street, distill the
commonplace experiences of a Mexican city into moments pregnant
with potential and resonant with mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Less well known are his modernist experiments with abstraction
and ambiguous details in the 1920s, which first brought him to
public attention in Mexico in 1928. For a series of ``Paper
Games,'' Alvarez Bravo let his adding machine spew out paper tape
that wound itself into unforeseeable shapes, and then photographed
the results close up. In 1931 he won first prize in a contest
sponsored by the Tolteca Cement Co. with a photograph that is at
once a geometric exercise and an index to information about the
subject. A trapezoidal form, actually a cement wall that recedes
too rapidly, stands on a slanted bed of crushed pebbles used for
making cement. The dark background, punctuated by lighter diagonal
lines, is the ceiling of the cement factory. Alvarez Bravo's lens
turns both site and process into spare emblems of modernity.
</P>
<P>
   He taught photography to his first wife, Lola Alvarez Bravo
(1907-1993), and she made a career of it, keeping his name after
they divorced. She is the late comer in this show; though she was
photographing by the mid-1930s, most of her pictures then were
portraits and street work. The selection here is of landscapes
taken in the 1940s and 1950s; they are less devoted to the
principles of abstraction than some of the other images in ``Otras
Cosas,'' though they immerse the viewer in roots and leaves and
branches without horizon, beginning or end.
</P>
<P>
   As a muralist, Emilio Amero (1901-1976) assisted Rivera and
Orozco; later he made experimental films and earned most of his
reputation as a lithographer. In the early 1930s he made
photograms, a cameraless technique thought of as a pre-eminently
modern way to make the familiar strange. Amero experimented with
the process and produced an unusual range of tones by exposing the
paper to light in the darkroom several times _ most photograms are
exposed only once _ and changing the light's intensity. His
rigorously constructed compositions, mostly of mass-manufactured
objects like gears and springs, include cut-out shapes as well as
actual objects placed on the emulsion and proclaim their modernism
by technique, composition and the use of machine parts and
utilitarian products.
</P>
<P>
   Augustin Jimenez's (1901-1974) photographs were shown in America
and London between 1929 and 1931 to good reviews. He subsequently
devoted himself to cinema, collaborating with Sergei Eisenstein and
working with Bunuel as well as making some films on his own. In
this show, his photographs from around 1931 concentrate on
repetitive elements that form patterns when ripped out of context:
The spines of a cactus, a line of rifles on a rack, the open-work
shadows of some sort of umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Covarrubias (1895-1970), wife of the painter and
illustrator Miguel Covarrubias, played with photograms in a manner
so different from Amero's that it might be called _ at risk of
sounding politically incorrect _ feminine modern. Two of her images
begin with drawings of herself in the nude and add emblematic
objects like shells, a sunburst, a Mexican ceramic animal, a goblet
turned upside down to make the outline of a full-skirted dress that
does not obscure her naked body. One photogram of a glass, lace and
a butterfly could certainly have been made by a man, but in the
context of her other work it looks like a riff on feminine
preoccupations. She won third prize in the Tolteca competition,
reportedly with the most abstract composition of all.
</P>
<P>
   Covarrubias was a striking woman even with her clothes on, and
Edward Weston took her portrait more than once. He and Tina
Modotti, who had moved to Mexico together in 1923, taught her
photography. How well she learned the lesson is evident from her
photogram of a halved cabbage, most likely made after Weston had
left Mexico and certainly before his extreme close-up of a halved
artichoke, which it strongly resembles.
</P>
<P>
   All of this work follows modernist dictates, even regarding
experiment, with an air of assurance, suggesting on the basis of
limited material that photographic modernism had a respectable
outpost in Mexico at the time. The surprise is that it exists in
some quantity, since so little of it has been seen here.
</P>
<P>
   Modernism came to Mexico from abroad. In photography, and to
some degree in painting, Weston and Modotti were primary influences
(though Covarrubias probably learned about photograms in Europe in
1926 when she became friends with Man Ray). In the 1920s and 1930s,
several outstanding foreign photographers, including Weston,
Modotti, Paul Strand and Henri Cartier-Bresson (and Eisenstein),
worked for a time in Mexico, and their presence enriched the
culture of that country, if not as greatly as it enriched the
culture of the visitors.

<TEXT>
<P>
   People on the streets of Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo have more
than once had to ask themselves if they're not living in a soap
opera.
</P>
<P>
   Passion is such common coinage in Brazil that novelists don't
have to invent anything _ real life has already done so.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, crimes of passion in Brazil occur in the
favelas, communities of misery and poverty that surround big
cities, but even the famous are not immune. They, too, can succumb
to the same consuming emotion, because passion recognizes no class.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:30 p.m. on Sunday, Aug. 20, Antonio Marcos Pimenta Neves,
63, pumped two bullets into Sandra Gomide, 32, killing her
instantly. They both worked for the same company and had been
lovers for three years.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Sandra had been trying to break off the affair but
the obsessive Pimenta, distraught with jealousy and desperation,
would not let go.
</P>
<P>
   His consuming suspicion was that she was seeing someone else. To
find out, he started going through e-mail on her computer, and as
she walked down the street he'd follow her, blind with jealousy, in
his car, crashing into things along the way. At night he took to
watching the shadows in the windows of her house for hours, just
like James Stewart in ``Rear Window.''
</P>
<P>
   Described like this, this crime seems much like any other of the
many that happen every day. But it is not. Pimenta Neves, whom I
met briefly at a luncheon in 1996, was one of the most powerful
newspapermen in Brazil. A prudent, serious and reflective man, no
one could possibly imagine he'd be capable of violent passion.
</P>
<P>
   When I met him at a restaurant in Sao Paulo, we discovered we
had been film critics during the same era and that we had loved the
same movies. At the time, Pimenta had just returned from
Washington, where he'd served as an adviser at the World Bank, and
had become editor of Gazeta Mercantil, Brazil's most prestigious
financial daily.
</P>
<P>
   I knew that his twin daughters, born in 1972, lived in
Washington with their mother, and that loneliness at times engulfed
him. The year after our meeting, he was named editor of O Estado de
Sao Paulo, and thereafter I lost track of him. So the man I met was
a very different Pimenta.
</P>
<P>
   At some point during 1997 Pimenta fell in love with Sandra
Gomide, business editor at Gazeta Mercantil, and when he moved to O
Estado, he took her with him.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of months, Sandra soared to dizzying heights at the
newspaper. Her $1,000 monthly salary as a special reporter rose
nearly fivefold. A striking and sensual woman, she was, it seemed,
amazingly intelligent. Returning to postgraduate studies for her
Master's at Sao Paolo's Research Institute, her articles early this
year on aviation mergers in Brazil were a must-read for anyone in
business or media.
</P>
<P>
   But something started going wrong between the two lovers. Two
months ago, during an editors' meeting at O Estado, Pimenta
complained that Sandra was neglecting her work and that he had
asked for her resignation. Then he was seen going through Sandra's
private mail on her computer to check for messages from an
Ecuadorian businessman with whom Pimenta suspected she was in love.
</P>
<P>
   This story is not all that different from other famous tales of
fiction, such as that of Carmen in Prosper Merimee's novel of the
same name, or that of Lola Lola or Rosa in Heinrich Mann's ``The
Blue Angel.'' But Brazilian crimes are moved by more complex
passions. Sometimes it's a matter of wounded pride, self-respect or
honor, but most times it's all about possessiveness.
</P>
<P>
   There are countless examples and some are still alive in
people's memories today, like the unforgetable murder of writer
Euclides da Cunha, author of the Brazilian classic ``Os Serties.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1906, Da Cunha was a member of the Brazilian Academy
of Letters, supervisor of Public Works and one of the most
distinguished figures in the country. He had just come back from a
14-month trip on the Amazon, to find his wife Saninha pregnant.
Rather than disowning her, he decided to adopt the baby. A year
later another boy was born _ again, not his _ and he also accepted
him without reproach. He only reacted strongly when Saninha left
him to live with her lover of all those years, Dilermando de Assis.
</P>
<P>
   Da Cunha, who had accepted adultery, could not accept
abandonment. He went to his rival's house and, after shooting in
the air, he pointed the gun at Saninha. But Dilermando, national
rifle champion, was quicker on the draw and shot Da Cunha clean
through the chest. Da Cunha's death was a national tragedy and
Brazil decreed an official three-day mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Pimenta, too, could not accept Sandra leaving him. He'd appear
at her apartment at any hour of the day or night, with a variety of
excuses, and sometimes he even hit her. Sandra reported him to the
police on charges of ``forced entry and battery,'' but nothing came
of it. The police just thought it was a mere quarrel between an
immensely powerful man and his lover.
</P>
<P>
   At daybreak, Aug. 20, Pimenta left for the outskirts of Sao
Paulo where he often rode to release his tension and where Sandra's
family kept two horses. He knew that she would appear at any
moment, as she did every Sunday. He waited for her till 2:30 in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   When he saw her arrive, he took out his gun and said he was
going to kill her _ and himself _ if she insisted on leaving him.
Sandra cried, ``No, Pimenta! Don't do it!''
</P>
<P>
   Two shots were heard. The first bullet hit her in the chest,
puncturing a lung, the second bullet caught her in the head, just
above the left ear, as she fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Pimenta soberly gathered up the spent shells and fled in his
car. For hours he drove aimlessly around nearby rural Ibiuna until
finally he decided to seek refuge at a friend's house. On the
Tuesday afternoon he wrote a farewell letter to his daughters,
saying he had lost all interest in living. He took a huge dose of
barbituates and lay down to die. He was found unconscious two hours
later and paramedics were able to resuscitate him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Pimenta has turned the tables and become the
accuser, charging that the dead woman had ``personally and
professionally'' deceived him, ridiculed his honor and given him a
venereal disease.
</P>
<P>
   Was the crime, then, an act of blind passion, or vengeance, or
the destruction of a woman by a sick man who could no longer
possess her? Two of Brazil's most intelligent women, novelist
Nelida Pinon and sociologist Rosiska Darcy de Oliveira believe that
violence continues to be the macho's only way of expression in
response to wounded pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society itself is an accomplice,'' says Darcy de Oliveira.
``The Penal Code doesn't prescribe any form of punishment for a man
who beats a woman. And from there to murder is only a small step.''
</P>
<P>
   Confined to a rest home, Pimenta has shown no remorse and has
self-confidently assumed the role of victim. He is conscious only
of living in a soap opera. What he doesn't know is that those
condemned to that hell can never leave.

   HIGHLAND PARK, N.J. _ Mas de una vez, en las calles de Rio de
Janeiro o en las de San Pablo, la gente se ha preguntado si esta
caminando dentro de una telenovela.
</P>
<P>
   La pasion es un lenguaje tan comun en Brasil, tan cotidiano, que
los autores de ficcion no necesitan inventar nada, porque la
realidad lo inventa antes que ellos.
</P>
<P>
   Los crimenes de amor suceden a menudo en las favelas, pero
tambien es usual que los cometan los personajes famosos, porque en
Brasil la efervescencia de los sentimientos no reconoce diferencia
de clases.
</P>
<P>
   El domingo 20 de agosto, a las 2:30 de la tarde, Antonio Marcos
Pimenta Neves, de 63 anos, asesino de dos balazos a Sandra Gomide,
de 32. Ambos trabajaban en la misma empresa y habian sido amantes
durante tres anos.
</P>
<P>
   Desde hacia meses, Sandra queria romper la relacion, pero el
obsesivo Pimenta, enfermo de desesperacion y de despecho, no se lo
permitia. Imaginaba que ella se habia enamorado de otro hombre mas
joven, y para sorprenderla, abria el correo de su computadora, la
perseguia _ ciego de celos _ en automoviles que iba estrellando por
las calles, vigilaba las sombras de su casa por las noches, como
James Stewart en La ventana indiscreta.
</P>
<P>
   Contado de esa manera, el crimen parece uno de tantos. No lo es.
Pimenta Neves _ a quien conoci fugazmente durante un almuerzo en
1996 _ era uno de los periodistas mas poderosos de Brasil. De
modales cautos, formales, reflexivos, nadie habria dicho que era
capaz de una pasion violenta.
</P>
<P>
   Cuando coincidi con el en un restaurante japones de San Pablo,
descubrimos que habiamos sido criticos de cine en la misma epoca y
que habiamos amado las mismas peliculas. Pimenta acababa entonces
de regresar de Washington, donde habia servido como asesor del
Banco Mundial, y dirigia Gazeta Mercantil, el diario economico mas
prestigioso de Brasil.
</P>
<P>
   Supe que sus dos hijas gemelas, nacidas en 1972, vivian en
Washington con la madre, y que la soledad, a veces, le pesaba. Al
ano siguiente de nuestro encuentro lo nombraron director de O
Estado de Sao Paulo y en ese momento lo perdi de vista. El Antonio
Pimenta Neves al que conoci es, por lo tanto, anterior al de la
tragedia.
</P>
<P>
   En algun momento de 1997 se enamoro de Sandra Gomide, la editora
de la seccion Empresas &AMP; Negocios en Gazeta Mercantil y cuando paso
a O Estado se la llevo consigo.
</P>
<P>
   En pocos meses, Sandra vivio ascensos de vertigo. Su salario de
redactora especial, mil dolares, subio casi cinco veces. Era una
mujer llamativa y sensual y, al parecer, de una asombrosa
inteligencia. Estaba haciendo estudios de posgrado en el Instituto
de Investigaciones de San Pablo y sus articulos sobre las fusiones
en las empresas brasilenas de aviacion fueron citados por toda la
prensa del pais a comienzos de ano.
</P>
<P>
   Algo debia de andar mal entre ella y su enamorado porque hace un
par de meses, en una reunion de editores de O Estado, Pimenta se
quejo de que Sandra estaba descuidando su trabajo y anuncio que le
habia pedido la renuncia. En la redaccion del diario vieron al
director investigando en el correo privado de la computadora de
Sandra para leer los mensajes que ella habria recibido de un
empresario ecuatoriano, del cual creia Pimenta, sin razon alguna,
la joven se habia enamorado.
</P>
<P>
   La historia no parece diferir de otras que son ya celebres en la
ficcion, como la historia de Carmen en la novela homonima de
Prosper Merimee y la de Lola Lola o Rosa en ``El Angel Azul'' de
Heinrich Mann. Los crimenes brasilenos son movidos, sin embargo,
por pasiones mas complejas. A veces los desata el amor propio o la
honra herida, pero la causa mas frecuente es el afan de posesion.
</P>
<P>
   Los ejemplos abundan, y algunos siguen aun vivos en la memoria
de la gente, como el inolvidable crimen del escritor Euclides da
Cunha, autor del clasico Setti.
</P>
<P>
   En enero de 1906, Da Cunha era miembro de la Academia Brasilena
de Letras, superintendente de Obras Publicas y una de las
personalidades mas notables del pais. Al regresar de un viaje de 14
meses por el Amazonas, encontro embarazada a su esposa Saninha. En
vez de repudiarla, decidio adoptar al nino. Al cabo de otro ano,
nacio un segundo hijo que no era suyo, y tambien lo admitio sin
reproches. Solo reacciono cuando, en agosto de 1909, Saninha
abandono el hogar conyugal y se fue a vivir con el amante de todos
esos anos, Dilermando de Assis.
</P>
<P>
   Da Cunha, que habia admitido el adulterio, no pudo tolerar el
abandono. Se presento en la casa de su rival, y luego de disparar
su revolver al aire, apunto al corazon de Saninha. Se le adelanto
Dilermando, que era campeon nacional de tiro al blanco, con un
balazo certero en el pecho. La muerte de Da Cunha fue una tragedia
por la que Brasil guardo tres dias de luto publico.
</P>
<P>
   Tampoco Pimenta quiso aceptar el abandono de Sandra. Se
presentaba en su departamento a cualquier hora del dia o de la
noche, con pretextos diversos, y en algunas ocasiones la
abofeteaba. Sandra lo denuncio a la policia por ``invasion de
domicilio y agresiones,'' pero nada paso. Los investigadores
imaginaron que se trataba solo de reyertas triviales entre un
hombre de inmenso poder y la mujer que amaba.
</P>
<P>
   El 20 de agosto al amanecer Pimenta llego a Setti, cerca de San
Pablo, donde solia descargar sus tensiones cabalgando y donde la
familia de Sandra guardaba dos caballos. Sabia que en cualquier
momento ella apareceria, como todos los domingos. Espero hasta las
2:30 de la tarde.
</P>
<P>
   Cuando la vio llegar, desenfundo el revolver Taurus calibre 38
que llevaba consigo y le dijo que iba a matarla y a suicidarse si
insistia en abandonarlo. Sandra grito ``No lo hagas, Pimenta! No!''
</P>
<P>
   Se oyeron entonces dos balazos: uno acerto a la victima en un
pulmon; el otro, mientras caia, le fue disparado a la cabeza, desde
una distancia de 40 centimetros, un poco por arriba de la oreja
izquierda.
</P>
<P>
   Pimenta recogio con parsimonia las dos capsulas servidas y huyo
en su automovil. Durante horas vago por la zona rural de Ibiuna, en
las cercanias de donde cometio el crimen, hasta que decidio buscar
refugio en casa de un amigo.
</P>
<P>
   El martes por la tarde escribio una carta de despedida a sus
hijas gemelas en la que dijo que habia perdido todo interes en la
vida. Tomo una dosis excesiva de Lexotanil y se tendio en la cama a
morir. Lo encontraron a las dos horas y lo rescataron del coma en
el que estaba sumido.
</P>
<P>
   Ahora, Pimenta se ha convertido en acusador de la muerta.
Sostiene que ella lo enganaba ``personal y profesionalmente,'' que
burlo su honra y que le contagio una enfermedad venerea.
</P>
<P>
   El crimen fue entonces un acto de pasion ciega, la trama de una
venganza o la destruccion del objeto amado por un enfermo que ya no
podia poseerlo? Dos de las mujeres mas inteligentes de Brasil, la
novelista Nelida Pinon y la sociologa Rosiska Darcy de Oliveira
suponen que la violencia sigue siendo el unico modo de expresion de
todo macho que siente su orgullo herido.
</P>
<P>
   ``La propia sociedad es complice,'' dice Rosiska. ``El Codigo
Penal no preve ningun castigo para el hombre que golpea a la mujer.
Y de alli al crimen hay solo un paso.''
</P>
<P>
   Recluido en un hospital de reposo, Pimenta se ha desentendido
ahora de todo arrepentimiento y asume, confiado, el papel de
victima. Sabe desde hace tiempo que ha entrado en una telenovela.
Lo que no sabe es que los condenados a ese infierno ya jamas pueden
salir de el.

CAMERON CROWE'S ROCK-NOSTALGIA PIECE IS UNFOCUSED AND TOO ADMIRING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CHRISTOPHER KELLY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a beautiful scene about halfway through Cameron Crowe's
``Almost Famous'' that finds Stillwater, the fictional 1970s rock
band at the center of the film, aboard the tour bus on a sunburnt
morning out of Kansas. In the front of the bus, the magnetic
guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) recovers from an evening
of drugs and booze; his bandmates lounge around bored and tired,
groupies at their sides; and in the back, William Miller (Patrick
Fugit), the 15-year-old rock journalist covering the group for
Rolling Stone magazine, sits next to Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), a
groupie he's fast falling in love with, but who is in love with
Russell.
</P>
<P>
   A song comes on the radio _ ``Tiny Dancer,'' one of Elton John's
soaring early-'70s anthems of heartbreak; one of the band members
begins to sing along. And then, one by one, everyone else rises
from their hazy slumber to join in _ quickly building to a
crescendo that's both exultant and, in its brevity and elusiveness,
oddly, unavoidably melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost Famous'' is a memory piece _ writer-director Cameron
Crowe (''Jerry Maguire'') based the screenplay on his experiences
as a boy-wonder rock journalist _ but what makes it such a
frustrating experience is that this scene is one of the few that
come through with any degree of emotional clarity. Crowe locates an
underlying theme here _ namely, the way popular music creates
powerful, yet ephemeral, links between its listeners _ and he
brings it to the fore with a quiet, unforced eloquence. But for so
much of the rest of the film, he seems to be remembering
experiences that he doesn't have a hold on, and emotions that he's
never completely sorted out for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost Famous'' is certainly in need of an editor (it's at
least 15 minutes too long, and it has a half-dozen characters too
many), but what it seems most in need of is a psychotherapist _
someone who can help Crowe give his adolescence a meaning and a
focus.
</P>
<P>
   The Crowe stand-in is William, a precocious San Diego teen-ager
who has already skipped two grades in school. His overprotective
mother (Frances McDormand) abhors rock music, driving older sister
Anita (Zooey Deschanel) out of the house with her rants against sex
and drugs. But William has been writing music reviews for a local
underground paper and sending his work to Creem magazine editor
Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and to the editors at Rolling
Stone magazine. Eventually, he's awarded a major assignment _
following Stillwater, a struggling band on the brink of a
breakthrough, on tour.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe has a loose narrative thread running through the movie _
William keeps trying to get a one-on-one interview with Russell _
but the screenplay is mostly anecdotal. Russell attends a party and
drops too much acid; the band has petty squabbles over whether
Russell is trying to steal the spotlight; the groupies decide to
help William lose his virginity. Along the way, a love triangle
develops, also: William wants Penny, Penny wants Russell, and
Russell wants to sleep with Penny without his steady girlfriend
back in New York ever finding out.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't with the episodic structure. I think if Crowe
had decided to play these episodes out with a more relaxed whimsy,
he might have had a low-key sleeper. But instead, in scene after
scene, you feel him trying for meaning that the material can't
support _ or meaning that remains too deeply embedded in his brain
to make any sense to the viewer. After a while, the film loses its
center. Is it William's story? Penny and Russell's? Stillwater's? I
don't quite understand the exact nature of William's journey,
either. Are we supposed to root for him to win Penny's heart _ or
to be the one who finally brings Penny and Russell together? Is he
supposed to become a great journalist _ or realize that journalists
are gadflies who have no friends?
</P>
<P>
   These sorts of problems aren't uncommon for autobiographical
works; there are periods of many people's lives that remain too
emotionally complicated for them to ever come to terms with, much
less shape into a coherent 120-minute film. And there are things
here, it should be said, that are as good as anything Crowe has
ever done. Always showing a gentle touch with his actors, he works
particular wonders with his ensemble, especially McDormand, who
finds depths of humanity in her broadly written, too-small part,
and Hoffman, who captures the real-life Bangs' crinkly edges with
surprising warmth.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, ``Almost Famous'' feels at once
overdeliberated and too thin _ very much made by (and for) a
middle-aged white guy on the road to his first midlife crisis and
in desperate need of validation. And while Crowe may be clinging to
his self-image as a progressive hipster, a lot of his formulations
also seem terribly old-school. He tries to do right by the women in
the film _ at one point, William calls the groupies the purest kind
of fans _ but they still come off as slutty, hangers-on cliches.
Meanwhile, the soundtrack, which features Led Zeppelin , Deep
Purple and The Who, among many others, feels a bit too worshipful
of these (mostly white) '70s rock gods to have much resonance for
today's hip-hop-weaned teen-agers. Crowe deserves credit for his
ambition and heart-felt sincerity. But as much as you may want to
like it, ``Almost Famous'' simply refuses to sing.

&HT;     TURNING A MIDLIFE CRISIS INTO A BIG SPLASH

<P>
   (From ``I Wanna Be a Lifeguard'' by Broadway Blotto)
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The 250-pound man is floating face-down in the
deep end of the pool, so you jump in with a rescue tube and swim.
You hook him under the arms, tilting his back onto the tube, and
then start kicking. Only this guy isn't going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, you've traveled maybe five feet. Two minutes of
exerting like mad, finally you cover the 15 feet to poolside.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's midlife crisis takes a different turn. Mine has
morphed into dreams of a tall chair overlooking the beach in
Trinidad. Sand between my toes. White stuff on my nose.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, I took the Red Cross lifeguarding course. I had
thought, at first, it was going to be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, you just about had to be Johnny Weismuller to
be a lifeguard.
</P>
<P>
   You had to be able to outswim a school of piranha, and you had
to be able to wrestle a giant crocodile into submission, and then
you had to haul that monster to shore by yourself, using only a
cross-chest hold and a modified sidestroke.
</P>
<P>
   Even for Weismuller, who did this in Tarzan movies, it wasn't
easy. He'd been an Olympic swimmer, and he could do just about
anything with large animals and water.
</P>
<P>
   When the Red Cross began offering lifeguard training in 1914, it
never actually involved crocodiles. But you had to be able to swim
far, tread water for a long time and rescue struggling victims
without any equipment, using various grappling techniques to get
the upper hand, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   The burly Commodore Wilbert E. Longfellow founded the program to
end what was a mounting toll from drownings. In old photographs, he
looks like he could have done the job single-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you didn't have to be Johnny Weismuller. But you had to be
Jack LaLanne or Buster Crabbe, or a member of the UCLA water polo
team, just about. It wasn't for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the whole business has evolved _ the result of
technology and more astute observation about how people actually
drown.
</P>
<P>
   Now that struggling victim would be classified in the Red Cross
manual as ``a distressed swimmer.'' If you couldn't reach out to
him from poolside, you'd jump in and pass him one end of the rescue
tube, keeping him away from you and afloat, and drag him back.
</P>
<P>
   If he progressed to ``active drowning victim,'' he'd probably be
incapable of grabbing the tube, and his few gasping movements would
be limited to what the Red Cross calls the ``instinctive drowning
response'' (the one that makes you wonder how the human race
survived long enough to learn to dog paddle).
</P>
<P>
   Then you hook him from behind, using the tube to keep you both
afloat, and start kicking. I did that with a 250-pound ``victim.''
It took two minutes to move him 15 feet, and I only swallowed water
twice.
</P>
<P>
   But I passed the Red Cross tests, which proves it doesn't take
an Olympian anymore.
</P>
<P>
   You have to swim 500 yards (20 pool lengths); tread water for
two minutes (no hands); retrieve a rubber brick from the bottom of
the pool; retrieve a human from the bottom of the pool; spend about
40 hours of class time; read two books; pass multiple-choice tests
on first-aid, safety and rescue; and certify in CPR. It cost $70.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part was being a 45-year-old among 15-year-olds (15
is the minimum age), who were polite but not entirely enthusiastic
about having a geezer in the class. And you could see bystanders
wondering why the old guy was hanging around the kids.
</P>
<P>
   The best part was being three times the age of the other
students _ who didn't really want you to be their victim. At the
Glen Hills Club, outdoors on a cool evening in late summer, you
don't want to be the one feigning spinal injury, the one that
they're taking 10 minutes or so to strap onto a backboard and pull
out of the diving well.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the practical point for a middle-aged man? Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   My daughter, who's also 15, made $5.50 and $6.25 an hour this
summer in her two, part-time guarding jobs. On her last scheduled
workday, I asked if she'd let me come out there and sit in the
chair for a few minutes with her whistle and the rescue tube. Being
all certified now. No, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's actually a serious business, done around here mostly by
teen-agers at cement pools. Preventing spinal cord injuries and
drownings. Keeping little kids from bobbing around where they can't
touch bottom and can't get out. Keeping knuckleheads from diving
head first into the shallow end.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'70s, a film came out titled ``Lifeguard'' in which
Sam Elliott portrayed a guy attending his 15-year high school
reunion. He was still a lifeguard, and everybody looked at him like
he was a loser. Now there's ``Baywatch'' on TV, making it appear
more glamorous as a career option.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported this summer that some Northeastern
beaches, facing a lifeguard shortage, recruited middle-aged
executives to come back on weekends and moonlight at the jobs
they'd held 20 years ago. They said it recalled the best times of
their youth.
</P>
<P>
   But to work at the ocean, you need a separate certification,
which is supposed to be more rigorous, on account of the surf.
</P>
<P>
   Volusia County, Fla., where lifeguards make approximately 3,000
ocean rescues a year, requires taking its course, annually swimming
500 meters, emergency medical technician certification, and ability
to tolerate ``inclement weather'' and ocean temperatures as low as
50 F. For entry-level seasonal work, it starts at $6.50 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Volusia Beach Patrol's senior lifeguard positions pay up to
$13.80, but you're also sworn in as a law-enforcement officer and
have to swim 500 meters in less than 10 minutes. A little too close
to Weismuller territory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's Trinidad. Warmer water than Daytona. And maybe
they think geezer guards aren't bad for tourism. Make the
vacationers feel youthful.
</P>
<P>
   And if not? Dream about a beach chair, get out the sunblock, and
hum a few bars of the Blotto song.

A MOVIE OF MANY `RESOURCES'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRISTOPHER KELLY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   American movies so rarely have anything substantive to say about
people's work (Steven Soderbergh's wonderful ``Erin Brockovich'' is
perhaps the year's only exception) that foreign viewers might
simply assume that ours is a nation of leisure. But that's not the
case for the French, who, with movies like ``A Single Girl'' (about
a day in the life of a chambermaid) and ``Post Coitum'' (about a
book editor's obsessive relationship with one of her writers) have
shown a probing interest in the ways by which everyday folks earn
their keep.
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Cantet's ``Human Resources'' is both a welcome addition
to the genre and a vivid, moving reminder of that central role that
work plays in our lives. Jalil Lespert plays Franck, a Parisian
college student who returns home for a summer internship in the
management offices of the factory where his father has toiled for
30 years. The bosses are busy trying to implement a 35-hour
workweek _ which will mean less overtime and money for the workers,
who oppose the plan. Franck wants to involve the workers in the
labor negotiations, but the bosses seem more intent on using his
plan for a referendum to justify more firings.
</P>
<P>
   You'll figure out quickly where the story is headed (hint:
Franck's dad is only five years from retirement age), but Cantet
has made a film of real purpose and intelligence, with his crisp
shooting style and complicated characterizations of everyone from
the ready-to-fight union representative to the middle manager
fearful that Franck is trying to usurp his power to the younger
worker coming to terms with the soul-deadening nature of his work.
Indeed, what a refreshing, simple pleasure just to hear characters
talk about what it is they do for a living and how it makes them
feel.
</P>
<P>
   I do wish the director hadn't ultimately decided to paint
Franck's conflict in such black-and-white, ``workers
good''/''management bad'' terms. The sequence in which Franck joins
with the union to strike against the company is moving, but it
doesn't tell us much about how this soulful idealist will ever find
his own place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cantet has brought a whole range of fascinating ideas to
the table _ about the gulf that develops between uneducated parents
and their educated children; and about how corporate culture is
often defined by an unwillingness on the part of all employees to
listen to one another. Lespert, too, is a major find. The French
cinema has never been in short supply of brooding, brown-eyed,
hunky intellectual types, but he captures Franck's shifts from
haughtiness to empathy, and from ambition to self-disgust, with a
control and authority that suggests his own career is going to be a
long one.

&HT;     ARMY HOPES ON-LINE UNIVERSITY WILL HELP KEEP RECRUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (ATTN: Ga., Ky., Texas)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Army Secretary Louis Caldera, rolling out a new
incentive to keep recruits in the military, says a groundbreaking
on-line education program will allow soldiers to earn degrees while
serving at posts in the United States and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Benning, Ga.; Fort Campbell, Ky.; and Fort Hood, Texas,
will serve as the first three sites for the Army University Access
Online education initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The $598 million, six-year program is to begin in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest way the services have thought of education is as a
benefit for departing soldiers, the GI Bill model,'' Caldera said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a completely different model which says that instead
of giving it as a benefit for people who served in the military,
make it an incentive for people to join and stay in the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Unveiled by Caldera two months ago, the program is one of
several Army initiatives designed to help counter a generally
downward slide in enlistment and retention.
</P>
<P>
   Though Army retention has risen over the past year and the
service also has met its recruiting goals, signing up 80,000 new
soldiers, Caldera said he believes that many of those leaving are
using educational incentives earned during their enlistment to
complete college degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The Army, he said, is taking the lead in creating an on-line
university system and taking its commitment to in-service education
``to a whole new level.'' The program will offer soldiers the
opportunity to earn two-year, four-year and post-graduate degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime military observers, among them the University of
Maryland's David Segal and former Pentagon leader Sara Lister, see
the move as a bold step.
</P>
<P>
   ``It think it's raising the ramp significantly,'' said Segal,
director of the Center for Research on Military Organization, a
think tank. ``There have been small initiatives in the past, and
the Army is saying, `Let's get more bang for the buck out of this,'
and I think they will.''
</P>
<P>
   Lister, former assistant secretary of the Army for manpower and
reserve affairs, said soldiers like to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of soldiers who have bachelor's degrees,
master's degrees. There are undoubtedly some with Ph.D.s, and what
(Caldera has) done has been very sensible and also very clever, and
it certainly should help retention,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has traditionally offered education benefits to draw
recruits into the service, but has had trouble keeping veteran
soldiers because many of them have left to complete their
education, Segal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only recently, I think, that the services have explicitly
realized that the real competition is not McDonald's, it's the
college down the street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern University sociologist Charles Moskos, the author
of ``The Postmodern Military: Armed Forces After the Cold War,''
said soldiers he met earlier this month in Kosovo complained they
didn't have time to answer e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Moskos said, ``I'm cautiously optimistic. It's worth the
effort.''

PURVEYORS OF VULGARITY AND VIOLENCE ARE DOING US NO FAVORS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CECIL JOHNSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the F-word was heard in a movie or over the radio, there
was the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Before simulated coitus was allowed on movie or television
screens, there was the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Before the blood and gore of the gangster movies and video
games, there was the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Long live the First Amendment. May it ever provide creative
artists and pretenders to that vocation the freedom to make and
distribute their creations. As Americans protected by that
provision of the Constitution, filmmakers, music producers and
video game manufacturers have the right to dispense products using
the most extreme vocabularies of sex and violence if they choose to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   Undeniably, that is their right. That does not mean, however,
that it is right for them to do it. And one can make a strong case
that, by doing so, they are wronging society and jeopardizing their
freedom and everyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans who are still ambulatory and alert can remember
the days when some novels now considered to be classics were banned
in all or certain parts of this country because they contained a
few words or scenes that today would be considered quite tame.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, anything _ with a few exceptions of time and
place _ goes. And that near-total license has led to a spiraling
degradation of cultural and aesthetic standards. The profusion of
protected vulgarity has contributed to a pervasive mediocrity in
popular entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Comedians don't have to be funny anymore. They have only to yell
obscenities. The same holds true in much of what passes for music
for the masses. Rhythmic noise overlaid with offensive language,
violent or sexually degrading images and fractured rhymes drowns
out popular music that evidences talent.
</P>
<P>
   Variations of the F-word predominate in what passes for dialogue
in the preponderance of movies that elevate violence and special
effects above imaginative plotting and insightful characterization.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it is easier to do that. Moreover, the entertainment
industry has conditioned much of the public into thinking that this
is what it really wants. The truth, of course, is that the public
comes to want what the entertainment industry gives it.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the wholly unscrupulous marketing of killing games
that pander to the basest instincts of children and adults alike.
The cumulative effect of prolonged and persistent participation in
such games is to reduce the players' sensitivity to the value of
life. The subconscious mind, after all, can't distinguish between
real and virtual murder.
</P>
<P>
   This diatribe obviously was triggered by the Federal Trade
Commission report that accuses some filmmakers, music producers and
video game manufacturers of surreptitiously marketing entertainment
products to children that are labeled for adults.
</P>
<P>
   Both presidential candidates, predictably, have seized upon the
FTC report as a rationale for calling upon the entertainment
industry to cease and desist from the egregious practice. And just
as predictably, entertainment industry moguls have denied doing it.
</P>
<P>
   This makes for good political theater. But the politicians and
entertainment sellers are all skirting the real issue. It's not
enough for the movie, music and game folks to correct their
marketing practices. They really need to cut back on making the
worthless, distasteful and dangerous junk and foisting it off on
the defenseless public.
</P>
<P>
   They can do better, because they have the talent and resources
to move to a higher plane. Unfortunately, there is so much money to
be made in adhering to the easier low road that there is little
room to hope that they will clean up their act of their own
volition.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, no one who really values the freedom guaranteed to
all Americans by the First Amendment wants to see government force
the industry to change its entirely mercenary ways. If, however,
the entertainment industry continues to abuse the protection
afforded by the First Amendment, that could happen.
</P>
<P>
   There still are powerful groups in this country that would like
to take us back to the days when ``Lady Chatterley's Lover'' and
``Ulysses'' were banned and when Lenny Bruce was jailed for saying
the F-word in a nightclub to an audience of adults.
</P>
<P>
   Those groups have a very narrow slant on the First Amendment.
And those who are abusing that precious protection today are
playing into their hands.

BAD NOTES IN `DUETS'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Paltrow doesn't have a whole lot on his resume since
beginning his producing career in 1973, the year his daughter,
Gwyneth, was born. Perhaps that explains why his new directorial
effort, ``Duets,'' looks a little like an early '70s TV-movie: a
lost, well-meaning artifact about ``looking for America'' that you
stumbled across during a late-night channel-surf.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that most of ``Duets' '' cast wasn't around in
the early '70s. Nor was karaoke, the movie's unifying topic. But
the movie echoes so many movies from that era and later that it's
like the elder Paltrow's cinematic version of karaoke _ he's
filming along to the oldies.
</P>
<P>
   The title refers not to onstage performances, but to the motley
duos that make up the movie's three interlocking story lines. These
uneasy riders include a karaoke hustler (Huey Lewis) and his
estranged daughter (Gwyneth Paltrow), who insists that he act like
a dad now that her mother's dead; a midlife-runaway salesman (Paul
Giamatti) and a not-as-harmless-as-he-seems hitchhiker (Andre
Braugher); and a disenchanted gypsy-cab driver (Scott Speedman) and
a karaoke thrush (Maria Bello) who sleeps her way into the best
hotel rooms, much to the cabdriver's dismay.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone pairs up on the way to the National Karaoke Finals in
Omaha, Neb., but it's not the climax _ which is kinda abrupt and
bizarre _ that matters here, so much as the bonding that takes
place on the road. Unfortunately, only one of the stories _ the
Giamatti-Braugher arc _ is at all developed.
</P>
<P>
   The father-daughter story is underdrawn, and for some reason,
director Bruce stuck daughter Gwyneth with the movie's most
stilted, hoary speech, about how her dad should act like a dad. And
although Bello probably gives the best performance, it's difficult
to tell just what screenwriter John Byrum is trying to do with her
and Speedman's characters.
</P>
<P>
   It's an oddball movie, and your enjoyment depends on how much it
breaks down your resistance: To Gwyneth Paltrow singing (less
painful than you'd think); to Huey Lewis acting (he seems
uncomfortable and jittery, except when he's singing); to the
soundtrack of warhorse rock and soul songs chirped by people who
were never meant to sing them in public; to the idea of karaoke
itself, which seldom sounds as good as it does in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   But if Paltrow and Byrum are trying to get at the conscience of
America today, and at the rush that onstage singing can give you,
they don't succeed. It doesn't mean that ``Duets'' won't grab you
if you're in the right mood, but in the current box-office climate,
it seems likely that most people will just plug their ears to its
uneven charms.

<P>
   While the Olympics have added weightlifting, hammer throwing and
pole vaulting as official women's events, dozens of female
Olympians have enthusiastically participated in an unofficial,
eyebrow-raising, media-covered sport -- disrobing.
</P>
<P>
   American Olympians stepped out of their warm-up outfits and into
what Maxim magazine calls ``the sexiest get-ups we could create''
for the publication's September issue. The Australian women's
soccer team, the Matildas, created its own $20 calendar featuring
full frontal nudity. Canada's Waneek Horn-Miller appeared naked
with a strategically placed water polo ball on the cover of Time
magazine's Canadian edition.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the unabashed attitudes of her fellow athletic models,
Horn-Miller told the Canadian press that she hoped to communicate
``the strength, pride and determination'' of the women's team. But
where some see strength and pride, others see unnecessary
titillation and a double standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm asking for is equal treatment,'' said Mary Jo Kane,
director of the Tucker Center for Research on Girls &AMP; Women in
Sport at the University of Minnesota. ``When Tiger Woods is on the
cover of Sports Illustrated naked, holding a golf ball with the
Nike swoosh in front of his genitals, I'll be quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Donna Lopiano, executive director of the Women's Sports
Foundation of Long Island, N.Y., ``Any exposure in a sports
magazine that minimizes athletic achievement and skill and
emphasizes the female athlete as a sex object is insulting and
degrading.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexualizing female athletes is nothing new. What's different is
that a generation of athletes seems to be cooperating with the
process, as if, said Kane, they are saying, ''`Hey, we've arrived,
we can be soft-porn icons, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the critics just don't get it, contend the athletes
competing in Australia. It's not about pornography, but an artistic
celebration of a lean and muscled athletic ideal of the female
body, one they have worked hard to achieve and are proud to
display.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions about the propriety of nude modeling aside, some argue
that beneath the debate lies societal uneasiness with women as
athletes, even as their popularity soars above men's in some
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's partly a backlash against women, a way of
diminishing their power, trivializing their strength, putting them
in their sexual place,'' said Linda Steiner, associate professor
and chair of the department of journalism and media at Rutgers
University in New Brunswick, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Olympic swimming sensation Jenny Thompson disagrees, saying
it's time for some people to lighten up.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson posed on a California beach for Sports Illustrated
wearing red boots, a red-white-and-blue swimsuit bottom and nothing
on top, her fists covering bare breasts. The woman Mattel chose to
endorse ``Swimming Champion Barbie'' says she took off part of her
suit to display a muscular, athletic form to young girls, to which
Kane responds, ``It's not clear to me which muscle group naked
breasts belong to.''
</P>
<P>
   September's Maxim portrays swimmer Ashley Tappin gazing
provocatively beneath spiky bangs in a red sweater unbuttoned from
the waist to the collar. When her hometown newspaper, The
Times-Picayune of New Orleans, asked Tappin to comment, she
sarcastically replied: ``Athletes showing skin! Oh, forbidden!''
</P>
<P>
   Describing the criticism as ``a bunch of bull,'' Tappin said:
``We're healthy. We're fit. And we're not just cute; we do good
things with our bodies. They are functional. Why not show them
off?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some sports publications, Maxim, a men's magazine, is
unapologetic about showing off female bodies and writing about sex.
``Let me put it this way,'' said James Kaminsky, its executive
editor. ``If (U.S. Attorney General) Janet Reno were a babe, we'd
put her on the cover in a second.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kaminsky vehemently denies the charge that athletic women
and not men are sexualized.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back to the original Olympic games, the Greek
athletes did them naked for the main purpose of the titillation of
the horny Greek men of the time,'' he said. ``In the modern games,
Jim Thorpe was considered a sexual icon for women. Mark Spitz had a
hot-selling poster wearing just a tiny little bathing suit and his
gold medals. Yet with female athletes we're supposed to treat them
as asexual creatures?''
</P>
<P>
   (Thorpe was the 1912 track and field gold medalist who went on
to play professional football and baseball, and whom some regard as
the athlete of the century. Spitz won seven gold medals in the 1972
games, more than any other athlete in a single Olympics.)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In reality, sexuality had little to do with male athletes
competing without clothes during the original Olympic games, said
David Romano, senior research scientist in the Mediterranean
section of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and
Anthropology. One story attributes the practice to a Spartan
tradition, while Romano said another traces it back to ``a man from
Orsippus who lost his shorts during a race and set a trend.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is evidence, Romano said, that provocative clothing
and nudity among women athletes in ancient Greece sparked a
controversy similar to this year's.
</P>
<P>
   Women had separate Olympic games back then, with a 155-meter
race pitting the athletes of Sparta against the women of Athens.
The Spartan women trained in the nude with male athletes in the
gymnasium, a Greek word that means ``place of naked people,''
Romano said. In competition, the Spartan female athletes wore a
short dress that left one breast exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Athens critics dubbed the Spartan athletes ``thigh flashers,''
and playwright Euripides insulted Sparta's lack of restraint and
chastity in a popular 430 B.C. play called ``Andromache.''
</P>
<P>
   If Spartan female athletes competed today, they would be among
those taking their clothes off, Romano said. ``It's totally within
the ancient tradition of being proud of your physically attuned
body to show off what you've spent years and years to produce,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kane traces the disrobing of the modern female athlete back to
``the Brandi Chastain moment,'' when the U.S. soccer star
celebrated her game-winning 1999 Women's World Cup penalty kick by
-- spontaneously, says Chastain -- ripping off her jersey and
revealing a black Nike sports bra. Chastain also posed nude for
Gear magazine in October 1999, crouching like a question mark over
a soccer ball.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Chastain has become perhaps the biggest celebrity of
that famous World Cup team. She was named one of People magazine's
20 most intriguing people of 1999 and was the answer to a $32,000
question on ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''

   Can showing a little more skin bring in a lot more money and

   Olympic high jumper Amy Acuff hoped so when she orchestrated the
Omni-Lite Millennium Calendar of Champions ($19.95). It features
Acuff and 11 other female track and field athletes in

</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, the Canadian women's cross-country ski team
announced in September that it produced a ``Nordic Nudes''
calendar, on sale for $30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did this to raise money,'' team member Sara Renner told The
Calgary Herald, ``but also to raise the profile of cross-country
skiing across Canada. I've been racing for 10 years and the profile
of the sport hasn't improved, and this is a way to get
cross-country skiing as a household sport, even if we have to take
our clothes off to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   A study of television sports coverage released this month by the
University of Southern California provided some fresh evidence that
women's sports are often sexualized when they are not ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at 1999 sports coverage of three Los Angeles
stations for six weeks and ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' for three weeks.
It found that reports on men outnumbered those on women 6-to-1 on
the local broadcasts and 15-to-1 on ESPN. When women were covered,
the broadcasters often engaged in ``sexual voyeurism,'' commenting
on the good looks of tennis player Anna Kournikova or reporting on
visual, offbeat sports such as nude bungee jumping or professional
women's wrestling, said Michael Messner, a sociology professor who
conducted the study.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner, at Rutgers, said that for many women athletes, posing
nude is ``a way of cashing in when they can and exploiting their
situation, which is inevitably short-lived.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   ``And I also think it's partly a concern on the part of the
women athletes to prove their `womanhood,' to give evidence that
they are feminine, despite their hard bodies, and even to define
themselves as sexual, given their fears that others might think
they are masculinized or de-feminized,'' Steiner said. ``In short,
some of this is an effort to prove that they are not lesbians.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a sensitive subject, but one Amy Taylor, one of the
Australian soccer team nudes, addressed when she said, ``We wanted
to prove we're not all butch lesbians. We are attractive, feminine
girls who play soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   It has been 28 years since Title IX banned sex discrimination in
federally funded school programs in the United States. For the
first time, women will compete in the same number of team sports as
men at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But the flap over nudity reveals that women are still struggling
to find their unique athletic identity, said Chris Gobrecht,
women's basketball coach at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports, by its very nature, proclaims masculinity,'' Gobrecht
said. ``Women have been a little bit pressured to establish their
femininity in sports. Whether you want to call it homophobia or
whatever, part of that is what these women are fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to grow out of our adolescence. We need to be
comfortable with the sexuality that will be the natural extension
of any gender performing actions of a physical nature.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Gobrecht cited Michael Jordan, who never did a
nude calendar but did pose in Hanes underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex appeal is a positive for either gender,'' she said.
``Michael Jordan wouldn't be Michael if he didn't have some sex
appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference between Jordan and female athletes is that Jordan
is remembered primarily for his six NBA championships, his
game-winning performances and his gravity-defying dunks, not his
underwear shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maturity will arrive,'' said Gobrecht, ``when sexuality isn't
the overriding theme of women's athletics, but just a part of it.''

<P>
   While the Olympics have added weightlifting, hammer throwing and
pole vaulting as official women's events, dozens of female
Olympians have enthusiastically participated in an unofficial,
eyebrow-raising, media-covered sport -- disrobing.
</P>
<P>
   American Olympians stepped out of their warm-up outfits and into
what Maxim magazine calls ``the sexiest get-ups we could create''
for the publication's September issue. The Australian women's
soccer team, the Matildas, created its own $20 calendar featuring
full frontal nudity. Canada's Waneek Horn-Miller appeared naked
with a strategically placed water polo ball on the cover of Time
magazine's Canadian edition.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the unabashed attitudes of her fellow athletic models,
Horn-Miller told the Canadian press that she hoped to communicate
``the strength, pride and determination'' of the women's team. But
where some see strength and pride, others see unnecessary
titillation and a double standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm asking for is equal treatment,'' said Mary Jo Kane,
director of the Tucker Center for Research on Girls &AMP; Women in
Sport at the University of Minnesota. ``When Tiger Woods is on the
cover of Sports Illustrated naked, holding a golf ball with the
Nike swoosh in front of his genitals, I'll be quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Donna Lopiano, executive director of the Women's Sports
Foundation of Long Island, N.Y., ``Any exposure in a sports
magazine that minimizes athletic achievement and skill and
emphasizes the female athlete as a sex object is insulting and
degrading.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexualizing female athletes is nothing new. What's different is
that a generation of athletes seems to be cooperating with the
process, as if, said Kane, they are saying, ''`Hey, we've arrived,
we can be soft-porn icons, too.'''
</P>

Lieberman's unease with affirmative action, his support for making
it harder for Americans to sue and his belief that government
should use public funds to send children to private schools, at
least on an experimental basis. (Sherman, Atlanta

HOW (AND WHY) TO READ A COMPANY'S NEWS RELEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Financial Commentary)  
 By DAGEN McDOWELL  
 c.2000 TheStreet.com  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (The following ``separate buy'' article from TheStreet.com, the
premier business/finance Web site, is available from the New York
Times Syndicate. Please contact syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, you now have easy access to company
financial statements, news from multiple sources and analyst
reports straight from Wall Street. You can also get your hands on
some baffling, badly written news releases.
</P>
<P>
   These announcements at times may be filled with useless
gibberish that is meant to confuse rather than inform. Nonetheless,
you can't ignore the news releases issued by the companies in which
you own stock. These notices often contain important information
about a company's earnings, management changes or customer growth.
</P>
<P>
   What is contained within a news release often has a big impact
on a stock, for better or for worse. Wall Street pays close
attention when releases come down the pike, particularly quarterly
earnings announcements. You also have easy access to releases
distributed via PR Newswire and Business Wire on sites like Yahoo!
Finance.
</P>
<P>
   To make use of these releases, you'll need to learn the tricks
that companies use, from overwhelming you with news about
absolutely nothing to crafting indecipherable jargon that no one
can understand.
</P>
<P>
   HEAVY VOLUME
</P>
<P>
   When issuing news releases, some companies obviously ignore the
maxim, ``Less is more.'' Instead, they try to distract you with a
constant flood of announcements that often say nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, management believes a stock will react favorably to
a volume of news releases and they cater to that mentality,'' says
Bill Nygren, co-manager of the Oakmark fund and the Oakmark Select
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies, in particular, are often guilty of pumping
out announcement after announcement. FreeMarkets (FMKT on the
Nasdaq), which operates business-to-business auctions, posted 11
releases to its Web site during August. That works out to more than
two a week.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com (MPPP on the Nasdaq), the embattled online music site,
issued 22 news releases during the same month, covering subjects
from the important to the ridiculous. (Important: The release about
the company settling a copyright infringement suit with Sony Music
Entertainment. Ridiculous: The one announcing the site's tribute to
Survivor contestant Gervase after he was kicked off the island.)
</P>
<P>
   With some companies, it's not the number of news releases that's
irksome. It's their lack of substance.
</P>
<P>
   Scanning the news-release wires, you'll find releases that hype
meaningless trade-show appearances and promotional tours.
</P>
<P>
   Last November Track Data (TRAC on the Nasdaq), the
financial-data provider online-trading firm, actually put out an
announcement titled ``Track Data Announces No Press Release
Today,'' which went on to recap several earlier releases. Although
amusing, the announcement still highlights the games that some
companies will play to attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the news that really mattered came this spring when
it was revealed that Track Data's CEO incurred millions of dollars
in trading losses. That announcement then raised concerns that the
company would be sold since the CEO's borrowings were secured by
many of his shares in the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't find a lot of value added in press releases. But too
many can be a bad thing, particularly when a company is not doing
so well,'' says Doug MacKay, co-manager of the Red Oak Technology
fund. ``They should spend more time on their business.''
</P>
<P>
   BLAH-BLAH-BLAH
</P>
<P>
   You can plainly see that many news releases are written in
indecipherable language that doesn't tell you anything about what a
company does. Companies don't make products. They provide
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 135 releases hit Business Wire that used the
descriptive phrase ``end-to-end solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Using that kind of gibberish, you could describe a trash can as
a comprehensive, adaptable waste-containment device.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people use America Online to access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But did you know that ``through its strategic alliance with Sun
Microsystems, the company develops and offers easy-to-deploy,
end-to-end and enterprise solutions for companies operating in the
Net Economy?'' That's the line you'll find in AOL news releases.
</P>
<P>
   Need a translation?
</P>
<P>
   AOL has a joint venture with Sun to make software used in
e-commerce, or selling stuff over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To figure out what some of these companies really do, you have
to go to an independent source like Hoover's to find descriptions
written in English. This vast business-information site can help
you interpret those releases.
</P>
<P>
   BURYING THE IMPORTANT STUFF
</P>
<P>
   Reading many releases can be pure drudgery. But sometimes
combing through every last word is incredibly important.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies bury important information in the body of their
news releases. An announcement's headline will tell you one thing.
You'll discover something wholly different if you read the entire
release. Generally, they don't bury the good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   In late July, Nokia (NOK on the New York exchange) announced its
second-quarter results in a release titled, ``Nokia in April -
June: Preparing for third generation with outstanding results.''
</P>
<P>
   But buried at the bottom of this rather cheery release, you
would have found a sliver of stock-crushing information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate Nokia's earnings per share in the third quarter
to be at least equal to the level achieved in the third quarter of
1999. However, due to the timing of the new product introductions
as well as seasonality, they are projected to be lower than in the
second quarter of this year,'' reads a quote from Chairman and CEO
Jorma Ollila.
</P>
<P>
   The company was saying that it wouldn't meet expectations during
the third quarter, and the stock fell 25 percent that day.
</P>
<P>
   Oakmark's Nygren believes it's worth going back to read a
company's prior earnings releases to see how the language changes
from quarter to quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In one quarter, management might say they expect the year to
``substantially exceed'' last year. Then in the following quarter's
release, they are telling you this year will merely ``exceed'' last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reduction is implied in the way management worded the
release,'' says Nygren.
</P>
<P>
   If you miss that subtlety, you might be in for a nasty surprise.

   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ Border Patrol agent Cecilio Bauelos pulled
a stack of nearly new life jackets _ including a tiny one for a
baby _ from the stowage area of a patrol boat moored to the banks
of the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, they've only been used once,'' Bauelos said.
</P>
<P>
   The life vests apparently were used by people who risked the
dangerous crossing to get from Mexico to the United States. And
just as these illegal immigrants are taking steps to avoid the
hazards of the river, so, too, are the agents of the U.S. Border
Patrol and its Mexican counterpart, Grupo Beta.
</P>
<P>
   Bauelos watched Wednesday as 40 members of the Border Patrol,
Grupo Beta and Mexico's federal police trained in water-rescue
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Rain dappled the river as animated agents in swimming trunks
gathered on a wooden dock along with life preservers, buoys and
other water-rescue devices. One officer dived from the dock into
the murky river, and Bauelos flinched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's dangerous!'' said Bauelos, who was trained in water
safety while in the U.S. Coast Guard. ``You should never dive in
head-first. Sometimes there are concrete blocks on the bottom of
the river. Did that guy come up?''
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   As thunderstorms rolled overhead, agents tossed life preservers
or towed to safety ``drowning'' companions who struggled in the
river's thick water hyacinth lilies.
</P>
<P>
   Some agents with Mexico's Grupo Beta don't know how to swim, but
that won't be an obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Garza, head of the McAllen Border Patrol Sector, which is
hosting the $10,000 training program, said agents will be taught
that jumping in to perform a rescue is only a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to use the equipment they have at hand to perform
the rescue,'' he said. ``We want them to be able to do their jobs
better, but we're not going to demand that they jump in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them to become victims, too, is not what we have in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   John Fletemeyer, a nationally acclaimed water-safety instructor
helping to train the officers, said statistics show 90 percent of
all water-related accidents occur between 10 and 20 feet from the
shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consequently, there's seldom any need for a person ... to
actually go into the water to effect a rescue,'' he told his
students. ``I'm here to train members of the Border Patrol not to
be lifeguards, but to be lifesavers.''
</P>
<P>
   The water-safety training is a part of the Border Safety
Initiative launched by the United States and Mexico in 1998, said
Renee Harris, associate chief of the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, which received almost $500,000 in U.S. funding
this year and also is underwritten by the Mexican government,
focuses on preventing immigrant deaths, search and rescue
operations, identification of dead immigrants and tracking of
undocumented immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1998, immigrant safety was not a significant part of the
Border Patrol's activities, and statistics about their well-being
were sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, however, figures kept by the agency have shown
drowning to be the leading cause of death for immigrants who
illegally cross the border.
</P>
<P>
   In both 1998 and 1999, the Border Patrol documented the drowning
deaths of 89 immigrants along the Southwest border.
</P>
<P>
   In June, two Mexican men drowned while trying to cross the river
from Matamoros to Brownsville. A Mexican TV crew captured images of
the deaths, along with footage of the Grupo Beta, apparently
looking on helplessly.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said the water-safety training program is not a result of
those highly publicized deaths, but the decision to place it in
Brownsville was.
</P>
<P>
   A similar training program, conducted by a Border Patrol agent
certified in swift-water rescue, recently was held in El Paso,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to take the best practices from both areas and share
them,'' she said. ``In the future, officers on both sides of the
border will be able to teach this class to others.''

AN ELMENTAL CHANGE FOR US, KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (f and i coding)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Magnesium is about as friendly as an element gets. From homey
laxatives like grandma's milk of magnesia, to furnaces for making
steel, to the very latest in environmental technology, most all its
uses are benign.
</P>
<P>
   Now it may become the element that opens normal trading
relations between the United States and North Korea after 50 years
of war, distrust, and a tough US embargo.
</P>
<P>
   An alliance of businessmen and academics has put together the
first joint venture between US and North Korean interests _ a deal
struck quietly in Pyongyang in late August to produce and export
magnesia, a processed form of the mineral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real importance of this is it is a first step in
confidence building,'' said Greyson Bryan, a California-based Asia
Society official and specialist on North Korean business law.
``Confidence for North Korea that it can benefit from closer
relations with the rest of world, and for the rest of world that
there is something worth investing in in North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is significant for several reasons: It marks the
apparent beginning of a special zone for US investment in North
Korean mines, south of Korea's Rajin-Sonbong free trade zone, and
it provides a striking illustration of how private citizens, rather
than government, are leading the United States into better
relations with the North.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture is no sure thing. Nowhere in international
politics and business are the commitments less certain than in US
dealings with what generations of American diplomats have demonized
as the world's most isolated Stalinist regime, and a significant
part of the US partners' obligation is to recruit investment to
modernize North Korea's magnesium industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the US partners _ a Harvard-based specialist in business
law, a Korean War veteran who made millions in gold mining, and a
scholar who serves as a go-between for the United States and Korea
_ are as interested in geopolitics as in profit. All have an
abiding interest in northeast Asia, and all believe US policy often
has heightened tensions in a region where Chinese, Korean, Russian,
Japanese, and American interests easily can come into conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korea, its people, and its 10 million divided families are the
unfortunate victims of a US policy dominated by Cold War
thinking,'' said Robin Radin, 58, who joined Harvard Law School's
international law program in 1996 after nearly a decade as a top
corporate executive in Japan and China. ``I want to make a positive
change in relations between the United States and North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Birl Worley, 69, who became a mining executive after serving in
the Korean War, put it more gruffly. ``I was one of those nice
people who helped make a mess of China and North Korea,'' he said.
``I thought I'd make a little amends.''
</P>
<P>
   The third US partner is K.A. Namkung, a China-born Korean,
raised in Japan, educated and naturalized in the United States. He
refuses to discuss the venture.
</P>
<P>
   The deal targets an emerging market in North America and Japan
for environmentally benign methods for disposing of the nasty
byproducts of mines and coal-burning power plants. Magnesium
products are coming into use in place of lime to absorb the sulphur
and carbon compounds produced in these industries. The resulting
magnesium sulphate is non-caustic and easy to handle compared to
the gooey, unusable gypsum that results from using lime on
sulphur-polluted mine water. And magnesium sulphate can be used as
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to create a door-opening venture with North Korean
interests grew out of the friendship Namkung and Radin formed in
the late 1960s, when they were graduate students in Asian and
Japanese history at the University of California-Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   They fell out of touch for nearly 20 years, reconnecting by
chance just before Radin moved to Tokyo as a Morgan Stanley
executive. Their business dealings became frequent, and Namkung
became deeply involved in back-channel communications between
Pyongyang and Washington _ which led to the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   Namkung and former President Jimmy Carter were key players in
the prolonged crisis in 1994 over allegations that North Korea was
developing the capacity to manufacture nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After the crisis was defused, to the fury of Clinton
administration officials who had advocated a new round of sanctions
against the North, relations among countries with interests in
northeast Asia gradually warmed, despite setbacks over North
Korea's missile development and testing, and ``in 1996, Tony
(Namkung) advised me that his contacts in North Korea had an
interest in attracting US investment, particularly in the mining
sector,'' Radin said.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed that the moment to realize their ambition to improve
North Korea's relations with the world was at hand.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, both participated in the first exchange between US and
North Korean legal experts; during the meetings, the Koreans
broached the idea of creating investment opportunities for US
investors in the Danchon mining region.
</P>
<P>
   But when the idea was pitched to the US mining industry,
``interest was tepid, to say the least,'' as Radin put it. So he
and Namkung organized a second trip in spring 1998 in an attempt to
persuade mining experts to join them in a venture.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Worley, president of Golden Cycle Gold Corp.,
one of the oldest gold mining companies in the United States. After
retiring from Golden Cycle last year, he co-founded of Aurora
Partners Ltd. to undertake the joint venture. When US sanctions on
North Korea were partially lifted this summer, the trip that led to
the magnesium deal was arranged.
</P>
<P>
   Still, much can go wrong, particularly in the financing. Because
the United States still considers North Korea a terrorist nation,
conventional access to international capital is barred.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Korea is no pasture to bring your cash cows into,''
Worley said. ``But if somebody doesn't lead the way, nobody will
follow. . . . One of the main reasons we're there is to show it can
be done.''

MARK DONOHUE: A BOY'S ENTHUSIASM IN THE SOUL OF A DRIVER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, know this: Speed is a science.
</P>
<P>
   So, as they say, let's go racing. The proposition? We race five
races, and the night before each race we draw from a hat the type
of auto we will be racing the next day. Could be an Indy car. Could
be a Winston Cup car. Could be a Formula 1 rocket. Could be an old
Corvette. Whatever we pick, we'll run on an appropriate track or
course. You get points depending on where you finish, as long as
it's in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   The catch? We each get one driver to handle our cars. You can
hook up with a current star _ that Gordon boy from NASCAR has a
reputation for flexibility in what and how he drives, for instance
_ or you can reach back in time, even back through mortality, and
pick a great from the past.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is my column, I pick first. I choose Mark Donohue,
the best driver and one of the greatest race/engineering minds who
ever lived. He, probably better than any driver, understood the
science of speed.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't matter what he was in. He let the car do its thing and
interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel what I'm doing is the obvious, natural thing to do,''
he wrote in his autobiography. ``The driver is simply doing what
the car wants to be done.'' If the driver has the guts to go for
the ride, he did not add.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that in ``The Unfair Advantage,'' which he authored
more than a quarter-century ago and which has be reissued by
Bentley Publishers of Cambridge. Having just read the book, I'm not
sure what was ``unfair'' about his advantages, given they were
inside the rules and the product of his own genius _ things like a
faster system for changing brakes during a race, better fuel
intake, even a gravity-feed fueling station (later outlawed) for
pit stops.
</P>
<P>
   You want to know how broad was Donohue's driving ability?
Consider only the cars he drove and mentions in chapter headings.
Among them, beginning in 1958, the Corvette, the Elva Formula
Junior, Daimler, Cooper-Offy, MGB, and Ferrari 275, Cobra, Lotus
20, Mustang, Ford Mark II, and Mark IV, Lola T70, Camaro,
Eagle-Chevrolet, McLaren M6-B, Lolas T70, T152, T163, T150,
Javelin, Matador, Lola-Ford, Ferrari 512, Mclaren M16, Mclaren M19,
Eagle-Offy, Lola T330-AMC, Porsche 917-10, Porsche 917-30, Porsche
911 Carerra.
</P>
<P>
   In these cars he won endurance races, Formula 1 tests, set a
closed track world speed record at Talledega, and, by God, won both
the Indianapolis 500 and a Winston Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   What he drove, how he drove it, and the modifications he made
ripple like waves on the pond of racing. His sons, Michael and
David, say in the preface to the book, that ``Even though racing
has taken him from us, it continually keeps giving him back to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a return journey that began in 1958, when he was, of all
things, an engineering student at Brown University (and you thought
all good drivers were Southern boys with home brew and lightning
chases through the woods in their blood) and entered his 1957
Corvette in a hill climb in Belknap, N.H. The bugger won that race
and kept winning ever after.
</P>
<P>
   And he did it with the soul of a true garage rat. In 1963, he
was approached by Bob Holbert, known to run Porsches but with a
Cobra on his hands. First sponsored driving for Donahue, listen to
him describe it and don't get a chill: ``The Cobra didn't seem to
corner . . . it was much more powerful than anything I'd ever
driven . . . and what a great noise it made. VAROOOM-VAROOM.''
</P>
<P>
   A boy's enthusiasm in the soul of an engineer who was also a
fantastic driver.
</P>
<P>
   Go back in time and check him out, pre-Cobra, way pre-Porsche,
and hear him prep an MGB for a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cut the springs and bent the arms . . . until the car was
inches off the ground.'' Then, he bled the spring-loaded valves in
the shocks, shimmed them up, and refilled them with heavier oil.
Nice, hard ride.
</P>
<P>
   He drove what the world tossed at him. Couldn't afford the
race-prepared Shelby, so he took a road-ready GT 350, fixed its 600
pounds of aerodynamic lift on the front (talk about driving a boat)
and beat the hotter cars.
</P>
<P>
   Hooked up with a guy named Penske and wrote racing history.
Helped engineer Lolas and McLarens, got AMC, of all companies, into
the winner's circle though the Javelin team he inherited, he said,
had as its most valuable asset, its International tow truck.
</P>
<P>
   He helped Porsche, as engineer and driver, develop the 917-10,
917-30, and Carerra 911.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to quit driving, but money and the lure of competition
drew him back. He ends his autobiography discussing this decision,
saying of his return, ``Of course, there were some negative
concerns. For one thing, I'm putting my life on the line again.''
But then he added, ``hopefully, in a few years, I'll have another
story to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Months later, he was dead, killed by a test run on an F1 track
in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   He's my guy. Who's yours? Let's go racing.

LEXUS IS300 IS SNEAKY FAST ENOUGH TO SLIP INTO SEDAN CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The answer: 2001 Lexus IS300.
</P>
<P>
   The question: Is there a Toyota product that can appeal to
young, aggressive drivers for whom the Camry or the Echo just
aren't enough, image-wise and zippy-wise?
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Toyota will tell you they've been struggling to
come up with a car that will appeal to younger drivers. The Camry
is a fine car, but you don't find it tricked out the way you do
Honda Accords and Civics. The Echo doesn't seem to have created any
youthful buzz, and the ad campaign for this low-end Toyota is being
revamped in the shadow of highly successful ads for the Ford Focus,
which has youthful buzz all about it.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Lexus _ out of Toyota's luxury division _ is not a car
most 18-year-olds will be able to afford (at $30,000-plus), but
given the number of 25-40-somethings with good incomes in this
high-tech economy, the IS300 may be just the rig to challenge BMW,
Saab, and Audi in the compact sport sedan class.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great-looking car, from its gaping fascia, up over its
steeply sloped front, big windshield, solid roofline and down to
its short, chopped rear deck. It's downright Saablike.
</P>
<P>
   But if the outside says Sweden, the inside says Switzerland, as
in fine watches. Especially cool is the chronograph watch style of
the center gauge. Its circumference is toothed like a gear and
inside it sit the tachometer, speedometer, and smaller gauges for
temperature and fuel readings.
</P>
<P>
   And you get downright German with drilled aluminum pedals,
aluminum doorsills, and a sculpted aluminum shift knob. It's billed
as a five-passenger, but realistically, it will hold four adults.
</P>
<P>
   The leather front bucket seats on the test model were firm and
gripped especially well at the sides of the thighs and up the back
during hard cornering. A small steering wheel added that certain
race car feel that young drivers (and crazy older ones) seem to
crave.
</P>
<P>
   But looks, of course, won't fool many people who know what they
want in a sports sedan. You've got to show them performance.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Lexus has equipped the IS300 with an in-line six,
3.0-liter engine that delivers 215 horsepower. It's not as powerful
as the 300-horsepower plant introduced three years ago for the
GS400, but this is a smaller, lighter car, and this engine propels
it around just fine, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is a sneaky fast car. You stomp the gas, expecting
to hear some sign of surge: a roar, a burble, a guttural gush. You
get none of that. But then you look at the speedometer and realize
you have leaped forward and are rapidly gaining speed. The Lexus
engine is that quiet. So quiet, in fact, that you pick up tire
noise instead of engine sounds as you roll down the highway. In a
week of driving, the IS300 got about 21 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it comes only with an automatic, electronic, five-speed
transmission. It does a good job of shifting up _ for an automatic
_ as you accelerate. A manual option _ buttons on the steering
wheel a la Porsche _ lets you take over the shifting, but only to a
point. Use the manual option and try to run the car close to red
line and it won't let you. The automatic takes over and shifts up
for you. I hope they offer this with a good five-speed manual as
soon as they can come up with one.
</P>
<P>
   So how's it handle?
</P>
<P>
   Just the way a good sports sedan should.
</P>
<P>
   On the highway, it's nimble and firm, moving in and out of
traffic with a solid feel from the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   On corners, it flat out carves turns and there is virtually no
sense of weight being thrown around or body roll. That, no doubt,
owes to a sport-tuned suspension that has upper and lower control
arms, coil springs, and anti-roll bars front and rear.
</P>
<P>
   The price you pay, of course, is stiffness on rough roads, but
even here it's not a cowl-shudder tremor that ripples through the
cockpit as you get in some tight sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   It's got ABS operating four-wheel disc brakes that bring the
IS300 to confident, quick stops _ though I'd like a little more
feel from the brake pedal.
</P>
<P>
   Add that to the manual transmission I long for _ and there
again, you'd get more feel for the car _ and you'd have an almost
perfect compact sports sedan, something the folks at Toyota have
been striving for in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The tuck-and-roll look of the leather-coated dashboard. Hey,
it's a fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --They did such a great job designing that chronograph gauge
setup. Too bad they didn't encircle the dash knobs with the same
thing: geared real metal.

&HT;     RESTORATION ARTISTS UNCOVER LONG-HIDDEN FRESCOES AT THE ALAMO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CARMINA DANINI  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Nearly three centuries after the founding of
Mission San Antonio de Valero, the church now known as the Alamo
continues to harbor many secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are frescoes dating to the Spanish Colonial era.
Painstakingly, restoration artists Cisi Jary and Pam Rosser are
bringing the works to light.
</P>
<P>
   For four weeks, the two women have been gingerly removing
decades of layers of grime and whitewash from the walls of the
former sacristy, which is one of two rooms that reopened in
February after being closed to the public since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The frescoes, paintings on wet plaster, were discovered that
month while Alamo officials were in the room discussing where to
place exhibit cases, Alamo Director Brad Breuer said.
</P>
<P>
   Jary and Rosser, who were then working on a project at the state
Capitol in Salt Lake City, were hired by the Daughters of the
Republic of Texas (DRT). The two began work Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to scream when we found the flowers and
pomegranates,'' said Jary, one-half of the mother-daughter team
whose firm, Restoration Associates, also worked on restoration of
the Texas Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The find is significant because there is no documentation on the
interiors of San Antonio's missions, Jary said. ``Most books
address the architecture of the missions but not decorative
painting, and we've never found anything this old,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Jary said pomegranates are a design element of the Rose Window
at Mission San Jose, largest of the five missions in San Antonio,
and of a niche in which stands a statue of Saint Anne holding the
infant Mary.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Catholic priest whom Jary consulted, pomegranates
symbolize renewal and fertility.
</P>
<P>
   The design is stylized and likely the work of Franciscan monks,
Jary said. Franciscan friars established outposts in what now is
the southern and western United States for the Spanish crown. One
of those monks, Antonio Olivares, and the Spanish governor, Martin
de Alarcon, founded Mission San Antonio de Valero in May 1718 near
San Pedro Springs here.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, San Antonio de Valero, oldest of the five
missions, was moved to the east bank of the San Antonio River. The
present site in downtown San Antonio was selected in 1724.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the church that houses the Alamo shrine was
begun in 1756. More than three decades later, San Antonio de Valero
was secularized; that is, it ceased to be used as a mission.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1836 battle of the Alamo, Mexican Gen. Vicente
Filisola ordered the structures burned so they no longer could be
used as a fort.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army leased the ruins in 1848 and repaired the
buildings. Federal troops departed when the Civil War broke out,
but at the end of the conflict returned to the Alamo and remained
until 1877.
</P>
<P>
   The Alamo became state property in 1883. It has been under the
custodianship of the DRT since 1905.
</P>
<P>
   Tinted lime washes, air conditioning and the lack of insect
infestation combined to keep the paintings _ and even some graffiti
lower on the walls _ intact, Jary said.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings are a special find, said Mary Carmack, Alamo
Committee chairwoman. The work is ``a part of the Spanish Colonial
era of the Alamo and a puzzle, and it'd be nice to know more about
it,'' Carmack said.

SUMMER GAMES STAFF ALERT TO TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Eric Rudolph is presumably dead or still cowering in
the dense forests of North Carolina, but the suspected Atlanta
bomber continues to haunt the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   When the 2000 Summer Games begin with Friday's opening
ceremonies, a small army of men, women, dogs and machines will be
on high alert to protect the Olympics and preserve Australia's
terrorist-free reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Southern Hemisphere's Fort Knox,'' Olympic
spokeswoman Elsie Hasting said during a tour of Olympic Park, the
Games' main venue. ``Nothing will move around here without security
people being aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities expressed confidence they can keep the Games free
from a repeat of the bloody 1972 siege by Palestinian terrorists in
Munich. They say they are also prepared to counteract more than 100
other nightmare scenarios, such as the use of ``biological,
chemical or radiological'' weapons, the pirating of ocean liners,
or the purposeful crash of a hijacked jet.
</P>
<P>
   Added to that list in recent days are possible clashes with
anti-globalization protesters en route from Melbourne, where they
staged three days of demonstrations at the Asia Pacific Economic
Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ryan, police commissioner for the state of New South Wales
and head of Games security, promised that security teams would deal
`'very, very firmly'' with demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have applied the most sophisticated security approach to
these Olympic Games ever,'' Ryan told reporters earlier this month.
``We have done all we can humanly possible to ensure there is a
trouble-free Games,''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Ryan and other officials acknowledged that a lone
bomber _ particularly one who chooses a target near but not within
the Olympic venues, as happened in Atlanta _ poses a potentially
unstoppable threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real danger will come, rather than from some huge,
well-financed, well-resourced terrorist group ... but from the
individual nutter making a bomb in the basement or garage,'' Graham
Richardson, who oversees the Olympic Village, told a news
conference. ``That would be the kind of thing a police department
would find almost impossible to prepare against.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say they aren't trying.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic organizers have mounted what they call the largest
security operation in Australian peacetime history. At the top of
the security pyramid is Joint Task Force Gold, consisting of 1,000
elite army commandos, navy divers, a Black Hawk helicopter squadron
and other military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Olympic security force includes nearly 5,000
state police, 4,500 civilian security guards, 4,000 army troops,
3,500 fire and emergency service personnel, up to 3,500 volunteers,
and a pack of bomb-sniffing labradors. So many police have been
called in that three dozen police stations in New South Wales will
be effectively closed during the Games.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster the response to any security threats, Australia's
Parliament last week gave the military broad powers to help police
combat civil unrest. Military involvement in domestic affairs had
been limited to national emergencies such as direct threats to the
government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to general security, special precautions will be
taken to protect about 60 VIPs, including heads of state, sports
ministers, and royalty expected at the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The main Olympic precinct, the 1,877-acre site at Homebush Bay,
underwent a painstaking search before being sealed off Sept. 1.
Since then, access has been limited to people with proper
accreditation, all of whom must undergo vehicle and bag searches as
well as inspections with metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   The same treatment awaits the estimated 500,000 people expected
to converge here daily during the Games, which last through Oct. 1.
Even the movements of most staff and volunteers will be limited to
specific areas of the site.
</P>
<P>
   Public concern about security has increased recently in the wake
of several well-publicized incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In May, police arrested a man with a Nazi fixation after finding
explosive materials in his home near the Olympic site. Some of the
materials were similar to those used in the 1995 Oklahoma City
bombing that killed 168 people.
</P>
<P>
   Then last month, New Zealand police said they had evidence of a
plot by Afghan refugees to blow up a nuclear research reactor in
Sydney; Australian authorities said an investigation determined
there was ``no credible threat.''
</P>
<P>
   International police and security agencies have been helping
Australia prepare for the Games, and US agents are on hand from the
Secret Service and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Matthews, a special agent in the FBI's Salt Lake City
bureau, said the FBI agents will be acting both as observers and
liaisons with Australian authorities. Salt Lake City will be home
to the 2002 Winter Games, and Matthews said the FBI is focusing on
preventative measures for large-scale terrorism and violent acts by
``lone wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You do the best you can to prepare against anything, but it is
the irrational individual acting on his own who is hardest to
prepare against,'' Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   That was allegedly the case four years ago in Atlanta, where a
pipe-bomb explosion in Centennial Park killed one woman and injured
more than 100 others. Federal authorities are still searching for
Rudolph, who in early 1998 disappeared into North Carolina's
rugged, half-million-acre Nantahala National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The only other Olympic-related terror act, and the only one on
Olympic grounds, was the 1972 hostage-taking by eight Palestinians
that caused the deaths of 11 Israelis. A stainless-steel panel
inscribed with the names of the slain Israelis has been installed
on a light tower outside the Olympic Stadium. Extra security has
been devoted to the Israeli Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading up to the Olympics, security officials
have focused on expected protests by Aborigines, indigenous
Australians who have suffered two centuries of persecution.
Aboriginal leaders have been seeking a government apology for a
now-defunct policy of removing indigenous children from their
families to be raised in institutions or by whites.
</P>
<P>
   The government's refusal to apologize had prompted some
Aborigines to suggest disruptive uprisings during the Olympics, but
in recent weeks Aboriginal leaders have been unanimous in urging
loud but peaceful demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Protest leaders at the Asia Pacific Economic Summit have said
they plan to join Aborigines in demonstrating at the opening
ceremonies, but it is not clear whether disruptions are planned.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the security mix, there is one non-human concern:
sharks in Sydney Harbor, site of the swimming portion of the
triathalon. Prompted more by media alarms than actual danger _
death by asteroid is statistically as likely as a fatal shark
attack in the harbor _ six divers equipped with electrical prods
will patrol the waters during the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Under the broadest definition of security, Olympic organizers
say they have ordered 100,000 condoms for free distribution in the
Olympic Village, which will house about 15,000 athletes and coaches
for the two-week Games.
</P>
<P>
   Other than staging the competitions, security is the biggest
remaining challenge for Olympic organizers who are eager to prove
their competence after years of often-farcical missteps.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven years since Sydney won its bid to host the Games,
organizers have stumbled into embarrassments over ticket
distribution schemes, medal designs, and nepotism in the choice of
torch-bearers. Then there were repeated cost overruns, a dispute
over the inclusion of foreign youths in marching bands at the
opening ceremonies, and seemingly endless reminders of the
influence-peddling scandal that led to the resignation or expulsion
of 10 members of the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a certain amount of Olympic fatigue even
before the first race is run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to avoid it like the plague,'' said Michael Hays,
20, a scaffold builder on his lunch break at Sydney's Manly Beach.
``They don't even have surfing in the Olympics, and that's what
it's all about here.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all are quite so cynical.
</P>
<P>
   George Eldred, 63, a retired executive who lives two miles from
Olympic Park, said he attended the 1956 Games in Melbourne, ``every
event, for 13 pounds, nine shillings.'' Tickets for Sydney's
opening ceremonies range from $70 to $900.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been seven years of build-up, and the excitement wore off
for a time,'' Eldred said, ``but now we can't wait for the world to
come to Australia.''

U.S. WOMEN DEFEAT THEIR NEMESIS, NORWAY, 2-0, IN OLYMPIC SOCCER
OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ She delivered the winning goal in the
1996 Summer Olympics and led the Americans in scoring during the
1999 Women's World Cup, yet Tiffeny Milbrett has always felt
something of an outsider _ in the middle of many important
victories, yet in a sense always apart.
</P>
<P>
   She did not play collegiately at North Carolina, which has
essentially been a farm system for the national team. She clashed
with Tony DiCicco, the former national team coach, whom she felt
was too rigid. For Milbrett, soccer is a form of jazz, something
that must be felt rather than instructed.
</P>
<P>
   April Heinrichs, the new coach of the national team, has given
Milbrett the freedom she craved, and she responded Thursday night
with one goal and nearly three others as the United States
dominated Norway, its most intractable rival, by 2-0 in the opening
women's match of the Olympic soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Milbrett hit for the cycle, scoring on a brilliant counterattack
in the 18th minute and slammed three other balls off the left post,
the right post and the crossbar. Mia Hamm added the second goal in
the 24th minute. The Americans smothered Norway in midfield and
played most of the game in the opponent's end on a cold, blustery
evening.
</P>
<P>
   These are the Summer Games, but it is late winter in the
Southern Hemisphere. Having grown up in Hillsboro, Ore., and having
played at the University of Portland, Milbrett was more than
accustomed to the chill and a field made slick by a late afternoon
rain. Benefitting from o her speed and agility, the Americans are
in excellent position to advance to the semifinals, with group
matches remaining against China on Sunday and Nigeria on Wednesday.
China defeated Nigeria 3-1 Thursday night in Canberra on a pair of
goals by Sun Wen, the most valuable player in the 1999 Women's
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Norway was the only team with a winning record against the
Americans (14-13-2), and had defeated the United States three times
in six previous matches this year. Thursday night, however, the
sluggish Norwegians appeared as soggy as the turf. Milbrett
repeatedly exploited seams in the flat-back four defense, turning
and shooting with insistent, unobstructed determination.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Milbrett had seemed tense and hesitant in the
opening match of the World Cup. Thursday night, she felt free,
unrestricted, dancing in the locker room before the match. Then she
played with her own dazzling, improvisational rhythm, even if it
felt like performing in an echo chamber with only 16,043 spectators
in the 95,000 seats at the Melbourne Cricket Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you've got to quit listening to coaches,'' Milbrett
said. ``I don't mean that in a bad way. You're the one out there
playing the game. You got yourself to this level. If you forget
that, sometimes you start struggling. In the past, I was worried
about what my coaches and teammates thought. I got the point where
I said, `It's time to get back to listening to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the 18th minute, goalkeeper Siri Mullinix played with the
assertive roaming that has come to characterize her style, racing
to the top of the penalty box and clearing a ball 60 yards
downfield to a sprinting Milbrett. This was Mullinix's first start
in a major tournament, and she sometimes appeared overly aggressive
in straying off her line, but she did collect her 14th shutout of
the year, a team record. And, on the first goal, she placed the
ball with such distance and precision that Milbrett ran onto it at
full speed.
</P>
<P>
   Heading the ball forward, Milbrett rushed past two defenders and
punched a shot at the Norwegian goalkeeper, Bente Nordby, who could
not control the rebound, leaving Milbrett with an unencumbered
finish and a 1-0 lead. Norway left huge gaps through which Milbrett
knifed with her searing first step, change of direction and
spontaneity. At 5 feet, 2 inches, she and China's Sun move more
expertly in tight spaces than any players in the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her agility and change of direction and change of speed and
control of her body, I liken it to a point guard in basketball,''
Heinrichs said.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL MATERIAL BEGINS
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Milbrett felt shackled by DiCicco's more structured
style, even though it brought the Americans an Olympic gold medal
and a world championship. DiCicco, on the other hand, felt that
Milbrett did not possess a sufficient level of fitness. Heinrichs,
a former star forward on the national team, does not yell from the
sideline and she does not insist on any unbending plan of attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``April said, `Do whatever you want, I'm not going to yell, just
get the ball on frame,''' said the defender Kate Sobrero.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL MATERIAL
</P>
<P>
   Hamm beat the offside trap for the second goal, taking a chip
pass from Kristine Lilly and driving it beneath Nordby's futile
dive for her 126th international goal, unsurpassed by any man or
woman. It has been Hamm's history to score in early matches of
major tournaments, then to have difficulty continuing to put the
ball into the net. Without the pressure of playing at home as the
Americans did in the 1996 Olympics and the 1999 World Cup, perhaps
she will be able to sustain her goal production throughout the
tournament.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If she just plays for herself and doesn't worry about what
anyone else is saying, she'll be fine,'' Milbrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it is Milbrett who appears to be on the verge of a
breakthrough tournament and a chance to gain widespread attention,
as well as a sense of true belonging on the American team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't hurt if we come home with a gold medal,'' she said.

PORCELAIN AN EMPEROR WOULD LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Qing porcelain can be a neglected stepchild in the
family of Chinese porcelains. Qing is the name given to porcelain
produced during the Manchu Dynasty (1644-1912). The pieces were
made for the imperial court, for domestic use in China and for
export to the West. They differ in quantity and artistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that nonimperial Qing porcelains vary in
quality,'' said James B. Godfrey, director of Chinese art at
Sotheby's. ``There are pedestrian pieces and pieces of fine
quality. It goes both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey was discussing the porcelains in Sotheby's auction of
Chinese art on Wednesday. ``The uninformed might focus on the
glories of Ming,'' he said, ``but Qing imperial porcelains have
always been highly sought after and reflect the highest levels of
taste and appreciation.''
</P>
<P>
   There are Qing porcelains of all three types in Manhattan at
Sotheby's, at Doyle's ``Asian Works of Art'' sale on Monday, at
Christie's ``Fine Chinese Ceramics, Paintings and Works of Art''
auction on Thursday, and at the Arts of Pacific Asia Show at the
69th Regiment Armory from Thursday through Sept. 24. Several pieces
are also for sale at the Chinese Porcelain Co. at 475 Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   China was successfully invaded from the north many times. In the
17th century it was the Manchus who conquered China, ending the
long Ming dynasty (1368-1644). The last Ming emperor, Chongzhen,
hanged himself from a plum tree north of Beijing, unable to deal
with his warring generals and the pirates who dominated the
southern seas and stole his exports. (In 1984 in Amsterdam there
was a sale of 2,000 pieces of blue-and-white porcelain recovered
from a sunken junk off the coast of China. The salvage specialist
Michael Hatcher determined that the ship had gone down around
1644.)
</P>
<P>
   The Manchus, nomads descended from the Tangus tribes of northern
China, were great warriors and traders, able to secure a monopoly
in the sale of pearls, fur and ginseng. They surrounded themselves
with Chinese advisers and once in power adopted Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
   They did not interfere with the Chinese porcelain factories,
though they did change the colors used. They introduced a vivid
sapphire blue that replaced the purplish blue of the Ming period,
the bright green seen in famille-verte ware and the palette of
pinks that appear in famille-rose ware. The new colors were a hit
in Europe, and Westerners especially prized works made under the
second Qing emperor, Kangxi, a scholar and artistic patron who has
been compared to Louis XIV. Kangxi ware was collected by Queen Mary
II of Britain, the sultans of the Ottoman Empire and Frederick III,
Elector of Brandenburg and Prussia.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese Porcelain Co. is selling a pair of large
blue-and-white Kangxi jars depicting foliate panels and ladies in
gardens. They were made for export, and cost $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's is also selling a pair of blue-and-white Kangxi-period
jars. The white baluster-shaped jars with lids are decorated with
petal-shaped panels, each showing blue peonies, chrysanthemums and
prunus (cherry) trees emanating from a rocky landscape. The
estimate for the pair is $40,000 to $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   As the Paris dealer Michel Beurdeley and his colleague Guy
Raindre write in their book, ``Qing Porcelain'' (Rizzoli, 1987):
``The quality of the blue-and-white ware made at this time attained
a level that fired the enthusiasm, first of all, of Chinese
connoisseurs and then, a little later, of European collectors.
Technically, these wares are unequaled: the pure white and
fine-grained body is covered with a faintly blueish-tinged glaze
that sets off the decoration painted in sapphire blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's has a beehive-shaped Kangxi water pot in a
strawberry-pink glaze with dark speckles on it. It is lightly
incised with dragons. Such pots are scholars' wares, in the Chinese
taste. Called peach-bloom water pots, they have simple domed bodies
rising to narrow rims. The estimate for the one at Sotheby's is
$8,000 to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   China's imperial factory continued to thrive under the following
Qing emperor, Yongzheng (1723-1735), and his successor, Qianlong
(1735-1795). Beurdeley and Raindre say that Jesuits introduced pink
enamels into China in the early 18th century, and the new pinks and
purples were called yangcai (foreign colors). The French referred
to them as famille-rose.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's has a pair of 32-inch-high Yong-zheng famille-rose
baluster jars and covers that come with giltwood and marble stands.
Each has medallions depicting Chinese figures at home and in the
garden. The panels are surrounded by dense thickets of foliage,
including lotus and peony blossoms in yellow, aqua, lime green and
periwinkle.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the type you see on a staircase landing in a grand
late-19th-century house in America,'' Godfrey said. The estimate
for the two is $120,000 to $140,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's is also selling a yellow Yongzheng chrysanthemum dish.
Shallow like a saucer, it has sides molded to resemble a ring of
petals, suggesting an open chrysanthemum flower. Yellow was
reserved for members of the court. The estimate is $10,000 to
$15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners will love a pair of Qianlong cranes, with white
bodies, dark blue and green plumage and small heads crowned by red
crests. The crane, native to China, symbolized longevity and was
sacred. Nonetheless these winning cranes were clearly made for
export. The estimate for the pair is $20,000 to $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's two sales _ Chinese decorative arts at Christie's
East on Monday and fine works of art at its headquarters on
Thursday _ include about 60 pieces of Qing porcelain consigned by
the Cleveland Museum of Art. The museum, which has had the
collection since the 1930s, is selling them to bolster its
acquisitions fund.
</P>
<P>
   One of the exceptional pieces is a 29-inch-tall famille-verte
vase from the Kangxi period. It depicts a Daoist scene, a day in
the realm of the immortals. The Daoist goddess Xiwangmu, the Queen
Mother of the West, and her jade maidens are shown on the Isles of
the Blessed. As two women fan her with peacock feathers, the queen
watches a group approaching with a deer-pulled cart filled with
flowers and a giant peach. In the Daoist tradition the queen's
peach trees bore fruit only every 3,000 years. Anyone who ate a
peach was granted immortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The painting is exquisite, the enamels are in very good
condition, and the story is wonderfully fantastical,'' said Athena
Zonars, a specialist in Chinese ceramics at Christie's. The
estimate is $30,000 to $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Less expensive Qing porcelains can be found on the Web, for
under $2,000 at Sothebys.amazon.com, and at the Arts of Pacific
Asia Show. One dealer at that show, Midori Gallery of Miami, is
selling a five-piece famille-rose Qing garniture set from the late
19th century for $20,000. It has an incense burner, candle stands

EVEN TALENTED JAMIE FOXX ISN'T A KEEPER IN WEAK ACTION FLICK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CHRISTOPHER KELLY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After years working on the pop-culture periphery in his own TV
show on UPN and in the inspired (and hugely underrated) sex farce
``Booty Call,'' Jamie Foxx scored a major breakthrough last year in
Oliver Stone's football drama ``Any Given Sunday.'' The film itself
was a muddle, but Stone recognized Foxx's best quality _ his
mixture of relaxed comic playfulness and an almost venomous-seeming
sexual energy _ and framed Foxx's character accordingly. The
resulting performance was similar to watching Will Smith in ``Six
Degrees of Separation'' _ a lightweight teen heartthrob suddenly
showing a gravity that no one could have predicted.
</P>
<P>
   So it makes a lot of sense for Foxx to take the next step _ up
to a Will Smith-style action crossover superstar role. It's sad
that he chose a script that is essentially a dumbed-down remake of
Smith's ``Enemy of the State,'' a handicap only exacerbated by a
director, Antoine Fuqua, who seems to take all of his visual
inspiration from the movie ``Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is apparent from the first sequence, a gold heist in
New York that goes awry. The film's sniveling bad guy (Doug
Hutchison) is swindled out of his share of the take by his partner
(Robert Pastorelli). A bang-'em-up car chase between the Feds and
the sniveler ensues, but Fuqua dispenses with establishing shots
and instead serves up, in rapid fire, one cut after another of
mayhem and crunching metal. This may be fun to watch, but good luck
making a shred of sense out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Foxx's Alvin Sanders who, for reasons never quite
explained, is across town robbing a fish warehouse. He ends up at
Riker's Island, sharing a cell with the sniveler's partner _ who
managed to bury the gold in a secret location, but who was picked
up for drunken driving on his way home. It gets worse. The robber
also turns out to have a heart problem, and he dies after not
taking his pills. Flash-forward 18 months: In an effort to capture
the sniveler who got away, the Feds knock Alvin unconscious,
secretly plant a tracking device in his skull, and let him out of
prison _ with the hope that the sniveling bad guy will think Alvin
knows were the gold is and come after him.
</P>
<P>
   If this all sounds senseless, well, wait until you see where
they buried the gold! The screenplay, by Andrew and Adam Schienman
and Tony Gilroy, barely qualifies as a first draft _ it piles one
ludicrous plot twist atop another and bothers not a whit with
logic. This might not have mattered much if the action sequences
came off. But in addition to being visually incoherent, the set
pieces are jaw-droppingly stupid (the climax, featuring Foxx on a
racehorse riding in the opposite direction of a race that's being
run, is like something out of a Marx Brothers movie, only here it's
played straight). As for Foxx, he toggles between dithering
stand-up comic shtick and serious ``paranoid guy'' poses _ which
only further contributes to the make-it-up-as-we-go-along spirit of
the whole movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bait'' probably won't do much damage to Foxx's rising star _
he's an immensely compelling on-screen presence and has built up
enough good will with audiences that they'll forget this turkey
fast. But he needs to learn that a successful acting career is as
much about making good choices in projects as it is about anything
else.

`THE ELIAN GONZALEZ STORY': LITTLE ELIAN, HAPPY AT LAST? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes appear at end of review. Time, channel are
for New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has the political heft of a Disney cartoon, the dramatic
tension of ``Saturday Night Live'' and is so upbeat it should have
been called ``Everybody Loves Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Fox Family Channel movie ``The Elian Gonzalez Story''
is significant merely because it exists. The little boy had hardly
set foot on Florida's shore before the course of his life became
inseparable from the television circus around him. This
simple-minded film, the latest turn in the media extravaganza,
displays how television shapes and reshapes events.
</P>
<P>
   Though it seems the story has been around much longer, it was
only last Thanksgiving when Elian was found floating in an inner
tube, having survived a flight from Cuba in a crowded boat that
claimed his mother's life. Almost at once, television news helped
make the battle over Elian's custody an international incident.
</P>
<P>
   When his relatives in Miami refused to return him to his father
in Cuba, their campaign was fought with photo ops and sound bites
as much as with the law. Television viewers became accustomed to
seeing crowds of Cuban-Americans gathered outside the house in
Little Havana, Elian's cousin Marisleysis emotional and sometimes
hysterical on-camera appearances and a happy-looking Elian paraded
before the cameras. Elian's life became a virtual gallery of iconic
moments, culminating with the still photograph of a federal agent
in riot gear taking the boy at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   If the cable news channels puffed the story up, this movie
re-enacts those scenes as bland caricatures. Trying to change a
complex political battle into entertainment for the largest
possible audience, the film creates a fantasy in which there are
only heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel (Esai Morales, in a cardboard role),
loves his son and believes in Castro's Cuba. Most of the film,
though, assumes the point of view of the Miami relatives. If they
are guilty of anything, it is loving the little boy too much, as
television-movie characters so often do. Their fictional images
here stray far from the news clips that created such divided
opinions about them.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Great-Uncle Lazaro, in reality an angry presence with a
striking pompadour of black hair, is played by Miguel Sandoval as a
warm, balding teddy bear. The fictional Marisleysis (Laura Elena
Harding) is more rational than the actual one and is given demure
brown hair, a small but telling detail. Replacing her artificial
brassy color has the instant effect of raising her social class
without saying a word. Any hard-nosed calculations from either the
Cuban-American community in Miami or American politicians _
calculations that so coldly exploited the child in reality _ have
been smoothed away.
</P>
<P>
   There's no reason to think any other network would have done
things much differently. As early as last spring, CBS had a deal in
place to create its own Elian movie, a project the network is still
developing with Craig Anderson, the producer of its romanticized
mini-series ``Sally Hemings.'' First as news and now as fiction,
the Elian story reveals television's knee-jerk tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   But the relatively new Fox Family Channel (one of Fox's cable
channels, not to be confused with the broadcast network, of ``The
Simpsons'' and ``X-Files'' fame) apparently wants to out-Disney
Disney, so this film goes as far as possible in stripping the Elian
tale of any hint of controversy. Fox's own press material spells
out what the film intends to do: ``Behind the headlines. Beyond the
politics. The story of a family torn apart.''
</P>
<P>
   After you recover from the sugar-shock of those cloying lines,
you can see that they unwittingly point to what is bogus about the
movie. It can't get behind the headlines if it refuses to deal with
complex motives. The idea of going beyond politics is absurd
because politics is what made the story a public rather than a
private matter in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the film's approach brings to mind the singsong way
Conan O'Brien used to call the boy ``Leetle Ay-lian,'' mocking the
sappy news reports. This movie even begins with a cliched vision of
sunny Cuba, with Che posters plastered on buildings, colorful
laundry hanging across alleys, Elian kicking a soccer ball with
friends. Juan Miguel calls Elian home. It is time for him to return
to his mother, who tells her ex-husband that she is taking their
son to Havana for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd dramatic turn, the disaster at sea is saved for later,
in a few flashbacks. We cut to the Gonzalez family in Miami
watching the Thanksgiving parade on television and being called to
get their young relative. Soon Lazaro, in a phone conversation with
his nephew Juan Miguel, blurts out, ``For his own good, I think
Elian should stay here.'' He tells his family about the decision:
``I didn't plan it. I hadn't even thought about it.'' It's hard to
complain that we don't share Lazaro's thoughts when the script has
so clearly decided not to give him any.
</P>
<P>
   The central scene comes when Lazaro tells why he is determined
to keep the boy. In one of a handful of skittish references the
script chooses not to explore, Lazaro tells his advisers that while
they may want to use Elian for political reasons, he has different
reasons. His eyes welling with tears, he says, ``I want to keep him
here 'cause I would miss him so damn much if he left. It would
break my heart if he left.'' We're meant to sympathize, but such
lines inadvertently depict Lazaro as a selfish airhead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Marisleysis believes Elian is a miracle child
delivered to them by God, making ``The Elian Gonzalez Story'' sound
like ``Touched by an Angel.'' No wonder the film dashes through a
tough scene it cannot ignore. Marisleysis assumes a tone of sad
necessity when she creates a home video of Elian telling his father
he wants to stay in Miami. In this brief re-creation, Elian (Alec
Roberts) is not nearly as angry as he was in that real tape, which
was so unsettling it quickly became known as ``the hostage video.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a few other times when the film takes a similar
hit-and-run approach to deeper issues. Everything about the
family's relations with their Cuban-American political advisers,
the real untold story, is even murkier in the film. Armando
Guttierrez (Tony Amendola), the Gonzalez family's spokesman,
appears out of nowhere offering help with legal affairs and public
relations. He is seen in the office of a group called Democracy
Movement, in reality a Cuban-American organization behind many of
the vigils in Little Havana, though that is not explained either.
</P>
<P>
   The film is most laughable when it resorts to caricatures of
Janet Reno, Fidel Castro and Donato Dalrymple, the fisherman who
said he pulled Elian from the sea but is shown here watching from
the boat, then claiming credit for heroism. When James Quattochi
imitates Dalrymple's hoarse, hysterical voice on the morning the
federal agents take Elian, the film plunges into pure,
unintentional comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Even that most iconic moment, when the agents arrive, is
softened here with Cuban music playing in the background. The scene
quickly shifts to Elian happily reunited with his father.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken less than three months for the television seesaw to
transform a complex political event into this pablum, which is all
too typical of how television recycles its own excesses. As recent
news films of Elian going to his first day of school in Cuba
showed, the story is still here. All we can hope is that we are
spared a sequel, ``Little Elian Goes to Therapy.''  &QL;

to invest $3.65 billion in Long-Term Capital Management, an obscure

world learn what still seems implausible today: That this tiny
bond-trading firm, virtually unknown, had panicked financial

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ More than 3 million Americans played golf for the
first time last year, which has sometimes made public courses and
country clubs across the land almost as crowded as the freeway
during rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   So many fledgling golfers, so many errant shots.
</P>
<P>
   So many lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't it figure, just as predictably as night follows day?
Yes, indeed there has been a marked increase in golf course-related
litigation, according to Manhattan-based attorney Robert D. Lang,
who has reviewed cases in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The list of those who have tried to receive compensation for
injuries on the links is long and varied. It includes spectators at
tournaments, caddies struck while on the job, homeowners whose
property borders a golf course, a motorist who had the misfortune
to be driving down a highway alongside a golf course when a poorly
hit ball whacked his car, even a golfer whose errant shot whacked a
yardage marker, ricocheted and plunked him.
</P>
<P>
   There is a silver lining for the person with a bad slice,
however. Even if your fellow golfer is not very understanding, the
courts usually are.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits based on golfing accidents rarely result in judgments
against the defendant, Lang says. Golf course accidents are a
given, justices and juries have declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jurors don't tend to like those types of cases, thinking
anyone who's engaged in something like golf tends to get what's
coming to them,'' Lang said. ``Some jurors view golf as an elitist
sport, and they're particularly unsympathetic to these sorts of
lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits, however frivolous, are not amusing when they involve
you. Professionals at public and private clubs are reluctant to
discuss litigation stemming from incidents at their courses.
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga Springs attorney Matthew Jones, a lawyer in Saratoga
Springs, N.Y., said that golf course lawsuits are on the rise
despite the fact that the courts are reluctant to penalize the
golfer. Jones, who played on the University of Vermont golf team 30
years ago, finds some of the litigation laughable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you read these cases, they almost always talk in terms of
negligence, saying that the shot did not go exactly where the
golfer intended it to go. Well, no kidding!'' Jones said. ``This is
golf, where to slice is human, and to hit long and straight
divine.''
</P>
<P>
   Lang believes there is a simple reason why so many men, women
and children are now being drawn to golf for the first time: Tiger
Woods. Golf has never been more popular, thanks largely to Woods,
the pro superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Television ratings are at an all-time high whenever Woods is in
the hunt for another championship, prompting more and more people
to give the game a try. And putting more folks potentially in the
way of errant shots on the links.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most golfers have been witness to at least one incident where
someone has been hit by a golf ball,'' Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the equation, notes Lang, a personal injury and
casualty specialist at the firm D'Amato &AMP; Lynch, is that we are
living in an increasingly litigious society. ``If someone has an
injury,'' he noted, ``the first thing they want is to have someone
else pay for their medical bills and injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Lang is a self-described mediocre golfer who says he's never
been sued for a golf shot gone awry, but has represented several
clients who have sought compensation for injuries that occurred on
the links. (He advises friends to be sure to have an umbrella
policy to guard against all sorts of unforeseen mishaps, including
those that are golf course-related.)
</P>
<P>
   The attorney reviewed more than a dozen lawsuits in an article
he wrote for the July/August issue of the New York State Bar
Journal. In his research for the story, titled ``Lawsuits on the
Links: Golfers Must Exercise Ordinary Care to Avoid Slices, Shanks
and Hooks,'' Lang found that in every suit he studied the case was
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Jenks vs. McGranaghan, the defendant drove a golf
ball without warning from the eighth tee and hit a player at the
ninth tee, which was adjacent to the eighth fairway. The ball
struck the player in the eye, causing blindness.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the defendant's group had shouted ``fore,'' but the
plaintiff did not hear.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the defendant was preparing to drive, the plaintiff
was behind the protective fence where he had left his golf bag,
walking out just at the time the defendant drove the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Court of Appeals wrote that a ``golfer cannot be
expected to break his concentration while addressing the ball the
instant before he hits to look up and see if someone has just
stepped into the danger zone,'' and concluded that there was
therefore no duty to yell ``fore'' before hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Lang advises that the basic rule imposes no duty on the golfer
to warn people who are not in the intended line of the ball's
flight, and that spectators, in general, assume the risk that even
the best golfers cannot avoid an occasional hook or slice.
</P>
<P>
   When a suit is filed, he concluded, the crux of the inquiry is
likely to be whether ``the harm to the defendant was reasonably
foreseeable, with the onus on the player taking the shot to take
reasonable precaution to protect those in the intended line of
flight of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Said lawyer and golfer Jones: ``What it comes down to, I think
the courts are saying, is common sense prevails on the golf course.
I think that's the theme. If you hit a ball toward some people, you
should yell and let them know.''

PACE IS FORSAKING SOHO FOR CHELSEA AND GETTING LOTS OF COMPANY;
TEXAS MUSEUM ANNOUNCES THE ACQUISITION OF A RENAISSANCE
MASTERPIECE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Texas, Britain, Italy, France)   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Jan. 10, PaceWildenstein plans to close its
10-year-old gallery at 142 Greene St. in SoHo and migrate to
Chelsea, opening in mid-March at 534 W. 25th St. While Pace will
keep its sleek 57th Street space, its new downtown location will be
something of an artwork. Arne Glimcher, chairman of
PaceWildenstein, has commissioned the California artist Robert
Irwin to design the space.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, whom Pace has represented since 1966, is the design
consultant to the Dia Center for the Arts' new branch in Beacon,
N.Y. ``We've been watching Bob's drawings of Beacon, and thought
he'd be perfect to design our new gallery,'' Glimcher said.
``Nobody understands light the way Irwin does.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he stressed that he is first and foremost an artist,
Irwin has put on a design hat before, helping with the design of
places like the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego. ``I looked
at other galleries in Chelsea, those swept-out spaces each with
elaborate architectural statements,'' he said. ``I'm a fan of
modernism, but here it seemed out of character.'' He plans to
conceive a design that he feels is more appropriate to the
neighborhood, with its warehouse buildings and garages dating from
the early years of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaving some vestiges of the old building _ a pair of
garages _ like the wood beam ceiling,'' he said. He also plans to
put in vertical windows with brick columns between them. ``At first
it will look symmetrical,'' Irwin said, ``But they're actually
asymmetrical.''
</P>
<P>
   CHELSEA HOT SPOTS
</P>
<P>
   PaceWildenstein is just one of a number of dealers moving to
Chelsea. Some have just opened; others, like Pace, are in the
throes of renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Like PaceWildenstein, Mary Boone is keeping her uptown gallery
but plans to open in Chelsea on Nov. 4. Her new gallery, at 541 W.
24th St., is in a space that virtually backs up to PaceWildenstein.
Charles Cowles, a SoHo dealer who has temporarily taken space at 74
Grand St. after moving out of 420 West Broadway, will be her
neighbor. His new gallery, at 537 W. 24th St., is expected to open
the first week in January.
</P>
<P>
   Another hot spot is 535 W. 22nd St., where seven dealers _ six
from SoHo _ have leased space from Dia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a 1917 warehouse building, which Dia bought in 1992 to
show our permanent collection, but once our new museum in Beacon
got under way we decided to rent it,'' said Michael Govan, director
of Dia. The contemporary-art center is attempting by its example to
try to ensure that the neighborhood will not be taken over by
high-style shops: the leases stipulate that all tenants must be art
galleries.
</P>
<P>
   The six SoHo dealers that will occupy the building are Friedrich
Petzel, who opened on the ground floor last week; Marianne Boesky,
who opened last week on the second floor; Yancey Richardson, who
plans to open on Nov. 11 on the third floor; CRG Gallery, also
scheduled to open Nov. 11 on the third floor; Frederieke
Taylor/Tz'art Gallery, opening on Oct. 21 on the sixth floor; and
Julie Saul, also planning to open on Oct. 21 on the sixth floor.
Leslie Tonkonow Artworks Projects, which was at 601 W. 26th St.,
hopes to open on the sixth floor in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   After 17 years in the Fuller Building on 57th Street, ACA
expects to open in mid-October on the fifth floor of 529 W. 20th
St. It will be joined by Paul Rodgers9W, opening next Friday on the
ninth floor. Howard Scott opened last Thursday on the seventh
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Three old-time artist cooperatives _ Bowery Gallery, Prince
Street and Blue Mountain _ will be leaving their SoHo space on Dec.
1 after 10 years and moving to 530 W. 25th St. They hope to reopen
in March.
</P>
<P>
   KIMBELL BUYS RARITY
</P>
<P>
   The Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, has announced its
latest purchase: a gilt bronze statue of St. John the Baptist,
recently identified as a lost masterpiece by the Florentine
sculptor and architect Michelozzo di Bartolommeo. The sculpture, 22
5/8 inches high, was commissioned by Piero de Medici around 1450
for the Church of Santa Maria dei Servi (known as the Santissima
Annunziata) in Florence around 1450.
</P>
<P>
   The only known works by Michelozzo outside Italy are two
fragmentary marble angels in the Victoria and Albert Museum in
London. ``There has not been a more important Renaissance discovery
than this in a generation,'' said Timothy Potts, director of the
Kimbell. ``It's one of the first free-standing sculptures in the
Renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kimbell bought the sculpture, which depicts St. John the
Baptist in his camel-pelt undergarment, a year ago but delayed the
announcement while the work was being cleaned by conservators at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Jack Soultanian, the conservator
responsible for European sculpture at the Met, calls the statue ``a
masterpiece.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's heavily cast, and the detailing of the surface is
beautifully finished,'' Soultanian said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Kimbell declined to say what the museum paid
for the sculpture, but art experts put the price at just under $4
million.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture was originally above a baptismal stoup in the
entrance to the church and was thought to have been removed during
renovations in the 18th century. It was later sold, and then it
disappeared. The work surfaced, unidentified, in the collection of
Jean-Georges Rueff, a French dealer and decorator, who had owned it
for decades. In 1995 he sold it to an unidentified Swiss collector
through a dealer living in England; at that point an Italian
scholar, Giancarlo Gentilini, identified it as a Michelozzo. The
same dealer sold it to the Kimbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was contacted by a dealer living in London who knew we were
looking for great things,'' Potts said. He declined to give the
dealer's name. Experts would only say the dealer is Russian-born
and lived in Venice until he moved to England recently. &QL;

`THE DREAM CATCHER:' RECKLESS ISN'T GLAMOROUS, JIMMY DEAN, JIMMY
DEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Clacking freight trains silhouetted against a fading
late autumn sunset, the peripheral blur of trees speeding by a
moving boxcar, the hollow glare of anonymous gas stations and bus
depots, and the desolation of shabby bars and luncheonettes on the
wrong side of the tracks: These are some of the recurrent images
that lend Ed Radtke's melancholy road film ``The Dream Catcher'' an
enveloping sadness.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which opens a one-week engagement Friday at the
Walter Reade Theater as part of the Film Society of Lincoln
Center's Independent Feature Project, follows the odyssey of two
runaway teen-age boys scrounging their way across the country, each
on his own vaguely defined personal quest. Freddy (Maurice Compte),
a handsome, stony-faced brooder, is fleeing a pregnant girlfriend
in Philadelphia while searching for the father he barely remembers.
Albert (Paddy Connor), who attaches himself to Freddy early in the
trip is a voluble, smart-aleck prankster from Dayton, Ohio, headed
for Reno to reunite with a mother he hasn't seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dream Catcher'' could be described as a ``lost boy'' film
as well as a road movie, and the scenes in which the characters
poignantly press their noses to the glass of an adult
self-sufficiency that seems as unreachable as the stars, will put a
lump in your throat. What grown man doesn't remember having been
gripped as an adolescent by a sinking feeling when finding himself
in a strange situation with only pocket change and no parents
hovering nearby? ``The Dream Catcher'' conjures those moments of
choked-back anxiety and the strategies for disguising it that range
from displays of phony bravado to an impenetrable withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's greatest assets are Compte's and (especially)
Connor's performances. Compte deftly deglamorizes a sullen movie
stereotype that dates back to James Dean. Connor's Albert, by turns
charming and infuriating, is an impetuous boy-child with a wild
streak that grows more reckless as the journey continues. The two
actors beautifully evoke the establishment of a fragile fraternal
bond that is continually tested by Albert's impulsive acts of
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dream Catcher,'' like almost every other road movie, is a
schematic patchwork of episodes that wants to piece together an
offbeat mosaic of American life. Its gallery of characters includes
a Bible-thumping couple of mixed race, the kindly Indian caretaker
of a church in which the boys spend the night (Patrick Shining
Elk), a raving gun nut, and a divorced nurse (Jeanne Heaton) who
takes the boys under her wing late in their odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   But as one vignette folds into the next, the storytelling often
seems forced. Recurrent symbolic images of a white bird furiously
beating its wings inside a cage strike a pretentiously false note.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the film, Freddy visits his ailing, hospital-bound
uncle (Larry John Meyers) who informs him that his father, recently
discharged from prison, is living in Oklahoma City. Freddy doggedly
tracks him down. But when he faces his dad, a gruff, hard-boiled
ticket taker in a parking garage, Freddy's volatile reaction
doesn't quite ring true. Nor do Albert's antics with a gun he
somehow succeeds in stealing from the glove compartment of a hunter
who gives the boys a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its small glitches, ``The Dream Catcher'' sustains a
mood of aimless adolescent angst, and its vision of the road is
uncompromisingly bleak. The dreams luring these teen-age drifters
into the Wild West are leftover childhood illusions. In the end,
there's nothing out there.

SPORTS OF THE TIMES: GAMES NEED NEW BLOOD TO SURVIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The sun is setting on fading empires.
Gerontocracies are going out of style. The Olympic movement is
starting to resemble the Soviet Union in its final days, just
before people attacked the Berlin Wall with sledgehammers. In this
case, the cracks are appearing from within.
</P>
<P>
   The newest set of Summer Games are beginning this weekend,
following an opening ceremony both touching and spectacular. But
there are a lot of extravaganzas in the world, a lot of sporting
jamborees, and there is no guarantee that people are going to buy
this retro act much longer.
</P>
<P>
   The world is getting smaller. The Sydney Morning Herald this
week ran photographs of Darryl Strawberry and the Monday night
football game.
</P>
<P>
   To love the Olympics for the next two weeks, you have to go
along with the program _ gold medals, old-fashioned amateur sport,
sound mind and sound body, fair play. The old ideals don't work
with the world snickering in the background.
</P>
<P>
   It is the sadness of Juan Antonio Samaranch that he stayed on
too long. He knows it. The look of weariness is on his face. He no
longer makes any pretense at having fun with this business. It's
over. The real question is where the International Olympic
Committee goes from here. Can it hold Games in Athens in 2004 and
in some undesignated city in 2008 with the guaranteed full
obeisance of the host city? Those days may be over.
</P>
<P>
   Before the first shuttlecock is fired in anger here, the powers
that be have already spent a week that would have embarrassed the
average elected public official.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch and his Politburo were seen agitating over missing
brethren, a boxing fixer from Uzbekistan and a basketball officer
from Hong Kong who were denied entry by the Australian government
on the grounds of questionable activities. The IOC also seemed
highly perturbed about the legal troubles of an Indonesian
colleague known for razing the rain forest and supporting an old
dictatorship back home. With friends like these ... as the saying
goes.
</P>
<P>
   It was extremely bad timing for the Olympic movement to have the
next two sets of Games already assigned to cheeky former colonies.
People in Australia generally like to hoot at pomposity, and they
have surely enjoyed watching the IOC fumble around this week.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the ongoing spectacle from Salt Lake City, where
two former big shots are set up to take the hit for the rich
burghers they served. The IOC heavies are furious that documents
from Salt Lake City organizers would be accessible in potential
trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't you just burn everything like our esteemed
colleagues in Nagano did?'' the IOC honchos seemed to be shrieking,
while a few Yanks tried to explain that the laws of the land allow
distribution of evidence. Peculiar place, this America.
</P>
<P>
   It's all going bad. Thursday, Samaranch held his quadrennial
news conference before the opening of the Games. As if the mood
around the IOC were not operatic enough, somebody chose to pipe in
the sounds of Pavarotti singing ``Nessun Dorma'' from Turandot
while the world press awaited the entrance of the dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said little in a few languages, demonstrating all the
blandness of latter-day Soviet Union presidents like Brezhnev,
Andropov, Chernenko.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of the ``enhanced role of women on our executive
board,'' noted the inclusion of contemporary athletes, praised
alleged advances in testing for drugs, alluded to healing gestures
between the two Koreas, between Bosnia and Herzegovina, the
inclusion of athletes from East Timor. He made it all seem so
banal.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody asked if Samaranch planned to go to Salt Lake City in
2002, and he answered: ``If I am invited. I am awaiting an
invitation.'' Lawyers will be on call. The future of the Olympic
movement is in the hands of the U.S. Justice Department. If the
Games survive, the United States won't be the host for a century or
three.
</P>
<P>
   While Samaranch presided over this exercise in ostensible
democracy, he was flanked by younger IOC officials undoubtedly
still hoping for their turn. Have they been tainted by the blatant
associations with hustlers from outposts like Uzbekistan and Salt
Lake City? Quite possibly.
</P>
<P>
   What the IOC may need is to go out and hire a chief executive
officer who knows how to handle money, handle the law, handle the
public, handle the press. It needs a David Stern of the National
Basketball Association, a Dick Ebersol of the National Broadcasting
Co., a David D'Alessandro of the John Hancock Co., just to mention
three skilled and personable Yanks who just might be able to save
the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   There are cracks in the Lausanne Wall. A few more snickers from
the colonies, and the walls come tumbling down.  &QL;

CLINTON SAYS HE IS `TROUBLED' BY HANDLING OF SCIENTIST'S CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STOUT  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Thursday he was ``quite
troubled'' by how the government handled the prosecution of Dr. Wen
Ho Lee. The president's remarks came just hours after Attorney
General Janet Reno defended the Justice Department's conduct in the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in light of a plea agreement reached Wednesday that
set free Lee, the former Los Alamos scientist originally accused of
espionage, the government could not justify the way it had treated
him.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge James Parker apologized to Lee, 60,
Wednesday after accepting his guilty plea to one count of
mishandling nuclear secrets. Parker said the government should not
have held him in solitary confinement, prohibiting him from talking
to his family, save for an hour each week. Parker said the
executive branch's conduct had ``embarrassed the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters on the south lawn of the White House,
Clinton said he and his aides had taken prosecutors at their word
that Lee should not be freed and was a danger to national security.
But Clinton said he personally had doubts about the government's
stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had reservations about the claims that were being
made denying him bail,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that , in light of the plea deal, the case against
Lee was not as strong or wide ranging as prosecutors had suggested
initially. He said that given that the Justice Department was
willing to let Lee walk free as part of the plea agreement, it was
difficult to justify their earlier demands that he be kept in
solidary confinement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden they reach a plea agreement which will, if
anything, make his alleged offense look modest compared to the
claims that were made against him,'' Clinton said. ``So the whole
thing was quite troubling to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks were at odds with Reno's position that the
government had acted correctly. Reno defended the government's
conduct in the Wen Ho Lee case Wednesday, saying she had no regrets
about it personally, and that Lee deserved no apology.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was peppered with questions at her regular weekly briefing
about the case, in which the former Los Alamos scientist was freed
on Wednesday after pleading guilty to a single charge of
mishandling nuclear secrets. But Reno refused to budge Thursday
from the government's long-standing position that Lee brought his
troubles on himself (and potentially on his country) by downloading
and mishandling nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a great respect for Judge Parker,'' Reno said, ``and I
regret that he feels that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general chose her words carefully and delivered
them in an even tone, as is her custom, but there was no mistaking
her feelings. ``We went over the evidence. We looked at the law. We
made the best decision we could, based on the evidence and the law,
and I feel very comfortable about that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The government's case against Lee, which was never officially an
``espionage'' case as such, unraveled in recent weeks, so much so
that dozens of felony counts went by the wayside and the defendant
admitted to only a single count before being released.
</P>
<P>
   Does Lee deserve an apology, as the judge said?
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Lee had the opportunity from the beginning to resolve this
matter, and he chose not to,'' Reno said, ``and I think he must
look to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, she elaborated: ``With respect to issues of
whether apologies are out of the question or who, what should have
been done differently, I with all my heart and soul wish that Lee
had come forward, said, ``This is what I did with the information,
this is what I did with the tapes.'''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general said she and her staff had been guided only
by concerns for national security and the necessity of finding out
just what the scientist had done with the sensitive material he
mishandled.
</P>
<P>
   And she said there was nothing to the accusation, made by some
of Lee's supporters, that Lee was mistreated because he is of
Chinese descent. ``There was no racial bias in anything we did,''
she said.

<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `BLESS THE CHILD'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kim Basinger, Rufus Sewell and Jimmy Smits. Directed by
Chuck Russell. (R, 115 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   A runny supernatural soap opera _ the first thriller of the
``Touched by an Angel'' era _ that tries for the elegant calm of
``The Sixth Sense'' but fails. It is too often overcome by its
flamboyantly cheesy reflexes. Basinger is the protector aunt of a
child (the gifted Holliston Coleman) whose heavenly powers make her
the target of an evil cult leader (Sewell, chewing his English
accent as if it were sunflower seeds). He means to kill her before
Easter; you may feel the need to leave long before then. ``Bless
the Child'' seems derivative of so many other movies that you're
surprised it doesn't have to credit its sources the way hip-hop
artists do when they sample songs. With Smits as an FBI agent and
Ian Holm as a priest who does a laughable steal from ``The Usual
Suspects'' (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `BRING IT ON'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Bradford and Eliza Dushku.
Directed by Peyton Reed (PG-13, 110 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Even though it does feature young women bouncing around in
skimpy outfits, this cheerleader comedy directed with giddy,
sometimes sloppy pep-rally intensity by Reed from a brisk, slangy
script by Jessica Bendinger is more than a low-minded appeal to
male lechery. Though bound by the conventions of the sports movie
and the teen-age romantic comedy, ``Bring It On'' has a fine
satirical edge, and at least glances at some serious issues of race
and sexuality. It's also a vehicle for the vibrant comic talents of
Dunst, ably supported by Bradford as her cute, nonconformist love
interest, and Dushku as his sister (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CELL'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Lopez, Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn.
Directed by Tarsem Singh (R, 110 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   A serial killer named Stargher ( D'Onofrio), who abducts women
and imprisons them in a Plexiglas cell that slowly fills with
water, has a seizure and goes into a coma. His latest victim is
trapped in his cell, and she has to be found before the automated
torture takes her life. An FBI agent (Vaughn) talks a child
psychologist (Lopez) into using an experimental technique to enter
the killer's subconscious. Singh's talents haven't quite jelled
into storytelling yet. He folds this tale over and over on itself,
working with a script that blends elements of ``The Silence of the
Lambs,'' ``Manhunter,'' ``The Matrix,'' ``Seven,'' ``Dreamscape''
and ``Spellbound'' with the stop-motion animation of the brothers
Quay (``Street of Crocodiles''), the moody photography of Matt
Mahurin, the paintings of Francis Bacon and so many other things
that there's no there there (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CREW'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Dreyfuss, Burt Reynolds, Dan Hedaya and Seymour
Cassel. Directed by Michael Dinner (PG-13, 88 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This sloppy, cliche-ridden comedy about four aging mobsters
blundering their way through a series of unlikely capers has
moments of wit provided by Barry Fanaro's overplotted script and
Hedaya's priceless goofing. But the picture, with no clear idea of
what it wants to do, lurches between slapstick and sentimentality,
wasting the talents of Dreyfuss, Cassel and Lainie Kazan. Reynolds,
meanwhile, absurdly cast as a New Jersey mafioso, looks as bored
and grouchy as the audience will be after 88 minutes of this mess
(Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `IT ALL STARTS TODAY'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Philippe Torreton. Directed by Bertrand Tavernier (not
rated, 117 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Filmed with unassuming realism, beautiful to look at even as it
avoids any suggestion of stylishness, Tavernier's latest film is a
passionate and relentless look at how chronic unemployment _ with
the usual side effects of alcoholism, domestic abuse and pervasive
despair _ menaces the lives of children. Torreton plays the
director of a preschool in a town where the coal mines have been
shut down, and the film chronicles his daily battles with
bureaucrats, parents and his own pessimism. The film avoids both
sentimentality and cynical despair; Torreton's character refuses to
succumb to hopelessness, but he also refuses to rule it out
(Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `MADADAYO'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tatsuo Matsumura. Directed by Akira Kurosawa (not
rated, 134 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   In the course of his long career, Kurosawa, who died in 1998,
made a number of great movies. His last film, ``Madadayo,''
released in Japan in 1993, lacks the narrative intensity of
emotional range to be considered among his masterpieces, but within
its own modest proportions it achieves a kind of perfection. The
story is not much: a retired professor in postwar Tokyo lives out
his twilight years in the glow of his former students' devotion and
declares his unreadiness to say farewell to the life he lives with
humor and gusto. But Kurosawa's absolute assurance as a filmmaker
and his unabashed affection for his characters make ``Madadayo'' a
richly, and in a way inexplicably, satisfying movie (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `NURSE BETTY'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Morgan Freeman, Renee Zellweger, Chris Rock and Greg
Kinnear. Directed by Neil LaBute (R, 112 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Alternately hilarious, poignant and gory, this modern fairy tale
that follows an aspiring nurse (Zellweger), suffering from
traumatic amnesia, to Los Angeles to win the love of her favorite
soap-opera character is a contemporary ``Wizard of Oz.'' Hollywood
is the Emerald City. Kinnear is the self-centered actor who plays
her heart's desire on television. Freeman and Rock are a sadly
introspective hit man and his hot-headed protege who follow her
across the country with intention to do harm. This may be the
deepest and funniest American comedy since David O. Russell's
``Flirting With Disaster'' (Stephen Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and
Bernie Mac. Directed by Spike Lee (R, 117 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Filmed before a live audience on two nights in February in
Charlotte, N.C., the self-proclaimed Kings of Comedy swagger across
the stage, urban legends in resplendent outfits. Until a couple of
years ago the comedians' exposure was limited mostly to cable
television. Here their comedy gives audiences that have never seen
anything like it a hilarious window on a new world. They display
their chops when they talk about family, specifically
African-American family with roots in the South (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE REPLACEMENTS'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman. Directed by Howard
Deutch (PG-13, 105 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This negligible jock comedy, about a group of misfit macho
clowns who suit up for pro football during a players' strike, just
wants to be loved: Is that so wrong? This rehashed and desperate
picture stars Reeves as the honorable, stoic fill-in quarterback.
(He glides through.) Hackman musters his requisite command as the
honorable, stoic fill-in coach in a wardrobe from the Tom Landry
Collection, mouthing dialogue from ``Hoosiers'' and old United
Airlines commercials. The unvaried ragtag scab players include a
pair of violent bodyguard brothers (Faison Love and Michael
Taliferro), a violent cop (Jon Favreau) and a violent felon on loan
to the league (Michael Jace). Brooke Langton is the cheerleader who
resolves not to date players and dates Reeves anyway. It's a
peculiarity from L.A., a union town: a film that celebrates
anti-union activity (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``SAVING GRACE'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brenda Blethyn and Craig Ferguson. Directed by Nigel
Cole (R, 93 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This innocuous piece of comic Anglophilia features the usual
cast of lovable British eccentrics plopped down in a picturesque
seaside spot, in this case a Cornish village. Blethyn is Grace, a
widow whose husband committed suicide, leaving her $450,000 in debt
and in danger of losing her lovely stone house. She and her
resourceful gardener (Ferguson, who also wrote the screenplay)
convert her greenhouse into a marijuana farm, and the resulting
high jinks resemble a twee hybrid of ``The Full Monty'' and the
lesser works of Cheech and Chong (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `SOLAS'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Maria Galiana and Ana Fernandez. Written and directed
by Benito Zambrano (not rated, 98 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   When a simple Spanish woman ( Galiana) makes a rare journey to
the city to be with her husband, who is having surgery, she stays
with her embittered, alcoholic daughter ( Fernandez) who works for
a cleaning service. Galiana's eloquent, utterly unsentimental
portrayal of a woman who expects little of life is an
extraordinarily moving portrait of unconditional love gradually
working its wonders (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `SPACE COWBOYS'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and
James Garner. Directed by Eastwood. (PG-13, 105 minutes)
</P>
<P>
   The second half of Eastwood's new movie is a pleasant reworking
of the standard trouble-in-space movie, with Eastwood himself
leading a heroic team of astronauts that also includes Jones,
Sutherland and Garner. But the first half, which consists of the
comic, tough-old-guy interplay among these four sublime actors, is
a boisterous, easygoing tribute to manhood and maturity. Sutherland
and Jones are in especially fine form, as are Marcia Gay Harden,
playing a NASA engineer, and James Cromwell as (once again) the
villainous bureaucrat who tries to deny the old-timers their shot
at celestial glory (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE TAO OF STEVE,' starring Donal Logue and Greer Goodman.
Directed by Jenniphr Goodman (R, 87 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The ``Steve'' in the title refers to the spiritual embodiment of
cool as exemplified by Steve McQueen, Steve McGarrett (``Hawaii
Five-O'') and Steve Austin (``The Six Million Dollar Man''), a goal
to which the blobby and amiable Dex aspires. In this
light-as-a-marshmallow romantic comedy, Dex (Logue) has lined up
quotes from Heidegger, Thomas Aquinas and ``Don Giovanni'' to
rationalize his aimless pleasure-seeking in this rather aimless
movie. Logue's performance as a nice-guy player _ his weight
doesn't keep him from scoring with the ladies _ makes the movie
glide. Dex has a cherub's glee over what he gets away with. The
movie becomes a lot less interesting when it rolls around to the
inevitable quest for a steady relationship with a woman (Goodman)
whose feelings were trampled in Dex's compulsive fox hunting.
``Tao'' can't redeem the moves to its predictable end, but its
protagonist has a great time getting there (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WATCHER'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keanu Reeves, James Spader and Marisa Tomei. Directed
by Joe Charbanic (R, 93 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Reeves enunciates, Spader frets and Tomei just looks tired in
this pretentious, incoherent compilation of serial-killer cliches
and warmed-over MTV-style visual flourishes. Reeves is a sadistic,
diabolically intelligent strangler, Spader the FBI agent whose
psychic torment is the killer's real turn-on, and Tomei is the
agent's kindly therapist (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WAY OF THE GUN'
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ryan Phillippe, Benicio Del Toro and Juliette Lewis.
Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie (R, 120 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This film feels like a more violent and grim version of a Coen
brothers film; it could be Quentin Tarantino's ``Raising Arizona.''
Its lead characters are small-time criminals who tend to speak in
ambitious and hilariously orotund turns of phrase. The two, um,
heroes, while visiting a sperm bank, hatch a plan to kidnap a young
woman doing surrogate mother duty for a wealthy couple. ``Gun'' is
a stylish and intelligent film noir built around the feelings
adults have about babies, climaxing with a childbirth and a lengthy
gunfight and standoff (Mitchell).

 &HT;    Catching Phish an epiphany phor this phan
 &HT;    By Sara Pharr
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMEWHERE IN VERMONT _ Eight years of my life have been spent
following the Burlington, Vt., jam-rock band Phish, at least on
some level.
</P>
<P>
   From the very first song I heard at age 16 to now, at 24, I've
been a Phish fan. I can remember my first show like it was
yesterday _ I still have the ticket stub _ and I can remember that
when ``Farmhouse'' was released a few weeks ago, it was the first
time I didn't rush out and buy it immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Phish was a virtual ``introduction to music'' class. The group
led me to seek out new and exciting music, such as Colonel Bruce
Hampton and the Aquarium Rescue Unit, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones
and Miles Davis. Through reading about the band and its influences,
I became exposed to eclectic acts from Sun Ra's Arkestra to Frank
Zappa.
</P>
<P>
   Though I never got fully into the touring lifestyle (college and
a full-time job precluded that idea, which proves I was never a
neo-hippie), I did make sure to go to every Phish show in Dayton
and a few outside the area as well. My philosophy was: ``Hey, if
Phish is in Dayton or nearby, I ought to go see what they're up
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Often people ask, ``How can you follow one band around so
much?'' For every fan of the Grateful Dead, the Allman Brothers or
even Bruce Springsteen, the answer is obvious: Because you never
know what to expect. Every time Phish plays a show, there's
something different. With a vast catalog of songs, every set list
is different. Being there when the band jumps into a cover of a
song it's never played _ unannounced _ is something special indeed.
Being part of the Phish ``phamily'' is another bonus _ bonded
together by a love of the music, young adults from across the
country meet and swap stories about a band that becomes a metaphor
for life.
</P>
<P>
   All of this helps explain why Phish has become one of the top
touring acts in the world despite receiving minimal airplay (and
even that is mostly on college radio stations). However, the world
seems to be catching on: Rolling Stone, Spin, Alternative Press,
Entertainment Weekly _ Phish has recently been ``discovered'' by
every mainstream music magazine. The band has videos on MTV, M2 and
VH1. The phenomenon of Phish has been unmasked for all to see and
hear. Is it a good thing? Is it a bad thing? That's open to
speculation, but in the meantime, Phish is busy doing its thing _
putting out records, pleasing the fans and playing hundreds of
shows.
</P>

`CLAUDE AND THE IDEAL LANDSCAPE': COWS, VIRGIL AND ITALIAN
COUNTRYSIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Italy, Britain, Belgium)   By JOHN RUSSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Opinion now seems to be divided on whether this is
the 400th anniversary of the birth of Claude Lorrain (as one would
suppose from the inscription on his gravestone in Rome). But the
chance to see nearly 40 of his drawings and eight of his etchings
at the Pierpont Morgan Library is always timely.
</P>
<P>
   It was Pierpont Morgan himself who set the tone for Claude
drawings in 1910, when he bought the large group that, in part, has
prompted the library's present show, ``Claude and the Ideal
Landscape.'' Among much else he bought the ``Landscape With Aeneas
Landing at Carthage,'' which relates to the grand passion for
Virgil that powered many of Claude's finest paintings in his later
years. (He died in 1682.) Morgan also bought a drawing for Claude's
``Sermon on the Mount,'' a painting acquired by the Frick
Collection in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   The show owes much to loans from two holdings: the Thaw
Collection of the Morgan Library and the estate of Peter Jay Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   A good case can be made for the variety and the versatility of
Claude's ambitions. There are preliminary drawings for paintings,
like the ``Aeneas Hunting'' now in the Musee des Beaux-Arts in
Brussels, and the ``David With Three Heroes,'' now in the National
Gallery in London.
</P>
<P>
   There are souvenirs of the excursions that Claude, a French
expatriate artist who spent most of his life in Rome, made to the
Italian countryside, often with painter friends. It was one of his
colleagues on these country walks, a German named Joachim von
Sandrart, who left us the most convincing account of how Claude
actually went to work: ordering the given landscape with total
clarity and ``bringing everything together in correct harmony by
accentuating the front strongly and shading off the back in
proportion.'' This we can see for ourselves at the Morgan Library.
</P>
<P>
   The show offers some telling examples of Claude's interest in
animals. There was a so-called ``Animal Album'' by Claude, which
was kept in a Roman family for generations until it was sold at
auction in 1957. In particular, he was fascinated by cows and is
said to have made some 50 drawings of them.
</P>
<P>
   That the relationship between the herdsman and his beasts was
one that Claude studied with great tenderness is clear here from
the monumental drawing of two men tending an ox, which comes from
the Thaw Collection. Claude did more for the cow and the ox with
pen and ink than he normally did for human beings.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sparkling little drawing of the Temple of Vesta at
Tivoli, which was a favorite destination for painters who wanted a
day out in what was then unspoiled country. Claude delighted in the
Temple and often used it to stand in for antiquity. There are
drawings of unaccompanied travelers to remind us that making one's
way on foot among rocky hillsides in the late afternoon could be a
very lonely business.
</P>
<P>
   It was often held against Claude that he had no gift for
portraying the human figure. In the big paintings of his maturity
this mattered less, because the human figure was incidental. What
mattered were the sky, the sea, the splendid trees, sometimes the
ships, and the carefully fabricated architecture. The people were
tiny stock figures who came with gestures to match. If they gave
any trouble, perspective could fix it.
</P>
<P>
   In his drawings Claude carries us away by his skill with trees,
with water, with the movement of the light and with his mastery of
complicated textures. His ``David and the Three Heroes'' here is a
capital example. It is done with ``brush and brown wash over black
and red chalk, heightened with white body color, on paper tinted
with brown wash,'' as the text panel explains. Claude did his very
best, and the four figures have the makings of a heroic group. But
it doesn't quite come off as a momentous occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Claude lived in Rome for many years, but he does not seem to
have been a big-city man at heart. If his subject called for a
city, he made one up from bits and pieces of antiquity. This show
does, however, have a ``View of Santa Maria del Popolo.'' The view
has the charm of some cows in the foreground. As he lived in the
Via Margutta, the church was an easy walk away, just beyond the
city walls, and the view was not cluttered with men and women.
</P>
<P>
   The eight etchings in the show are on loan from the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, which has been acquiring Claude's etchings since
1917 and now owns 30.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most curious items is the print called ``Time, Apollo
and the Seasons.'' This is said to be related to Poussin's ``Dance
to the Music of Time'' in the Wallace Collection in London. As the
Poussin is one of the most beautiful pictures ever painted, this is
great company. But Claude's image, though undeniably curious, does
not in any respect keep company with Poussin's.
</P>
<P>
   Claude's is undeniably rather droll. Apollo leads four none too
stable women across some tricky ground toward a rather daunting
figure of Time. Given the multiple overtones of the Poussin, and
his incomparable handling of the subject, there really can be no
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   But in his drawings Claude did not aim to tell a story or to
deal in depth with human nature. He just had to sit down and watch
Nature at her work. His eye and his hand did the rest. For proof we
have only to see the little ``Tiber Landscape'' here. The river,
its banks and the big blue sky _ all are touched in to perfection.
It is done with almost nothing, and it has no particular incident.
Yet the Tiber is all there, with nothing unsaid.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Claude who would one day send John Keats into
ecstasy (so people said) with his great painting ``The Enchanted
Castle.''

 &HT;    ROUPS CALL FOR REFORM OF U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A group of environmental and taxpayer organizations
Thursday called on the Clinton administration and Congress to
reform the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers by imposing greater
civilian control over the agency and requiring independent reviews
of major projects.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations claimed the Corps often pursues projects which
benefit private interests, but waste taxpayer money and could harm
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army should not be at war with nature,'' David R. Conrad,
water resources specialist for the National Wildlife Federation,
said at a news conference. ``Reform is needed to bring this
out-of-control agency back in line.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless reforms are included in the pending Water Resources
Development Act, the groups said they would prefer to see the bill
die when Congress adjourns next month.
</P>
<P>
   The water bill includes authorization of the $7.8 billion
Everglades restoration project, but spokesmen for the groups said
they were hopeful the Everglades project could be approved
separately.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference came as the Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee held a hearing on the nomination of Maj. Gen.
Robert Flowers to be chief of engineers, the Corps' top military
post.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers told the committee he planned to continue the Corps'
mission ``of maintaining its vast inventory of existing public
improvements and pursuing new projects that develop, conserve,
preserve and protect our aquatic resources,'' but he said such
efforts could be done ``in an environmentally responsible manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Westphal, the assistant secretary of the Army who
oversees the Corps, said in an interview that the Clinton
administration is ``committed to civilian control. ... We have
never really lost that, but there have been questions about how
effective it has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal said Flowers' nomination, if confirmed ``gives us an
opportunity to restore confidence and to take a closer look at
shaping the mission of the Corps,'' including reviewing criticisms
that the Corps' has improperly tried to broaden its duties.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 10-point reforms the groups hope to see adopted would
be creation of an Office of Independent Review within the Corps
that would appoint expert panels to study projects costing $25
million or more, or which have become controversial.
</P>
<P>
   A bill proposed by Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., would require the
Corps to establish such an office.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress scheduled to adjourn next month, group leaders
agreed prospects for reform this session were slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, Congress's addiction to pork has made them blind
to the need to reform the Corps of Engineers,'' said Steve Ellis,
director of water resources for Taxpayers for Common Sense.
</P>
<P>
   The other groups in the coalition are American Rivers,
Earthjustice(cq) Legal Defense Fund, Environmental Defense, Friends
of the Earth, Mississippi River Basin Alliance, and the Sierra
Club.

`THE TALMUD AND THE INTERNET': BEFORE HIGH TECH, THERE WAS A HIGHER
AUTHORITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   A page or two of the Talmud will offer rabbinical
interpretations of the Torah, along with arguments, allegories and
legends, all compiled 1,800 years ago in the Mishnah. These are
interleaved with others from a few centuries later (the Gemarah),
while up one side run the commentaries of the 11th-century scholar,
Rashi, and up the other, commentaries by Rashi's own commentators
(tosefists).
</P>
<P>
   Not so much a book as ``a sort of drift net for catching God,''
writes Jonathan Rosen. It is an enticing image for this great
religious work whose affirmation comes by means of perpetual
interrogation of Self, and of God, the close and cantankerous
neighbor. It is an image with a purpose as well, as is Rosen's note
that one rabbinical term for the Talmud means sea, and that the
Hebrew word for its chapters means, literally, webbing. We see it
coming: net-Internet, sea-surfing, webbing-World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have often thought, contemplating a page of Talmud, that it
bears a certain uncanny resemblance to a home page on the Internet,
where nothing is whole in itself but where icons and text boxes are
doorways through which visitors pass into an infinity of
cross-referenced texts and conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talmud and the Internet.'' The title is piercing and
jaunty, something like a bugle playing reveille at camp, with no
close relation to the sounds of the coming day, but both jolting us
and enticing us awake to engage with them.
</P>
<P>
   Can Rosen really bring together two such radically different
things? Not quite. As with the examples above, there is a certain
playful sleight of hand. He joins metaphors for his twin subjects
more easily than he does the subjects themselves; but we have a
digressive good time watching him try. We are moved and enlightened
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The author is writing a kind of spiritual memoir, and he does it
wittily, suggestively and with a fine rambling grace. His book has
more to say, and more convincingly, about the contemporary
significance of the Talmud than of the Internet. He can use the
former to cast a partial light on the latter; not vice versa,
though.
</P>
<P>
   One of his book's principal themes is that of the transformation
of the Jews when they were forced into the Diaspora. ``Jews died as
a people of the body, of the land, of the Temple service of fire
and blood, and, in one of the greatest acts of translation in human
history, they were reborn as the people of the book.'' In
Christianity, the word became flesh, he writes. ``In Judaism, I'm
faced with the equally challenging notion that the flesh became
words.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Rosen returns to suggest in different ways that the
dispossession and loss that the Jews experienced, and transformed
into the Talmud's triumph, resemble the bewildering changes that
technology has brought us today. We, too, are dispossessed in some
sense from our material certainties, our structures, our books. The
Internet operates a dematerializing transformation as the Talmud
did 2,000 years ago. It, too, is a vast network of information,
arguing voices (those disputatious rabbis), confusion,
contradiction and mutually entangled certitudes.
</P>
<P>
   It is an interesting thought. The flaw is that Rosen forces
comparisons. To say that the mouth is used to eat and to sing is
not to say that eating is the same as singing. Rosen's finding of
disorienting change, both now and back then, does not mean that the
response is the same, though he does turn up some parallel details.
He is careful to make disclaimers. (Behind the Talmud, he writes,
is a moral gravity; nobody uses it to make airline reservations or
find a date.) Taken together, though, the disclaimers threaten to
undermine the thesis.
</P>
<P>
   What the author has to say about the Internet, in fact, seems
more a provocative idea than a conviction. His own feelings,
perhaps to his credit, raise some doubts.
</P>
<P>
   At one point he tells of seeing a computer re-creation on the
Web of three destroyed synagogues in Frankfurt. The images ``were
three-dimensional but had a flat, inert quality, and the colors,
dead blues and lipstick reds and cyber greens, were unnatural,
artificial hues,'' he writes. ``The images were like a dream a
computer might have of being a person.'' They left him, he
concludes, ``feeling empty, miserably detached from the past I
hoped to encounter.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, though, he seems to ignore his own insight. He speaks of
being able to visit the synagogues as if such visits were real, as
if virtual travel were the equivalent of travel or the movement of
a mouse could give the human and divine value to the Internet that
the millions of bloody footsteps of the Jews gave to the Talmud.
``Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish,'' Shakespeare wrote,
never suggesting that a cloud was a dragon.
</P>
<P>
   This doth protest too much. In fact Rosen writes not one or two
ideas but a whole sparkling shower of them; and contesting a few is
as exhilarating as agreeing with most. Beneath the ideas, though,
and what gives this book what I venture to call its soul, is his
interrogation of himself as American and Jew. One of his
grandmothers died in the Holocaust, the other in a New York
hospital longing woozily for a pastrami sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Others have raised the felt contradictions between the tragic
and luminous Jewish heritage and the ahistorical comforts and
complacencies of American life. Few have managed to do it with such
a mix of the searching, the modest and _ if the word is not
patronizing _ with such charm. Rosen is an intellectual who writes
of contradiction and uncertainty as though they were were beams of
light, and as he meditates on his family and his own journeys, he
makes them seem so.

   ``Power Money Fame Sex: A User's Guide''
</P>
<P>
   By Gretchen Craft Rubin
</P>
<P>
   Pocket Books, $25.95
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Few books have been titled better to grab the attention of a
potential buyer than Gretchen Craft Rubin's ``Power Money Fame
Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the human cravings they represent, each word taken in
isolation would be enough to incite reader interest. Together their
allure is almost irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Once she has hooked readers, Rubin reels them into a net of
interlocking themes that makes the book hard to put down. It is not
so much that Rubin dispenses any wealth of new truths. It is the
way she organizes knowledge that most adults believe they already
possess.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin commences her treatise with power, although she could have
begun with any of the other three themes. She, of course, ends it
with sex. The organizational structure is designed to hold the
reader until the end, although the reader could skip ahead to the
section in which he or she is most interested and read the others
randomly.
</P>
<P>
   She defines power quite simply as the capacity to express one's
will and have others execute it. But she emphasizes that before one
can exert power over others, one must seize control of one's own
situation, take on the responsibilities of decision-making within
one's own orbit and make one's time one's own.
</P>
<P>
   It is essential, Rubin writes, to decide whether one wants to
exercise power either directly or indirectly. In her case, as a law
school professor and author of a book that she hopes will be
influential, Rubin is taking the indirect approach to the exercise
of power by seeking to influence the thinking of future lawyers and
judges and by enhancing public understanding of the uses and abuses
of power, money, fame and sex.
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer engaged in trying to win cases for clients and
causes, a businessman seeking to sell a product and compete
successfully against other companies or a politician winning an
office and passing legislation is pursuing power directly.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin identifies eight pillars of power. They include maximizing
the power of one's institutional position, using other people to
gain power, controlling information, exploiting the attraction of
special abilities, exploiting the attraction of nearness to power,
using one's money to gain power, making the most of one's fame and
making the most of one's sexual assets.
</P>
<P>
   Among the subsets of those pillars are networking, sycophantism,
footwashing adoration, proximity to the powerful, exclusivity,
surrogacy and charisma. Rubin makes a clear distinction between
charisma and charm. You either have the former or you don't. It
can't be developed. But with hard work, you can acquire a useful
degree of charm. But you must not convey the impression that you
are making an extraordinary effort to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin has a word for such seemingly effortless performance. She
calls it ``sprezzatura.'' It is a continuing motif of the book.
Whether demonstrating power, flaunting wealth, enjoying fame or
exhibiting sexual attraction, you must convey an air of
nonchalance, of accepting the extraordinary as ordinary, of never
letting them see you sweat.
</P>
<P>
   As with power, Rubin poses different reasons for wanting money.
People want it, she says, to signal others about their social
status, for self-gratification, to satisfy a lust for material
objects, for sheer miserly love of accumulating it and to purchase
power.
</P>
<P>
   Her chapters on money constitute a guide on what to buy, where
to go, how to act and with whom to associate to make one's money
grow, how to win status and influence and how to acquire the best
things that money can buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are what you buy,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things many successful men buy, Rubin points out, is
a trophy wife. Although trophy wives are often thought of as sex
trophies, their principal function is really to supervise the
couple's status signaling. She controls the decisions about the
house, entertaining, civic activities, vacations and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first wife was no help _ she was preoccupied with the
children with vivid memories of humbler days; she was unskilled in
the new parties, the right shops, the stylish activities that her
husband's position now, he believes, merits,'' Rubin writes.
</P>
<P>
   She cites this as a true rule: ``A first wife marries for better
or for worse. A trophy wife marries for better.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's sections on fame focus on how to get it and how to use
it once you have it. But first, as with power and money, she makes
distinctions between the kinds of fame different people want. She
divides fame seekers into those who want to be a big fish in a
small pond, a household name, a star or an icon.
</P>
<P>
   She presents six ways to get fame. Rubin advises the fame seeker
to practice fame frottage, i.e., rub up against someone who is
famous; attain a prominent position; accomplish a notable
achievement in one's field; achieve ubiniquity, i.e., do something
scandalous; buy it; or cultivate a reputation for colorfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Once having achieved fame, Rubin writes, you can use it to
acquire greater fame, to boost your power, to make money or for
sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the consequences of fame is the adoring fans _ the
admirer who hands the screen idol a propositioning note or the
groupie who shows up outside the rock star's hotel room late at
night,'' she writes. ``Fame oils the way for sexual adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the use of fame to obtain sexual favors is touched upon
in Rubin's sections on sex, her emphasis is upon the more
sophisticated uses of sex to acquire money, power and fame, as well
as the use of sex to signal that one is wealthy, powerful or
famous.
</P>
<P>
   She points out, for example, that Henry Kissinger attained the
reputation of being something of a playboy because he was
frequently seen at social gatherings in the company of beautiful
and sometimes famous women. But it was mostly show. Kissinger
seldom if ever attempted to engage in actual sex with any of those
women.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of his macho display was to send signals about his
power. In his own words: ``I think that my playboy reputation has
been and still is useful because it served and still serves to
reassure people. To show them that I am not a museum piece.''
</P>
<P>
   The late John F. Kennedy used his celebrity quite differently in
that regard. Rubin writes that JFK once said that if he didn't
sleep with a different woman every day he'd have a migraine
headache.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, of course, dwells at some length on President Clinton,
but not in a self-righteous, condemning way. She uses Clinton to
illustrate how using power and celebrity to get sex can prove
disastrous. She also points out that many other politicians have
been caught with their pants down in that regard and have paid a
high price for their indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in particular are susceptible to such mistakes, she
said, noting that it was Kissinger who first said, ``Power is the
ultimate aphrodisiac.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sex section concludes with analyses of how women use sex to
gain power, fame or money, including outright prostitution,
trapping rich or famous men in child support situations, marrying
wealthy and powerful men or being kept mistresses of such men. She
dwells at some length on the phenomenon of the Washington mistress
as a prime example of using sex to gain money and power.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's book is aptly subtitled ``A User's Guide,'' because it
is about people using other people to satisfy their cravings for
power, money, fame and sex. The book can be used, she says, both to
help one pursue, exhibit or exploit those assets, as well to defend
oneself against being caught unaware by such users.

IS THE WRITE STUFF LONG GONE?
</HEADLINE>
 
 (EDS: Has a sidebar, CAMERONCROWE-INTERVIEW)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Almost Famous,'' Cameron Crowe's semi-autobigraphical
movie, a seasoned rock critic named Lester Bangs dispenses advice
to William Miller, a 15-year-old who's trying to break into music
journalism. Among the warnings in the 1973 meeting: Rock musicians
are not your friends, so don't get too close to them; it hardly
matters anyway, because the enemy _ big-biz forces cannibalizing
rock acts as they capitalize on their success _ have taken over.
</P>
<P>
   William Miller is fictional, sort of; he's a representation of
the young Crowe, who began his career as a teen-age rock writer
before switching to writing and directing movies in his 20s. Lester
Bangs, however, is real _ or rather was real _ though Philip
Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of him mellows him out a bit. He was a
wild, cough-syrup-swilling, gonzo writer and part-time musician who
helped create rock journalism in the late '60s _ and who, despite
his own advice, befriended rock musicians. He died in 1982 at 33, a
casualty of too much hard living.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, Bangs' ghost seems to be everywhere. Not only is he a
character in ``Almost Famous,'' but he's the subject of a recently
published biography, Jim DeRogatis' ``Let it Blurt'' (Bantam
Doubleday Dell, $15.95), which includes an account of the
Bangs-Crowe meeting. Peter Guralnick, the guest editor of the
upcoming Da Capo Best Music Writing 2000 (Da Capo Press, $14),
included a Bangs essay in the book: the critic's liner notes to a
1980 album compilation of songs by the '20s German group the
Comedian Harmonists (a 2000 intro to the essay by New York Times
critic John Rockwell helps justify the inclusion of the piece).
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone who sees ``Almost Famous'' will know who Lester
Bangs was, but for those who do, the character inspires nostalgia _
not just for the heady days of late '60s and '70s rock music, but
for the pioneering days of rock journalism itself. Back in the day,
hard-core rock-music fans could name many critics off the top of
their heads _ Bangs, Richard Meltzer, Nick Tosches, Dave Marsh, Jon
Landau _ but it's difficult to find a star rock writer today. And
many of today's most familiar music critics _ Robert Christgau,
Robert Hilburn, Greil Marcus _ have been doing this since the early
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Cameron catches the cusp of the change in his film,''
says DeRogatis, who has seen ``Almost Famous'' twice. ``It went
from inspired amateurism, people who wrote because they were
obsessed with the music or with a band, to a form to sell what's
cool. I think (the latter) is what rock journalism is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bangs' ``inspired amateurism'' included first-person reviews
influenced by such writers as Beat novelist Jack Kerouac and barfly
poet Charles Bukowski; his pieces often read like run-on letters to
brethren music fans. When he worked at Creem, the now-defunct
magazine that was once the main rival to Rolling Stone, he engaged
readers in arguments and recruited some of the more eloquent
letter-writers who ever appeared in the magazine. In interviews, he
was likely to attack his subjects, as he did in a series of talks
with an increasingly leery Lou Reed. In a music world dominated by
MTV, fragmented radio formats and corporate conglomerates, Bangs'
antics probably wouldn't pass today.
</P>
<P>
   DeRogatis and some others interviewed for this report agree with
the Bangs character in ``Almost Famous'': The enemy took over a
long time ago. Once, rock journalists were allowed unusual access
to the bands they wrote about _ in ``Almost Famous,'' young Miller
accompanies a band called Stillwater, a fictional amalgamation of
Bad Company, Led Zeppelin and the Allman Brothers, on the road as
he tries to get an interview with the band's elusive lead
guitarist. That mirrors some of Crowe's real-life experiences,
especially with Led Zeppelin and the Allmans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, DeRogatis laments, thanks to tightly controlled publicity
schedules, writers are lucky to have lunch or get a 20-minute phone
interview with big stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not even supposed to think about asking tough
questions,'' says DeRogatis, who writes for the Chicago Sun-Times
(a paper he says will let him ask tough questions). ``You can't
write a critical piece about Limp Bizkit for a magazine, because
you need Limp Bizkit to be on the cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Meltzer, who recently published a collection of his
work, says he was in the game even before Bangs was. Meltzer, who
was one of the founders of Creem and worked with Bangs during the
early days, has an even bleaker viewpoint, which is that rock
writers always faced the forces that DeRogatis complains about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like trench warfare,'' says Meltzer, who's 54 and says
that he stopped writing rock-crit in earnest in the mid-'70s. ``You
basically had writers who had to contend with vicious publicists,
monstrous record companies and editors who wouldn't let you get
away with anything. You had to fight for every word. Magazines,
including Creem, survived by getting record-company ads, and the
way they got ads was by their quota of positive reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference was that writers fought this,'' he adds.
``Writers refused to kind of buckle under to it. But by '72, '73 or
'74, a whole style sheet evolved, and you had a whole new cast and
crew of people willing to submit to it. But from about, let's say
'68 to '72-'73, there were those of us who would give 'em hell.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Bangs/Meltzer days, rock writers sometimes acted like
rock stars. Meltzer writes about standing in a vat of chicken salad
and throwing food at the New York Dolls' David Johansen. DeRogatis'
book includes an anecdote about Bangs stirring up a food fight with
the unamused British glam-rock group Slade.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably my most vivid food-fight memory,'' says Jaan
Uhelszki, a Rolling Stone Online writer who worked at Creem, of the
Bangs-Slade melee. ``But you were closer to the bands back then. I
did a story where I put on KISS makeup and went on stage with KISS.
Lester took his typewriter onstage during a J. Geils Band concert,
and wrote his review onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   Uhelszki also sees restricted access as a problem _ ``Back then,
you could see Gregg Allman put his face in a plate of spaghetti and
fall asleep'' _ but what she misses more is a sense of community
among rock writers. She doesn't see a mentor-protege relationship
like Bangs and Crowe's happening now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really fierce about passing on the spirit back then,''
she says. ``But don't forget, we were inventing the form. Most of
the rock writers now aren't community-based. It's more competitive.
... Even with the online community, you're hard-pressed to find
people who'll help each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Uhelszki says that she tries to help young female rock writers,
because rock journalism is still a male-dominated world
(significant exceptions include The New York Times' Ann Powers and
USA Today's Edna Gundersen). But don't expect Meltzer to pull a
Bangs act anymore, because he was never all that impressed with the
field in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't read any of the stuff in years, because it just got
revolting,'' Meltzer says. ``For one thing, it became completely
binary, like `This is good, this is bad.' . ... (But) even in the
heyday of the damn thing, I wouldn't say that I read rock mags just
to read them. I'd pick 'em up if I had a piece in 'em, and I'd see
what else there was. I didn't feel I needed to have any guidance to
what was going on because I was seeing it with my own eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you could blame the ``revolting'' writing on the
music. In the late '60s/early '70s, Rolling Stone cover subjects
might have included a still-vital Beatles and Rolling Stones, Jimi
Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Bob Dylan or Led Zeppelin. You were unlikely
to see the equivalents of teen-pop artists such as the Backstreet
Boys, 'N Sync, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera _ all of whom
have recently merited Rolling Stone covers. In the early days of
Rolling Stone and Creem, rock was in its adolescence, still
rebellious and breaking rules; now it seems to be about
adolescence, and rule-breakers are harder to find on magazine
covers (the one glaring exception being rapper Eminem, whom too
many writers forgive for his virulent lyrics).
</P>
<P>
   ``One difference between now and, take 1970, is that the music
is nowhere near as central to the culture,'' says Guralnick, the
guest editor of Da Capo Best Music Writing 2000. ``For example, a
review of the new Rolling Stones album, the new Beatles album, the
new Van Morrison album, the new Aretha album _ these could be
written about at great length 30 years ago, and these could be the
subjects for passionate disagreement or agreement. I think that
that climate doesn't altogether exist anymore. It's just much more
diffused. You have many more different themes.''
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick _ whose credentials include writing ``Last Train to
Memphis'' (Little Brown &AMP; Co., $17.95) and ``Careless Love,''
(Little Brown &AMP; Co., $17.95) two award-winning books about Elvis
Presley _ says that the main thing writers struggle against today
isn't lack of access but lack of length; fewer outlets (especially
most daily newspapers) let writers stretch out as much as they used
to. But the biggest problem with good rock writing today might be
that there's just so much rock writing overall. And it's in places
where it didn't necessarily have a home in the late '60s: daily
newspapers, alternative weeklies, obsessive fanzines,
general-interest entertainment magazines such as Entertainment
Weekly, and, of course, the Internet. Finding the good stuff is the
difficult part.
</P>
<P>
   And there is some good stuff out there, giving hope that there's
a vital future possible for rock journalism. DeRogatis recommends
Michaelangelo Matos, who contributes to the Seattle Weekly and has
written for papers in Minneapolis-St. Paul and Chicago. Uhelszki
says she likes a Bay area writer named Greg Heller. ``If there's
another Lester out there, it's him,'' she says. ``He's the type of
guy who'll go head-to-head with someone like Sammy Hagar and say he
stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Crowe, who long ago stopped writing rock journalism when
his career as a screenwriter and director took off, still has
something to say on the subject _ and, in the spirit of his movies,
it's typically optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody told me recently that there's a kid named Charlie
Zaillian,'' Crowe says, ``whose dad happens to be Steve Zaillian,
the screenwriter-director. And that (Charlie) had this fanzine
called Distortion. And he is 15. And so I called him up, and I
said, `We're finishing this movie about a 15-year-old journalist. I
want you to come see it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So this kid shows up, with a couple copies of his fanzine, and
I met him. I read the fanzine; he's fantastic. It lives. It lives
and it's harder to find and all that stuff, and I was very, very
happy to meet him. And I thought, `Y'know what? There is rebirth.
Rebirth is possible.' This guy was going on and on and on about all
this new music that he'd gotten or downloaded, and there was just
pure passion in it. And a lack of cynicism. But an artistic,
critical edge. I just felt great.''

   In ``Almost Famous,'' Cameron Crowe's semi-autobigraphical
movie, a seasoned rock critic named Lester Bangs dispenses advice
to William Miller, a 15-year-old who's trying to break into music
journalism. Among the warnings in the 1973 meeting: Rock musicians
are not your friends, so don't get too close to them; it hardly
matters anyway, because the enemy _ big-biz forces cannibalizing
rock acts as they capitalize on their success _ have taken over.
</P>
<P>
   William Miller is fictional, sort of; he's a representation of
the young Crowe, who began his career as a teen-age rock writer
before switching to writing and directing movies in his 20s. Lester
Bangs, however, is real _ or rather was real _ though Philip
Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of him mellows him out a bit. He was a
wild, cough-syrup-swilling, gonzo writer and part-time musician who
helped create rock journalism in the late '60s _ and who, despite
his own advice, befriended rock musicians. He died in 1982 at 33, a
casualty of too much hard living.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, Bangs' ghost seems to be everywhere. Not only is he a
character in ``Almost Famous,'' but he's the subject of a recently
published biography, Jim DeRogatis' ``Let it Blurt'' (Bantam
Doubleday Dell, $15.95), which includes an account of the
Bangs-Crowe meeting. Peter Guralnick, the guest editor of the
upcoming Da Capo Best Music Writing 2000 (Da Capo Press, $14),
included a Bangs essay in the book: the critic's liner notes to a
1980 album compilation of songs by the '20s German group the
Comedian Harmonists (a 2000 intro to the essay by New York Times
critic John Rockwell helps justify the inclusion of the piece).
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone who sees ``Almost Famous'' will know who Lester
Bangs was, but for those who do, the character inspires nostalgia _
not just for the heady days of late '60s and '70s rock music, but
for the pioneering days of rock journalism itself. Back in the day,
hard-core rock-music fans could name many critics off the top of
their heads _ Bangs, Richard Meltzer, Nick Tosches, Dave Marsh, Jon
Landau _ but it's difficult to find a star rock writer today. And
many of today's most familiar music critics _ Robert Christgau,
Robert Hilburn, Greil Marcus _ have been doing this since the early
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Cameron catches the cusp of the change in his film,''
says DeRogatis, who has seen ``Almost Famous'' twice. ``It went
from inspired amateurism, people who wrote because they were
obsessed with the music or with a band, to a form to sell what's
cool. I think (the latter) is what rock journalism is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bangs' ``inspired amateurism'' included first-person reviews
influenced by such writers as Beat novelist Jack Kerouac and barfly
poet Charles Bukowski; his pieces often read like run-on letters to
brethren music fans. When he worked at Creem, the now-defunct
magazine that was once the main rival to Rolling Stone, he engaged
readers in arguments and recruited some of the more eloquent
letter-writers who ever appeared in the magazine. In interviews, he
was likely to attack his subjects, as he did in a series of talks
with an increasingly leery Lou Reed. In a music world dominated by
MTV, fragmented radio formats and corporate conglomerates, Bangs'
antics probably wouldn't pass today.
</P>
<P>
   DeRogatis and some others interviewed for this report agree with
the Bangs character in ``Almost Famous'': The enemy took over a
long time ago. Once, rock journalists were allowed unusual access
to the bands they wrote about _ in ``Almost Famous,'' young Miller
accompanies a band called Stillwater, a fictional amalgamation of
Bad Company, Led Zeppelin and the Allman Brothers, on the road as
he tries to get an interview with the band's elusive lead
guitarist. That mirrors some of Crowe's real-life experiences,
especially with Led Zeppelin and the Allmans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, DeRogatis laments, thanks to tightly controlled publicity
schedules, writers are lucky to have lunch or get a 20-minute phone
interview with big stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not even supposed to think about asking tough
questions,'' says DeRogatis, who writes for the Chicago Sun-Times
(a paper he says will let him ask tough questions). ``You can't
write a critical piece about Limp Bizkit for a magazine, because
you need Limp Bizkit to be on the cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Meltzer, who recently published a collection of his
work, says he was in the game even before Bangs was. Meltzer, who
was one of the founders of Creem and worked with Bangs during the
early days, has an even bleaker viewpoint, which is that rock
writers always faced the forces that DeRogatis complains about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like trench warfare,'' says Meltzer, who's 54 and says
that he stopped writing rock-crit in earnest in the mid-'70s. ``You
basically had writers who had to contend with vicious publicists,
monstrous record companies and editors who wouldn't let you get
away with anything. You had to fight for every word. Magazines,
including Creem, survived by getting record-company ads, and the
way they got ads was by their quota of positive reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference was that writers fought this,'' he adds.
``Writers refused to kind of buckle under to it. But by '72, '73 or
'74, a whole style sheet evolved, and you had a whole new cast and
crew of people willing to submit to it. But from about, let's say
'68 to '72-'73, there were those of us who would give 'em hell.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Bangs/Meltzer days, rock writers sometimes acted like
rock stars. Meltzer writes about standing in a vat of chicken salad
and throwing food at the New York Dolls' David Johansen. DeRogatis'
book includes an anecdote about Bangs stirring up a food fight with
the unamused British glam-rock group Slade.

`CRIME AND PUNISHMENT IN SUBURBIA': LOTS OF WASTED TALENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In addition to its title, there are a few other things about
``Crime and Punishment in Suburbia'' that might lead you to believe
it has something to do with Dostoyevsky, including a portentous
quotation from the Russian novelist that appears on the screen
before the action starts, and the name of the film's heroine, which
is Roseanne Skolnik (Monica Keena) _ kind of like Raskolnikov, get
it? But you will search in vain for Dostoyevskian themes, or indeed
any themes at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian writer whose influence is most in evidence may be
Chekhov, and then only because his oft-cited remark that a gun on
the mantelpiece in the first act of a play must be fired in the
third act is given an indie-film paraphrase: The electric carving
knife used by Mom to slice up the roast in an early scene will be
used to slice up Daddy later on.
</P>
<P>
   Dostoyevsky's Raskolnikov murdered an innocent old woman to test
his theories that superior human beings can act free of ordinary
moral constraints. Roseanne decides to kill her stepfather after he
rapes her. It's not quite the same idea, but then again this film,
directed with more attitude than discipline by Rob Schmidt from an
addlepated script by Larry Gross, mopes along without a thought in
its head, confusing its own vacuity with the alienation of its
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent (Vincent Kartheiser), the disaffected loner whose sexual
fantasies about Roseanne provide the movie with its
heavy-breathing, in-and-out-of-focus credit sequence, starts out as
a high school nihilist, tattooing the words ``por nada'' on his
arm. But then later on he turns out to be some kind of Christian
new-age guru, sporting a big blue Jesus T-shirt and trying to
assuage poor Roseanne's tormented soul with self-help cliches.
``What a strange path it took to find my heart,'' she marvels at
the end. Yes, but if you're a connoisseur of pseudorebellious
American cinema it will seem awfully familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Completed before the release of ``American Beauty,'' this
contrived, puffed up little picture nonetheless seems like a
ripoff, perhaps because it mines the same tired assumptions and
unexamined stereotypes about suburban family life. Like Wes
Bentley's video stalker in ``American Beauty,'' Vincent sneaks
around with a camera recording Roseanne's intimate moments. He
talks (in the voiceover narration) about his plans to rescue her
from the hell her life has become. Her mother (Ellen Barkin) and
stepfather (Michael Ironside) sulk and bellow through the endgame
of a marriage; mom is moody and adulterous, dad expresses his
frustration through drink and sarcasm. Roseanne seeks comfort in
the arms of her football-playing boyfriend, Jimmy (James DeBello).
</P>
<P>
   At first you think the usual teen-movie archetypes _ the battle
between the narcissistic jock and the sensitive misfit for the love
of the secretly soulful popular girl _ are being cleverly
subverted. Jimmy seems like a nice enough guy, if a little dim.
There seems to be some sexual chemistry between him and Roseanne,
and if he occasionally tries to beat up Vincent, it may be because
the little creep has it coming.
</P>
<P>
   But the only thing ``Crime and Punishment in Suburbia'' ends up
subverting is itself. In the absence of any real insight into its
characters and situations, the film falls back on visual
atmospherics and soundtrack pyrotechnics. There's lots of great
music, and some of the camerawork has a beautiful, expressive
fluidity. But try as they might, the showy effects _ the dream
episodes, freeze frames and slow-motion sequences, the artful sound
mixing and the division of the narrative into ``chapters'' _ can't
compensate for the basic emptiness of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive use of voiceover is often a sign of trouble, a
last-ditch attempt to pull a film into shape when the resources of
cinematic storytelling have failed. The fact that ``Crime and
Punishment'' switches from one character's narration to another's
without explanation is the final evidence of its disastrous
incoherence, its lack of a consistent point of view.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of talent is wasted here. Barkin and Ironside give some
emotional weight to their cardboard characters, and Jeffrey Wright
(as Skolnik's lover) dispels some of the pervasive gloom with his
physical grace and quick intelligence. The younger members of the
cast do less well, but it's hardly their fault. Keena's soft,
melancholy loveliness is especially ill-used; the filmmakers can't
decide whether Roseanne is meant to be an object of pity, satire,
or just lecherous ogling.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, when Roseanne seems to have shut down her emotions
entirely, you suspect you are witnessing not the character reacting
to the turmoil in her life but the actress protecting herself from
the mess that surrounds her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime and Punishment in Suburbia'' is rated R (Under 17
requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes a
grisly murder and several heavy-breathing (though not terribly
explicit) sex scenes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans have one last battle to
fight this fall: determining how much money to spend on education
and other social programs.
</P>
<P>
   If they are not confident of a substantive or political victory,
it is because GOP leaders must wage the battle with President
Clinton, a creature of compromise who nonetheless demands every
last dollar he can get for his own priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats generally are delighted that the GOP Congress has
passed only two of 13 appropriations bills for the budget year that
begins Oct. 1, providing the president with added veto leverage
now.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, caution their rivals to refrain from
popping any champagne corks. Bringing Clinton back into the
political limelight through spending negotiations, they argue,
isn't necessarily good news for Vice President Gore, who has soared
while separating himself from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   If there is political danger for both sides, however, there is
also the likelihood that any final deal will significantly drive up
federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Republicans have agreed, through endgame
budget deals and emergency legislation, to increase discretionary
spending to $619.2 billion this year, far beyond the $564 billion
cap envisioned by the 1997 Balanced Budget Act.
</P>
<P>
   Only the budget surplus, a swelling financial windfall that no
one fully understands, keeps the federal ledger in the black.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair to the American people,'' said U.S. Rep. Pat
Toomey, R-Pa. ``The president is going to say, `OK guys, you want
to go home? It's going to cost you $30 billion.' And I'm afraid
he's going to get most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is virtually assured that Congress will vote to increase
spending dramatically to get out of town and avert political
disaster, such as a government shutdown or a stalemate that lasts
until mid-October. Incumbents for a third year straight have
entered a realm where they get to leave Washington only if they
provide more money for everyone's programs, making sure everyone is
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   There is no brake on the process, save time.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has met with House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to begin initial talks.
Before the meeting on Tuesday, Clinton held a news conference to
talk about his goals and, possibly, to remind the GOP that spending
talks have been his strong point.
</P>
<P>
   ``American students in schools are making steady gains in almost
every category,'' the president said. ``I urge Congress to invest
more in the priorities that work well for our students: in smaller
classes, good teachers, modern schools, more after-school programs
and pre-school programs, and accountability for results.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton this year asked Congress to provide $1.3 billion for
emergency repairs in schools. Republicans generally claim that
building and repairing schools is a state and local responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., said if the GOP is forced to
give up the money, he would propose directing it to asbestos
removal and disability-access projects, two obligations imposed on
schools by the federal government. ``We do have some responsibility
in those areas, so that's what we would try to push in school
construction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the House Education and the Work Force Committee,
Goodling also expects to negotiate some provisions related to any
increase in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   And he plans to fight for language that would bar the U.S. Labor
Department from regulating the treatment of ergonomic, or
repetitive stress, injuries people suffer at work. The GOP usually
includes such language in its labor spending bill, and the Clinton
administration always tries to strike it.
</P>
<P>
   The $106.2 billion labor, health and education spending bill
written by congressional Republicans illustrates how the
last-minute process creates incentives to spend more money than any
lawmaker would care to admit.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton were to throw up his hands and accept the GOP bill as
written, it would increase discretionary spending by $8.93 billion,
or 9.2 percent. The president, however, would veto that bill, says
Joel Packer, lobbyist for the National Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get way more than that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While generous, the GOP bill fails to provide $2 billion in
school funding that Clinton requested. It includes funds for
class-size reduction or urgent school repairs, but would let school
districts decide how to use the money.
</P>
<P>
   If the budget process poses a political opportunity for
Democrats, it also poses a risk, according to some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does reintroduce Bill Clinton front and center back into
the political equation,'' said U.S. Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., chairman
of the National Republican Congressional Committee. ``If you're Al
Gore, you've got to wonder how many kisses it takes to make up for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis added that the end-of-session budget fracas poses a
``tough'' dilemma for the congressional wing of the GOP. If
Republicans too willingly submit to the president's spending
demands, he said, they will be seen by their own base as abandoning
their fiscal principles.
</P>
<P>
   The moment seems to favor Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   By writing a compromise bill to fund the federal labor, health
and education agencies, the Labor-HHS spending bill, Republicans
have painted themselves into a corner. Clinton can accept the
spending hikes Republicans have proposed for their own priorities,
such as special education. And then he can demand more money for
his own ideas, such as repairing run-down school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The blueprint suggests the final bill will boost domestic
spending more than anyone dreamed at the outset. It is a fiscal
conservative's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a new approach. Adding money is the way
congressional appropriators have worked in recent years. The U.S.
Education Department's budget has gone up 55 percent since fiscal
1996. And that's when Republicans took over the congressional purse
strings.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Toomey lamented the likelihood that lawmakers would include more
pork-barrel projects in a final budget deal, larding up any
catchall compromise with pet projects that one lawmaker couldn't
possibly identify or kill before a vote. He said he wished the
Republican Senate had passed more spending bills,like the House,
and forced Clinton to deal with them one by one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants to veto them, let him veto them. Then we can
negotiate where we need to end up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. Rep. Robert Andrews, D-N.J., seemed to relish the
moment. Andrews held out the possibility that Democrats would
strike a deal to include managed care reforms, such as the right to
sue an employer-provided health plan, in the last-minute
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., wants to see if Clinton really
would veto the GOP's generous proposal for labor, health and
education programs, even if the measure doesn't comply with all of
the president's policy goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``My preference would be to send the Labor-HHS bill to the
president,'' said Specter, chairman of a key appropriations
subcommittee. ``I believe we have a good bill there. He sent over a
request for $106 billion, and after a lot of effort, we've gotten
the Republican caucus to go along with that. ... We have the high
ground. If we could undertake a public debate with him on this
subject, I think we'd get a lot of public support.''

LAST-MINUTE BUDGET DEAL PROMPTS POLITICAL, SPENDING WORRIES

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans have one last battle to
fight this fall: determining how much money to spend on education
and other social programs.
</P>
<P>
   If they are not confident of a substantive or political victory,
it is because GOP leaders must wage the battle with President
Clinton, a creature of compromise who nonetheless demands every
last dollar he can get for his own priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats generally are delighted that the GOP Congress has
passed only two of 13 appropriations bills for the budget year that
begins Oct. 1, providing the president with added veto leverage
now.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, caution their rivals to refrain from
popping any champagne corks. Bringing Clinton back into the
political limelight through spending negotiations, they argue,
isn't necessarily good news for Vice President Gore, who has soared
while separating himself from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   If there is political danger for both sides, however, there is
also the likelihood that any final deal will significantly drive up
federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Republicans have agreed, through endgame
budget deals and emergency legislation, to increase discretionary
spending to $619.2 billion this year, far beyond the $564 billion
cap envisioned by the 1997 Balanced Budget Act.
</P>
<P>
   Only the budget surplus, a swelling financial windfall that no
one fully understands, keeps the federal ledger in the black.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair to the American people,'' said U.S. Rep. Pat
Toomey, R-Pa. ``The president is going to say, `OK guys, you want
to go home? It's going to cost you $30 billion.' And I'm afraid
he's going to get most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is virtually assured that Congress will vote to increase
spending dramatically to get out of town and avert political
disaster, such as a government shutdown or a stalemate that lasts
until mid-October. Incumbents for a third year straight have
entered a realm where they get to leave Washington only if they
provide more money for everyone's programs, making sure everyone is
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   There is no brake on the process, save time.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has met with House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to begin initial talks.
Before the meeting on Tuesday, Clinton held a news conference to
talk about his goals and, possibly, to remind the GOP that spending
talks have been his strong point.
</P>
<P>
   ``American students in schools are making steady gains in almost
every category,'' the president said. ``I urge Congress to invest
more in the priorities that work well for our students: in smaller
classes, good teachers, modern schools, more after-school programs
and pre-school programs, and accountability for results.''

AS THE CROWE SIGHS: SUCCESS NO REMEDY FOR DIRECTOR'S ANXIETY
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies FILM-ROCK JOURNALISM)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1973, when ``Almost Famous'' writer-director Cameron Crowe
was 16 years old, he got his first assignment from Rolling Stone
magazine: Go out on the road with the Allman Brothers. Discover the
soul of the popular Southern band. Dig into how twin tragedies _
the traffic-accident deaths of guitarist Duane Allman and bassist
Berry Oakley _ in the preceding years had affected the surviving
members.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like an enviable assignment for a teen-age rock fan:
Spend two weeks tagging along with a million-selling band. And all
was fine, until Gregg Allman woke Crowe with a late-night phone
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a vision,'' Allman said, ``and I think you might be a
cop.''
</P>
<P>
   Allman demanded that the young journalist turn over all his
tapes, and that he produce ID immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still hard to talk about, in a way,'' Crowe says during a
phone interview. ``I was scared to death. And I left my tapes with
him, and within a week, they had been sent back to me, and Phil
Walden, who was the head of Capricorn (Records), called me and
said, `Oh, Gregg, he woke up the next day and didn't even remember
why he had those tapes, and you just know that the Brothers really
loved you, and write yourself a great story, nobody got the kind of
access you got.'''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe never told the editors at Rolling Stone, but the incident
dented his confidence. Until then, the stakes had been low, because
he considered rock writing a hobby that wouldn't last.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the truth is, I thought that was the end,'' Crowe said.
``I thought, `This is life saying, ``You have no idea what you're
doing. You're in an adult forum here, and you do not belong.''' And
I got through it, and that was the first big test. So it was not
the easiest thing in the world, and it became harder after that.
But the beginning was all about, `Hell, this is fun!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe, best-known for writing and directing ``Jerry Maguire,''
recaptures those days in ``Almost Famous,'' his
semi-autobiographical movie. The movie sees Crowe's salad days
through the eyes of alter-ego William Miller (Patrick Fugit), a
15-year-old rock journalist who befriends groupies and becomes
enmeshed in an unrequited-love triangle as he travels with
Stillwater, a fictional composite of several bands, most notably
the Allmans and Led Zeppelin. Miller spends much of the movie
trying to snare an interview with Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup),
the group's elusive lead guitarist _ who, yes, accuses Miller at
one point of being a cop.
</P>
<P>
   Although some facts and names have been changed, Crowe's movie
is easily his most personal; like the reporter he was, he's used to
observing, whether it be the student antics of ``Fast Times at
Ridgemont High,'' the teen romance and parental conflicts of ``Say
Anything ... '', or the grunge-era Seattle scene of ``Singles.''
Here, he observes as well _ but puts himself and his family in the
middle of the plot.
</P>
<P>
   One of the movie's many plot threads involves Miller's mother
(Frances McDormand), a college professor who mistrusts rock 'n'
roll _ she condemns Simon &AMP; Garfunkel's mellow and comparatively
innocuous ``Bookends'' as ``drug music'' _ and wants her son to
become a lawyer. But she indulges his passion enough that she
drives him to a Black Sabbath concert, and drops him off _ yelling,
``Don't do drugs!'' to her embarrassed son as bemused bystanders
look on. It almost looks like a caricature, but Crowe says it's
pretty close to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was there for a little bit of the time we were filming
it, which was truly weird and strange and somewhat difficult,''
Crowe says. ``But we're very close, and when my dad passed away, we
got closer to kind of make up for the hole that was left. She's
like one of my best editors. I'll send her a script and she'll say,
`You know what? You've gotta dig deeper.' Or, `This is funny, don't
touch it.' Or something like that. She's very much like Frances'
character in the movie. She's a teacher; she always has to teach.
Even when she's taking your head off.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Crowe's passion for the music remained, he didn't keep
the journalism gig. In the late '70s, when he was in his early 20s,
he went undercover at a Los Angeles high school to find out what
teen culture was about. That resulted in the magazine article
``Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' which became a book, and then an
Amy Heckerling-directed movie that's often credited with starting
the '80s teen-movie craze.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Crowe made his directorial debut with 1989's
``Say Anything ... '', though, that he became what he calls a
``film geek'' _ a guy who's now so into it that last year he
published a book called ``Conversations With Billy Wilder,'' a
series of interviews with the multi-Oscar-winning director. But in
a climate where directors often churn out a movie a year, Crowe is
hardly prolific _ ``Almost Famous'' is his fourth directing effort
in 11 years behind the camera. For him, every movie is an anxiety
attack.
</P>
<P>
   But, ``You start the long journey and you forget all the tough
stuff and soon you slam into the wall of realizing that bringing
this stuff to life is the greatest joy and the greatest anxiety
attack ever, because you're bringing so many people along on your
anxiety attack,'' he says. ``Particularly on this movie, it was
weird, because every time I'd go to six or seven takes I could feel
people behind my back going, `Isn't therapy a little cheaper? And a
lot less public?' And I'm happy I did it.'' &QL;

BRITISH FUEL BLOCKADE ENDING, THOUGH SHORTAGES TO CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A blockade of British refineries and storage areas
began to break up Thursday and convoys of oil trucks moved past
company gates unimpeded for the first time in a week. But Prime
Minister Tony Blair warned there was still ``some way to go''
before drivers would see gasoline back in their neighborhood pumps.
</P>
<P>
   The signal that the hastily organized but remarkably effective
countrywide protest of high fuel prices was ending was a statement
at 5 a.m. from the movement's instigator, a Welsh farmer named
Brynle Williams, that he was shutting down a vigil at the Shell
refinery in Stanlow, Cheshire, in northwest England where the
protest began seven days ago. He urged others to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the Stanlow pickets were taken down, protesters did
likewise at Grangemouth in Scotland, Cardiff in Wales, Jarrow in
northeast England, Plymouth in southwest England, Avonmouth near
Bristol and Trafford Park in Manchester. Pockets of resistance
emerged at other sites, but at noon Blair reported that 12 main
depots were operating freely.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who has become a practiced performer on British
television this week, said he felt the siege should be lifted while
its supporters still occupied the ``high moral ground.'' A BBC poll
broadcast Wednesday said 80 percent of Britons supported the
blockades despite the inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, his third in as many days, Blair
acknowledged the widespread opposition to his tough stance against
the demonstrators and the depth of sentiment about high fuel costs.
Striking a less defiant note than in recent days, he said,
``Whatever the strength of feeling on the price of petrol, I do
hope that over time people will carefully reflect on recent events.
However much people may dislike paying petrol duty, there's no way
that any government of this country could or should yield to this
form of protest.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the proper times to take up the matter of fuel taxes
were during the budget review in November and the presentation of
the budget itself in March. He suggested that he and his ministers
would be meeting with some of the protest leaders before then.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he looked for a cut in taxes within the next 60
days in exchange for lifting the siege. He said he decided to call
a halt ``after deep discussions and concerns among ourselves about
the distress to the British public.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair said Wednesday night that the blockades were putting
``lives at risk'' by jeopardizing police and hospital activities,
and he put the National Health Service on national disaster
footing.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators have been picketing refineries and storage
depots in protest of duties that make Britain's gas the highest
taxed and most expensive in Europe. Depending upon e-mails and
mobile telephones for coordination, the nationwide movement was
mounted by a relatively small number of truck owners, farmers and
self-employed workers who attested that rising fuel prices _
gasoline costs about $4.37 a gallon _ are putting them out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   With almost all of Britain's 12,500 filling stations drained,
returning supplies to normal is a ``massive logistical operation,''
according to the Petrol Retailers' Association. Less than 10
percent of normal supplies were on the move Wednesday despite
government pressure on the oil companies and assurances of police
protection for drivers. With emergency services getting the
priority, it would take until Saturday to start getting fuel back
in pumps and at least two weeks before the situation was back to
normal.

<P>
   Two of Britain's major suppliers, Esso and TotalFinaElf,
announced Thursday they were raising their prices on gas and diesel
fuel despite the crippling countrywide protests, provoking instant
condemnation from Blair and motorists' organizations. ``We
recognize this may seem untimely in the light of the current
disruptions,'' Esso acknowledged in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to a question on the matter, Blair said irritably that
he ``really couldn't understand'' the decision. ``The world oil
price as far as I'm aware has actually gone down in the last few
days.'' He said the subject would be discussed at a meeting with
oil company heads at 10 Downing Street later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Automobile Association said drivers would be ``unimpressed''
by the rise and should respond by being ``more selective about
where they patronize.''
</P>
<P>
   Shell and BP said they would hold to present prices and absorb
losses from recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Burke, a spokesman for the London Chamber of Commerce,
said the protests were costing Britain $350 million each day,
roughly 1/10 of the national daily economic output. ``By the time
this is all over, it'll be over 1 billion pounds'', he said, or
more than $1.4 billion. he said. ``We have seen three or four days
of quite severe disruption and we expect one more. It's something
that's affecting every sector of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Blair spoke, the Ministry of Defense announced
that 80 army, navy and air force tanker trucks it had deployed
across the country Wednesday would now begin refueling needy police
stations, hospitals and other essential services facilities from
military stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's roads were all but deserted during the morning rush
hour, railways reported 50 percent rises in passenger numbers and
stores said they were selling record numbers of bicycles and
lightweight aluminum scooters. Halfords, a motoring accessories
chain, reported a threefold rise in gas tank tops and cans designed
to prevent theft, but a spokeswoman added that there had also been
a run on hoses used to siphon gas.
</P>
<P>
   One victim of the fuel shortage was Prince Charles, who canceled
public appearances touring farms in southwest England rather than
accept an offer of gasoline from police. ``He didn't think he was
an emergency service,'' a spokeswoman said.

 &HT;    Sexual fantasy begins tender tale of love
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody does it like the French, be it romance, food or film
festivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Affair of Love'' is an extremely French wisp of a picture
with a lingering whiff of needless tragedy. The protagonists, known
only as Her (Nathalie Baye) and Him (Sergi Lopez), connect through
an ad she's placed in a sex magazine describing a certain sexual
fantasy. They meet at a cafe and almost immediately repair to a
nearby hotel where, to their mutual satisfaction, they do it.
</P>
<P>
   What ``it'' is is never revealed. Director Frederic Fonteyne
discreetly closes the door every time the pair walk down the
bordello-red corridors of their hotel to Room 118. The sole time
we're allowed inside _ for an extended oh-so-French scene that
includes a mid-coital discussion of former lovers _ is when they
decide to try something really kinky, i.e., make love normally.
</P>
<P>
   The problem _ revealed in the movie's opening scenes, so there's
nothing being spoiled here _ is that these two can handle sex but
panic when romance rears its ugly head. We're introduced to each
character separately, being quizzed by an off-screen presence
(shrink? journalist? filmmaker?) who wants to know why the affair
ended. What we learn is that they can leap into bed, but making
that leap of faith _ to take the risk of true intimacy _ is too
scary. Both insist that they couldn't make it as a couple and that
if they'd guessed wrong, as one shrugs, ``Something would've
happened. Something would've told us we were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they turn a tragic lack of trust _ in
themselves, in each other _ into an act of fate.
</P>
<P>
   Baye, who's lit up the screen in such classics as ``Day for
Night'' and ``The Return of Martin Guerre,'' projects the radiance
of a still beautiful middle-aged woman (the character is in her
mid-40s; Baye is actually in her early 50s) who's still open
sexually but troubled by the notion of falling in love. Lopez,
who's slightly younger, has eyes that give off a Kevin Kline
crinkle when he smiles. There's a boundless irony in this
self-proclaimed ``optimist's'' statement that if she got to know
him she'd probably end up hating him.
</P>
<P>
   The sappy title suggests a Gallic chick flick, but remember that
it was called ``A Pornographic Affair'' in France. It's a movie
about the risks we can take and the ones we can't. One that reminds
us _ in a rueful, tender, what-if way _ that what we do for love is
as complex as anything on this planet and even a so-called fling
can carry all the romantic weight in the world.
</P>

 &HT;    Paltrow out of place playing at karaoke
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even the opening credits for ``Duets'' are off-key. Why, you
wonder, is an A-list, Oscar-winning actress appearing with a
semi-known ensemble cast in a movie about karaoke?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is as easy as it is distressing. Check the name of
the picture's producer/director. It's Bruce Paltrow. As in, father
of Gwyneth. ...
</P>
<P>
   Kudos to a dutiful daughter, but lending your star-shine to
something like ``Duets'' may be going too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duets'' is a dismal little film in which six characters, who
should be in search of an author, are in search of the nearest
karaoke bar. They're all hooked on the three-minutes-of-fame you
get by singing your heart out to a prerecorded background CD. Plus,
there's the prize money _ $5,000 if you win the Big Sing-Off in
Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   Our contestants are as varied as, well, the passengers on ``The
Love Boat.'' But underneath their differences, they're variations
on a theme: one a naif, one worldly-wise who learns from the naif.
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow's character is an exceedingly sheltered Vegas showgirl
whose mom has just died. That reunites her with the father (Huey
Lewis, formerly of Huey Lewis and the News) she never knew. To get
to know him better, she insists on tagging along as he heads for
Omaha. What she doesn't realize is that he's a karaoke hustler _
did you know there were such things? _ meaning, he's a professional
singer who poses as a clueless amateur and beats the non-pros by
professing ignorance of and even disdain for the karaoke
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Next are a traveling salesman (Paul Giamatti) and a canny ex-con
(Andre Braugher, formerly of TV's ``Homicide''). The former is a
burnout case, worn to a frazzle by life on the road and a family
that barely knows if he's home or not. The latter is a lifer prone
to pulling a gun on those kind enough to give him a ride. What they
have in common is good voices and a healthy disrespect for the
Establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's ``Felicity's'' Scott Speedman (in a role once
earmarked for Brad Pitt) and Maria Bello (``Coyote Ugly''). He's a
former seminary student, now driving a cab but still convinced of
people's essential goodness. She's a tough cookie making her way
across the country by dispensing sexual favors in exchange for the
best room at the local Ramada.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone ends up in Omaha, where the director further taxes our
patience _ this is almost a two-hour movie _ by showing us a bit of
the competition. So for anyone who misses ``Star Search'' and wants
to watch a really fat guy who sings really well, here's your
chance.
</P>
<P>
   The cast gets to sing, too, and they all manage it well. Gwyneth
gets to sing twice. She has a pleasant if somewhat thin voice.
Mostly, you find yourself studying her hair extensions. Very blond,
very straight and very long. Substitute ``bland'' for ``blond'' and
you've got a pretty good description of her movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duets''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Andre Braugher and Huey Lewis.
Directed by Bruce Paltrow. Rated R for profanity and brief sex. 1
hour, 53 minutes.

 &HT;    Former rock 'n' roll journalist's `Almost Famous' is a
bittersweet paean to a magical time long gone
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Listen to `Tommy' with a candle burning and you will see your
entire future.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what one character says in the absolutely fabulous new
film ``Almost Famous,'' and she'd sound crazy, except, well, there
probably isn't an aging baby boomer out there who doesn't remember
saying some version of the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   It was the early 1970s. The country was in flux from one water
sign (the Age of Aquarius) to another (Watergate). But in 1973,
anything still seemed possible. The happy-hippie aura of the '60s
hovered like a guardian angel over the more grounded,
granola-brained next chapter in the continuing saga of, if not the
greatest generation, the most self-important. It was a time when
``he's with the band'' were magic words that could take you places
Dorothy and company never dreamed of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost Famous,'' written and directed by Cameron Crowe, is a
reality-based fable of that fabled time. Crowe, who's now better
known as a screenwriter (``Fast Times at Ridgemont High'') and
filmmaker (``Say Anything,'' ``Jerry Maguire''), was only 15 in
1973 when he lowered his voice, talked ``concept'' and managed to
con Rolling Stone magazine into hiring him to write profiles of
such bands as the Allman Brothers, the Eagles and Led Zeppelin.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Almost Famous,'' Crowe's alter ego is a baby-faced
day-dream believer named William Miller (Patrick Fugit). Sent on
the road with Stillwater, an opening act striving to become a
headliner, he relies on his mentor, real-life rock critic Lester
Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), to give him the right spin to pass
along to his editor at Rolling Stone. Bangs helpfully concocts an
effective quickie: ``It's a `think' piece about a midlevel band
struggling with the limitations of stardom.''
</P>
<P>
   Those limitations include the usual sex, drugs and rock 'n'
roll. Or, as William learns later in the tour, sex, drugs and a
stomach pump. Shut out by security on his first foray into the rock
world, he finds his way into the inner sanctum of backstage thanks
to a radiant groupie who calls herself Penny Lane (Kate Hudson,
daughter of Goldie Hawn). She and her gal pals (Fairuza Balk and
Anna Paquin), however, refuse to think of themselves as groupies.
Rather, they insist, they're ``Band Aids,'' in it for the music,
not the sex. Of course, their definition of sex is startlingly
similar to President Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   Penny gets William in the door; his enthusiastic blend of
innocence and smarts keeps him there. Stillwater is an on-the-verge
band; this leads to some nasty ego clashes offstage. When the lead
guitarist (Billy Crudup) threatens to hog the spotlight, the lead
singer (Jason Lee) reminds him, ``From the beginning, we agreed.
I'm the frontman and you're the guitar player with mystique.''
</P>
<P>
   Mystique is a lot of what ``Almost Famous'' is all about. Or
lack thereof. Bangs, who died of a drug overdose in 1982, cautions
the movie's Miller to always remember that we _ i.e., we the
writers, not them the rock stars _ are perpetually uncool. ``They
don't know what it's like to be a fan. To love some silly bit of
music so much that it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe knows exactly what that feels like, and that, perhaps, is
a key to the picture's power. ``Almost Famous'' is a coming-of-age
story in more ways than one. It's about the coming of age of a
particularly gifted teenage writer, but it's also about the coming
of age of an entire generation. There was a time when,
metaphorically, we were all with the band. Or wished we were. A
time when we all seemed to be on the same sweet, strange,
can't-last-forever-but-don't-tell-us ride.
</P>
<P>
   That energy, affection and synchronicity keep ``Almost Famous''
from being just another nostalgia trip. Add in Crowe's uncanny ear
for dialogue and the gracefully assured visual stylings of
cinematographer John Toll (``The Thin Red Line''). Finally, there
are the terrific performances. Young Fugit, who must have one of
the most engagingly loopy smiles in the business. Oscar winner
Frances McDormand (``Fargo'') as his weird but wonderful mother
(she worships ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' but disdains Simon and
Garfunkel because ``they smoke pot''). Crudup as the band member
with an easygoing sexiness and the star power to implement a
laid-back but well-crafted ambition. Hoffman as the wary
observer/Ultimate Fan who advises William, ``You must never make
friends with the rock stars.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, someone says,
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone can explain rock 'n' roll except maybe
Peter Townshend.'' That's the glory of ``Almost Famous.'' It
doesn't try to explain. It just puts us there, in the entourage, on
the edge of the stage, where, as Penny says, ``It's all
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Like William, we get off Stillwater's bus a little sadder, a
little wiser. But also terminally infected by the sheer exuberance
of what we've been part of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost Famous'' may be, at heart, a kind of elegy, but its
bittersweet edge is blown away by its buoyant spirit. ``Just make
us look cool,'' Crudup pleads _ something that Glenn Frey of the
Eagles apparently once really said to Crowe. And Crowe does. But he
also shows us what lies beneath the coolness _ the raw, vibrant
longing and the aching legacy of things long past. ``Almost
Famous'' is a last waltz you can dance to; you already know the
words.``Almost Famous''

 &HT;    Playing with exhibitionism
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Danish director Lars von Trier (``Breaking the Waves'')
continues his role as provocateur with a movie about provocateurs,
``The Idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not about comedians. The mob of performers in question
are a houseful of dropouts (including a doctor and an advertising
grunt) who ride around in a short bus and try to upset the nearby
townsfolk with elaborate displays of ``spazzing.'' Pretending to be
mentally retarded, they wander like children through the public,
and cry, and drool.
</P>
<P>
   ``You poke fun,'' says Karen (Bodil Jorgensen), a fragile
mid-30s waif who gets swept up by the group during one of their
public outings. ``They're the ones who make fun,'' counters Stoffer
(Jens Albinus), the charismatic but possibly unstable leader of the
group. His main goal is to upset what he sees as the hypocritical
values of society.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least, that seems to be his goal. Stoffer never really
gives a plausible reason for this group's rude merrymaking. Neither
does the movie. It proposes that this brand of acting out
represents freedom, an escape from the shackles of polite society.
Whatever. The idea doesn't really hold water, and von Trier doesn't
spend too much time trying to state a thesis.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the movie is primarily a series of comic scenes that
show the characters getting under the middle-class skins of
selected victims. They include a woman interested in buying the
house (it belongs to Stoffer's uncle) and a concerned member of
city hall. Driven by the actors' performances, ``The Idiots''
increasingly feels less like a movie than an extensive actors'
experiment, a work of exhibitionism egged on by the director. (This
movie, ``Breaking the Waves'' and next month's ``Dancer in the
Dark'' all show von Trier wringing extreme emotional performances
out of very thin material.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Idiots'' adheres to the director's no-frills Dogma 95
aesthetic. The film is shot with hand-held cameras (queasy viewers,
beware). In fact, crew members and boom mikes accidentally appear
onscreen from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   You'll mind these intrusions less than the ridiculous black
rectangles that are used to cover up glimpses of male nudity.
Apparently that was the compromise USA Films made to get the movie
an R rating instead of the dreaded NC-17. It's a bad choice, even
worse than the digital cover-ups in ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' The
director and his actors obviously understood the ways that nudity,
even more than inappropriate behavior, can be one of the most
provocative weapons. The blotted-out images of this censored
version are instead unintentionally comical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Idiots''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jens Albinus and Bodil Jorgensen. Rated R for strong
sexuality and nudity and profanity. In Dutch with English
subtitles. 1 hour, 55 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: More provocation from the bad boy of Denmark.

 &HT;    Take the bait: Petty thief, but big-time fun
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bait'' may not hook you with its first couple of scenes, but
give it time. After all, this is still a generic action-comedy with
all the requisite explosions and quips.
</P>
<P>
   But despite its genre trappings, ``Bait'' is an entertaining and
occasionally clever picture with a crackling peformance by Jamie
Foxx, who showed off his big-screen moves in last year's ``Any
Given Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Foxx plays Alvin Sanders, a hapless petty thief who lands in
jail after a failed attempt to rob a fish market (``Not shrimp,''
he keeps telling his partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prawns .'')
</P>
<P>
   His cellmate is a much bigger fish, a guy named John Jaster
(Robert Pastorelli) who has a weak heart. He's been incarcerated
for a high-tech heist _ several millions in gold from the Federal
Reserve. In fact, it's so high-tech that the feds don't just want
their gold back; they're worried there's still someone out there so
skilled, he could threaten national security. And, they would like
their gold back.
</P>
<P>
   To get that somebody to come out of hiding, a Treasury agent
named Edgar Clenteen (David Morse) arranges for Alvin's early
release. He also implants a tracking device on him, thus making him
the titular bait. Trouble is, Alvin isn't about to give up his old
ways. Since he doesn't know the feds are inside his head
(literally), this leads to some interesting
do-we-watch-or-do-we-act situations for Clenteen and company.
</P>
<P>
   The picture has its weaknesses. A by-the-books climax that
builds improbably and just keeps building long past the patience of
anyone who doesn't think ``Armageddon'' was one of the best movies
of the '90s. (A cautionary note: One of the writers is also
credited with ``Armageddon.'') A tacked-on subplot that gives Alvin
a girfriend (Kimberly Elise) and a little daughter to help him grow
up. And a tacky performance by Doug Hutchison that's a shameless
being-John-Malkovich impersonation, down to every sibilant, silken
syllable.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the good news. The writers actually tried to make
this more than just a Jamie Foxx vehicle and, to his credit, Foxx
let them. An element suggestive of ``The Truman Show'' emerges as
Clenteen's team gets involved with Alvin as a regular
flesh-and-blood guy. So much so that their leader has to remind
them, ``Alvin is bait. That's all he is. And you know what happens
to bait.''
</P>
<P>
   Elise (``Beloved'') gives character to a plot-device role, while
Morse, who's featured in the upcoming ``Dancers in the Dark,'' is
especially effective as the not-quite-villainous Clenteen.
</P>
<P>
   As for Foxx, he's still the movie's bait, so to speak, and he
should be. He has the freshness and charm of the early Eddie
Murphy, but with a vulnerable edge and an edgy wariness that's all
his own.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we need one, but if anyone's thinking about a remake of
``48 Hours,'' he's their man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bait''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jamie Foxx, David Morse and Kimberly Elise. Directed by
Antoine Fuqua. Rated R for profanity and violence. 1 hour, 50
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Foxx and a not-bad plot are the hook.

   ``Adventures in Wild California''
</P>
<P>
   An Imax film.
</P>
<P>
   Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Review: You've got to hand it to the makers of the Imax movie
``Adventures in Wild California.'' Their movie will keep kids
slack-mouthed with excitement as they watch the extreme-sport
antics of athletic daredevils: tree climbers, snowboarders, skiers
and surfers. (SM) 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost Famous'' R (profanity, sexual situations, and substance
abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Cameron Crowe's (``Jerry Maguire'') exhuberant and
knowing movie grabs the soul of rock and roll and blissfully
re-creates the early '70s, a time poised between one water sign
(the Age of Aquarius) and another (Watergate). Drawing on his own
experiences, Crowe gives us a 15-year-old rock fan (Patrick Fugit)
who, in 1973, convinces Rolling Stone magazine to send him on the
road with an emerging group called Stillwater. He learns about sex,
drugs, rock 'n' roll and stomach pumps. He also learns why the
music matters _ and always will matter. (ERG) 2 hours. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``An Affair of Love'' R (sex and nudity) Subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nathalie Baye and Sergi Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Review: An extremely French wisp of a film with a lingering
whiff of needless romantic tragedy. A man and a woman (Sergi Lopez
and Nathalie Baye) _ we never learn their names _ meet through an
ad she placed concerning a certain sexual fantasy. Falling into bed
is easy but things get difficult when it looks like they're falling
in love. Though it sounds like a Gallic chick flick, keep in mind
the original title was ``A Pornographic Affair,'' and that it's a
rueful, tender movie about sex and love. (ERG) 1 hour, 20 minutes.
B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Backstage'' Rated R (strong language, nudity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   A hip-hop documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Review: A hip-hop documentary, the behind-the-scenes film about
the 1999 Hard Knocks Life tour is less a documentary than a home
movie, intercutting stage-show clips with endless bad-boy behavior.
To its credit, ``Backstage'' doesn't pull any punches. It never
tries to show its rapping crews as misunderstood artists. As Kevin
Liles, president of Def Jam Records puts it, ``It's all about
getting the (expletive) money.'' (SM) 1 hour, 27 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Bait'' Rated R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jamie Foxx, David Morse and Kimberly Elise.
</P>
<P>
   Review: May not hook you completely, but give it a chance.
Underneath the usual action-comedy trappings is an entertaining
and, on occasion, clever movie. Jamie Foxx stars as a small-time
crook who, without his knowledge, is released from jail with a
tracking device planted on him. The scheme, hatched by some federal
agents, is to lure a high-tech criminal out of hiding. A bit of
``The Truman Show'' emerges as the agents watching Foxx come to
care about him. Foxx, who provides the box-office bait, delivers a
fresh and charming performance reminiscent of early Eddie Murphy.
(ERG)1 hour, 50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bless the Child'' R (violence, drug content and brief
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kim Basinger and Jimmy Smits.
</P>
<P>
   Review: A junky would-be religious thriller about a little girl
with special powers. The latest cinematic struggle of good vs.
evil, the film swipes everything it can from ``The Omen,'' ``The
Exorcist,'' ``End of Days,'' ``Stigmata'' and other
Catholic/satanic epics, all while managing to bore the pants off
you. (SM) 1 hour, 50 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring It On'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   (sex-related material and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirsten Dunst.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Kirsten Dunst stars in a comedy that pits two rival high
schools' cheerleading squads in a we-hate-you showdown at the
national cheerleading championships. Pretty much all the jokes fall
flat. Actually, the funniest bit involves projectile vomiting. And
what does that say about this movie? (BL)1 hour, 33 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cell'' R (violence, language and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Lopez, Vince Vaughn and Vincent D'Onofrio.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Don't get trapped in this one. Jennifer Lopez plays an
intrepid child therapist who, through an experimental sci-fi
technique, can enter the minds of others. A detective (Vince
Vaughn) asks her to stroll through the brain of a serial killer
(Vincent D'Onofrio) so he can find where he's stashed his latest
victim. Visually provocative, narratively impaired, it's like ``The
Silence of the Lambs'' without the compelling characters. (ERG) 1
hour, 52 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run'' G
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices of Mel Gibson
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Set on a chicken farm in 1950s Britain, the movie is
about some hens' repeated attempts to fly the coop after their
villainous owner decides there's more money in chicken pies than in
chickens. If you're in the mood for something offbeat and wackily
deadpan, this may be just your kind of amiably bird-brained
entertainment. (ERG)1 hour, 22 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyote Ugly''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Piper Perabo, Adam Garcia, Maria Bello and
</P>
<P>
   John Goodman. PG-13 (sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Review: Dog-face hideous. The come-on is five hot chicks serving
liquor in a rowdy fun-time saloon (they splash whiskey across the
bar and set it afire; they douse each others' T-shirts with big
pitchers of water). But it's really the slapdash story of a young
waif, a struggling songwriter aching for stardom in New York City.
``Coyote'' is profoundly stupid and earnestly inept at conveying a
story. (BL) 1 hour, 34 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Crew'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   (sexual content, violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Dreyfuss and Burt Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Review: It stereotypes Jews and Hispanics and belittles the
group it's supposed to be celebrating, retirement-age Americans.
Even worse, the movie's not even funny. The stars are old mafia
wiseguys trying to fight a rent increase in their Miami hotel. Lame
plot twists and accidents ensue. (SM)1 hour, 28 minutes. F
</P>
<P>
   ``Croupier''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clive Owen and Alex Kingston. Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Review: This 1998 film involves a struggling author who takes a
job at a casino running a roulette wheel to look for writing
inspiration. Soon he's convinced to join a robbery scheme.
``Croupier'' has more on its mind than danger and plot twists. It's
a fascinating, hard-edged portrait of a man who swears he doesn't
gamble. (SM)1 hour, 31 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Duets'' Rated R (profanity and brief sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Andre Braugher and Huey Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Off-key. Gwyneth Paltrow, Andre Braugher and Huey Lewis
are among six characters, each caught up in a personal drama,
headed for a big karaoke contest in Omaha. Sort've like a ``Love
Boat'' episode, only longer. And why, you might wonder, is an
A-list Oscar winner appearing in a dismal little movie about
karaoke? Check out the name of the director/producer. It's Bruce
Paltrow, as in father of ... (ERG)1 hour, 53 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' R (extreme violence, perverse sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Two thousand _ or, if you want to add computer effects,
200,000 _ thumbs up for Ridley Scott's spectacle starring Russell
Crowe as a Roman general, who returns to the Colosseum to take
revenge on the odious Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The
battles staged before the mob of mindless ancient Romans are the
film's centerpieces, but its brave heart (so to speak) is Crowe.
(ERG) 2 hours, 33 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone in 60 Seconds''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicphis Raines, a reformed car thief called back behind
the wheel when his little brother bungles a deal for a British
crime lord. If you sit through the usual formula garbage, ``Gone''
delivers a long, harrowing car chase that easily outdoes the
motorcycle finale in ``Mission Impossible: 2.'' A few IQ points may
be lost while watching the flick. But you'll be having too much fun
to care. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollow Man'' R (graphic violence, nudity, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue.
</P>
<P>
   Review: A high-tech fusion of ``The Invisible Man'' and ``Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,'' it lets director Paul Verhoeven (``Starship
Troopers,'' ``Total Recall'') show off some gruesome,
state-of-the-art computer effects and exercise his gleeful brand of
brutal action. But his filmmaking energy is wasted on a weak script
and characters so two-dimensional, they're virtually all
transparent. (SM) 1 hour, 54 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Idiots''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jens Albinus and Bodil Jorgensen. Rated R (strong
sexuality , nudity, profanity) In Dutch with English subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Danish director Lars von Trier (``Breaking the Waves'')
continues his role as a provocateur with a movie about
provocateurs, ``The Idiots.'' The mob of performers in question is
a houseful of dropouts (including a doctor and an advertising
grunt) who ride around in a short bus and try to upset the nearby
townsfolk with elaborate displays of ``spazzing.'' (SM)1 hour, 55
minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg'' Not rated.
</P>
<P>
   A documentary about baseball player Hank Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Aviva Kempner's documentary is a rare film indeed _ a
celebration of Hank Greenberg, a pro baseball player in the 1930s
and '40s who became the first Jewish sports superstar. Greenberg
broke records, was voted most valuable player twice and led his
team, the Detroit Tigers, to two World Series _ even as he was
being subjected to anti-Semitic baiting by fans, rivals and,
sometimes, his own teammates. Jackie Robinson puts it best: ``Mr.
Greenberg was class.'' So is his movie. (ERG) 1 hour, 35 minutes.
A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Love &AMP; Sex'' Unrated (sexual situations, adult language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Famke Janssen and Jon Favreau.
</P>
<P>
   Review: A charming trifle with a sparkling performance by Famke
Janssen as a magazine writer in her early 30s who's had plenty of
sex in her life but not enough love. A magazine assignment sets her
thinking about her past romances, especially one with a good-guy
artist (Jon Favreau). The movie skims when it should take the
plunge and the lead players don't quite match, but at least it's a
romantic comedy that eschews contrivances and admits that it's hell
just being in the dating zone. (ERG)1 hour, 22 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurse Betty''Rated R (violence and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, Chris Rock and Greg
Kinnear.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Renee Zellweger's otherworldly sweetness is used to
great effect in ``Nurse Betty,'' a dark fantasy. Like a collision
between ``Being There,'' ``The Wizard of Oz'' and early Coen
brothers, you've seen it before, but you've never seen anything
quite like this. Zellweger plays a waitress in search of her
long-lost love, a soap opera character, and steals a Buick to find
him. Two problems. The Buick is full of drugs, and hitmen Charlie
(Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock) are soon on her trail.
(ERG) 1 hour, 48 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps'' PG-13 (crude humor and sexual
content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy and Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Review: The big problem in ``Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' is
the nutty professor. This sequel to the 1996 hit seems designed for
video: You want to fast-forward through all the parts focused on
tubby scientist Sherman (Eddie Murphy) so you can get back to the
rest of his family (played by Murphy, Murphy, Murphy and Murphy,
plus a fat kid). Murphy is jaw-droppingly funny. But the script is
simply not nutty enough. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Original Kings of Comedy'' R (language and sex-related
humor)
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Steve Harvey, Cedric the Entertainer, D.L. Hughley and
Bernie Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Review: There's nothing that original. It's just a lot of funny
stuff knocked out by four sharp stand-up comics. And under Spike
Lee's direction, it's one of the liveliest concert films in years.
The routines get raucous and rude, but hold off on the blistering
verbal assaults of other comedians. Lee looses several cameras
through the venue, capturing audience reactions and giving the
movie the dynamic spark of the live event. (SM) 1 hour, 57 minutes.
A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm'' PG-13 (profanity and scenes of peril)
</P>
<P>
   Starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Review: The fishermen of the Andrea Gail take a pounding, and so
does the audience in the latest movie directed by Wolfgang
Petersen. Based on Sebastian Junger's best seller, it re-creates
the collision of three weather systems in the fall of 1991 _ and
the battle of men (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg) and women (Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio) trying to survive the monstrous sea. (SM) 2
hours, 15 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Personals''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Malik Yoba, Stacey Dash and Sheryl Lee Ralph. Unrated
(contains adult themes and profanity.) Part of
BlackFilmFestAmerica's independent movie tour.
</P>
<P>
   Review: A sometimes witty, but thoroughly slow-going
relationship comedy. Malik Yoba (TV's ``New York Undercover'')
plays Keith, a New York journalist juggling a few too many personal
items. Like two girlfriends, a boss who wants to fire him, and
friends who see all too clearly through Keith's ``I'm OK'' veneer.
His saving grace may be his final assignment: date 30 women in 30
days for an article about the personal ads. (BL) 1 hour, 32
minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``A Piece of Eden'' Unrated, but family-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Marc Grapey and Rebecca Harrell.
</P>
<P>
   Review: ``Eden'' isn't exactly heavenly. But in a multiplex
landscape dominated by R-rated flicks, this little, family-friendly
movie is a bit of an oasis for viewers trying to see something
without guns, sex jokes or rapid-fire vulgarities. It's about a New
York publicist trying to save the family farm in Indiana. (SM) 1
hour, 46 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Replacements'' PG-13 (some crude sexual humor and
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman.
</P>
<P>
   Review: It's got it all. Bone-crunching football plays.
Boneheaded comedy (the team kicker, a wire-thin Welsh soccer
player, puffs cigs while booting field goals). And a dumb-as-dirt
pep squad whose sideline lap-dance cheers cause the opposition to
fumble a lot. Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman star in this dumb romp
about adult scabs taking over for striking pro players. (BL) 1
hour, 58 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Grace'' R (drug content and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brenda Blethyn and Craig Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   Review: A guiltless, feel-good flick in the ``Waking Ned
Devine'' mold. The film has everything it takes to be hopelessly
twee: steaming teacups and scenic seascapes, eccentric villagers, a
rowdy pub and some naughty business involving marijuana. But to the
credit of everyone involved, especially Brenda Blethyn in the title
role, the comedy mainly skirts the pitfalls of preciousness. (SM) 1
hour, 33 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Scary Movie''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anna Faris, Jon Abrahams, Shawn Wayans and Marlon
Wayans. Rated R (strong crude sexual humor, profanity, drug use and
violence)
</P>
<P>
   Review: Propped up by the Wayans brothers _ Keenen
(writer/director), Shawn (writer/actor) and Marlon (writer/actor);
and they are a talented bunch _ ``Scary Movie'' is a parody of teen
horror flicks. The ``Scream'' trilogy, ``I Know What You Did Last
Summer,'' ``The Blair Witch Project'' and, just because it was
popular, ``The Matrix'' all get skewered in a thousand jokes that
are either hilarious, mildly funny, not funny, crude, or absolutely
offensive. (BL) 1 hour, 28 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Solomon &AMP; Gaenor''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ioan Gruffudd and Nia Roberts. Rated R (sexuality and
some violence) In English, Welsh and Yiddish, with subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Set in a gloomy Welsh village in 1911, it tells of the
forbidden love between Solomon (Ioan Gruffudd), son of Jewish
merchants, and Gaenor (Nia Roberts), daughter of a church-going
family of miners. Writer-director Paul Morrison gives his film a
poetic kind of gravity. But he never throws any narrative
curveballs that might have made the story more than a misty, damp
echo of ``Romeo and Juliet.'' (SM)1 hour, 40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Space Cowboys'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, James Garner and
Donald Sutherland.
</P>
<P>
   Review: The right stuff. Geezer chic gets a grand showcase in
Clint Eastwood's shamelessly crowd-pleasing comedy-thriller. When a
decrepit Russian satellite threatens to crash to Earth, four aging
astronauts who were axed from the program in the '50s are summoned
into service to repair the thing. The best part of the film is
watching these veterans play off each other like seasoned pros on
the Senior Tour. (ERG) 2 hours, 15 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tao of Steve'' R (profanity and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Donal Logue and Greer Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Review: A slight and slightly obnoxious romantic comedy about a
chunky nonhunk (Donal Logue) who's a babe magnet because he
practices the so-called tao of Steve, i.e., the way to get girls is
to emulate the sheer coolness of Steve McQueen. The twist comes
when this lumpen Lothario falls for a set designer (Greer Goodman)
impervious to his method. Logue can be charming, but the whole
premise seems contrived and a bit false. (ERG) 1 hour, 30 minutes.
C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn It Up'' Rated R (strong violence, language and some drug
content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pras, Ja Rule, Vondie Curtis-Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Based on ``Ghetto Supastar,'' both the CD and
young-adult novel by hip-hop star Pras (aka the Fugee's Prakerzel
Michel), ``Turn It Up'' is a flashy, loud urban thriller that wants
to critique the guns-and-bullets world of thug life, while at the
same time reveling in its perks. It's a cautionary tale that isn't
quite sure what it wants to caution the audience about. (SM) 1
hour, 23 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Watcher'' Rated R (violence and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Spader, Keanu Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Review: There's a resonant 21st-century theme in ``The
Watcher,'' an otherwise standard serial-killer thriller. A sicko
named Griffin (Keanu Reeves) stalks pretty women and uses a burnt
out detective, named Campbell (James Spader), as his main pawn.
Debut director Joe Charbanic manages to wring some suspense out of
stock situations. Too often, though, he falls back on cliches,
including heavy breathing on the soundtrack, and an arty reliance
on blurry slo-mo flashbacks. (SM)1 hour, 33 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Way of the Gun'' Rated R (violence, gore, language and
some sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ryan Phillippe, Benicio Del Toro and Juliette Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Review: An Oscar winner for his ``Usual Suspects'' screenplay,
Christopher McQuarrie makes a sluggishly paced directing debut in
the tale of a couple of lowlifes named Parker (Ryan Phillippe) and
Longbaugh (Benicio Del Toro). Though it's not exactly original, the
movie is so intent on an air of existential grunge, it becomes
suffocating and pretentious. (SM) At metro theaters. 2 hours. D
</P>
<P>
   ``What Lies Beneath'' PG-13 (terror, violence, sensuality,
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Review: What lies beneath this film is a script that could have
come from a 1970s TV movie. Narratively old-fashioned, but boosted
by star performances from Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford and
suspenseful direction, it's a lovingly crafted throwback to
haunted-house movies that relied more on suggestion and slowly
building creepiness than great effects. (SM) 2 hours, 10 minutes.
B-
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' PG-13 (sci-fi action violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman, Anna Paquin, Patrick Stewart
and Ian McKellen.
</P>
<P>
   Review: ``X-Men'' never comes close to classic status. The best
movie to work this superhero turf lately was the shamelessly
entertaining ``The Matrix.'' But director Bryan Singer and his
collaborators treat the comic's mythology with seriousness and
respect (unlike other recent, slapdash comic adaptations ``Spawn''
and ``Blade''). It's an engaging popcorn movie in a summer that's
littered with duds. (SM) 1 hour, 44 minutes. B-

 &HT;    Wistful Welsh romance gone awry
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After hiding the fact that he's Jewish from his Christian
girlfriend for weeks, Solomon (Ioan Gruffudd) finally explains to
her, ``I just couldn't see how to put the pieces together.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the star-crossed melodrama ``Solomon &AMP; Gaenor''
puts its pieces together too predictably. Set in a gloomy Welsh
village in 1911, it tells of the forbidden love between Solomon,
son of Jewish merchants, and Gaenor (Nia Roberts), daughter of a
churchgoing family of miners.
</P>
<P>
   They meet one afternoon when Solomon is traveling door to door,
selling cloth samples. Instantly smitten, Solomon is soon paying
formal visits to her family, including her father, Idris (William
Thomas), and gruff, menacing brother Crad (Mark Lewis Jones).
There's just one catch. He tells them his name is Sam. And en route
to Gaenor's home, he stashes his tallit (prayer shawl) in the
chinks of a stone wall.
</P>
<P>
   As you might expect, soon after Solomon and Gaenor have started
sneaking off to make love in a (distractingly overlit) stable,
trouble breaks around them. Gaenor's family are anti-Semitic, but
Solomon's kin are no better: They let him know he will be
dispossessed if he takes up with a shiksa.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Paul Morrison gives his film a poetic kind of
gravity. But he never throws any narrative curveballs that might
have made the story more than a misty, damp echo of ``Romeo and
Juliet.'' Gruffudd and Roberts are attractive performers, but they
never make their characters seem like much more than plot devices.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of plot devices, Solomon's masquerade as a Christian
seems unlikely, given the way that the townsfolk are depicted as
such a xenophobic, tight-knit community. In the suspicious world
Morrison shows us, it doesn't seem that any secret is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solomon &AMP; Gaenor''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ioan Gruffudd and Nia Roberts. Rated R for sexuality
and a scene of violence. In English, Welsh and Yiddish, with
subtitles. 1 hour, 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A star-crossed love affair that seems too familiar.

   CLINTON-VIETNAM (Washington) _ The White House said Thursday
that President Clinton would visit Vietnam shortly after the
November elections, becoming the first president to step on
Vietnamese soil since the end of the war that took 58,000 American
lives, and completing a rapprochement with the communist government
that has unfolded over most of Clinton's time in office. By David

   LEE-RELEASE-CLINTON (Washington) _ President Clinton said
Thursday that he was ``quite troubled'' by the government's conduct
in the Wen Ho Lee case one day after a U.S. district court judge in
New Mexico harshly criticized federal authorities for tactics he
said were unfair and abusive. The government's abandonment of the
case that it had once compared to nuclear espionage shattered an
uneasy calm that had settled over the Justice Department and the
FBI in the waning months of the Clinton presidency. By David

   FULTON, N.Y. _ The New York Senate candidates hit the stump
Thursday, a day after a contentious first debate, with both Rep.
Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton claiming the high road but
firing off barbs aimed at tactics and issues.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who embarked on a four-stop swing through western and
central New York state, defended his challenge to Clinton to sign a
document that he said was an agreement to refrain from using
unregulated campaign contributions known as soft money.
</P>
<P>
   That image _ of Lazio approaching Clinton with paper in hand _
was repeated on television news programs and newspaper front pages
after the debate, and Clinton on Thursday called it a ``stunt'' and
something that reminded her of the sort of tricks her little
brothers used to play on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that probably prepared me best in dealing with
things like that was having two younger brothers,'' she said in a
campaign stop in Buffalo. She derided Lazio's debate appearance as
``a performance without a lot of substance.'' She said, ``He had a
script and he followed his script.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio kept up his aggressive posture Thursday, saying New York
needed the ``plain talk'' he had delivered in the debate. His
campaign also sent a letter Thursday to Clinton's campaign manager
saying Lazio had written to independent groups telling them he
would demand they forsake any political activity on behalf of the
candidates once Clinton signs his pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am writing in hopes that you and Clinton will reconsider our
campaign's pledge to ban soft money from this race,'' William Dal
Col, Lazio's campaign manager, wrote to Bill de Blasio, Clinton's
campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio made no apologies for his tactics in the debate, brushing
aside complaints from NBC, which broadcast the debate, that he
violated a rule using props.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person who violated the rules was Clinton, by not
agreeing to what she said she was going to do _ a ban on soft
money,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect plain talk,'' Lazio told reporters as he
embarked on the tour. ``And you can't take the high horse and then
take the low road. If you fire at me, you're going to have to
expect to get fired back at.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been a major beneficiary of soft money, raising
almost $22 million for her campaign from both those unregulated
contributions and direct contributions. Lazio has gathered about
$19 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has not established soft-money fund-raising committees on
his behalf but has benefited from spending by independent
committees. The first lady has said that she is willing to renounce
the use of soft money, providing that Lazio obtains ``signed
agreements'' from those committees promising not to advertise in
New York or from those sending ``mean mail'' solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, even children, it seemed, paid notice to his
aggressiveness. During a visit to a charter school in Rochester, a
second grade pupil asked, ``Why were you fighting against Mrs.
Clinton?''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio replied, ``Last night, we were on TV and we were talking
about different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Fagan, a second-grader who said she had watched the
debate with her father, asked, ``Did you expect her to sign that
paper?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really, really did,'' Lazio replied, seated on a pupil's
chair and leaning toward his questioner, ``and I still do.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, both campaigns declared victory Thursday. The
Clinton campaign sent out a synopsis of news reports that it said
backed up its claim of a Hillary Clinton victory.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio took the opportunity during the hour-long debate to hammer
Clinton continually, questioning her trustworthiness and repeating
one of his campaign's major themes: that Clinton is seeking to
serve as a senator from a state where she has never before lived.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, for her part, sought throughout to tie her
opponent to the policies of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and
attacked what she described as his ``reckless'' plan to cut taxes
by at least $770 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, the Lazio campaign said he received the
endorsement of three Erie County Latino groups. In the evening,
Clinton was due to attend a Democratic fund-raising concert at
Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan with Vice President Al Gore and
his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Lieberman plan to campaign together in New York City
on Friday.

LUXURY-PRODUCTS MAKERS IN EUROPE REPORTING RISING PROFITS AND
SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ As booming economies around the world fuel the
consumption of luxury goods, some of Europe's largest luxury goods
retailers are reporting strongly improved sales and profits in the
first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The world's leading luxury goods retailer, LVMH-Moett Hennessy
Louis Vuitton of France, reported Thursday that operating profit in
the first half rose 31 percent, to 762 million euros, or $655
million, on a 40 percent increase in sales to 5.03 billion euros.
</P>
<P>
   The group attributed the strong result to particularly big
increases in sales of leather goods and perfumes, including
Christian Dior's J'Adore, which was launched earlier this year in
the United States. But it said that ``global economic growth has
certainly contributed to these developments.'' Net profit rose 21
percent in the first half to 374 million euros.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, another of Europe's biggest specialty
retailers, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute of France, said first half
operating profit had risen 35 percent, to 791.1 million euros, on
an 8 percent increase in revenue, to 11.3 billion euros, borne
aloft by strong consumer buying in France and the good performance
of Gucci Group, in which Pinault owns a 42 percent share. Pinault
said net income rose 23 percent to 20.6 million euros.
</P>
<P>
   Pinault, which is controlled by the French billionaire Francois
Pinault, entered the luxury business in a big way last year, after
winning a drawn out battle with Vuitton for control of Gucci.
Vuitton, which is controlled by another French billionaire, Bernard
Arnault, a kind of archrival of Pinault, owns a 20 percent share of
Gucci, but management control rests with Pinault. Since the
acquisition, Gucci has used the purchase price pocketed from
Pinualt of roughly $3 billion to launch a campaign of high profile
acquisitions that have included the French fashion house Yves Saint
Laurent and Sergio Rossi, an Italian maker of shoes for the
well-heeled.
</P>
<P>
   Vuitton's strong results were also reflected in the return to
profitability of DFS Group, which is 61 percent controlled by
Vuitton. DFS operates duty free shops at major airports and had
suffered badly following the Asian economic crisis when usually
free-spending travelers from Japan and other East Asian countries
cut back their airport shopping. Vuitton said DFS was ``benefiting
from increasing tourism in the Asia-Pacific region.''
</P>
<P>
   Investor reaction to the news was mixed. After initial strong
gains, the share price in both companies fell back and registered
only slight gains at the end of the day. Pinault's share price rose
by a little more than 1 percent, to 207.10 euros; Vuitton 0.7
percent, to 88.65 euros.

 &HT;    Breezy `Eden' like a breath of fresh air
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A Piece of Eden'' isn't exactly heavenly. But in a multiplex
landscape dominated by R-rated flicks, this little family-friendly
movie is a bit of an oasis for viewers trying to see something
without guns, sex jokes or rapid-fire vulgarities.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by veteran John Hancock (``Bang the Drum Slowly''),
``Eden'' gets off to a shaky start as it introduces New York
celebrity publicist Bob Tredici (Marc Grapey) and his new
assistant, Happy (Rebecca Harrell), a sweet space-case who can't
answer the phone without stumbling over her own tongue.
</P>
<P>
   When Bob learns that his father, Franco (Robert Breuler), has
landed in the hospital, leaving the family's sprawling Indiana farm
in the hands of Bob's scheming cousin Greg (Jeff Puckett), he
returns home hoping to run the farm himself. But Franco distrusts
his citified, girl-chasing ways, so Bob has to pretend he's
settling down and has even gotten married.
</P>
<P>
   You guessed it: He brings Happy along, masquerading as his wife.
And while Bob starts modernizing the farm, what do you bet they
start to make googly eyes at each other (culminating in a messy
food fight involving gallons of fresh honey).
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Tristan's screenplay tries to evoke generational weight,
giving us flashbacks to the Tredicis' origins in Corsica and
throwing in a few magic-realist touches like the amiable
appearances of grandpa Tredici's mandolin-playing ghost. At its
best, ``Eden'' strives to be a Midwestern ``Moonstruck'' but
doesn't have the romantic spark (or John Patrick Shanley's zing
with dialogue).
</P>
<P>
   Still, its good-natured charm sneaks up on you. Grapey,
unfortunately, is never quite the adorable rascal he's obviously
supposed to be. Harrell (who played the little girl in Hancock's
``Prancer'' back in 1989) has an appealing girl-next-door spunk.
But the movie is pretty much stolen by Tyne Daly, as Bob's sensible
Aunt Aurelia, and Irma St. Paule, as his superstitious (and
melodramatic) grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Piece of Eden''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Marc Grapey and Rebecca Harrell. Unrated, but it's a
family-friendly movie. 1 hour, 46 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An uninspired but perfectly decent family comedy.
</P>

INTERROGATING THE DETECTIVE; INTERVIEWING THE DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Morgan Freeman knows how to give people the fisheye.
When you say something a little unexpected or maybe even a little
silly (as people sometimes do when in the presence of, say, a
celebrity or one of the country's finest actors), he will cock his
head slightly and look at you out of the corner of his eye. Like:
Say what? And then, if you're lucky, he'll break into a broad
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman was sitting in the bar at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los
Angeles one recent afternoon, doing interviews for the two films he
has coming out this month and nudging along his dream project of
making a big-budget adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke's ``Rendezvous
With Rama,'' a project that has attracted the interest of the
director David Fincher.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman is already in theaters as the principled hit man chasing
Renee Zellweger in ``Nurse Betty.'' But he is even more eager to
talk about ``Under Suspicion,'' a small film, set for limited
release next Friday, that comes out of his own production company.
He will be paired, once again, with one of his ``Unforgiven''
co-stars, Gene Hackman.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on ``Garde a Vue,'' a 1981 police thriller by
Claude Miller that was critically and financially successful in
France, where it is regarded as a minor classic. In it, a police
detective spends a long night interrogating a very successful local
lawyer who may or may not be a murderer. It's all bluff and mind
games and steely eyes contemplating one another in the harsh glare
of an interrogation room. Freeman plays the detective, Hackman the
prosperous suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened right here, in this hotel,'' Freeman said. ``I
bumped into Gene in the lobby, and he told me he had this project
he was interested in and that he had a tape he wanted to show me. I
said sure, and he sent me the tape.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Claude Miller film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked later and he asked me if I was interested, and I
said yes, and then he asked which part I wanted to play,'' Freeman
said. ``I told him, oh, I wanted to play the detective, and he said
that's good because he wanted to play the lawyer. Sometimes it
works out.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Freeman said, is that it was a small movie. ``And
in this town, right now, you cannot go to a big studio with a small
movie,'' he said. ``All they want to make are big movies. Summer
blockbusters. No mayhem, no money.''
</P>
<P>
   So Freeman decided to take on the project for his own fledgling
production company, Revelations Entertainment, raise the money
himself, hire a director (Stephen Hopkins), shoot it and then find
a distributor, which is just what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman said he was particularly gratified when the film was
shown at the Cannes International Film Festival this year and
Miller appeared at the post-screening news conference and said he
considered it a better film than his. ``I don't think it's a better
film, personally,'' Freeman said. ``I think it's a different film.
I have a big thing about remakes. I don't think they're worth
anything unless you give them something new, unless you make them
different. Otherwise, it's just another pillaging of French cinema
by Hollywood hacks.''
</P>
<P>
   AGAINST THE ODDS
</P>
<P>
   Peter M. Cohen sees himself as a success story of independent
filmmaking, someone whose story should give hope and encouragement
to other young filmmakers out there flying on a wing and a credit
card. But he's afraid that, with one thing and another, that's not
how his story is coming across.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen produced, wrote and directed a movie called ``Whipped,''
which opened over Labor Day weekend on about 1,500 screens. It
stars Amanda Peet as the object of affection, if that's the word,
of a group of not altogether admirable Manhattan men. The movie
drew some fairly harsh reviews and earned only $2.7 million in its
opening weekend, not even finishing in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say the box office wasn't disheartening, compared to
the marketing, but I am still proud,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   What people don't seem to realize, he said, since the movie all
but vanished in an eye-blink, is that it wasn't the studio film
that it might have appeared from its marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total cost to make this movie was $180,000,'' Cohen said.
``That's it. I raised the money myself from 36 private equity
investors. My whole hope was not so much to get released as to just
go to some festivals, get a little attention, maybe get myself an
agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen made the movie as ``kind of a hobby''; his full-time job
is as a producer with a major Manhattan advertising agency. ``Most
of the characters were first-time actors, high school or college
friends of mine,'' he said. ``If you gave me $1,000, you got to be
in the movie; you got to walk through the frame.''
</P>
<P>
   It was never intended to be a Hollywood film, he said:
``Originally, it was going to be a short. It only grew into a
feature as we were making it. It was always supposed to be a
character-driven piece more than a plot-driven piece. It was never
supposed to be more than it was.''
</P>
<P>
   He shot it in 15 days in Manhattan and tried to get it into the
Sundance Film Festival in January, but it wasn't accepted. So
rather than continuing to try to interest festivals, Cohen and his
new agent decided to do some distributor screenings in Los Angeles
_ to show the movie directly to studios and independent
distributors in hopes of making a direct sale. The odds against
this are great, but they showed the movie around Hollywood, and a
week later Destination Films made an offer for the domestic rights
and Intermedia for the foreign rights.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he said, it was a Hollywood film.
</P>
<P>
   Destination mounted an aggressive marketing campaign, and the
movie went out over Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   And died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Cohen said. ``I was actually happy. I mean,
they told me the movie had made $2.7 million. This is a movie that
cost me $180,000 to make. This was just me and a bunch of my
friends running around New York with a camera. I thought, `This is
great.'''
</P>
<P>
   But in the reality of Hollywood perceptions, with bad reviews
and a disappointing box office ($2.7 million is not great for 1,500
screens, no matter how much the movie cost), he is worried that
``Whipped'' will never be seen as anything positive. It bugs him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be an inspirational story,'' Cohen said. ``The guy
who came from nowhere and decided to make a movie, and it ended up
on 1,500 screens. But it's not being seen that way. I don't know.
I'm still proud. I made something from nothing.'' &QL;

U.S. SWIMMERS WILL FACE STIFF CHALLENGES IN QUEST OF OLYMPIC
SUPREMACY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ There are more than 100 municipal pools in
this sprawling city where Dawn Fraser and Ian Thorpe learned how to
swim astonishingly fast. On any given day in any season, you can
find someone doing laps with a sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Head to Bondi Beach in the winter where members of the Iceberg
Club ignore their chattering teeth and plunge in a seaside
saltwater pool. Head to an aquatics center in late summer when
hordes of teen-agers covered in colorful grease paint race in
school carnivals that resemble fraternity initiation rites.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on Saturday, though, all eyes will be on just one pool
in Sydney: The Olympic pool at Homebush Bay. If the pundits are
correct, the thousands watching in person and the millions viewing
around the world could be treated to the most compelling swim meet
in memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly looks that way,'' said Michael Klim, one of
several Australians hoping to win gold medals over the next eight
days.
</P>
<P>
   No nation is more passionate about competitive swimming than
Australia, where the majority of people live within a short drive
of the ocean. Nearly all Australians learn to swim early and those
who excel receive considerable positive reinforcement from a
society where the best swimmers are in the spotlight every year,
not just every four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say that Australia is like swimming heaven,'' said
Jenny Thompson, an American who has trained here extensively in the
last year. ``Because I think it's the country that gives the most
respect to the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The Australians, led by the otherworldly 17-year-old Thorpe and
the veteran Susie O'Neill, appear to have their strongest Olympic
team since 1956, when the team featuring Fraser and Murray Rose
took full advantage of the home-pool advantage to win 8 of the 12
gold medals contested in Melbourne. This time, the Australians are
clear favorites in seven events, but the program has expanded
greatly in 44 years, which means that there are now 25 events in
which they are not clear favorites.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian men should challenge the American men and the
remarkable backstroker Lenny Krayzelburg for medal supremacy, but
the Australian women are merely one element in a balanced field.
Female swimmers from Japan could win three individual gold medals
and Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands could win three all by
herself in the 50-meter and 100-meter freestyle and 100-meter
butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in for one of the most exciting Olympics in
history, because it's going to be a world competition; it seems to
me about nine or 10 countries have a chance to win Olympic gold,''
said the American women's coach, Richard Quick. Only two of the
American women swimmers _ Brooke Bennett in the 800-meter freestyle
and Megan Quann in the 100-meter breaststroke _ have the year's
fastest time in their events.
</P>
<P>
   At 27, de Bruijn already has broken world records eight times
this year and displaced Thompson as the favorite in the 100-meter
freestyle and 100-meter butterfly. But her stunning times,
remarkable for both their quality and quantity, have been greeted
with skepticism by competitors in a sport where systematic doping
by East German swimmers in the 1970s and 1980s and by the Chinese
in the 1990s contributed to a climate of perpetual suspicion
regarding excellence.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Michelle Smith further poisoned the atmosphere.
Smith, an Irish swimmer who like de Bruijn did not peak until her
mid-20s, won three gold medals in the Atlanta Olympics in 1996.
Smith has since been banned from the sport for four years for
manipulating a urine sample.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, O'Neill, the veteran Australian swimmer,
called de Bruijn's records ``pretty suss,'' slang for suspect and
then sent de Bruijn an apologetic e-mail message. De Bruijn has
denied cheating, attributing her huge improvements to several
factors: A new training regime under the respected American coach,
Paul Sterkel; increased motivation after missing the Atlanta Games,
and to the lift provided by a new body suit.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of suits, which along with de Bruijn have
been the most pressing and polarizing poolside topic this year,
will be worn by the vast majority of competitors in Sydney. One
exception could be Aleksandr Popov, the most successful men's
Olympic swimmer of the 1990s. Popov, a Russian who trains with Klim
in Australia under coach Gennadi Touretsky, became the first man to
sweep the 50-meter and 100-meter freestyle in consecutive Olympic
Games when he defended both titles in Atlanta. After losing races
and his aura of dominance last year, he has roared back this season
to break the world record in the 50-meter freestyle and threaten
his own world record in the 100-meter. He will be the favorite in
both events in Sydney and has said that he plans to compete in his
own skin here, not a high-tech suit.
</P>
<P>
   Popov should be pushed very hard in the 50-meter by Americans
Anthony Ervin and Gary Hall Jr. And in the 100-meter, Popov will
face Klim and Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands, who won
six gold medals at last year's European championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the hardest meet of my life,'' said Popov, who at
28 plans to make it his last Olympic meet.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight is still considered an advanced age for a swimming
star, but age is no longer the same barrier it once was. Dara
Torres, 33, became the oldest woman to qualify for the American
swim team after an improbable comeback, which came after a
seven-year layoff. She will compete with de Bruijn in three
individual events.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the age spectrum is 16-year-old Megan Quann,
an American who has every intention of ending world-record holder
Penny Heyns' Olympic reign in the 100-meter breaststroke. This
should be one of many duels to remember in the Sydney Aquatic
Centre, the 17,500-seat arena that will be sold out for every
session.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that in our country we are way down the
ladder of popularity,'' said Tom Dolan, an American who is the
world-record holder in the 400-meter individual medley. ``So it's
fun to come here and read the papers and see that swimming is not
only on the cover of the sports section, but on the cover of the
paper. It's helped us to get motivated.'' &QL;

 &HT;    FOREIGN JOURNAL: TODAY'S RUSSIA NO SUPERPOWER, BUT PATRIOTISM
REIGNS
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 17 
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In recent months, while terrorist bombs exploded in the
heart of the capital and more than 100 sailors perished in a
nuclear submarine accident, many Russians retreated to the dim
safety of their local cinemas to watch the country's most popular
summer movie _ a slick shoot-em-up that features good-guy Russians
venturing to America to avenge a comrade's death.
</P>
<P>
   Many of my Russian friends adore the film, ``Brat 2,'' for its
thumping soundtrack. But what they especially love is the climax of
a fight scene on the streets of Chicago. The only American left
standing asks fearfully, ``Are you all gangsters?'' In reply, one
of the stars of the Russian-made film deadpans: ``No, we're
Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   While signs of Russia's deteriorating condition pile on one
another with alarming frequency _ if it's not the Kursk submarine
disaster, it's the army's shellacking in Chechnya, the country's
decrepit roads or the alarming drop in life span due to poverty and
alcoholism _ patriotism is on the rise here.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not their grandfather's patriotism. In place of the
infamous Cold War superpower boast that ``We will bury you,''
today's slogan might more aptly be: ``We haven't been buried yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the young generation of Russians born after the Cold War
views the Soviet past like a fairy tale. Their adulation in today's
Russia is reserved not for generals and cosmonauts, but for
home-grown rock stars and athletes such as Murat Safin, who
recently won the U.S. Open tennis tournament. But, they are as
proud of their country as their elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been practicing democracy longer than we have, so you
have a better standard of living. But we have things you don't. We
have 1,000 years of history and literature,'' 15-year-old Nikita
Volkov told me when I asked him in the chatter-filled hallway of
Moscow Public School No. 57 what he loved about his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is the biggest and richest country in the world,'' is a
favorite saying of my friend Andrei Kazakov, who comes from a
distinguished military family that traces its roots to the glorious
battle in 1812 when the Russian army decimated Napoleon's forces at
Moscow's doorstep and forced the French emperor's retreat. One of
Andrei's proudest possessions is his grandfather's Order of Lenin
decoration, the highest military honor bestowed on World War II
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gold, we have diamonds, we have oil. We have the most
beautiful landscape. We have the highest standards of education and
the best mathematical minds. We should be number one,'' Andrei
says.
</P>
<P>
   For Andrei, those words are not bragging or a sign of Russian
expansionist designs on the West. They are a simple statement of
fact. But do they mean that he thinks Russia is still a superpower?
The answer is an unequivocal ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   What the government thinks about Russia's role in the world,
however, is more murky.
</P>
<P>
   During the rare times the question about the country's
superpower status has been raised on a national level, ministers,
educators and commentators have run into a problem. While the
country's image has changed among Russians since the end of the
Cold War, the lexicon to describe national pride remains stuck in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Just the word ``patriotism'' in Russian is soaked in military
nuance and wrapped in a nostalgic respect for a past where millions
of their countrymen sacrificed their lives and millions more were
killed in the name of furthering Soviet goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patriotism is a cliche for army victories. All our national
holidays except New Year's Eve commemorate a military battle,''
said Yevgeny Bunimovich, the Moscow City legislator in charge of
education and culture. ``Our views of ourselves have evolved, but
we don't have a consensus on how to describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin himself exhibits a split personality on
the issue. Much of his public rhetoric suggests that Russia remains
capable using its military to play a Soviet-era global role. He's
continued to insist on Russia's seat at meetings of the G-8, where
leaders of the world's leading industrialized nations gather. Yet
Russia's economy is only as big as that of Belgium, a non-member.
</P>
<P>
   Putin even signed a decree ordering mandatory classes this year
where ``national pride'' and ``defense of the Fatherland'' are
taught _ classes that harken back to Soviet times where children
had compulsory lessons on how to assemble a Kalashnikov rifle and
march in drill formation. However, the president did not offer a
definition about what he thinks patriotism means, or how exactly
the curriculum should be altered.
</P>
<P>
   With confusion at the top, many Russians agree with Andrei's
views of what national pride should be.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Brat 2,'' the literature-quoting, gun-toting characters are
hard-drinking ladies men who never give up and never leave one of
their own behind. In other words, they're ``muzhiki,'' or real men.
</P>
<P>
   For Boris Davidovich, the vice principal at Moscow's Public
School No. 57, this code _ minus the drinking, of course _ seems a
decent one to raise his kids by. Putin's decree, he says, is
ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't teach patriotism by standing up in front of a flag
every morning and singing the national anthem. Even if you could,
in Russia it's impossible. Our national anthem doesn't have
words,'' said a laughing gray-bearded Davidovich, who has been
teaching math for close to 30 years at this high school just a
short walk from the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``To instill respect for your country, you have to have respect
for yourself. You have to understand what friendship means. That's
what I try to teach. The government doesn't understand that, but
they don't have any control over us and our ideology anymore,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For kids like Nikita, the answer to whether Russia can regain
its superpower status is easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These adults don't understand us,'' he said. ``Wait until we
get a little older. We'll start to run the show, and then you
watch. You won't know Russia anymore.''

`INTO THE ARMS OF STRANGERS': THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS IN THE
WORST OF TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years _ perhaps the turning point was ``Schindler's
List'' _ films about the Holocaust have undergone a noticeable
change in tone toward a redemptive, even hopeful reckoning with
historical catastrophe. The change has been especially evident in
documentaries about the period. Claude Lanzmann's ``Shoah''
confronted viewers with the vast, unfathomable horror of genocide,
emphasized the indifference and complicity of European gentiles, a
theme further explored in Marcel Ophuls' ``Hotel Terminus'' and
``The Sorrow and the Pity.'' Lately the emphasis has shifted to
stories of survival, and testimonials to the courage of those who
tried to protect European Jews from the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Having faced the worst evil that human beings are capable of, it
has seemed necessary to pay compensatory attention to the
persistence of kindness, bravery and resilience in monstrous
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Into the Arms of Strangers,'' a new documentary by Mark
Jonathan Harris, tells the story of a group of Jewish children from
Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia who were fortunate enough to
escape, thanks to the Kindertransport, which took 10,000 children
to the safety of England in the late 1930s. (The United States
government, which could have sponsored a similar program, declined
to do so.)
</P>
<P>
   This film is something of a companion piece to Lisa Gossels'
``Children of Chabannes,'' which opened in June, though Harris
dwells more on the emotions of the rescued than on the motives of
the rescuers. Although it is being released theatrically, ``Into
the Arms of Strangers'' seems more suited to HBO or PBS, since it
follows the standard rhythms of television documentary, rotating
among archival film clips and photographs, discreet re-enactments
and talking-head interviews, all of them held together by Lee
Holdridge's restrained, evocative score and Judi Dench's voice-over
narration.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the broad historical context is well enough known,
the film concentrates on individual stories. Most of the interviews
are with the children, now mostly in their 70s, who recall the
overwhelming facts of their childhoods with simple dignity and
heart-rending power.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen kinder, their cheeks creased and their hair mostly gray,
recount their happy, generally privileged upbringings before Hitler
came to power, and then describe the agony of leaving their
parents, the strangeness of England and the tragic aftermath of the
war as they tried to rejoin the parents who had had to send them
away. Most now live in England and the United States, but they
still speak in the fading accents of Central Europe. To see
black-and-white pictures of their smiling, smooth faces is to feel
the mystifying weight of history and also to sense its bewildering
speed. These people come from a different world, but they are also
immediately recognizable; they're people we know, even if we can't
ever comprehend what they've been through.
</P>
<P>
   But every story helps us comprehend a little more. Each one is
different, of course, but Harris' subjects have in common a
remarkable candor and humor, even when revisiting unbearably
painful moments. Kurt Fuchel, born in Vienna and sheltered by a
Jewish family in Norwich, has a cherubic face and bubbly demeanor
that make his tears when he speaks of his love for his foster
parents all the more affecting.
</P>
<P>
   The writer Lore Segal, whose novel ``Other People's Houses'' is
based on her life in a series of English foster homes, regards her
uprooted youth, from the fiction-writer's perspective, as a kind of
gift. Other survivors speak with fulfillment and pride of their
children and grandchildren, their professional lives and their
social activism.
</P>
<P>
   One senses that they are still amazed by their good fortune.
While nobody talks of survivor's guilt, they clearly share a sense
of responsibility, knowing how many of their friends, family
members and contemporaries did not survive. Their participation in
this project is an expression of this sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The film's affirmation of survival is offered in full awareness
of the alternatives. The most devastating testimony comes from Lory
Cahn, whose father, unable to part with his beloved daughter,
pulled her from the window of the train as it left the platform in
Hamburg. She ended up, a few years later, on another train, to
Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Into the Arms of Strangers'' was produced with the help of the
Holocaust Museum in Washington; it is a valuable, if necessarily
fragmented, part of that institution's attempt to convey the
enormity of what the Nazis did one life at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Into the Arms of Strangers'' is rated PG (Parental guidance
suggested). Its subject matter is intrinsically upsetting.

CHINA'S WEB WORLD SHRINKS AS SOHU.COM PURCHASES RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ One of China's leading Internet companies
announced the purchase of a smaller rival Thursday, setting the
stage for what is expected to be a sweeping consolidation of
China's fledgling Internet industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sohu.com, which went public on the Nasdaq market in July, said
it would buy ChinaRen.com for 4.4 million shares, or about 12.5
percent of Sohu.com's outstanding shares. The deal values
ChinaRen.com, an operator of information and e-commerce web sites
popular among Chinese college students, at about $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   China's Internet industry, jammed with thousands of
under-funded, money-losing Web sites, has been surviving largely on
foreign investment capital since the industry appeared almost
overnight about two years ago. But that money has become
increasingly scarce since Western investor appetite for Internet
companies ebbed suddenly earlier this year. China does not yet
allow start-up companies to sell shares to its public, and
regulatory obstacles have kept all but four major Chinese Internet
content providers from going public abroad.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many Chinese Internet companies are running near
empty. Some smaller companies have already closed their doors. The
rest have begun a mad scramble to find shelter with the few
companies that were able to accumulate cash while the investment
dollars were flowing. Sohu.com is one.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists say the consolidation, while occurring
earlier than expected in the industry's development, is healthy
because few of China's Internet companies have innovative
technology or original business plans that give them a competitive
edge in the global industry. Instead, China's Internet industry is
all about size: With so little differentiation between companies,
only a few big players are likely to attract enough traffic to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Sohu.com's purchase of China.Ren.com gives it the largest
audience of Internet users of any Chinese Internet company. By
Sohu.com's count, its sites will have 44 million page views a day
and 7.8 million registered users. Independent tallies put the
number of users closer to 4.5 million, but that is still more than
either of the company's next closest rivals, Netease.com and
Sina.com, both of which are listed on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   China has about 17 million Internet users, though that number is
climbing daily and could increase fivefold by 2003, the year that
Sohu.com expects to start turning a profit.
</P>
<P>
   With Sohu.com now clearly in the lead, rivals Netease.com and
Sina.com are expected to announce similar acquisitions soon.
Neither company could be reached for comment, but both are believed
to have looked at ChinaRen.com, which received bids from other
prospective buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will definitely prompt these other companies to rethink
their acquisition strategies,'' said Sohu.com's chief executive,
Charles Wang, speaking by telephone from Beijing. ``Things will
happen at an accelerated speed.''

   Wang met ChinaRen.com's founder, Joseph Chen, when they were
both students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He said
he first approached Chen about a merger earlier this year, but the
two couldn't agree on the valuations of their respective companies.
When they spoke again after Sohu.com's public offering, the company
was sitting on $80 million in cash and ChinaRen.com was reportedly
running short of funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides got more realistic,'' Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was still possible for us to go it on our own, but there
were many elements that were uncertain,'' Chen said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies' web sites will continue operating after the
merger, but will share some features and link users between the
two. Wang said the company will stop promoting ChinaRen.com,
however. He said the merger would not affect the company's
timetable for profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Chen will stay on as head of Sohu.com's strategic planning and
both men said there may be more acquisitions in the future. Because
the currency of the deal is stock, Sohu.com still has plenty of
cash for shopping.

`DUETS': HARK, HERALD ANGELS SING! OR IS IT KARAOKE DUETS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Most bad movies _ and there is no shortage _ are content to
amble along the well-trodden path of mediocrity hoping, at best, to
remind their audiences of other, better pictures. About such movies
there is little to say. But every so often a movie comes along
that's bad in such original and unexpected ways that it inspires an
almost admiring fascination. You leave the theater in a state of
amazement, and say to yourself, ``Well, I've certainly never seen
anything like that before,'' a response that's not unrelated to the
thrill you feel after having seen something truly wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duets,'' Bruce Paltrow's new musical, which features his
daughter, Gwyneth, in its impressive ensemble cast, is such a
movie. It's not quite ``Ishtar'' or ``Showgirls'' _ it lacks both
the perverse integrity and the epic ambition that made those films
touchstones of bad movie sublimity _ but it will probably, as those
films have, inspire a devoted video cult. Best to see it now _ I
can't imagine you'll have much time _ and reserve yourself a
charter membership.
</P>
<P>
   How can you resist seeing Paltrow, in a pink outfit that looks
as if it was stitched together out of old ladies' bathing caps,
singing ``Bette Davis Eyes''? Or Huey Lewis doing Joe Cocker?
</P>
<P>
   The film explores an odd, out-of-the-way subculture: the world
of die-hard, competitive karaoke enthusiasts who, if John Byrum's
script is to be believed, travel across the country from bar to
bar, belting out the pop hits of yesteryear for prize money and for
the thrill, as one character puts it, of being ``a star for three
minutes.'' Karaoke is no mere drunken pastime, but rather, we're
repeatedly told, ``a way of life.'' For the purposes of this movie,
it's a way of life that unites six unhappy people, who make their
errant way to Omaha, Neb., lured by the promise of glory and a
$5,000 purse.
</P>
<P>
   Their chance pairings _ the duets of the title _ have a
carefully arranged unlikeliness. A saintly Cincinnati cabdriver
(Scott Speedman) is thrown together with a steely, manic
ex-waitress (Maria Bello) who has the voice of an angel and who
dispenses sexual favors the way other people use credit cards.
Meanwhile, a sleazy karaoke hustler (Huey Lewis) is reluctantly
reunited with his daughter, a third-generation Vegas showgirl (
Paltrow) with the speech patterns of a 12-year-old and the voice of
an angel.
</P>
<P>
   The odd couple whose adventures merit the most screen time
consists of a miserable sales executive (Paul Giamatti) on the run
from the prison of his empty middle-class life, and an ex-convict
(Andre Braugher) with the voice of . . . but you get the idea. (All
the actors, with the exception of Braugher, do their own angelic
singing. Bello, it must be said, does a mean Annie Lennox.)
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the release of ``Duets'' was held up by a dispute
between Paltrow and Disney about how it should be edited, and the
argument seems to have been settled with a blunt ax and a staple
gun. Lacking any narrative rhythm, the film flops around like a
carp on the kitchen floor, jumping from scene to scene, from
musical number to emotional confrontation, before you can figure
out what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   Still, its chaotic sprawl yields some moments of indelible
brilliance. ``You have these hidden corners,'' the
downward-spiraling salesman cackles to his solemn jailbird friend,
and so does the film. It intermittently reveals a dimension of
loneliness and vulnerability in the lives of its characters, and
suggests that their desperate drift is the symptom of a larger
cultural disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Giamatti's character spends the early part of the movie
wandering in a fugue state through a landscape of indistinguishable
hotels and airports, and when he falls into karaoke his inchoate
sadness turns into a vivid, life-affirming rage. Giammati, who has
won admiration in a series of comic character parts, careers
through ``Duets'' like the Tasmanian devil in the Warner Brothers'
cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   At its best _ in Giamatti's performance and in some of Lewis'
early scenes _ the movie has a tang of gamy alienation that recalls
the downbeat, existential black comedies of the early '70s.
Unfortunately, the maudlin habits Paltrow acquired working on
dramatic television series like ``The White Shadow'' and ``St.
Elsewhere'' wreck the film's tough, satiric possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The tearful, conflict-resolving speeches _ in which people say
things like ``You feel sorry for me? Well I feel sorry for you.'';
``you're right, I am the loser'' and so forth _ arrive punctually,
as if timed around commercial breaks. Relationships that had seemed
risky and interesting collapse into conventional sentiment.
Braugher, it turns out, has been cast in the role of sacrificial
black man, whose job is to assist in the spiritual education of his
privileged white companion. All credit to this fine actor for
bringing a measure of wit and dignity to this hoariest of
liberal-racist Hollywood archetypes.
</P>
<P>
   After a bizarre climax _ involving a shoot-out and an a cappella
version of ``Free Bird'' _ the characters (or do I mean the cast?)
wander around looking dazed, as if blinking through the haze of a
severe collective hangover and trying to remember just what
happened the night before. As I stumbled out of the theater, I had
a similar sensation _ not an altogether unpleasant one, I must
admit. We could use more bad movies like this.
</P>
<P>
   Duets is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult
guardian). It includes brief nudity, sexual references, gunplay and
the brutal murder of two classic Motown songs.

WRITING ON THE WALL, AND ON THE SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By image-obsessed Western standards, one picture is
worth, absolute minimum, a thousand paltry words. But in China,
where words are images, writing has traditionally been the highest
art form of all, and a source of profound political and emotional
power.
</P>
<P>
   To see this power art in action, check out ``The Embodied Image:
Chinese Calligraphy From the John B. Elliott Collection,'' the
grand survey of calligraphic material that opens Friday at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art here. Head straight to the middle of the
show, the long room in the Chinese painting galleries devoted to
the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). Look around, and just see what you
see.
</P>
<P>
   What you won't see are landscapes or still lifes or figure
paintings, at least not more than a few. In their place are dozens
of scrolls, vertical and horizontal, covered with handwritten
words, that collectively suggest a gathering of vivid personalities
and radiate the equivalent of cocktail party conversational buzz.
</P>
<P>
   A smallish hand scroll with a fastidious ink-and-brush script,
for example, brings to mind visions of an uptight court
functionary. A larger scroll with gangly, tumbling-about
characters, seems self-confident, and very ``on,'' maybe a little
high on something. A hanging scroll in the corner, with columns of
loops and smears, seems to be giving off agitated vibes. You can
almost hear the mutterings of righteous defiance and dashed hope in
a voice veering out of control.
</P>
<P>
   One can project meanings on practically anything of course. But
control _ as in, you need to have it to lose it _ really is the
binding ingredient in this extraordinary visual talk-a-thon. Almost
every specimen here is the product of arduous training. Each
written character is infused with the energy of generations of
writers physically shaping language to gain personal fame, to link
up with the past and above all to say what they want to say.
</P>
<P>
   What they say must remain somewhat conjectural to anyone who
doesn't read Chinese _ the Met supplies translations for only a few
of the texts _ which is why viewers are often encouraged to think
of calligraphy primarily in formal terms, as a kind of Asian
version of American postwar ``action painting,'' in which the
artist's stroke was assumed to reveal his psyche. If this analogy
gets you into the calligraphic groove, great. While you're there,
go back to the show's opening gallery for a chronological view of
how this phenomenon came to be.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with ritual inscriptions going back to the Shang
dynasty (16th to 11th centuries B.C.) writing seems to have been a
tool of social dominance in the hands of an elite. After the
invention of paper the ancient seal and clerical scripts were
joined by styles known as running and cursive, which caught the
movement of the individual hand. The emphasis on touch brought
strict standards of virtuosity, and writing as art was born,
replete with an exclusionary mystique, a market, a
still-flourishing trade in forgeries and a lineage of geniuses.
</P>
<P>
   The first and most enduring of these was Wang Xizhi (A.D.
303-361), routinely referred to in textbooks as one of the most
influential Chinese artist who ever lived. The running script he
developed, poised but springy and personable, provided a template
for most of what followed. Writers defined themselves as much by
rejecting his example as by adhering to it, and his ``Preface to
the Orchid Pavilion'' was endlessly copied.
</P>
<P>
   None of his original works are known to survive. His writing
does, in the form of ink rubbings lifted from stones, and a tiny
number of paper tracings, one of which is a centerpiece of the
show. Titled ``Ritual to Pray for Good Harvest,'' it's just a scrap
of a letter mounted on a scroll, but it has the aura of a relic.
Seals of owners and admirers float over its surface. The two
columns of Wang's traced script are flanked by proprietary comments
by one long-winded emperor and the renowned Ming artist Dong
Qichang. The work itself is now part of the John B. Elliott
collection at Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   If Wang was the canonized founder of the classical writing
tradition, it reached an aesthetic peak in the Song dynasty
(960-1279). Entries from this period _ an exquisite transcription
of a Buddhist sutras, a fan inscribed with a poem by the emperor
Gaozong, masterpiece hand scrolls _ are the exhibition's high
points.
</P>
<P>
   The inventive artist Huang Tingjian is represented by two superb
scrolls. In one he kvetches about his health _ his stomach aches,
his feet hurt _ though the quavers in his ink strokes are the
result of his adamant brush technique rather than infirmity. In the
other, ``Biographies of Lian Pou and Lin Xiangru,'' he works in a
fleet, airy, improvisatory style known as ``wild cursive,''
inspired by a famous eighth-century model by the monk-artist Huaisu
that Huang actually saw early in his career, and which traveled to
the Met two years ago in ``Splendors of Imperial China.''
</P>
<P>
   The other luminary here is Mi Fu, a live-wire artist and
antiquarian referred to as Crazy Mi in his day. Examples of his
writing are rare, and the Met owns a gem in ``Poem Written in a
Boat on the Wu River,'' an autobiographical travelogue enlivened by
calligraphic special effects.
</P>
<P>
   The narrative bops along in jazzy, syncopated cursive rhythms up
to the point where Mi's boat runs aground, and he hires a gang of
laborers to haul it back to deep water. He compares the shout they
give, when they finally dislodge it, to a battle cry, and he turns
the character for battle into a space-clearing wiry snarl that
punctuates the text like a Roy Lichtenstein ``Blam!''
</P>
<P>
   Although both Huang and Mi played daringly with the sacrosanct
Wang model, orthodoxy reasserted itself during the the Yuan dynasty
(1260-1368) in the person of Zhao Mengfu, an artist who ended up
having almost as much long-term clout as Wang himself.
</P>
<P>
   Zhao arrived at a tense moment. China was under Mongol rule.
Many artists, adhering to a Confucian ethos of imperial loyalty,
retreated from public view. Zhao, who was related to the defeated
Song royal family, chose to work for his new overlords, which
infuriated many of his peers but did wonders for the continuing
history of Chinese art.
</P>
<P>
   He represented an ideal version of the art-for-art's-sake
scholar-painter, and different facets of his complex achievements
and personality flash out in the show. His transcription of a
monastic history is an official document, meant to be copied as a
stele carving. It's written in a stately version of standard script
created by Zhao and adopted by the Yuan court as its house style.
</P>
<P>
   Another scroll nearby finds him in the role of art historian
with a retelling of anecdotes from the life of Wang Xizhi that
affectionately channel that master's spirit. In a private letter to
his Buddhist spiritual adviser, Zhao writes in a tremulous hand
about his crushing grief at his wife's death. Together, these
documents do more than flesh out a brilliant career; they suggest
the public and private ends to which calligraphy can be turned.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   In the adjoining gallery that Ming party is still in full swing.
Like many fledgling dynasties, the Ming asserted political
legitimacy by supporting time-honored tradition, and it was very
calligraphy-friendly at first. But this was a hybrid, promiscuous
age, much like our own. Social and cultural categories were
blurring, art of all kinds was in circulation, from high-polish
dandified fluff to agitprop.
</P>
<P>
   Political discontent gained force with the rise of the Qing
dynasty (1644-1912), and one senses it in a hanging scroll by the
Ming loyalist Fu Shan. A doctor by profession, he refused to deal
with the Manchu government and, as a ``left-over citizen,'' he
donned the robes of a Daoist priest. His ``Poem on the Heavenly
Emperor,'' done in ink on satin, suggests a fantastic, neurotic
aria of wishful thinking, incorporating bits and pieces of archaic
script into a baroque play of graphic trills and runs.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out the Manchus adored China, everything about it,
especially its art. The proprietary imperial colophons on ``Ritual
to Pray for Good Harvest'' were written by a Qing emperor, and the
dynasty sponsored extensive archaeological digs to recover ancient
stones and bronzes. As a result archaic scripts had a major
revival, and their presence in the last scrolls that conclude the
show, a few of them produced in the early 20th century, brings the
calligraphic saga full circle.
</P>
<P>
   The story isn't over. True, the repressions of the Cultural
Revolution and the global spread of digital technology have given
calligraphy the status of a left-over art in China today. It is
still practiced in its traditional form, and young, innovative
artists are both deconstructing and, perhaps, reclaiming it, as one
saw in ``Inside Out: New Chinese Art'' at the Asia Society in
Manhattan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Calligraphy was everywhere in that show, though in offbeat
guises. For example Xu Bing, who now lives in New York, cooked up a
customized East-West script through computer programming. Another
emigre in New York, Gu Wenda, ``wrote'' a pseudo-seal script in
strands of human hair. Wu Shan Zhuan, now living in Europe, covered
a room with quotations from classical poetry, Buddhist scripture,
Maoist tracts and advertising, so that competing spiritual and
social orthodoxies canceled one another out. Finally the Beijing
Conceptualist Qiu Zhijie copied Wang's ``Orchid Pavilion Preface''
1,000 times, but on a single sheet of paper, so the hallowed text
ended up a solid mass of black ink.
</P>
<P>
   Their work has little chance of finding its way into a
mainstream survey like ``The Embodied Image,'' which was organized
by Cary Y. Liu and Robert E. Harrist for the Art Museum at
Princeton University last year and has been expanded to twice its
original size in New York by Maxwell K. Hearn, curator of Asian art
at the Met.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the very fact that such art is being made suggests that the
polarities that have propelled calligraphy all along _ conservatism
and innovation, political manipulation and personal expression _
are still in play. This amazing art form may still feel a bit
unapproachable to the Western viewer. Any attempt to get to know it
is well worth the effort, and the Met makes persuasive
introductions in this stimulating icebreaker of a show. &QL;

`GOYA IN BORDEAUX': THE DARK GENIUS OF GOYA AND HIS FIERY
CANVASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the surreal opening sequence of Carlos Saura's visual
knockout of a film, ``Goya in Bordeaux,'' a bull's carcass in a
field of red dirt begins mysteriously to twitch. Gradually stirring
to life, it drags itself across the ground and hangs itself on an
outdoor meat rack that resembles a gallows. As this raw hunk of
flesh and bone is stretched to the breaking point on cables, a
chalky human face begins emerging from its exposed rib cage and is
revealed to be that of the 18th-century Spanish painter Francisco
Goya.
</P>
<P>
   These jarring images, like everything else in the biographical
montage created by a filmmaker renowned for his bold visual flash,
are anything but gratuitous. They forcefully conjure up the spirit
of Goya, who died in exile in Bordeaux (France), portraying him as
an unstoppable bull of a man and an artistic visionary whose
greatest work fearlessly locked horns with the darkest human
truths.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after this spectacular flourish, the movie follows
Goya (Francisco Rabal), who has either returned from the dead or is
in a premonitory limbo, as he rises from his bed in a nightshirt
and dazedly stumbles through a ghostly corridor that leads him into
the streets of Bordeaux. The very next scene finds him back in bed
attended by his adoring and worried young daughter Rosario (Dafne
Fernandez), to whom he recounts his life and times in passionate
feverish bursts.
</P>
<P>
   The life he evokes is a gorgeous, sensuously pulsating montage
of mental pictures in which the 82-year-old artist looks back, and
ruminates brusquely, on love, art, history, politics and the
sadness of the human condition. (Humans are worse than animals, he
declares, because they're aware of the harm they're doing.)
</P>
<P>
   As the movie goes along, it becomes a fitful dialogue between
the ailing octogenarian and his younger, mid-'40s self (Jose
Coronado). It was at that age that Goya nearly died from a
mysterious illness that left him permanently deaf and prone to
excruciating headaches. His recovery coincided with an artistic
turning point that found him embracing rougher, more realistic
subject matter, culminating with his unblinkingly horrific series
of engravings, ``The Disasters of War.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not meant disparagingly to describe ``Goya in Bordeaux'' as
a movie so ferociously red-blooded that at moments it threatens to
slop off the screen. In such earlier films as ``Flamenco'' and
``Tango,'' Saura and his brilliant collaborator, the
cinematographer and lighting genius Vittorio Storaro, became so
intoxicated with their subjects that they splashed their visual
ideas on the screen as though they were throwing buckets of paint.
``Goya in Bordeaux'' explodes with the same sense of unbounded (and
occasionally repetitious) visual exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the film's tableaus are staged re-creations of
well-known Goya paintings. In one stunning visual coup, a painting
of Goya's greatest love, the fiery Duchess of Alba, flashing what
seems to be the evil eye, comes alive and turns into an angel of
death, casting an ominous shadow that creeps across Goya's face
until he musters enough strength to cast off her spirit. Maribel
Verdu, a charismatic actress who radiates danger and a wild,
hot-blooded sensuality, plays the Duchess who, Goya confides to his
daughter, was poisoned to death by the jealous Spanish queen, Maria
Luisa, in cahoots with the royal secretary Godoy (Jose Maria Pou),
who was the lover of both women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goya in Bordeaux'' tosses together fragments of history,
fantasy, biography, gossip and art appreciation into a blend that,
despite a lack of narrative drive, coheres through the sheer
vividness of its imagery and the bluntness of its dialogue. But
there are moments, especially near the end, when the film seriously
overreaches.
</P>
<P>
   In the most ambitious and problematic sequence, the Catalan
action-theater group La Fura dels Baus re-enacts the 17 engravings
that comprise ``The Disasters of War'' as an extended dramatic
pantomime while Roque Banos' film score strains to evoke the kind
of epic tragedy expressed in a Shostakovich symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Although the actors in horror movie makeup strike the right
visual poses, the troupe's lack of acting skill undercuts the
emotional force of Goya's imagery, and the effort conveys the
clumsy earnestness of an elaborately produced high school pageant.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ There are more than 100 municipal pools in
this sprawling city where Dawn Fraser and Ian Thorpe learned how to
swim astonishingly fast. On any given day in any season, you can
find someone doing laps with a sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Head to Bondi Beach in the winter where members of the Iceberg
Club ignore their chattering teeth and plunge in a seaside
saltwater pool. Head to an aquatics center in late summer when
hordes of teen-agers covered in colorful grease paint race in
school carnivals that resemble fraternity initiation rites.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on Saturday, though, all eyes will be on just one pool
in Sydney: The Olympic pool at Homebush Bay. If the pundits are
correct, the thousands watching in person and the millions viewing
around the world could be treated to the most compelling swim meet
in memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly looks that way,'' said Michael Klim, one of
several Australians hoping to win gold medals over the next eight
days.
</P>
<P>
   No nation is more passionate about competitive swimming than
Australia, where the majority of people live within a short drive
of the ocean. Nearly all Australians learn to swim early and those
who excel receive considerable positive reinforcement from a
society where the best swimmers are in the spotlight every year,
not just every four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say that Australia is like swimming heaven,'' said
Jenny Thompson, an American who has trained here extensively in the
last year. ``Because I think it's the country that gives the most
respect to the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The Australians, led by the otherworldly 17-year-old Thorpe and
the veteran Susie O'Neill, appear to have their strongest Olympic
team since 1956, when the team featuring Fraser and Murray Rose
took full advantage of the home-pool advantage to win 8 of the 12
gold medals contested in Melbourne. This time, the Australians are
clear favorites in seven events, but the program has expanded
greatly in 44 years, which means that there are now 25 events in
which they are not clear favorites.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian men should challenge the American men and the
remarkable backstroker Lenny Krayzelburg for medal supremacy, but
the Australian women are merely one element in a balanced field.
Female swimmers from Japan could win three individual gold medals
and Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands could win three all by
herself in the 50-meter and 100-meter freestyle and 100-meter
butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in for one of the most exciting Olympics in
history, because it's going to be a world competition; it seems to
me about nine or 10 countries have a chance to win Olympic gold,''
said the American women's coach, Richard Quick. Only two of the
American women swimmers _ Brooke Bennett in the 800-meter freestyle
and Megan Quann in the 100-meter breaststroke _ have the year's
fastest time in their events.
</P>
<P>
   At 27, de Bruijn already has broken world records eight times
this year and displaced Thompson as the favorite in the 100-meter
freestyle and 100-meter butterfly. But her stunning times,
remarkable for both their quality and quantity, have been greeted
with skepticism by competitors in a sport where systematic doping
by East German swimmers in the 1970s and 1980s and by the Chinese
in the 1990s contributed to a climate of perpetual suspicion
regarding excellence.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Michelle Smith further poisoned the atmosphere.
Smith, an Irish swimmer who like de Bruijn did not peak until her
mid-20s, won three gold medals in the Atlanta Olympics in 1996.
Smith has since been banned from the sport for four years for
manipulating a urine sample.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, O'Neill, the veteran Australian swimmer,
called de Bruijn's records ``pretty suss,'' slang for suspect and
then sent de Bruijn an apologetic e-mail message. De Bruijn has
denied cheating, attributing her huge improvements to several
factors: A new training regime under the respected American coach,
Paul Sterkel; increased motivation after missing the Atlanta Games,
and to the lift provided by a new body suit.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of suits, which along with de Bruijn have
been the most pressing and polarizing poolside topic this year,
will be worn by the vast majority of competitors in Sydney. One
exception could be Aleksandr Popov, the most successful men's
Olympic swimmer of the 1990s. Popov, a Russian who trains with Klim
in Australia under coach Gennadi Touretsky, became the first man to
sweep the 50-meter and 100-meter freestyle in consecutive Olympic
Games when he defended both titles in Atlanta. After losing races
and his aura of dominance last year, he has roared back this season
to break the world record in the 50-meter freestyle and threaten
his own world record in the 100-meter. He will be the favorite in
both events in Sydney and has said that he plans to compete in his
own skin here, not a high-tech suit.
</P>
<P>
   Popov should be pushed very hard in the 50-meter by Americans
Anthony Ervin and Gary Hall Jr. And in the 100-meter, Popov will
face Klim and Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands, who won
six gold medals at last year's European championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the hardest meet of my life,'' said Popov, who at
28 plans to make it his last Olympic meet.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight is still considered an advanced age for a swimming
star, but age is no longer the same barrier it once was. Dara
Torres, 33, became the oldest woman to qualify for the American
swim team after an improbable comeback, which came after a
seven-year layoff. She will compete with de Bruijn in three
individual events.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the age spectrum is 16-year-old Megan Quann,
an American who has every intention of ending world-record holder
Penny Heyns' Olympic reign in the 100-meter breaststroke. This
should be one of many duels to remember in the Sydney Aquatic
Centre, the 17,500-seat arena that will be sold out for every
session.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that in our country we are way down the
ladder of popularity,'' said Tom Dolan, an American who is the
world-record holder in the 400-meter individual medley. ``So it's
fun to come here and read the papers and see that swimming is not
only on the cover of the sports section, but on the cover of the
paper. It's helped us to get motivated.'' &QL;

   SYDNEY, Australia _ The sun is setting on fading empires.
Gerontocracies are going out of style. The Olympic movement is
starting to resemble the Soviet Union in its final days, just
before people attacked the Berlin Wall with sledgehammers. In this
case, the cracks are appearing from within.
</P>
<P>
   The newest set of Summer Games are beginning this weekend,
following an opening ceremony both touching and spectacular. But
there are a lot of extravaganzas in the world, a lot of sporting
jamborees, and there is no guarantee that people are going to buy
this retro act much longer.
</P>
<P>
   The world is getting smaller. The Sydney Morning Herald this
week ran photographs of Darryl Strawberry and the Monday night
football game.
</P>
<P>
   To love the Olympics for the next two weeks, you have to go
along with the program _ gold medals, old-fashioned amateur sport,
sound mind and sound body, fair play. The old ideals don't work
with the world snickering in the background.
</P>
<P>
   It is the sadness of Juan Antonio Samaranch that he stayed on
too long. He knows it. The look of weariness is on his face. He no
longer makes any pretense at having fun with this business. It's
over. The real question is where the International Olympic
Committee goes from here. Can it hold Games in Athens in 2004 and
in some undesignated city in 2008 with the guaranteed full
obeisance of the host city? Those days may be over.
</P>
<P>
   Before the first shuttlecock is fired in anger here, the powers
that be have already spent a week that would have embarrassed the
average elected public official.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch and his Politburo were seen agitating over missing
brethren, a boxing fixer from Uzbekistan and a basketball officer
from Hong Kong who were denied entry by the Australian government
on the grounds of questionable activities. The IOC also seemed
highly perturbed about the legal troubles of an Indonesian
colleague known for razing the rain forest and supporting an old
dictatorship back home. With friends like these ... as the saying
goes.
</P>
<P>
   It was extremely bad timing for the Olympic movement to have the
next two sets of Games already assigned to cheeky former colonies.
People in Australia generally like to hoot at pomposity, and they
have surely enjoyed watching the IOC fumble around this week.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the ongoing spectacle from Salt Lake City, where
two former big shots are set up to take the hit for the rich
burghers they served. The IOC heavies are furious that documents
from Salt Lake City organizers would be accessible in potential
trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't you just burn everything like our esteemed
colleagues in Nagano did?'' the IOC honchos seemed to be shrieking,
while a few Yanks tried to explain that the laws of the land allow
distribution of evidence. Peculiar place, this America.
</P>
<P>
   It's all going bad. Thursday, Samaranch held his quadrennial
news conference before the opening of the Games. As if the mood
around the IOC were not operatic enough, somebody chose to pipe in
the sounds of Pavarotti singing ``Nessun Dorma'' from Turandot
while the world press awaited the entrance of the dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said little in a few languages, demonstrating all the
blandness of latter-day Soviet Union presidents like Brezhnev,
Andropov, Chernenko.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of the ``enhanced role of women on our executive
board,'' noted the inclusion of contemporary athletes, praised
alleged advances in testing for drugs, alluded to healing gestures
between the two Koreas, between Bosnia and Herzegovina, the
inclusion of athletes from East Timor. He made it all seem so
banal.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody asked if Samaranch planned to go to Salt Lake City in
2002, and he answered: ``If I am invited. I am awaiting an
invitation.'' Lawyers will be on call. The future of the Olympic
movement is in the hands of the U.S. Justice Department. If the
Games survive, the United States won't be the host for a century or
three.
</P>
<P>
   While Samaranch presided over this exercise in ostensible
democracy, he was flanked by younger IOC officials undoubtedly
still hoping for their turn. Have they been tainted by the blatant
associations with hustlers from outposts like Uzbekistan and Salt
Lake City? Quite possibly.
</P>
<P>
   What the IOC may need is to go out and hire a chief executive
officer who knows how to handle money, handle the law, handle the
public, handle the press. It needs a David Stern of the National
Basketball Association, a Dick Ebersol of the National Broadcasting
Co., a David D'Alessandro of the John Hancock Co., just to mention
three skilled and personable Yanks who just might be able to save
the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   There are cracks in the Lausanne Wall. A few more snickers from
the colonies, and the walls come tumbling down.  &QL;

WATCHING MOVIES WITH QUENTIN TARANTINO: WHOA, TRIGGER! AUTEUR
ALERT! 
</HEADLINE>
   This article is the first in a series of discussions with noted
directors, actors, screenwriters and cinematographers. In each
article, one filmmaker will select and discuss a movie that has
personal meaning.  
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The 6-by-8-foot flickering rectangle of light turns
the white wall to amber above Quentin Tarantino's fireplace. Not
far away, back through a Spanish archway, a 16 mm projector rattles
with a persistent click that never quite disappears beneath the
bleating of the soundtrack, like static on a short-wave radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this scene,'' Tarantino says. ``It's a really tough
scene, a tough, tough scene. But it's not the kind of scene you
expect, all right. The emotion is right out there. But if you buy
it, and I totally buy it, then it can make you cry.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the guy who made ear-severing a dance routine, turned
sadomasochistic basement torture into comic relief and created the
where Uma Thurman takes a 6-inch hypodermic in the chest. So when
the director of ``Reservoir Dogs'' and ``Pulp Fiction,'' the
celebrity prototype for an entire generation of Sundance-bred,
film-geek auteurs, tells you that you are about to see a scene that
is tough, you listen to him, don't you?
</P>
<P>
   Roy Rogers is standing off to one side, elegant and stoic, with
that thin, shiny mouth and those exotic eyes. Dale Evans is a few
steps behind him, plump and fretting. A few steps away, the
sheriff's men have Trigger, Rogers' famous stallion, held tightly
on a rope. Trigger bobs his head up and down, shifts from foot to
foot, his preternaturally floppy mane slapping across his forehead.
It doesn't look good for the good guys. Rogers and Trigger have
been found standing next to the body of a villain whose head has
been bashed. We know the horse is innocent, but circumstantial
evidence points to Trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, Roy, circumstantial evidence is enough,'' the
sheriff sadly intones.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Trigger is about to get one between the eyes, right now.
There is no court of appeals for killer horses. The screen is
suddenly filled with the face of Rogers. Somehow, fear, regret and
calculation all begin to wash out of his eyes even though his face
doesn't move a muscle. He drops his head, a decision made. ``Wait,
Sheriff,'' Rogers says, and then confesses to the killing. ``Roy,
don't you know what you're doing?'' Dale whimpers. He knows. He's
saving his best friend from a bullet, even if it means several
years on a chain gang for him.
</P>
<P>
   Tarantino leans forward and rests his elbows on his lanky legs,
his face riveted to the flickering image on his living room wall
where ``The Golden Stallion'' is playing. He says the film is one
of the three or four masterpieces of a now all-but-forgotten
journeyman director named William Witney.
</P>
<P>
   Witney, 85, an Oklahoma native now living in quiet retirement in
rural California, is the sweetest fruit of what Tarantino says has
been a year and a half of gorging on film history and B-grade
filmmakers. Tarantino says he had a suspicion that there were
``forgotten masters'' out there, workaday moviemakers who had
carefully chosen their assignments and then transformed them into
art, but who had been overlooked in the post-auteur critical
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that the only good westerns made in the '40s and
'50s were by John Ford or maybe Howard Hawks,'' Tarantino says.
``Film guys might add, oh, Anthony Mann and Budd Boetticher and
Andre De Toth. But I just had this suspicion that because they
didn't make A-list movies or didn't work with A-list stars, a lot
of really great masters were getting lost in the shuffle.''
</P>
<P>
   So while he was working on the two screenplays that he intends
to begin shooting, one after the other, after the first of the
year, Tarantino says he also indulged his film-scholar fantasies
and dived into the world of the forgotten genre flicks.
</P>
<P>
   Best Horse and Best Friend
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found directors of some of these movies who I'm really
into, but William Witney is ahead of them all, the one whose movies
I can show to anyone and they are just blown away,'' Tarantino
says. ``He makes you accept everything on his terms, and his terms
are that Roy and Trigger are best friends. Trigger is not just his
best horse; he's his best friend. You know, in some movies, a
cowboy might go to jail to save his best friend from being shot
down dead. Well, Trigger is Roy's best friend. It's the easiest
leap to have him do that here, yet it's so powerful and so
unexpected. What's great is that you buy it, you absolutely buy it,
and I don't know that I really would buy it from anybody else but
Roy and Trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind this series of articles is to sit down _ with
accomplished filmmakers or actors or screenwriters or
cinematographers, people who have contributed something to the
history of film _ and simply watch a movie, not one of their own
films, but someone else's, a film that has some special resonance
for them. Perhaps it was a film they saw as a teen-ager, something
that inspired them or has grown mysteriously in their estimation
over the years, or maybe something like this, something they have
stumbled across with shocked delight.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to get some sort of understanding of how film
artists absorb the movies they love, and how those movies have
informed their own work. Instead of just another profile about the
last project or the most recent award or the next big deal, this is
to be about the work.
</P>
<P>
   That's the idea. And so Tarantino, champion of everything from
B-grade 1950s genres to '70s black exploitation to life as a bitter
and ironic cocktail, was asked what he wanted to watch and he said,
``The Golden Stallion,'' a 1949 minifeature from the days of the
Saturday morning cowboy serials, neither bitter nor ironic. Tough?
Quentin Tarantino thinks so. You think you know better?
</P>
<P>
   Jungle Girls to Cowboys
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about William Witney is that he was really a
director of genre movies,'' Tarantino says. ``He started making
serials in the late 1930s, and he made some of the best of them,
from the Dick Tracy ones to Spy Smasher to Jungle Girl. And when
they stopped making serials, he moved over to Saturday morning
cowboy pictures and did pretty much everything Roy Rogers shot
between the late '40s and the early '50s'' _ when Rogers stopped
making movies and shifted to television.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As the lanky Tarantino grows more effusive about his subject, he
also becomes more mobile, pivoting on his hips as he chatters, then
leaping up to pace the room, peppering his long, fast sentences
with earnest expletives like ``all right'' and ``cool.'' The faster
he talks, the faster he walks. The more intricate his sentences,
the more baroque his gestures.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they stopped making Saturday morning cowboy pictures in
the '50s, when Republic Pictures closed down, he moved over and
made juvenile delinquent films, and they are some of the best of
those movies ever made,'' Tarantino says. ``And when they stopped
making those, he moved over and did some rock 'n' roll movies in
the '60s. He flirted with the A list a couple of times, but mostly
he was a guy who moved from one B-list genre to another, all right,
for something like 40 years. And all the while he is churning out
TV shows. He did a ton of `Bonanza' and episodes for almost every
western of the period. And do you know what his last movie was? A
black exploitation flick in the '70s. He ended with `Darktown
Strutters' in 1975, about a female black motorcycle gang. I think
it's so cool that he began as the king of the cowboy serials and he
ended with a black exploitation film. That's a career, man.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for McFarland and Co., which published Witney's 1995
memoirs about his years as a serial director _ ``In a Door, Into a
Fight, Out a Door, Into a Chase'' _ said that Witney had suffered a
stroke a few years ago and was not able to be interviewed, but that
he had been informed about Tarantino's interest in his work.
</P>
<P>
   Common Decency
</P>
<P>
   The rap on Tarantino, 37, is that he doesn't make as many movies
as he should; years and years come between his films. It's been
three years since his most recent, ``Jackie Brown,'' and that one
was a long time coming. This is all just about to change, he
promises. One of his new projects is a tasty little noirish
thriller starring Uma Thurman. ``My fans are gonna love this one,''
he says. ``They've been waiting a long time, and I think they're
really going to happy with it.'' The other is a big, epic World War
II adventure; he is just now trimming and polishing the screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what does this very deliberate filmmaker, who spent a lot of
his time in the last decade trying to generate an acting career,
find to love about a true Hollywood salaryman like William Witney,
who was making five movies a year when ``The Golden Stallion'' came
out?
</P>
<P>
   The flickering image shifts: Rogers is off in prison now. There
was no last-minute reprieve. He had to do his time, and hard time
it was. Not only that, but he also had to watch as Trigger became
the property of the bad guys. And yet he never became bitter.
Tarantino finds it odd that this is so moving to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, I would be drawn to movies where a good-guy Roy
Rogers character becomes corrupted through life,'' Tarantino says,
transfixed on the screen again. ``In one of my movies, this guy
would probably have come out of prison wanting to kill somebody.
And he would kill somebody _ while riding Trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, Roy Rogers seems almost too good, but you buy it
from him somehow. I find myself being moved by his common decency.
Life's events and other people's actions have no effect on him and
his heart. He didn't save Trigger to become a bitter man; he did it
because it was what he had to do. His code is his code. The whole
world can change, and it doesn't change his code.''
</P>
<P>
   A Lost Master
</P>
<P>
   Tarantino first came across Witney's work when he watched an old
print of ``The Bonnie Parker Story'' (1958), a kind of juvenile
delinquent movie set in the Depression, with Dorothy Provine
playing the infamous gangster. ``I was blown away,'' he says, ``It
was like, whoa, who made this? I have to see everything he ever
did.'' And so began the hunt for the half-forgotten works of
Witney. One after another, he found them, watched them and, with
one or two exceptions, found them absolutely riveting, the work of
a real lost master, just what he had been looking for.
</P>
<P>
   He has whittled Witney's oeuvre _ more than 100 films from 1937
to 1975 _ into what he considers to be his four greatest
masterpieces. The earliest is ``The Golden Stallion.'' Then comes
``Stranger at My Door'' (1956), another western, this time with
Macdonald Carey playing a frontier preacher whose homestead is
invaded by a robber on the lam. (``I showed this to a group of
friends, all film people, and it just blew them away,'' Tarantino
says. ``We talked about it for hours afterward.'') Then ``The
Bonnie Parker Story'' and, in 1959, ``Paratroop Command,'' a
realistic World War II adventure about a platoon pariah who has to
prove himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was showing `Paratroop Command' to Peter Bogdanovich one
day, and there comes this moment in the film where he goes, like,
hey, wait a minute, what the heck is happening?,'' Tarantino says.
``These guys, who you've been getting to know throughout the movie,
suddenly start dying. And I don't mean a big, glamorous cinema
death. They're just dropping like flies, unceremoniously. It's so
realistic. You know that it was a movie made by a guy who had been
there. William Witney was in the Marines in World War II for
something like five years.''
</P>
<P>
   The projector is still clicking away, and the wall above the
fireplace is filled with motion. Trigger is running through a broad
valley, the sun backlighting his mane and a team of wild horses
following behind. Dale Evans, in voice-over, is reading a letter
she is writing to Rogers, back on the chain gang. ``I find this so
poetic, so beautiful,'' Tarantino says. ``The letter is beautifully
written, her delivery is great, and these images of the wild horses
are just stunning. Wait, I want to run it back.''
</P>
<P>
   He jumps up and runs back to the projector and rewinds to catch
the last few minutes again.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No Fringe or Sparkle
</P>
<P>
   Appreciating William Witney begins with understanding what he
did with Roy Rogers, Tarantino says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy's movies at this time had turned into these sort of
western musicals, like frontier jamborees, where he's singing and
walking around in outfits with fringes,'' Tarantino says. ``After
their first few movies together, Witney had gotten Roy out of his
fringe-and-sparkle attire and was dressing him in normal attire,
blue jeans and stuff. They stopped being these crazy musicals. He
turned them into rough, tough violent adventures. Audiences loved
it. Nobody had ever seen Roy fight like that, so it was kind of
cool to everyone that he was such a good fistfighter. And a
fistfight in a William Witney movie is a fistfight. They're tough.
People get bloody noses.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarantino says he admires Witney for his rough and believable
action scenes, but also for his taste, as shown in his choice of
assignments over the years. He compares him to Howard Hawks, a
director who spanned genres but managed to bring something of
himself to each of them. ``It shows you how important taste is,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   And there is something unpretentious about the way Witney worked
that appeals to the young director.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a visual stylist, but he's a visual stylist in the way
that a lot of those guys were back then,'' Tarantino says. ``It's
always about moving the camera like `Hey, Mom, look, I'm
directing.' He was clever about camera movement. One of the things
I got from looking at his films is that the camera movements are so
elegant. You have to have made movies for 30 years to be able to
move the camera so unpretentiously. His camera movements, when they
happen, are so cool. They're either completely artful, in a cool,
don't-call-attention-to-yourself kind of way, or they're visually
about how to tell the story. These guys were storytellers. They
knew how to move the camera to convey information so they didn't
have to shoot another dialogue scene to explain something.''
</P>
<P>
   And something else has jumped out at Tarantino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the way he uses Trigger in this film,'' he says.
``William Witney is the greatest director when it comes to working
with animals. In his films, if there's an animal, it's another
character in the movie. If a homesteader has a dog, it's not just
yapping in the background. You get to know this dog; you might even
follow it on its own little adventure in the middle of the movie.
And `Golden Stallion' is his masterpiece when it comes to working
with animals, perhaps because he's working with Trigger, the
greatest animal actor who ever was.''
</P>
<P>
   A Noble Pursuit
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Tarantino says, he hopes Witney has influenced
him in subtle ways, perhaps helping him build his instinct for when
to move the camera and how. He did, while still in the first flush
of admiration for Witney's work, write two animal scenes into his
World War II epic, though he says that the script has grown too
long and byzantine and must be trimmed back and that both of the
animal scenes, sadly, will probably have to go. In one, a refugee
girl hiding in a barn is attacked by rats and saved by a dog; in
the other, a soldier separated from his platoon finds and befriends
a runaway horse. Never to be filmed, he says with a shrug: ``That's
the way it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Has this year in the film-scholar trenches been worth it? These
are, after all, years in which Tarantino could have been making a
lot of money and a lot of films.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very noble pursuit,'' he says. ``I've turned quite a
few friends on to William Witney, so he lives through us, at
least.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy, he knows, to ``get hung up on somebody when you do
something like this,'' and perhaps exaggerate a filmmaker's gifts
or importance. But he has thought about it and really believes that
Witney is the genuine article. So has it been worth it? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, in this business right now, there are a whole lot of
people making movies to pay for their incredibly extravagant
lifestyle,'' he says. ``There's just a whole lot of that going on.
I'm not judging, but that's not why I came here, to make movies to
pay for my pool. I never want to have to do that, and I don't have
to do that. But you know, if you come at this as though it's a
religion, as opposed to a job, then sometimes you have to keep
close to God a little. That's what this last year was. It was my
way of renewing myself.'' &QL;

EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK ENTERS MARKET TO SUPPORT EURO 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The European Central Bank on Thursday took
a baby step toward intervening in world markets on behalf of the
downtrodden euro, using its foreign reserves to buy up $2.5 billion
worth of euros and briefly halting the currency's tailspin against
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, insisted
that the move was little more than a routine portfolio adjustment
and that ``intervening in the market was not part of the motive.''
But currency analysts said the bank was hoping to prop up the
currency, or at least protect it from tumbling even further.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the central bank seems increasingly powerless to
reverse the euro's decline. Since it was introduced in January
1999, the euro has lost nearly one-quarter of its value against the
dollar, falling from $1.17 to about 87 cents. Central bankers and
political leaders have tried to talk up the euro's value, arguing
at every opportunity that the currency's low exchange rate does not
reflect Europe's fundamental economic health. The central bank has
also raised interest rates six times in the last year, also to
little avail.
</P>
<P>
   Intervention in the markets, by selling dollars and buying up
euros, is one of the few tools not yet tried. But most of Europe's
central bankers view intervention as a futile effort, given that
trillions of dollars flow across borders every day. The chances of
success are particularly low given that the United States and Japan
have shown no appetite for joining in an intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some analysts now predict that the euro could slip even
further in the weeks ahead. Jesper Dannesboe, chief
foreign-exchange strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, went so
far as to warn about the risk of a ``panic sell-off'' because many
investment funds are holding euros that they had bought at prices
well above current ones. He predicts the euro will slip as low as
80 cents on the dollar by early next year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The euro's decline is not necessarily all bad _ it has helped
European exporters by making their products more affordable
overseas. It also is making Europe look cheaper than it has in
years to American tourists, who are coming here in hordes and
buying everything from clothing to artwork to take back with them.
But it has also aggravated the worldwide rise in oil prices,
because oil is priced in dollars on world markets, and it is
pushing up the costs of other imports as well.
</P>
<P>
   In its move to buy up euros Thursday, the European Central Bank
said it had simply decided to sell the accumulated interest it had
earned on foreign reserves since it went into operation at the
start of 1999. In itself, the $2.5 billion shift is not enough to
have any lasting effect on currency markets. More aggressive
European economists have argued that the bank should be selling off
some of the reserves themselves, a much more radical move.
</P>
<P>
   The problem confronting the European Central Bank is that,
rightly or wrongly, foreign investors are pouring tens of billions
of dollars into American investments. Much of that is through
mergers and acquisitions, with companies like Deutsche Telekom and
Bertelsmann eager to buy up American companies. In addition,
analysts say that many investment fund managers have accumulated
large volumes of euros on the conviction that the currency was
overdue for a big climb back upward. But since that has not
happened, those fund managers are now under increasing pressure to
sell their euros at the first chance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Duisenberg's insistence that the bank is not intervening
in markets, many traders were convinced that the bank did want to
send the markets a signal. For one thing, it was the first time
that the bank has ever sold off the money it has earned from
foreign investments. Beyond that, the bank took the somewhat
unusual step of announcing the move with a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday following a meeting of the central
bank's governing council, Duisenberg insisted that the move was not
an ``intervention'' but admitted that he was ``not disappointed''
when the euro climbed briefly in response.
</P>
<P>
   Once heavily criticized for suggesting that he practiced
``benign neglect'' when it came to the euro's exchange rate,
Duisenberg went out of his way to declare his unhappiness about the
currency's value and his conviction that it will eventually bounce
back.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that economic growth across the 12-nation euro-zone is
running well above three percent this year, that business
confidence is at record levels and that European inflation is among
the lowest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the euro has continue to depreciate over recent
months is not in line with these economic fundamentals,''
Duisenberg said. ``Our concerns on this issue remain serious and we
shall monitor developments closely.''

`BAIT': FROM PRAWNS TO A PAWN, A THIEF'S BUMBLING JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the running jokes (or what passes for a joke) in the
numbingly incoherent comic action thriller ``Bait'' has to do with
the distinction between prawns and shrimp. You see, when Alvin
Sanders (Jamie Foxx), a paroled thief, and a partner are caught
red-handed stealing $2,000 worth of prawns from a Brooklyn
warehouse, everyone, including the police, insists on calling them
shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin is beside himself that people can't get the difference
straight and points out more than once that prawns are larger than
shrimp. But then, while Alvin may know his way around a fish store,
he isn't the brightest light on the planet. While he is fiercely
denying any involvement in the robbery, an interrogating officer
reaches behind his ear, and what does he find tucked there? Why, a
stray shrimp (oops, prawn), of course. At that moment the jig is
up.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between prawns and shrimp, incidentally, has no
relevance whatsoever to ``Bait'' beyond providing some tedious,
high-pitched verbal filler for its motor-mouthed star. Although
Foxx, his eyes gleaming, tries to pump up such inanities with his
characteristic bleats of mischievous hysteria, not even this
talented comic actor can levitate them.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question concerning ``Bait'' is why, oh, why Foxx,
who was so impressive in ``Any Given Sunday,'' chose to make a
movie so boring and idiotic that it barely meets minimal standards
of lowest-common-denominator entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The story finds poor Alvin sharing a cell with one of the
perpetrators of a $42 million heist of gold bricks from the Federal
Reserve System. When his cellmate suddenly dies of a heart attack,
Alvin is plucked from prison, implanted with a satellite-controlled
radio device that continually broadcasts his location and is used
as bait by a ruthless treasury investigator (David Morse) to flush
out the mastermind of the ``heist of the decade.'' Because his
cellmate buried the treasure, the reasoning goes, he may have left
Alvin a deathbed clue of its whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   The ploy succeeds, and before long, Bristol (Doug Hutchison), a
villainous computer wizard who talks as if he is a robotic
caricature of John Malkovich in his monster mode, is menacing
Alvin's girlfriend, Lisa (Kimberly Elise), and their baby son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bait,'' directed by Antoine Fuqua from a screenplay by Andrew
and Adam Scheinman and Tony Gilroy, is so frenetically choppy that
its action sequences are impossible to follow. As a result, the
movie's chases and demolition derbies have no continuity or
visceral charge. After a while you begin to wonder if the director
cheated and, instead of actually filming whole action sequences,
shot bits and pieces and spliced them together. The result is an
odoriferous helping of cinematic seafood whose pungency suggests
that it has been sitting on the kitchen counter for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bait'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or
adult guardian). It includes sexual situations and some gory
violence. &QL;

&HT;     THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNIGHT AND THE DARK SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Deep thoughts about shallow subjects, shallow
thoughts about shallow subjects and shallow thoughts about deep
subjects:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hey, Knight, what's up?
</P>
<P>
   According to Bob Knight, those words are enough to drive a
reasonable man to distraction _ and from his job.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, then let's do our part to make the sports
world a better place:
</P>
<P>
   Hey, (Patrick) Ewing, what's up?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, (Albert) Belle, what's up?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, (Mike) Tyson, what's up?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, (Daniel) Snyder, what's up?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, (Jerry) Jones, what's up?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, (Dick) Vitale, what's up?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, (Brent) Musburger, what's up?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, (Stuart) Scott, what's up?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, (Donald) Fehr, what's up?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, (Jerry) Tarkanian, what's up?
</P>
<P>
   _ Well, at least Knight didn't go down in a blaze of Woody Hayes
ignominy. There were no television cameras to capture the episode
that banished Knight into exile.
</P>
<P>
   Yet.
</P>
<P>
   Because Knight insists he isn't finished as a coach. Which means
that Knight will be back somewhere, doing the same boorish,
obnoxious, unnecessarily belittling things again. Anger management?
He needs a course in ogre management.
</P>
<P>
   Some school administration is going to sell out and hire Knight.
Didn't Tarkanian find work again? And Knight has never gotten a
school in probation, because the NCAA has never treated boorishness
as a prosecutable offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to coach in the worst way,'' Knight said. Why not? He
already behaves in that manner.
</P>
<P>
   _ Knight insisted there was nothing wrong with the hands-on
confrontation he had with freshman Indiana University student Kent
Harvey. Never mind that Knight admitted that the ``Hey, Knight,
what's up?'' greeting likely came out of nothing more sinister than
being flustered by an unexpected encounter with the most powerful
man in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did was simply try to teach him something about
manners,'' Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   Knight lecturing somebody about civility is like Madonna holding
court about chastity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Knight was his usual blustering, bullying self Wednesday night
during his ESPN interview with Jeremy Schaap. He sidestepped
questions, played semantic games, rambled on almost nonsensically
and refused to take responsibility for any of his actions. When
Schaap tried to press the coach on specifics or cut off
self-serving filibusters, Knight trotted out his tiresome tactics
of intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Knight tried to throw off Schaap by saying:
``You've got a long way to go to be as good as your dad (long-time
writer and broadcaster Dick Schaap). ``You better keep that in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, a certain coach with ill-fitting sweaters has got a long
way to go before he passes muster as any sort of Knight in shining
armor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't buy into the spin that Knight galvanizes people into
love-him-or-hate-him postures. That implies that anybody who
disapproves of Knight does so irrationally, out of hate. Just
because Knight has done a lot of wonderful things during his career
doesn't excuse his wretched excesses. He didn't invent the concept
of winning games and positively influencing players. Plenty of
coaches do those things without the spite and meanness.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I Love You, Ronnie,'' reveals the contents of several of the
love letters that Ronald Reagan sent to his wife Nancy. The new
book paints a portrait of a love almost as intense as the one
between Keyshawn Johnson and Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keyshawn hasn't come across as bitter and petty about the New
York Jets trading him to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He has been
bitter and petty, accusing Jets management of hidden agendas and
not wanting to win.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Jets are just as 2-0 as the Buccaneers. The lack of a
go-to receiver of Johnson's ilk didn't hinder the Jets from pulling
out an unlikely comeback victory against the New England Patriots
on Monday night. Dedrick Ward and Wayne (The Mascot) Chrebet both
made big-time catches during the winning drive. Johnson's nemesis,
Chrebet, caught two late touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   _ For the record, Johnson has contributed nine catches for 96
yards and a touchdown this season. Ward (nine for 204) and Chrebet
(nine for 118, two touchdowns) both have been more productive in
the season's first two weeks. The plot will truly thicken in 10
days, when the Jets play at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scary: St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt Warner, the reigning
NFL Player of the Year, has put up 827 passing yards and 78 points
in the first two games. Scarier: This Sunday the Rams face a San
Francisco 49ers defense allowing 35 points and 314 passing yards
per game against quarterbacks not named Kurt Warner. Scariest: ``I
definitely believe I can play better,'' Warner said, ``than I did
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Warner said he's shooting for ``that perfect game.'' Maybe he
should re-think his goals. Look what a perfect game did for David
Cone's career.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, Snyder tried to turn the Washington Redskins into The
Beat Team That Money Can Buy. Then, Snyder started charging fans to
watch the training camp workouts. Then, the Redskins split their
first two games, giving them the same record as the Arizona
Cardinals and Philadelphia Eagles. Meanwhile, Jones' Cowboys are
winless, with hopeless in clear sight.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy justice _ fleeting as it may be _ when you see it.

`URBANIA': FIRST URBAN LEGENDS, THEN REAL DANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One way of looking at Jon Shear's harrowing and indelible film
``Urbania'' is to think of it as ``Sex and the City'' turned inside
out. This menacing erotic fantasy, set in Manhattan on the evening
of the switch from daylight saving to standard time, adding an
extra hour to the night, suggests a surreal cinematic answer to one
of Lou Reed's rock 'n' roll walks on the wild side.
</P>
<P>
   Most of its characters, instead of looking for love, are hunting
for sex on the streets and in the bars of a neighborhood that
resembles the downscale environs of Chelsea and the West Village
near the Hudson River. One of the kicks of cruising the streets
after midnight, the movie reminds us, is the thrill of the unknown
and its undertone of danger, which ``Urbania'' portrays as
palpably, frighteningly real.
</P>
<P>
   The central character, Charlie (Dan Futterman), is an angry,
grief-stricken gay man whose lover, Chris (Matt Keeslar), seen in
flashbacks, has mysteriously disappeared and is probably dead.
Charlie is obsessed with Chris to the point that he repeatedly
dials his number and leaves messages that he knows his absent
friend will never get.
</P>
<P>
   The story darkens as it develops, and it becomes increasingly
clear that the normally unprepossessing Charlie is ritualistically
psyching himself up to commit an act of violence. One preparatory
rite is to ponder scary urban legends, which the movie brings to
life with a haunting mixture of realism and horror. There's the one
about a man who picks up a woman, is drugged and wakes up in a
bathtub covered with blood to discover that one of his kidneys has
been removed. There's the one about a man who has unprotected sex
with a woman; the next morning he finds her gone and the message
``Welcome to the world of AIDS'' scrawled in lipstick on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Burrowing deeply into the threatening mood of these and other
horror stories, Charlie begins playing sadistic mind games with
people he meets in a neighborhood bar. He charms, then humiliates
an arrogant jock and his bimbo girlfriend. In his nastiest prank,
he picks up a vain bisexual soap-opera actor, goes home with him
and pretends to be a violent sociopath. The movie's portraits of
these narcissists have a scalding accuracy that even a show as
observant and up to date as ``Sex and the City'' rarely equals.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie's adventures in mental cruelty are only rehearsals for
the creation and acting out of his own urban myth before the night
is over. By the time he attaches himself to Dean (Samuel Ball), a
homophobic punk who has been prowling the neighborhood, Charlie's
vengeful agenda is painfully apparent.
</P>
<P>
   If the intense, edgy performances and urban ambience lend each
vignette a gripping fascination, ``Urbania'' sometimes pushes too
hard. It is also infuriatingly coy in its withholding of crucial
information. Once the facts have finally been revealed, ``Urbania''
turns briefly and uncomfortably mawkish with a scene set either in
heaven or in one of its anterooms, in which Charlie and Chris have
a sad, mystical conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Futterman, familiar from the television series ``Judging Amy,''
delivers a remarkably subtle and shaded portrait of a peaceful man
driven by overwhelming personal grief and rage to exorcise his
personal demons through a kind of violence that doesn't come to him
as naturally as it does to the macho men he confronts. The extent
to which he forces himself to ignore his more humane impulses makes
his situation all the more excruciating. It's the psychic
equivalent of being a vegetarian whose survival depends on
cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urbania'' is as technically innovative as it is emotionally
unsettling. Shot in super 16-millimeter film and digitally blown up

ALBUM OF THE WEEK: `SONGS FROM AN AMERICAN MOVIE' BY EVERCLEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERCLEAR: ``Songs From an American Movie, Volume I: Learning
How to Smile'' (Capitol).
</P>
<P>
   What are memories for? Art P. Alexakis of Everclear ponders that
question on ``Songs From an American Movie, Volume I.'' Alexakis,
38, isn't afraid to admit he has a long past, and he seesaws
between weighing what he has done and trying to forget it.
</P>
<P>
   In the album's single, ``AM Radio,'' he borrows the strutting
riff from Jean Knight's `` Big Stuff'' to rap-sing fond
reminiscences of the 1970s. But in ``Here We Go Again,'' he fends
off a new girlfriend's questions, saying, ``I do not want you to
know me the way I used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Songs'' is a post-divorce album. Alexakis observes the
collapsing marriage, hurls his final barbs and worries about the
effects on the child. He pins his hopes on a new love, vowing not
to make the old mistakes. And with ``Unemployed Boyfriend,'' he
comes up with the perfect modern come-on.
</P>
<P>
   The album started as a solo project for Alexakis, and it moves
away from Everclear's usual punky, guitar-charged rock toward
AM-radio music he remembers: country-rock, the Beach Boys, the
string-laden pop of Electric Light Orchestra. Despite some overdone
moments, like the remake of Van Morrison's ``Brown-Eyed Girl,''
most of the album turns Alexakis' ups and downs into tuneful,
broad-shouldered rock.  &QL;

THE EURO EXPERIMENT: A BOLD IDEA THAT ISN'T WORKING 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The euro is a grand experiment, a paper currency without a
government. And that lack is one reason why the euro has sunk far
below any reasonable level.
</P>
<P>
   Early this week Romano Prodi, the president of the European
Commission and, as such, the closest thing Europe has to a
president, called for intervention in the foreign exchange markets
to support the euro. The markets yawned. Traders know Prodi has
little power.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does anyone else. Europe has a central bank, but the euro
has 11 national governments. None of them can set policy for the
area as a whole, and each of them can disclaim responsibility for
what happens to the currency.
</P>
<P>
   When the euro was being planned, advocates expected the currency
to be a strong one. No longer would an Italy, say, be able to just
let its currency weaken. To stay competitive, it and the other
governments would have to adopt structural reforms. Rigid labor
markets and high-cost government pension plans would inevitably
wither away.
</P>
<P>
   Just the opposite seems to be happening. Taxes are being cut,
but other reforms are coming slowly, if at all. The currency
markets can no longer cast a vote on any one government's policies,
so the easy way out is not directly punished, and the hard way is
not going to be directly rewarded. It should come as no surprise
that governments under pressure tend to choose the easy way, as
France did to buy off protesters who wanted lower fuel taxes.
</P>
<P>
   One way to fight a falling currency is to intervene in the
currency markets. That can be a good tactic when, as now, currency
values are clearly out of line. But for such intervention to work,
it should be large, internationally supported, backed by a
government making credible policy changes and seen as likely to
continue if necessary. Thursday's European Central Bank
announcement that it is buying $2.2 billion worth of euros fails on
all counts.
</P>
<P>
   Raising interest rates is another method to support a currency,
and one that poor Wim Duisenberg, the president of the European
Central Bank, has tried. Unfortunately, it is equity capital flows
that now dominate the global investment scene, not bonds. Europe
needs to find a way to persuade investors to buy stocks and
businesses. Higher interest rates would slow the economy without
helping the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg never expected anything like the current situation,
in which the United States can run an unprecedented current account
deficit _ now at 4.3 percent of gross domestic product, or more
than $1 billion a day, while the dollar rises. ``In the long run,
such a deficit is unsustainable,'' he told a European parliamentary
hearing. But for now, he added, ``the Americans have no difficulty
in having that deficit financed, basically by us, Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   That current account deficit is being exacerbated by high oil
prices, which may yet slow the entire Western world and make U.S.
investments look less attractive. Eventually, Duisenberg will be
proved right. The dollar is overvalued, and will decline. Someday.
</P>
<P>
   But the euro may not have that much time to wait. Already the
euro disarray is damaging hopes that Denmark will vote to join the
currency union. Such a vote would damage the euro even further, and
strengthen British opposition. In that environment, a European
recession might stir nostalgia for good old marks and francs. But
Europe's rules bar any country from abandoning the euro.
</P>
<P>
   A strong government for the euro region could fight those
trends. But this currency has 11 governments, which for some
purposes is the same as having none.

&HT;     CLINTON FINDS HANDLING OF LEE CASE `QUITE TROUBLING' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Thursday he found the
government's handling of the Wen Ho Lee case ``quite troubling,''
saying that Justice Department prosecutors could not justify their
treatment of the former Los Alamos laboratory scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had been concerned for some time about the
denial of bail for Lee, 60, who was freed Wednesday after agreeing
to plead guilty to one felony count of inappropriately downloading
nuclear weapons secrets at Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los
Alamos, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Following Lee's release, the case's presiding judge said the
government's conduct had ``embarrassed the entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing was quite troubling to me,'' said Clinton,
whose remarks came only hours after Attorney General Janet Reno
said she was ``comfortable'' with the handling of the case.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Lee was indicted on 59 counts alleging that the
scientist compromised some of the most sensitive codes in the
nuclear weapons arsenal by removing them from classified areas of
the lab from 1993 to 1997. Lee downloaded the codes onto 10
computer tapes, seven of which remain missing.
</P>
<P>
   The president questioned why government prosecutors would agree
to set free a person who, as recently as a week ago, they argued
was a potential national security threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day he's a terrible risk to the national security, and the
next day they're making a plea agreement for an offense far more
modest than what had been alleged,'' Clinton said, speaking to
reporters outside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can justify in retrospect keeping a person
in jail without bail when you're prepared to make that kind of
agreement,'' he said. ``It just can't be justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Reno blamed the scientist's incarceration on
Lee himself. She said that she ``wished with all her heart and soul
that Mr. Lee had come forward'' immediately with information about
the seven missing computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dr. Lee had the opportunity from the beginning to
resolve this matter, and he chose not to, and I think he must look
to himself,'' she said at her weekly news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also said the Justice Department handled the case
appropriately. ``We made the best decision we could, based on the
evidence and the law, and I feel very comfortable about that,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge James Parker,
speaking from the bench after approving the plea agreement, told a
packed courtroom that ``the top decision-makers in the executive
branch, especially the Department of Justice and Department of
Energy, have embarrassed the entire nation and each of us who is a
citizen in it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Parker did not exonerate Lee in his remarks, saying the
scientist had pleaded guilty to a ``serious crime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a felony offense. For that you need to be punished,'' he
said before sentencing Lee to the 278 days he has already served
while awaiting trail.
</P>
<P>
   But Parker, a Republican appointed by former President Ronald
Reagan, said the manner in which Lee was held _ without bail and
often in solitary confinement _ was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, you've been punished harshly,'' the judge said,
adding that citizens usually are entitled to be released until they
are tried and convicted. ``You lost valuable rights as a citizen. I
am sad that I was induced in December to order your detention.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Reno said Lee's punishment was equal to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even (Judge Parker) recognized that Dr. Lee had violated
criminal law in this instance, evidence was taken off a secured
computer, downloaded, put into an unsecured computer, which people
could have access to,'' she said. ``I think in that situation, you
have to look at the consequences of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   At his Wednesday hearing, Lee admitted that in 1994 he had
unauthorized possession of documents related to national defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used an unsecure computer to download a document related to
national defense,'' Lee said. ``I knew at the time that my position
was unauthorized and that under the Los Alamos National Laboratory
directives I was not permitted'' to have the documents outside of
the secured perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also acknowledged that the government had national security
reasons for the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The felony conviction carries a maximum penalty of 10 years'
imprisonment, a fine of $250,000 and up to three years of
supervised release. The scientist instead was credited with the 278
days he already served.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the plea agreement, Lee, a Taiwanese-born naturalized
citizen, will have to undergo as much as 60 hours of intense
interrogation from federal agents over the fate of the seven tapes.
</P>
<P>
   He will have to tell prosecutors how, when and where the copies
of the data were made and the manner in which they were disposed
of. He also has submitted a written declaration that he never
shared, nor had any intention of sharing, the information with any
other source.
</P>
<P>
   The sessions will begin Sept. 26 and will run for six hours a
day for 10 days. Lee also will make himself available for further
debriefing sessions, if necessary. And he will allow authorities to
search his home or any other storage spaces, such as safe deposit
becomes, if questioning leads to that. The deal further stipulates
that Lee may have to take polygraph exams on issues related to
national security.

CLARKS HOPING TO KEEP OLYMPIC MEDALS IN THE FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   By KELLY CROW    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hazel Clark is a Clark, which means many things, but mostly that
she is a runner. Her father ran cross-country in high school, and
her half-brother and half-sister have forged distinguished track
careers for themselves, particularly in the 800 meters. Her
sister-in-law even has an Olympic gold medal for a relay and holds
the American record in the 800: two laps in 1 minute, 56.04
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   When Hazel Clark was not much more than a toddler, though, she
decided two things: That she idolized her older and then-distant
half-sister, Joetta, and that she would never follow Joetta onto
the track. Instead, Hazel spent years at the fence railing, content
to watch with hands clasped together while Joetta flew past in a
blur of legs and accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was really young, I would get really nervous when she'd
run,'' Hazel said, ``and I'd root for her and pray to give her all
my strength.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet today, Hazel Clark at 22 is one of America's top
800-meter runners. In March, she won the USA Indoor Track &AMP; Field
Championships, and in July, she took first place at the U.S.
Olympic trials. Following right behind her in that race were her
sister-in-law, Jearl Miles-Clark, and her sister, Joetta Clark
Diggs. Her brother, J.J. Clark, was their coach, and watching from
the sidelines was the family patriarch, Joe Clark, better known
from his ``Lean on Me'' days as a hard-nosed Paterson, N.J., high
school principal.
</P>
<P>
   The Clark women made headlines and history as the first family
to sweep a track-and-field event in an Olympic trials. When track
competition begins Sept. 22 at the Summer Games in Sydney, it will
be Hazel's first time on an Olympic team, Jearl's third, and
Joetta's fourth and final. As far as the 800 goes, the Clarks are
America's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two sisters coached by a brother who is married to one of
their competitors _ it's a story even Hollywood couldn't make up,''
said Craig Masback of USA Track &AMP; Field, the organization that
oversees more than 4,000 track events a year. ``Jearl has to be the
favorite, Hazel has the most untapped potential, and Joetta has
more experience than anyone. Each has an opportunity to make it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to join Team Clark, though, Hazel first had to find
herself among her famous family of runners. She who would not run
had to figure out why she was so intimidated and then decide what
to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   There is an undeniable pressure that comes with taking on
another's legacy. You must somehow validate their successes and
further their dreams without losing your own. When Hazel eventually
became a runner, she constantly worried about letting Joetta and
the rest of the family down.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Hazel decided to race her sister and her
sister-in-law for the first time at the Goodwill Games in New
Orleans. Jearl finished first, Joetta second and Hazel fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point,'' Hazel said, ``I guess I was still caught in
that little sister routine, where I was so used to looking up to
Joetta and she had been everything to me for so long that I didn't
really race her.''
</P>
<P>
   But something in Hazel had changed by the Olympic trials in
Sacramento on July 23. ``This time,'' she said, ``I felt like I was
going to race her _ not cut in behind her, not let myself be beaten
by my big sister, not make excuses because I was young or not
supposed to be at the top _ no, I went for it.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, Hazel Clark left the railing for good.
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing is, Joetta Clark Diggs has watched her sister
for years now with the bemused pride and frustration of a drill
sergeant. Hazel, or ``Peachy,'' as the family calls her, is
Joetta's project as much as her sister.
</P>
<P>
   When Hazel was born, though, Joetta was already 16 and a senior
in high school. She was not keen about the prospect of
baby-sitting. The baby was welcome, Joetta said, but she was closer
to J.J., who was only two years younger. Joetta and J.J. had grown
up together in Newark, N.J. They had adjusted to their parents'
divorce and to their father's remarriage. They had discovered the
family talent for running track, although their father forbade them
from becoming sprinters because he wanted to combat the stereotype
that black people could not run distances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing that roadwork is very, very lonely,'' Joe said recently,
``but it builds character.''
</P>
<P>
   In matters of character, Joetta is her father's daughter. She is
aggressive and serious, well read and business savvy. Even as a
teen-ager, she thrived on the discipline of all-day workouts, and
for a long time she had little time for Hazel. Joetta was running
the 800 at 12 and missing her high school graduation at 17 because
she was at her first Olympic trials. Before Sydney, she was on
three other Olympic teams, with her best finish a seventh place in
the 800 meters in 1992. She's been ranked in the national Top 10
every year for the last 20 years, and in 1998, she was ranked
fourth in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot mentally to come back and train and race year
after year, to stay that intense over that many years,'' said Mark
Young, the assistant coach overseeing America's 800-meter runners
in Sydney. ``She's the consummate professional.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She is also 38 years old now, a veteran in a sport filled with
sprightly twentysomethings like Hazel, who makes time to shop and
talk about boys and go to dance clubs and the beach. Hazel never
had to fight for the college scholarships or the big-money shoe
deals that now give professional sports so much gloss. If Joetta is
intense, she said she has had to be to survive in her sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was Hazel's age, I was more focused,'' Joetta said,
``but it was a different generation. Women during my time were
trying to establish themselves in the career world, and at 21, I
was trying to prove that as a black woman I was educated. Now it's
a whole different game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like as an athlete, she thinks that there were always nice
tracks and nice weight rooms and nice equipment, and everyone
always had planes to fly on to go to all their meets. She doesn't
understand life before Title IX, when women couldn't do the same
things as men, didn't have the budget. So she's more into the
enjoyment of it, just having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true. Hazel Clark is having fun on the track these days,
relishing the Olympics with the giddiness of a spectator and taking
along several suitcases for the trip. Joetta packed one.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Hazel's childhood promise never to be a runner?
She kept it for a time, becoming a dancer and then a figure skater.
But by 16, she was 5 feet, 9 inches tall _ long-legged for a skater
_ and she quit the sport after suffering a serious fall on the ice.
Only then did she give in to the pleadings of her siblings, who saw
potential in Hazel's long stride.
</P>
<P>
   She begrudgingly became a runner. She even attended the
University of Florida in Gainesville where her brother is an
assistant track coach, and she trained with J.J.'s wife, Jearl.
Joetta stayed in New Jersey, but regularly flew down to train.
</P>
<P>
   Jearl, 34, said she had watched Joetta mellow and Hazel mature,
but she added, ``I didn't know it for a long time, but Hazel still
felt she had a lot to live up to. She wanted so much to be her own
person.''
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly six years for Hazel to deal with her demons of
inferiority and finally fall in love with the sport that she felt
belonged to her sister. Late last year the three Clarks started
training for the Olympics. Somewhere in all those early-morning
workouts and summer track meets, Hazel got to know Joetta. Hazel
came to know her not as a record-setter or a reputation but as a
sister, someone who loves to cook and hates to lose and reminds her
so much of their father that it's eerie. And one day after a long
workout, it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just stopped and thought, `You're supposed to be up there.
You've worked hard, and Joetta will be proud of you. She won't take
anything from you,''' Hazel said. ``It felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   She was right. Joetta said, ``She's a good kid. She still has to
prove herself a lot, but she's going to have some good years. She's
so talented.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that workout, Hazel said she no longer minds carrying on
the Clark legacy. She has chosen to love the sport on her own
terms, and now she wants nothing more than to race alongside her
sister and sister-in-law one last time in Sydney. After the
Olympics, Joetta will retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is make-or-break time,'' Hazel said, ``and it's my first,
but it's her last. But now we're motivating each other, and I think
that's why we all made the team. We get to the finals, and we're
going to make some more history.''  &QL;

   RUSSIAN REVERSAL ON MOBILE PHONES
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government suspended a decision to seize frequencies
of the country's two biggest mobile phone providers in a move that
investors said shows the government has not lost sight of
protecting Russia's property rights. The two companies, Vimpelcom
and Mobile Telesystems, were told last week by the Ministry of
Telecommunications to relinquish frequencies they had already been
awarded, which drove their stock prices down by as much as 24
percent. Though the government did not explain why it had recalled
the frequencies, analysts said Moscow's third mobile phone
provider, Sonic Duo, which is owned partly by a
government-controlled company, would have been the most likely
recipient. Frequency space is tight in Moscow's crowded mobile
phone market, which is expected to double in subscribers by the end
of next year.

<P>
   STRONG RESULTS AT CAP GEMINI
</P>
<P>
   Shares in one of Europe's biggest computer service groups, Cap
Gemini of France, rose sharply after the company announced strong
sales and profit growth in the first half and said results were
lifted by a tax credit related to its $11.1 billion acquisition
earlier this year of the consulting practice of Ernst &AMP; Young. Cap
Gemini's chief financial officer, Frederic Lemoine, said Cap Gemini
would benefit from the deductibility over 15 years of as much as
1.6 billion euros, or $1.3 billion, from U.S. taxes as a result of
goodwill amortization related to the Ernst &AMP; Young acquisition. Cap
Gemini shares rose almost 5 percent, to 219.50 euros, on the news.

   POTENTIAL DEAL FOR DHL
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Post AG, the postal and logistics company controlled by
the German government, is in talks to gain control of DHL
International by substantially increasing its 25 percent stake in
the courier company that has operations in the United States,
people close to the negotiations said. The deal would value
Brussels-based DHL at about 11 billion euros or $9.4 billion, far
less than what has been speculated.DHL would give Deutsche Post,
which is planning to go public in November, a global delivery
network and pit it against FedEx Corp. of Memphis, Tenn., and
United Parcel Service Inc., of Atlanta. Japan Airlines, Lufthansa
AG and a group of DHL senior managers and members of the founders'
family control DHL in nearly equal parts.

<P>
   HEAVY LOSSES AT NUCLEAR FUEL MAKER
</P>
<P>
   Britain's ill-starred, state-owned nuclear fuel company, BNFL,
reported disastrous losses for a year marked by scandal over the
falsification of quality control data on shipments of nuclear fuel.
In what the company called ``poor results'' for the year to March
31, pretax profit fell from 218 million pounds, or about $307
million, to a loss of 337 million pounds. BNFL, which has contracts
for a range of nuclear decommissioning projects in the United
States through its Westinghouse subsidiary, said it was unlikely to
proceed with plans for a partial privatization until late 2002.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE CONTRACTOR EARNINGS FALL
</P>
<P>
   Shares in BAE Systems PLC, Britain's leading defense contractor
and the world's third biggest, slipped by up to 8.7 percent to
363.25 pence after the company said first-half profit fell 3.3
percent because of higher taxes and cuts in government military
spending. The company said net income slid to (PS)87 million, or
about $123 million, from (PS)90 million one year earlier. The
results reflect BAE's purchase of Marconi Electronics last
December, but the company declined to say how the acquisition had
affected its first-half performance.
</P>
<P>
   RESPITE IN CANADIAN INFLATION
</P>
<P>
   Canada's annual inflation rate fell to 2.5 percent in August
from 3 percent in June, as the rise in energy prices abated.
Economists had expected less than the half-point drop in the
Consumer Price Index for August, but warned that the latest jump in
oil prices will push it higher again for September. Excluding
energy, Canada's inflation rate was 1.7 percent in August, up
slightly from 1.5 percent in July. Energy costs are 11.9 per cent
higher than a year ago.

<P>
   Companies have always wrestled with two questions in tandem:
what to sell and how to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how to sell is a big one, because in choosing
one way, sellers almost always foreclose other possibilities.
Commodity dealers selling on spot markets, for example, do not also
offer continuous replenishment programs. Mass merchandisers with
fixed prices do not invite negotiation. And auction houses do not
sell through mail order.
</P>
<P>
   Companies know that by limiting themselves to one main selling
mechanism, they sacrifice a lot of potential customers and leave a
lot of money lying on the table. But they've had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Selling the same things in different ways has traditionally been
too complex and has required radically different physical setups.
How, for instance, can a mail retailer bring together enough
interested buyers to run a reasonable auction?
</P>
<P>
   PROLIFERATING CHOICES
</P>
<P>
   All that has changed in the age of the Internet, where business
is increasingly unconstrained by the laws and limitations of the
physical world.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the many different ways one could purchase a ticket on
American Airlines' Web site. Travelers can book tickets through
Sabre, the company's traditional reservation system; choose from a
limited number of deeply discounted fares using NetSAAvers; secure
special fares based on membership in one of a number of affinity
programs, such as Senior TrAAvelers; arrange customized trips based
on a personal profile stored in Personal AAccess; or select
vacation packages, purchasing air tickets as part of a bundled
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, someone who goes to Dell's Web site can buy a
customized computer using the company's famous online system
configurator or bid in an auction for a popular setup. LandsEnd.com
augments its fixed-price catalog with a Dutch auction for
overstocks. Streamline.com offers buyers basic grocery ordering as
well as a continuous replenishment option for staple items.
</P>
<P>
   All these sites are early examples of all-in-one markets _
markets that offer, side by side, alternative ways for buyers and
sellers to transact business.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why companies are moving quickly to offer more
ways to buy. They recognize that the same buyer may want different
transaction mechanisms under different circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   A clotheshorse may love certain purchasing methods when bargain
hunting for basics, yet shun them when shopping for an outfit for a
special occasion. A person may not care about ticket prices when
traveling for business, but he may be the king of the cherry
pickers when it comes time to plan a family vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to offer multiple transaction approaches allows
companies to win a larger share of existing customers' business as
well as bring new types of buyers into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   A THREE-STAGE EVOLUTION
</P>
<P>
   All-in-one markets have evolved in three stages. Stage one saw a
great deal of innovation in online transaction mechanisms. Many
companies experimented with mechanisms that had previously been
unknown in their industries.
</P>
<P>
   For example, iBeauty.com introduced continuous replenishment to
the online health and beauty business, enabling automatic
reordering of fragrances and cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies pioneered entirely new transaction mechanisms.
Priceline.com, for example, introduced the world to the ``demand
collection system'' _ where buyers post the price they are willing
to pay and invite sellers to either accept or decline the business.
</P>
<P>
   Mercata pioneered electronic group buying. It allows individuals
to gather into buying blocks, leveraging their combined purchasing
power to drive prices down.
</P>
<P>
   In stage two, companies rushed to combine transaction approaches
on their Web sites. Of the 320 leading e-commerce sites we studied,
two-thirds already employ multiple transaction mechanisms, and 30
percent support three or more mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the growing availability of off-the-shelf software
for handling Web transactions, such as OpenSite's auction package,
these numbers are sure to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're entering stage three: the aggregation of many sellers
onto the sites that already feature more than one selling
mechanism. An early leader in this trend is Travelocity.com.
</P>
<P>
   Like the American Airlines site, Travelocity combines several
transaction mechanisms. But unlike American Airlines, it provides
access to travel services from a range of airlines, hotels and
rental car agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of all-in-one markets was inevitable. By enabling
frictionless movement among ways of doing business, they benefit
both buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this trend runs counter to the conventional wisdom
about e-commerce. Many observers predicted that the wide reach and
low transaction costs of the Internet would push all transactions
toward a single mechanism _ open-market price competition. It seems
that the ultimate market for e-commerce isn't one for all. it's all
in one.

EXPLODING THE SELF-SERVICE MYTH

 By YOUNGME MOON and FRANCES X. FREI  
 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone knows that it usually costs companies less to conduct
business over the Web than through traditional channels. An online
banking transaction, for instance, costs just 2 cents, compared
with 36 cents for an ATM transaction and $1.15 for a
teller-assisted transaction. So it's not surprising that many
companies are desperately trying to attract consumers to the
Internet channel.
</P>
<P>
   What is surprising, however, is that most have had dismal
results. In retail brokerage, for instance, only 2 percent of
households trade online. And the figures for the airline industry
are even worse: Less than 0.1 percent of households purchase
tickets through airline Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Why are the numbers so low? In large part, it's because many
companies have bought into the myth that the Internet is a
self-service channel. They assume they should let their online
customers help themselves to whatever product or service they need
_ be it reserving their own airline tickets or configuring their
own automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that when a company does less, the customer ends
up doing more _ and most customers don't want to do more. In many
cases, self-service sites just leave customers frustrated and
annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when customers visit a typical airline Web site,
they are invariably confronted with a self-service search engine.
If they know exactly when and where they want to travel, the Web
site will generate a list of feasible flights. But if they want to
find the cheapest ticket and are flexible on the dates and
destinations, they have to conduct search after search, often
re-entering basic information such as seating preference and
billing address.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, customers who contact that same airline's call
center have a markedly different experience. They can give the
sales agent far less specific information, and the agent does the
unpleasant work of searching through the flight databases.
Customers only have to state their preferences once and then choose
between the best alternatives. Sales reps can even check for
upgrades or request special meals.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be surprising, then, that air travelers have been
slow to move to the Web for ticket purchases.
</P>
<P>
   A better approach to e-commerce is ``coproduction.'' In this
model, a company uses technology to shoulder many of the tasks
involved in shopping and buying, relieving the burden on the
customer.
</P>
<P>
   The coproduction model recognizes that although customers like
having choices, they don't want too many. They appreciate it when
companies offer prescreened alternatives geared to their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Coproduction also recognizes that customers want to state their
preferences only once. Through coproduction, companies focus on
customer service, not self-service.
</P>
<P>
   Some of e-commerce's brightest stars are already using the
coproduction approach. Dell Computer, for example, performs a host
of back-end transactions that are invisible to customers _ such as
grouping its products by customer segments and displaying only
in-stock items. That way, customers can help themselves _ they can
configure their computers and check the status of orders but they
aren't overwhelmed with choices.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has also developed hundreds of custom Web pages for its
most valuable corporate customers. These pages display only those
computer configurations that have been preapproved by the
customer's company, and the prices reflect negotiated discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Dell also provides detailed purchasing reports and customized
inventory analyses so managers can use the Web pages to enforce
product standards and increase productivity. Far from pursuing a
self-service strategy, as most people assume, Dell has in fact
shouldered as many of the customer's transaction-related functions
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   You can help your company adopt a coproduction strategy by
taking the following four steps:
</P>
<P>
   First, deconstruct the entire transaction process _ from the
identification of the customer need to order fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Second, distinguish between those functions that are currently
performed by your company and those performed by your customer.
</P>
<P>
   Third, pinpoint which of the customer functions you can take
responsibility for _ establishing the boundaries of your company's
reach into the transaction _ and assess the costs and benefits of
taking on each task.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, find ways to expand your reach beyond a single
transaction to create more value for the customer _ as Charles
Schwab does by issuing e-mail alerts to customers when their stocks
make big moves.
</P>
<P>
   The Web promises not only to reduce corporate transaction costs
but also to enhance customer convenience. To fulfill that promise,
though, companies need to move beyond the self-service myth.
</P>
<P>
   Making it easy and enjoyable for visitors to use your site
through a coproduction strategy will translate into more customers,
greater loyalty and higher profits.

self-service channel. They assume they should let their online
customers help themselves to whatever product or service they need
_ be it reserving their own airline tickets or configuring their
own automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that when a company does less, the customer ends
up doing more _ and most customers don't want to do more. In many
cases, self-service sites just leave customers frustrated and
annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when customers visit a typical airline Web site,
they are invariably confronted with a self-service search engine.
If they know exactly when and where they want to travel, the Web
site will generate a list of feasible flights. But if they want to
find the cheapest ticket and are flexible on the dates and
destinations, they have to conduct search after search, often
re-entering basic information such as seating preference and
billing address.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, customers who contact that same airline's call
center have a markedly different experience. They can give the
sales agent far less specific information, and the agent does the
unpleasant work of searching through the flight databases.
Customers only have to state their preferences once and then choose
between the best alternatives. Sales reps can even check for
upgrades or request special meals.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be surprising, then, that air travelers have been
slow to move to the Web for ticket purchases.
</P>
<P>
   A better approach to e-commerce is ``coproduction.'' In this
model, a company uses technology to shoulder many of the tasks
involved in shopping and buying, relieving the burden on the
customer.
</P>
<P>
   The coproduction model recognizes that although customers like
having choices, they don't want too many. They appreciate it when
companies offer prescreened alternatives geared to their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Coproduction also recognizes that customers want to state their
preferences only once. Through coproduction, companies focus on
customer service, not self-service.
</P>
<P>
   Some of e-commerce's brightest stars are already using the
coproduction approach. Dell Computer, for example, performs a host
of back-end transactions that are invisible to customers _ such as
grouping its products by customer segments and displaying only
in-stock items. That way, customers can help themselves _ they can
configure their computers and check the status of orders but they
aren't overwhelmed with choices.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has also developed hundreds of custom Web pages for its
most valuable corporate customers. These pages display only those
computer configurations that have been preapproved by the
customer's company, and the prices reflect negotiated discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Dell also provides detailed purchasing reports and customized
inventory analyses so managers can use the Web pages to enforce
product standards and increase productivity. Far from pursuing a
self-service strategy, as most people assume, Dell has in fact
shouldered as many of the customer's transaction-related functions
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   You can help your company adopt a coproduction strategy by
taking the following four steps:
</P>
<P>
   First, deconstruct the entire transaction process _ from the
identification of the customer need to order fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Second, distinguish between those functions that are currently
performed by your company and those performed by your customer.
</P>
<P>
   Third, pinpoint which of the customer functions you can take
responsibility for _ establishing the boundaries of your company's
reach into the transaction _ and assess the costs and benefits of
taking on each task.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, find ways to expand your reach beyond a single
transaction to create more value for the customer _ as Charles
Schwab does by issuing e-mail alerts to customers when their stocks
make big moves.
</P>
<P>
   The Web promises not only to reduce corporate transaction costs
but also to enhance customer convenience. To fulfill that promise,
though, companies need to move beyond the self-service myth.
</P>
<P>
   Making it easy and enjoyable for visitors to use your site
through a coproduction strategy will translate into more customers,
greater loyalty and higher profits.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A band of locally heavy rain will precede a cold front as it
sweeps across New England Friday. In the wake of the front, winds
from the northwest will deliver sharply cooler air from central
Canada into the Middle West and Northeast. Showers and a few
rumbles of thunder will occur in the chilly air from the eastern
Great Lakes to the central Appalachians. The autumnal air mass will
envelop the Northeast and Middle Atlantic states throughout the
weekend, keeping temperatures far below normal.
</P>
<P>
   Cooler and noticeably less humid air will reach most of the
Southeast as a cold front moves toward the Gulf of Mexico. Sultry
air and a few thundershowers will linger across central and
southern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, high pressure will keep most areas from the Plains
states to the West Coast dry and tranquil.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: FUNNEL CLOUDS
</P>
<P>
   A funnel cloud swirled briefly near Brownsville, Texas, on
Wednesday as scattered showers moved across the area. Later Friday
and Saturday, funnel clouds may be seen near the eastern Great
Lakes. In general, funnel clouds are a result of atmospheric
instability, a condition that arises when a layer of cold air
overlies a layer of warm, moist air. The air above the Great Lakes
will be chilly this weekend, while the lake waters retain summer's
warmth. At Brownsville, the air aloft was not very cold, but
low-level Gulf of Mexico air was very warm and humid. In both
cases, the atmosphere was unstable.

BANFF SKI AREA OFFERS MORE SNOW, MORE SPACE, MORE FOR YOUR MONEY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CAROLYN POIROT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANFF, Canada _ Before leaving for Canada last March, I checked
the Web site for Banff and Lake Louise dozens of times, wondering
what the problem was. Why were the pictures, posted each day to
reflect current ski conditions, so dull and fuzzy? Where was the
bright and beautiful snowy scenery I'd seen in travel books, all
mirror images of snow-covered mountains reflected in shimmering
lakes?
</P>
<P>
   But when I got to Banff, I discovered there really wasn't a
problem. It was just that there was so much snow. And that will
only be a problem if you are trying to take pictures of the
Canadian Rockies, not if you want to ski them.
</P>
<P>
   On some days, as you look toward the horizon, where the
snow-filled sky meets the snow-covered mountains, you can
distinguish a faint difference in the tone-on-tone expanse of
white. A slightly lighter shade of pale tints the mountains,
looming like ashen ghosts in the near distance. The row on row of
mountains farther away is invisible in the swirling snow.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. Even if you can't see them, you can ski them.
There's deep-powder skiing in those mountains _ just off the wide,
groomed trails, where you may end up totally by accident because
you can't see the trails, either.
</P>
<P>
   If you are going to Canada for the magnificent scenery, don't go
during the long ski season. But, if it's magnificent snow you are
seeking, Banff is the place to be.
</P>
<P>
   Banff is in Alberta, about 80 miles north of Calgary, just off
the Trans-Canada Highway, at the entrance to Banff National Park.
The park was set aside by the Canadian government in 1885 as Banff
Hot Springs Reserve and grew with the development of the Canadian
Pacific Railway along the Bow River. The recreational area now
includes 2,654 square miles of mostly wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Louise is the largest and best known of the three resorts
included in Ski Banff/Lake Louise, a joint venture company in the
heart of Banff National Park that also includes Sunshine Village
and Mount Norquay. Combined, they offer 7,530 acres of skiable
terrain, 28 lifts and 227 named runs.
</P>
<P>
   And nowhere else in North America can people brag that the snow
is so consistently good _ or that their ski season is so long.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Louise and Sunshine Village expect to open Nov. 10 this
year; Mount Norquay will open Dec. 1. They don't close until May 6.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, by Nov. 15 _ when most U.S. resorts were still
waiting for their first snow _ Sunshine had a 36.5-inch base and
was running 75 percent of its lifts. Lake Louise, where there's
lots of snowmaking equipment on top of the natural stuff, had a
24.5-inch base and all lifts on go.
</P>
<P>
   With the white stuff a little scarce farther south in the
Rockies of Colorado and New Mexico the past couple of years, and
the exchange rate now at $1.40 Canadian for every $1 U.S., there
may not be a better time to ski Canada.
</P>
<P>
   A full-day adult intermountain lift ticket, good at any of
Banff/Lake Louise's three resorts, is $54 Canadian _ about $38 U.S.
Multiday tri-mountain tickets are no cheaper, but they include
transportation from your lodging to the resort of your choice each
day, as well as transportation among the resorts in case you want
to try two or all three the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Half-day private lessons go for about $45. Packages based on a
double room with six nights' lodging and five days of lift passes
start at about $250 per person.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Louise has more than 4,000 acres spread over four mountain
faces, with several thousand acres of open bowls. Lake Louise
guarantees skiers will be riding one of its three base-area lifts
less than 10 minutes after they get in line.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Louise is tied together by a system of 11 interconnecting
lifts that sometimes drop you off in areas where you can't even see
any other skiers _ especially on whiteout days when many of the
faint at heart stay inside.

 &HT;    PANEL HEARS ARGUMENTS ON RESEARCH WITH CELLS FROM EMBRYOS
 &HT;    By MEGAN K. DOYLE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Actors Michael J. Fox and Mary Tyler Moore urged a
Senate panel Thursday to support federal spending for stem cell
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consistent and inescapable conclusion is that this
research offers the potential to eliminate diseases,'' said Fox,
who suffers from Parkinson's disease and left his starring role in
the television series ``Spin City'' this year to establish a
foundation for Parkinson's research.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cell research involves the use of embryonic stem cells,
which are derived from human embryos and can develop into most of
the body's specialized tissues, including muscle cells, nerve
cells, liver cells and blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   The cells' ability to divide for indefinite periods of time make
them ideal for research and possible treatments of spinal cord
injuries and diseases such as Parkinson's, diabetes, heart disease,
and multiple sclerosis, according to the National Institutes of
Health.
</P>
<P>
   Current law prohibits federal money from being used for research
that would destroy human embryos, but does not directly refer to
stem cell research. A bill proposed by Sen. Arlen Specter, chairman
of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee for labor, health and
human services and education, would allow federal money to be used
for stem cell research.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of stem cell research warned that the legislation
could result in human embryos being created and sold specifically
for such research.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this cheapens human life and our respect for it,'' said
Russell Saltzman, a Lutheran pastor from Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Heagy, a quadriplegic victim of a surfing accident and
founder of the Life is an Attitude Foundation, also testified
against the use of stem cells from human embryos on moral and
ethical grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, Moore and other supporters of the research cited guidelines
issued by the National Institutes of Health on Aug. 23 as an
acceptable method of ethically regulating stem cell research.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I do understand that some people have heartfelt concerns
about this research, ... stem cell research should be pursued
vigorously and is appropriate for federal funding,'' said Moore,
who suffers from diabetes and is international chairman of the
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Gina Gershon, who appeared in the movie ``The Insider,''
testified on behalf of her friend, Jennifer Estess(cq), who suffers
from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou
Gehrig's Disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``ALS breaks down the body ... until a person can no longer
breathe,'' said Gershon. ``Stem cell research could reverse that
process. To not find out seems like an agonizingly cruel
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts in cell biology, cancer research and gene therapy also
testified, stating that embryos would not be created for stem cell
research, in accordance with the National Institutes of Health
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cells used for research must be derived solely from embryos
generated for fertility treatments and in excess of clinical need.
Such embryos would otherwise be discarded,'' said Dr. Richard O.
Hynes, president of the American Society for Cell Biology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see in these cells a chance for a medical miracle,'' said
Fox. ``The government has done its work. Now we ask you to release
our tax dollars so the scientists can do their work.''

 BANFF, Canada: stay inside. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even beginners can ski the wide-open back bowls of Lake Louise.
From the Top of the World lift, which is aptly named, you have a
choice of easy intermediate runs to double black diamond bowls.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see much in the way of ski patrol here _ not much is
out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine Village has three mountains: Mount Standish, Lookout
Mountain and Goat's Eye Mountain, with two new quad chairlifts
opening this season to make movement among mountain faces faster
and easier.
</P>
<P>
   Without trail maps, you could ski all day and miss a whole
mountain.
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry if you get a little lost; there is always an
easy way down _ even from Goat's Eye, where signs at the base warn
that there are no easy ways down.
</P>
<P>
   Smallest of the resorts is Mount Norquay with 31 runs, served by
five lifts. It may be little, but it's practically in town, and
locals say it's a favorite for its steep terrain and impeccably
groomed intermediate slopes. Home to the Canadian Alpine Ski Team,
Mount Norquay offers the only night skiing in Canada, and one free
night is included with all multiday lift passes.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there is only one ``ski-in, ski-out'' place to stay,
and that's the Sunshine Village Inn at Sunshine's midmountain base,
but there are many lodges, resorts and inns in the town of Banff,
and several lodges within a couple of miles of the Lake Louise ski
area, including the beautiful Chateau Lake Louise. (That's the
castle-looking hotel you most often see reflected in the lake by
the same name.)
</P>
<P>
   We stayed at Buffalo Mountain Lodge, which backs up to Tunnel
Mountain just outside of town and offers cabins with full kitchens
and fireplaces as well as a variety of deluxe rooms. It's across
the street from the Douglas Fir Resort, well-known for its indoor
water slides.
</P>
<P>
   The picturesque town of Banff is about four blocks of
restaurants, hotels, shops, banking facilities and a grocery store.
Our favorite place to eat was The Grizzly House, with great
fondues, including a huge bowl of fresh fruit and perfectly melted
chocolate to dip it in. For those looking for the familiar, there's
a Hard Rock Cafe with unusually reasonable prices, when you figure
them in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, readers of the British newspaper Daily Telegraph
named Ski Banff/Lake Louise ``Best Ski Resort'' in the world. The
previous year, the poll of 6,000 Telegraph readers gave the honor
to St. Moritz, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder there seemed to be so many young Brits ``on holiday''
in and around Banff.
</P>
<P>
   There is a ``secret'' that they say every midweek skier here
knows: During the week _ other than holiday and spring break weeks
_ the total number of skiers on the slopes of the three resorts
averages fewer than 7,000, so every skier gets an acre of his own.
</P>
<P>
   These conditions won't last forever. Sunshine Village had a
record-breaking 590,000 skier visits last year.
</P>
<P>
   My only complaint is that blowing snow pellets sometimes sting
the skin. Oh, and the fact that you could see for miles, if it were
not for all that snow.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   If you go:
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: From Dallas-Fort Worth, it is about a 3 1/2-hour
nonstop flight to Calgary, where shuttle buses are available to
take you to Banff and Lake Louise. It takes an hour and a half to
get to Banff; two hours to get to Lake Louise. Shuttle service also
is available from most hotels to the three ski resorts and is
included free with multiday lift passes.
</P>
<P>
   Getting around: Don't even consider renting a car. Shuttles are
cheap, clean, contemporary, convenient and go everywhere you want
to go, including in and around the small town of Banff, where ``The
Happy Bus'' circulates.
</P>
<P>
   Paying: Restaurants and other businesses in Banff accept U.S.
dollars and credit cards, but you get the best exchange rate if you
trade in your U.S. dollars for Canadian at a bank or a streetside
currency stand.

AS HISTORY AND ARTIFICE MATE IN A HOTHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It may almost be too late for the French photo team
known as Pierre et Gilles to get the credit they deserve in the
United States. The cross-pollination between high and popular
culture that they exemplify has accelerated so dizzyingly over the
last decade that their exquisitely hand-finished photographs of
impossibly, sometimes scarily, beautiful men and women seem oddly
creaky and routine. At the same time, it may also be too soon to
know just what credit Pierre et Gilles are owed.
</P>
<P>
   The team's 56-work retrospective at the New Museum of
Contemporary Art in SoHo is a long overdue introduction. It's their
first major museum show in the United States, coming a decade after
a single gallery show, at Hirschl &AMP; Adler Modern in 1990. Organized
by Dan Cameron, senior curator at the New Museum, it is a must-see
for anyone interested in the intertwining histories of postmodern
(especially set-up) photography, fashion photography, commercial
illustration, the male nude in art and the emergence of a gay
sensibility _ histories in which Pierre et Gilles figure to a
greater or lesser degree, depending on who is talking.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that this show is too small to account for the
activities of this prolific duo, who are now in their 40s and have
been a couple and a collaborative team since 1976. (While they plan
the images and their often elaborate stagings together, Pierre, who
trained as a photographer, takes the pictures, while Gilles,
trained as a painter, applies the painted highlights; contrary to
appearances there is no digital work involved.) Over the last
quarter-century they have applied their peculiar mix of media, and
of camp and kitsch and sacred and erotic, to an ecumenical range of
media: album and magazine covers, fashion photography, commercial
illustration and celebrity portraiture.
</P>
<P>
   They have given us Catherine Deneuve as a fairy princess with a
painted-on tiara, Iggy Pop as a foppish visionary with a pancake
complexion and crazed blue eyes. They have portrayed friends,
models and stars as biblical and mythological characters ranging
from Adam and Eve to Medusa.
</P>
<P>
   They have revisited academic painting genres (the exotic beggar
boy, for example) and raided non-Western cultures _ the Indian
movie poster, for one. Repeatedly they have provided lavish updates
on the beefcake tradition, bringing an unusual mix of blatant
seductiveness and innocence to images of beautiful young men cast
as Roman centurions, Greek sea gods, hustlers, sailors and cowboys.
Throughout, they have had a thriving gallery career, at least in
Europe: however widely reproduced, their photographs are always one
of a kind and encased in elaborate, often glitzy custom-made
frames.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to another problem: this exhibition's seeming
intent to present the artists as avatars of the avant-garde and the
somewhat isolated atmosphere that results. Pierre et Gilles are
stars in France and Europe because of their fairly constant
presence in the mass media. But there is no sense of the media, of
the street, in this exhibition, even though some of the images on
view have appeared on magazine and album covers. It might have
helped if the catalog or the installation had provided a fuller,
messier sense of the context in which their work habitually
appears.
</P>
<P>
   The clean, lean installation certainly enables the visitor to
savor the peculiar hothouse intensity of the images, and until a
larger show comes along, to form a few opinions, not all of which
may be completely reconcilable.
</P>
<P>
   One opinion is that Pierre et Gilles, rather than being
avant-garde artists, are the sole occupants of a category of their
own devising, a hermetically sealed, time-warped middle ground
between high art and popular culture. From this vantage point they
have ignored both, pursuing a vision of otherworldly beauty steeped
in artifice and historical consciousness and charged with an erotic
current that is often but not always explicitly gay.
</P>
<P>
   They share concerns and characteristics with many other artists
of the 1970s and '80s, including Gilbert and George, Robert
Mapplethorpe, Annie Liebovitz, Yasumasa Morimura, Cindy Sherman and
Jeff Koons. Their elaborately staged images also stand as
precedents for younger photo artists like Gregory Crewdson,
Catherine Opie, Matthew Barney and Mariko Mori. Their emphasis on
idealized images of beautiful young men has undoubtedly influenced
the increased visibility of the male body in fashion photography.
</P>
<P>
   These connections don't alter their basic isolation. For one
thing, their work seems protected by a not-so-invisible shield of
artistic conservatism; it is deliberately, almost exultantly retro,
which may account for its popularity. Its retrievals don't so much
parody or revitalize forms like the hand-tinted photograph or
mass-produced images of saints as pay heartfelt homage to them or
simply embalm them. There is not, for example, a shred of irony in
the beatific, softly lighted image of a slim black man in a monk's
habit who portrays St. Martin, even though some of the animals
gathered around him look as though they came from the taxidermist.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at this show becomes a process of seeking out the works
that, like St. Martin, have escaped the embalming process for one
reason or another and managed to breathe as art objects. Sometimes
survival is mostly due to the subject's force of personality, as
with the imperious glare of Eliane Pine Caringhton, an artist who
stands before a deep orange wall draped in pearls, looking like
Coco Chanel on a good jewel day despite his 5 o'clock shadow. In
other instances the painting seems to take over completely. A
jaundiced Medusa backed by greenish feather-boa clouds achieves a
classic aura of evil because it is so thoroughly overpainted that
it resembles a lithograph and not a photograph of a real person at
all.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, a large recent image of a melancholy male nude in a
rocky grotto is effective because the mist that gives the image
such mysterious depth is clearly painted and stands out against the
photographic quality of the rest of the image. This sense of the
techniques of painting and photography being pulled far enough
apart that a perceptible gap exists between them also animates
``Dans le Port du Havre'' This image, which is hands down the
show's best, features an angelic young sailor up to his chest in
water rich with gleaming bubbles and the harbor lights and a florid
night sky behind him. Like the grotto image, it dates from 1998,
and it takes the indefatigable Pierre et Gilles into new territory
that they would do well to explore.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Are you a Donald Trump or a Mahatma Gandhi? Both have
reputations as highly persuasive leaders, but they display very
different operating styles.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Boyatzis, professor of organizational behavior at Case
Western Reserve University Weatherhead School of Management,
defines two distinct drives for power: personalized power, or
seeking influence for personal gain (Trump); and socialized power,
which is used to enhance the success of a group with shared
objectives (Gandhi).
</P>
<P>
   To be a persuasive leader, you need to be clear about which
model you choose to emulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask yourself why you are trying to exercise influence,''
Boyatzis suggests. ``Research shows that those whose drive is
toward socialized power are the ones who make the most effective
leaders and who get promoted over the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you know whether you're more Gandhi or Trump, there are
specific things you can do that will set you on the path of
effective leadership and mastery of the art of persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   CONNECT EMOTIONALLY
</P>
<P>
   Good persuaders feel their commitment to the position they are
advocating in their heart, mind and gut and can convey that to
others. They also have a strong and accurate sense of their
audience's emotional state and adjust the tone and approach of
their argument accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the business world, we like to think that our colleagues
use reason to make their decisions,'' Boyatzis writes. ``Yet if we
scratch below the surface, we will always find emotions at play.''
</P>
<P>
   But before you can connect with others, you need to understand
yourself. ``Try first to know what your strengths and limits are,''
advises Daniel Goleman, author of ``Working with Emotional
Intelligence.'' ``Get feedback from people you work with who know
you well. You'll find a difference between what you think you're
good at and what others think you're good at.''
</P>
<P>
   Developing self-awareness takes time. To find out how you really
feel about things that are going on in your business day, take
regular time-outs. Nothing can replace the insights gained during
periods of quiet reflection.
</P>
<P>
   FIND THE COMMON GROUND
</P>
<P>
   Frame your position so it appeals strongly to the people you
want to persuade. You can do this by knowing what they are thinking
and what their concerns are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch Kenneth Branagh in `Henry V,''' suggests Murray M.
Dalziel, global managing director of Organizational Effectiveness
and Management Development Services for the Hay Group
(Philadelphia). ``Henry dresses up as a foot soldier, wanders
around to campfires and constructs his speech out of what he learns
there.''
</P>
<P>
   DEVELOP YOUR COMMUNICATION SKILLS
</P>
<P>
   Use vivid language and compelling evidence to reinforce your
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of every conversation as a dramatic presentation,''
Boyatzis says. ``You don't excite people by giving them factual
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Employ different strategies and tools to get your point across,
such as stories, anecdotes and authoritative sources. When one
approach isn't working, switch to another.
</P>
<P>
   ESTABLISH YOUR CREDIBILITY
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstones of credibility are expertise and relationships
built on trust, according to Harry Mills, author of ``Artful
Persuasion: How to Command Attention, Change Minds, and Influence
People.''
</P>
<P>
   When leaders lack them, Mills says, ``we discount everything
they say.''
</P>
<P>
   How do you establish trust? By making commitments and fulfilling
them. For Mills, trust begins with the ``law of candor.'' He
advises telling the truth _ suitably packaged, of course, but the
truth nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Establish trusting relationships both within and beyond your
organization. Join community groups and professional organizations
to build your networking skills. People need to feel you care about
them and their growth. Become a mentor _ get involved in coaching
and counseling others.
</P>
<P>
   BECOME AN EFFECTIVE TEAM BUILDER
</P>
<P>
   Practice running small groups with meaningful content. Take
workshops in group processing and get feedback in all settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When in a group setting, part of your job is to make sure
people are inspired, involved, committed to something important,''
Boyatzis emphasizes.
</P>
<P>
   Also, know how to build a coalition of support so you know who
to go to when you need to make a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Learn to negotiate and manage conflict. According to Boyatzis, a
course in alternative dispute resolution can develop the skills to
help people in the middle of conflict. ``This is a very
sophisticated skill, especially if your emotions are aroused and
you need to calm everybody down,'' he says.

 FROM: HARVARD MANAGEMENT UPDATE  
 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Management theory underscores the virtues of taking risks and
learning from failure. Management practice is behind the curve. The
dynamics of failure are poorly understood. Nobody likes to fail,
and nobody seems to learn much from it.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, professors Amy Edmondson and Dorothy Leonard of
Harvard Business School and Mark Cannon of Vanderbilt University
developed a concept they call ``failing forward.'' Drawing from a
study of 51 work groups in a midsized manufacturing company, they
explain that failing forward is ``the ability to fail intelligently
and respond constructively to failure so that the potential
learning is captured.'' It includes four essential activities:
</P>
<P>
   DELIBERATE EXPERIMENTATION
</P>
<P>
   ``Organizations that are not experiencing small failures on a
regular basis are probably not experimenting enough and not
learning enough,'' write Edmondson and Cannon in an as-yet
unpublished paper. Effective experimentation tests a variety of
hypotheses.
</P>
<P>
   BMW and other auto companies, for instance, use simulation
technology to test cars' crashworthiness. They can thereby
experiment with a wider range of risks than if they used expensive
cars and dummies for every test.
</P>
<P>
   ENGAGING IN `CREATIVE ABRASION'
</P>
<P>
   This concept, developed by Leonard, takes people with a mix of
differences _ in expertise, training, education, background and
cognitive preferences _ and engages them in a constructive thought
process that maximizes those differences. When an experiment
``fails,'' an intellectually diverse group can frame and analyze
the outcome in ways that wring value from the experience.
</P>
<P>
   EXPOSING FAILURE
</P>
<P>
   You can't learn anything when failures ``are either covered up
or never materialize in the first place because people have not put
their ideas to a test,'' Edmonson and Cannon write. What's more,
``errors must be surfaced before they are compounded, incorporated
into larger systems, and become irrevocable.''
</P>
<P>
   Try to identify the failure as early and efficiently as
possible. ``The sooner a failure is identified, the sooner the
potential learning ... can take place and the less investment goes
toward an unproductive end.''
</P>
<P>
   ANALYZING FAILURE THOROUGHLY
</P>
<P>
   High quality ``arises from an organizational system that
actively seeks out problems and determines how they may be avoided
in the future,'' the two researchers observe. Avoid placing blame.
Rather, create a system that discovers the causes of the errors and
prevents them from recurring.
</P>
<P>
   The theory may be straightforward, but it's difficult to
implement. Most organizations are allergic to failure and tend to
penalize employees associated with it. Little wonder that employees
are loathe to ask the difficult questions at the beginning of a
project or conduct a comprehensive post-project review. The risks
to their careers are too great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore,'' Edmondson observes, ``they tend to play not to
lose instead of playing to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Can things be different? Yes, according to Edmonson, provided
``managers learn how to be more concrete and less abstract than
people typically are in the way they ask questions and give
direction.'' For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ Demonstrate the kind of openness you'd like to see. Employees
may engage in constructive criticism of a project _ or even admit
their own mistakes _ when they see a manager do the same.
</P>
<P>
   _ Create ``practice fields.'' Peter Senge, author of the
best-selling book ``The Fifth Discipline,'' observes that
management is the only profession that affords no opportunity for
practice or rehearsal _ it's 100 percent live performance. Try to
create situations in which employees can experiment, whether it's
through computer-based simulations or offsite seminars.
</P>
<P>
   When managers create the psychological conditions that ease
employees' fear of failure, the potential for learning increases
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of nursing teams in a major hospital, for example,
Edmondson found that when the nurse manager was open, encouraging
and respected, the entire team was more open to exploring the
possibility of errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first glance,'' she explains, ``the results looked as
though the teams with the more respected nurse managers were making
more errors. But they were only reporting more errors: They had a
higher intercept rate, which meant they were catching more errors
and therefore averting more potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, these teams discovered systematic errors
occurring with a particular type of intravenous pump. This
discovery led the hospital to order a different kind of pump.''

 &HT;    Bob Costas: Pumped, prepped and at the helm
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Costas, bright-eyed and bearing tons of useful and
not-so-useful information, will bound kangaroolike into our living
rooms for a two-week visit beginning tonight.
</P>
<P>
   As anchor of NBC's prime-time telecasts of the Summer Olympics,
Costas will spend 162 1/2 hours on the air, starting with tonight's
4 1/2-hour coverage of the Opening Ceremony in Sydney. This is his
fourth Olympics for NBC and third as prime-time host. It would not
be stretching the truth to say he enjoys these assignments quite a
lot. His first love may be baseball, but the Olympic Games get his
blood pumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the appeal of the Olympics,'' Costas said in a recent
teleconference, ``is that it's an international adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Costas is legendary for his Olympics preparation. In
anticipation of the Atlanta Games, he pored through hundreds of
books, profiles and interviews. He's done the same thing this time,
prepping himself for an event that is equal parts sports
competition, human drama and travelogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The setting is always important,'' Costas said. ``To an
American audience, there's absolutely no intrigue about showing
scenes from Atlanta. But in Barcelona in '92, there was a
travelogue element. ... It was almost impossible to show an event
in Barcelona without the backdrop looking like a picture
postcard.''
</P>
<P>
   Costas' boss, NBC sports executive producer Dick Ebersol, calls
Sydney ``the best place the Olympics have ever been.'' The natural
beauty of the land Down Under, coupled with the intimacy of the
various venues, make for another potentially ``picture postcard''
setting. Americans are keenly interested in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the No. 1 destination for American tourist travelers,''
said coordinating producer Lisa Lax, ``and we're going to make sure
we show off the country.''
</P>
<P>
   `Our mantra is storytelling'
</P>
<P>
   The goal of NBC's Olympics coverage, as always, is to connect
viewers, especially those who may not be sports fiends, with
athletes from all over the world. ABC perfected the art with the
``Up Close and Personals'' created by sports producing genius Roone
Arledge and delivered by avuncular host Jim McKay in the 1960s and
'70s, and the tradition has continued ever since from year to year
and network to network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mantra is storytelling, and we do that primarily through
telling these unique, individual stories,'' Lax said.
</P>
<P>
   The profiles are now part of the Olympics experience because
they are such a big part of the TV experience. The theory is that
to know the athletes is to love them, and to love them is to want
to watch them _ whether they're racing around a track, spiking a
volleyball or pressing a few hundred pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be aware that 95 percent of the competitors who
come to an Olympic Games are not aspiring professionals who will
become fabulously wealthy,'' said Costas, 48, and still oozing
boyish charm and enthusiasm. ``This is their be-all and end-all.''
</P>
<P>
   Costas has had a happy, healthy career covering professional
baseball, basketball, football and hockey _ team sports that
function on yearly cycles, often with the same participants
returning from year to year. Famous folks, popular sports. For most
Olympic athletes, the once-in-a-lifetime experience raises the
competition to a heightened level that Costas finds thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of the preparation, the sacrifice and the anticipation
that go into that moment,'' Costas said, nearly breathless at the
prospect. ``And the nature of many events is that they are very
quick _ boom, it's over in 10, 20 seconds. Those moments have such
clarity, and knowing that the world is watching brings everything
to a peak. That's tremendous sports drama.''
</P>
<P>
   And although American viewers may have never heard of athletes
from other countries, sometimes these lesser-knowns have a greater
impact than our home-grown stars such as Michael Johnson and Marion
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``An athlete, such as a runner from Ethiopia, can lift the whole
country's spirit,'' Costas said. ``That's the way it works at the
Olympics, and I find that compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours and hours of coverage
</P>
<P>
   NBC's prime-time coverage is being touted by the network as the
``traditional family coverage,'' featuring premiere events such as
track and field, gymnastics, swimming and diving. And lots of
profiles. NBC's cable outlets, MSNBC and CNBC, are targeting more
ardent sports enthusiasts with a total of 279 hours of
wall-to-wall, start-to-finish coverage of team sports and boxing.
And for the total sports fanatic, there's NBCOlympics.com, which
will be laden with statistics and other insider sports stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the Complete Olympics,'' Costas said of the
whopping 441 total hours planned on the Peacock's broadcast, cable
and Internet empire.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the 15- to 18-hour time difference between Australia
and the United States, all of NBC's coverage will be tape-delayed.
The network figured very few viewers would watch the main events at
3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney Games are the first of five Olympics that NBC won the
rights to televise with a bid of $5 billion for the package, $705
million for the 2000 Summer Olympiad. Unless a koala kidnaps him in
Australia, we can probably expect to see Costas at the helm of at
least a couple more.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Are you a Donald Trump or a Mahatma Gandhi? Both have
reputations as highly persuasive leaders, but they display very
different operating styles.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Boyatzis, professor of organizational behavior at Case
Western Reserve University Weatherhead School of Management,
defines two distinct drives for power: personalized power, or
seeking influence for personal gain (Trump); and socialized power,
which is used to enhance the success of a group with shared
objectives (Gandhi).
</P>
<P>
   To be a persuasive leader, you need to be clear about which
model you choose to emulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask yourself why you are trying to exercise influence,''
Boyatzis suggests. ``Research shows that those whose drive is
toward socialized power are the ones who make the most effective
leaders and who get promoted over the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you know whether you're more Gandhi or Trump, there are
specific things you can do that will set you on the path of
effective leadership and mastery of the art of persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   CONNECT EMOTIONALLY
</P>
<P>
   Good persuaders feel their commitment to the position they are
advocating in their heart, mind and gut and can convey that to
others. They also have a strong and accurate sense of their
audience's emotional state and adjust the tone and approach of
their argument accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the business world, we like to think that our colleagues
use reason to make their decisions,'' Boyatzis writes. ``Yet if we
scratch below the surface, we will always find emotions at play.''
</P>
<P>
   But before you can connect with others, you need to understand
yourself. ``Try first to know what your strengths and limits are,''
advises Daniel Goleman, author of ``Working with Emotional
Intelligence.'' ``Get feedback from people you work with who know
you well. You'll find a difference between what you think you're
good at and what others think you're good at.''
</P>
<P>
   Developing self-awareness takes time. To find out how you really
feel about things that are going on in your business day, take
regular time-outs. Nothing can replace the insights gained during
periods of quiet reflection.
</P>
<P>
   FIND THE COMMON GROUND
</P>
<P>
   Frame your position so it appeals strongly to the people you
want to persuade. You can do this by knowing what they are thinking
and what their concerns are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch Kenneth Branagh in `Henry V,''' suggests Murray M.
Dalziel, global managing director of Organizational Effectiveness
and Management Development Services for the Hay Group
(Philadelphia). ``Henry dresses up as a foot soldier, wanders
around to campfires and constructs his speech out of what he learns
there.''
</P>
<P>
   DEVELOP YOUR COMMUNICATION SKILLS
</P>
<P>
   Use vivid language and compelling evidence to reinforce your
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of every conversation as a dramatic presentation,''
Boyatzis says. ``You don't excite people by giving them factual
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Employ different strategies and tools to get your point across,
such as stories, anecdotes and authoritative sources. When one
approach isn't working, switch to another.
</P>
<P>
   ESTABLISH YOUR CREDIBILITY
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstones of credibility are expertise and relationships
built on trust, according to Harry Mills, author of ``Artful
Persuasion: How to Command Attention, Change Minds, and Influence
People.''
</P>
<P>
   When leaders lack them, Mills says, ``we discount everything
they say.''
</P>
<P>
   How do you establish trust? By making commitments and fulfilling
them. For Mills, trust begins with the ``law of candor.'' He
advises telling the truth _ suitably packaged, of course, but the
truth nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Establish trusting relationships both within and beyond your
organization. Join community groups and professional organizations
to build your networking skills. People need to feel you care about
them and their growth. Become a mentor _ get involved in coaching
and counseling others.
</P>
<P>
   BECOME AN EFFECTIVE TEAM BUILDER
</P>
<P>
   Practice running small groups with meaningful content. Take
workshops in group processing and get feedback in all settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When in a group setting, part of your job is to make sure
people are inspired, involved, committed to something important,''
Boyatzis emphasizes.
</P>
<P>
   Also, know how to build a coalition of support so you know who
to go to when you need to make a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Learn to negotiate and manage conflict. According to Boyatzis, a
course in alternative dispute resolution can develop the skills to
help people in the middle of conflict. ``This is a very
sophisticated skill, especially if your emotions are aroused and
you need to calm everybody down,'' he says.

 FROM: HARVARD MANAGEMENT UPDATE  
 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Management theory underscores the virtues of taking risks and
learning from failure. Management practice is behind the curve. The
dynamics of failure are poorly understood. Nobody likes to fail,
and nobody seems to learn much from it.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, professors Amy Edmondson and Dorothy Leonard of
Harvard Business School and Mark Cannon of Vanderbilt University
developed a concept they call ``failing forward.'' Drawing from a
study of 51 work groups in a midsized manufacturing company, they
explain that failing forward is ``the ability to fail intelligently
and respond constructively to failure so that the potential
learning is captured.'' It includes four essential activities:
</P>
<P>
   DELIBERATE EXPERIMENTATION
</P>
<P>
   ``Organizations that are not experiencing small failures on a
regular basis are probably not experimenting enough and not
learning enough,'' write Edmondson and Cannon in an as-yet
unpublished paper. Effective experimentation tests a variety of
hypotheses.
</P>
<P>
   BMW and other auto companies, for instance, use simulation
technology to test cars' crashworthiness. They can thereby
experiment with a wider range of risks than if they used expensive
cars and dummies for every test.
</P>
<P>
   ENGAGING IN `CREATIVE ABRASION'
</P>
<P>
   This concept, developed by Leonard, takes people with a mix of
differences _ in expertise, training, education, background and
cognitive preferences _ and engages them in a constructive thought
process that maximizes those differences. When an experiment
``fails,'' an intellectually diverse group can frame and analyze
the outcome in ways that wring value from the experience.
</P>
<P>
   EXPOSING FAILURE
</P>
<P>
   You can't learn anything when failures ``are either covered up
or never materialize in the first place because people have not put
their ideas to a test,'' Edmonson and Cannon write. What's more,
``errors must be surfaced before they are compounded, incorporated
into larger systems, and become irrevocable.''
</P>
<P>
   Try to identify the failure as early and efficiently as
possible. ``The sooner a failure is identified, the sooner the
potential learning ... can take place and the less investment goes
toward an unproductive end.''
</P>
<P>
   ANALYZING FAILURE THOROUGHLY
</P>
<P>
   High quality ``arises from an organizational system that
actively seeks out problems and determines how they may be avoided
in the future,'' the two researchers observe. Avoid placing blame.
Rather, create a system that discovers the causes of the errors and
prevents them from recurring.
</P>
<P>
   The theory may be straightforward, but it's difficult to
implement. Most organizations are allergic to failure and tend to
penalize employees associated with it. Little wonder that employees
are loathe to ask the difficult questions at the beginning of a
project or conduct a comprehensive post-project review. The risks
to their careers are too great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore,'' Edmondson observes, ``they tend to play not to
lose instead of playing to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Can things be different? Yes, according to Edmonson, provided
``managers learn how to be more concrete and less abstract than
people typically are in the way they ask questions and give
direction.'' For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ Demonstrate the kind of openness you'd like to see. Employees
may engage in constructive criticism of a project _ or even admit
their own mistakes _ when they see a manager do the same.
</P>
<P>
   _ Create ``practice fields.'' Peter Senge, author of the
best-selling book ``The Fifth Discipline,'' observes that
management is the only profession that affords no opportunity for
practice or rehearsal _ it's 100 percent live performance. Try to
create situations in which employees can experiment, whether it's
through computer-based simulations or offsite seminars.
</P>
<P>
   When managers create the psychological conditions that ease
employees' fear of failure, the potential for learning increases
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of nursing teams in a major hospital, for example,
Edmondson found that when the nurse manager was open, encouraging
and respected, the entire team was more open to exploring the
possibility of errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first glance,'' she explains, ``the results looked as
though the teams with the more respected nurse managers were making
more errors. But they were only reporting more errors: They had a
higher intercept rate, which meant they were catching more errors
and therefore averting more potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, these teams discovered systematic errors
occurring with a particular type of intravenous pump. This
discovery led the hospital to order a different kind of pump.''

 &HT;    Put away welcome mat for opossums
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: We live in the country and are having a
problem with an opossum eating our cat's food and drinking his
water. He is about the size of a full-grown cat. My question is,
does he pose any health concerns if he and our cat share the same
water bowl or food bowl? Should I provide him with his own bowls?
The cat has had a few run-ins with him also.
</P>
<P>
   _ K.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Not really.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opossums do have some parasites, but transmission does not
occur at the food bowls,'' notes Texas A&AMP;M veterinarian David
Phalen. What should concern you is the chance your cat could be
bitten by the opossum, he warns. Opossums dine on dead things, and
their bite may transmit bacteria, leaving your cat with an infected
wound.
</P>
<P>
   Reconsider making the opossum so welcome. Can you feed the cat
inside?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you help me procure the address of film great Steven
Spielberg? This is business-related, not personal.

   Q: We were given a piece of Texas pink granite as a gift from a
man in Marble Falls to use as a countertop in our kitchen. It has a
smooth, shiny surface, but it still has lots of natural cracks and
indentations. Do we need to do anything before we use it? Do we
just set it as is on top of the laminate countertop? Also, do we
need to wax the surface to fill in those indentations? Use special
cleaners? Can we slice, dice, chop and scrub on this surface _ or
do we need to be careful?
</P>
<P>
   _ Jane U. &AMP; Jim D.
</P>
<P>
   A:You are going to love this countertop! Safely slice, dice and
set pots directly from the stove on it. No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Stone Works' Myrna Gonzalez advises removing the current
laminate and placing the granite directly on the counter supports.
Use Liquid Nails to secure the top and caulk the edges. Use a
standard sealer on the surface. The nicks and cracks give the
granite character. Simple soap and water keeps granite countertops
in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   Granite's enemy? Grease. If you do spill grease, wipe it up
promptly before it soaks into this natural stone.
Upshot/Update/Uproar:Cleaning out your closet? The Boys and Girls
Clubs of the Capital Area would love to have your old men's shirts
_ short or long sleeve. Any color. Any size. The clubs' fine arts
classes need these old shirts to use as smocks. While you are
cleaning out the closet, consider donating any art supplies _ clay,
paintbrushes, etc. Drop donations off at 303 W. Johanna St. or
contact fine arts director Alyx Kellington at 444-7199. Who knows?
You may be sparking the career of the next Auguste Rodin or Mary
Cassatt.

HOME VIDEO NOTES AND NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New VHS and DVD editions of ``This is Spinal Tap,'' Rob Reiner's
1984 parody of a rock documentary, were released on Tuesday, but
some of the better entertainment issued this week can be found in
two new series from the silent era: ``First Ladies: Early Women
Filmmakers 1915-25'' from Kino and ``Equal Time: The Women of
Cinema'' from Milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Good silent films hold surprises, not least the people who made
them. In the earliest days strong women frequently produced and
directed what they also wrote and starred in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women were allowed to work because there weren't great profits
to be made yet in that industry,'' said Dennis Doros, president of
Milestone, a distributor of classic films.
</P>
<P>
   Once the money got better in the 1930s, men asserted themselves
and professional life became more complicated for women like
Dorothy Davenport Reid, the producer and co-director of ``The Red
Kimona'' (1925), about a young girl who is tricked into becoming a
prostitute in New Orleans and murders her pimp.
</P>
<P>
   The Kino series includes five films, all of them preserved by
the motion picture department at the Library of Congress. The four
others are ``The Ocean Waif'' by Alice Guy-Blache, one of the first
directors of either sex, who had made more than 700 shorts and
features by 1916; ``49-17,'' a western satire by Ruth Ann Baldwin;
``Eleanor's Catch'' (1916), a two-reeler by Cleo Madison about
still another young woman done in by a lowdown man; and
``Hypocrites'' (1915), written, directed and produced by Lois
Weber.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague of Guy-Blache, Weber was known for her moral
crusades. In ``Hypocrites'' the subject was ``the naked truth'' as
envisioned by a hand-wringing religious ascetic and sculptor who,
inspired by a woman scampering in the buff, renders a nude statue
of same. On its unveiling, the good citizens, all cheats and
perverts, to judge by Weber's interpretation, are shocked.
</P>
<P>
   Notes on the cassette box call the film ``amazingly complex.''
Bizarre, too. ``Definitely off the wall,'' said Jessica Rosner of
Kino. ``That's real nudity. If you look closely, you can see
everything.'' In Boston, clothes had to be painted on the woman
before the film was distributed.
</P>
<P>
   The Milestone series moves on to the talkies with ``The Gay
Desperado'' (1936), starring Ida Lupino, and Mervyn LeRoy's
``Tonight or Never'' (1931), with Gloria Swanson as an opera diva
who has lost the passion for her work. But there are also Frances
Marion's silent ``Love Light'' (1921), with Mary Pickford as a
betrayed wife, a role intended to change her her little-girl image,
and two silent films by Nell Shipman, ``Back to God's Country''
(1919) and ``Something New'' (1920).
</P>
<P>
   Shipman, a conservationist, set her two films in northern Canada
and the Mojave desert, respectively. ``She did action films,''
Doros said. In ``Something New'' the heroine (Shipman), her
boyfriend and her collie, Laddie, escape mounted bandits across
rocky terrain in a Maxwell sedan, a forerunner of the sport utility
vehicle.

For the Kino tapes, call (800) 562-3330.

with Robert is fine and another love interest appears for Pamela,

Alice, who eventually ends up in jail and turns coldly critical of
her own life with her husband (David Strathairn). But Scott

been better had it clung to that toughness, rather than showing how
Alice's stay in jail makes jail a better place'' (Janet Maslin).

 &HT;    The man with the answers at Highlights
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Barchas
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If you ask Jack Myers a question, you'll likely
be met with silence. As senior science editor at Highlights for
Children magazine, his job is to answer queries, but he never
purports to know all the answers. Instead, he pauses. Mentally
chews on words, thoughts, ideas. Thinks about what to say, how to
say it, why it's so. And then, just as you think he didn't hear
you, or perhaps doesn't know, he delivers an answer.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it's been for 40 years, when Myers first began
responding to children's science questions in the magazine his
parents, Garry and Caroline Myers, founded. At the time, Myers was
a professor of zoology and botany at the University of Texas with
no experience catering to the under-12 audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pop was of a mind that, `You can do this. You're a
scientist aren't you?''' Myers said. ``I have to admit that my
first attempts were pretty lousy.''
</P>
<P>
   Years of experience addressing everything from how cats purr to
why snakes flick their tongues honed Myers' skill in writing for
children and taught him some tricks along the way. He uses
analogies to help readers understand a difficult science topic
through something they're already familiar with, and his vocabulary
is finely tuned kid-friendly without being condescending. When he
talks about an upcoming Highlights article on why there are no
giant insects, for example, Myers becomes especially animated.
``The answer is that an insect doesn't have a very good breathing
mechanism,'' he said. ``It works OK for the little guys, but it
won't work for the big guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Replying to children occupied much of Myers' time, but he also
managed to pursue some questions of his own. A renowned expert on
photosynthesis, Myers developed a method of studying algae in a
closed environment that is now used at labs across the world. He
was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1975, and
continues to stay abreast of new advancements by reading several
journals in his office at UT. It was only last year that he finally
gave up his research lab at the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had things in it that I built and made myself and used for
50 years, so that's kind of hard to walk away from,'' he said.
``But it's also true that a university can't provide laboratories
for old guys to play around, so when I wasn't really learning
anything new, it was time for me to fold up, and that's what I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   But Myers keeps busy addressing the dozen or so science
questions that come to Highlights each month, and he recently
published his seventh book of short essays about animals, ``What
Happened to the Mammoths?'' (Boyds Mill Press, $17.95). ``Kids deal
in pure curiosity,'' Myers said. ``I know that if you want to grab
them, talk about big, furry animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers responds to every question sent his way and digs into his
memory trove of scientific knowledge and his collection of
textbooks and journals to find the answers. If an explanation is
especially elusive, he'll turn to scientist friends for help,
including Norman Hackerman, who worked with Myers at UT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get together over coffee and talk about all kinds of
things,'' Hackerman said. ``Science, world affairs, the heat, where
are you going to park on campus and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at age 87, Myers has no plans to stop writing for the
magazine. He works closely with Andy Boyles, the Highlights science
editor, in approving essay contributions and editing stories, and
he's involved in all major decision with the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past 40 or 50 years Jack has shaped the way we do
science at Highlights,'' Boyles said. ``If we're ever going to take
a new direction and try something different, we touch base and see
what he thinks about it.'' Boyles said Myers is the most highly
respected member of the company, especially as he continues to
remain so active. ``I know it's hard for me to keep up with him,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Myers has been tackling kids' questions long enough to notice
trends, and while technology and new research continually alter the
fluid scientific world, he says the things that interest children
have remained fairly constant. The most frequent question he
receives is: ``When I take a warm bath, why do my hands crinkle
up?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are still taking baths like they did before,'' Myers
said. ``I don't think much has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Wholesome fun
</P>
<P>
   This could be a theme for the entire Highlights magazine
business. The family-owned corporation has managed to satisfy
generations of children with the same ``wholesome fun'' it used
from the very beginning, like twins Goofus and Gallant who teach
proper manners and Hidden Pictures that require concentration.
</P>
<P>
   The family element has always been important to Highlights,
based in Honesdale, Pa., and Columbus, Ohio. When Garry Myers, a
child psychologist who had written a syndicated newspaper column
about parenting, and Caroline Clark Myers, who had been involved in
family welfare causes, announced they were going to start their own
magazine, their children were ready to help where necessary. They
printed an initial batch of 20,000 copies of Highlights in 1946,
trying to captivate children _ and their parents _ by relying on
fun games and stories with a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling magazine was suffering business-wise in 1954, so
Myers' brother, Garry Jr., moved his family to Ohio to help save
Highlights. ``It was the gutsy thing that an engineer would do,''
Myers said. ``You know, engineers figure there isn't any problem
they can't handle.'' In just a few years, Highlights was a
self-supporting entity, and now there are more than 2 million
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the business became a full-fledged success, Garry Jr.
and his wife died when a United Airlines flight collided with
another plane over New York in 1960, leaving their five children
orphaned and the family devastated. With four daughters of their
own, Myers and his wife, Evelyn, welcomed the nephews and nieces,
ranging from ages 8 to 15, into their already full home on Lake
Travis. ``People always tell you what a wonderful thing that was to
do, but the facts of life are you just do it because it was
something you needed to do,'' Myers said. ``Every family has its
own culture and putting them together was pretty hard, but we all
worked at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong family foundation and common dedication to Highlights
helped keep the Myers clan on track. ``It was a traumatic time in
our lives, but he gave us lots of attention and he was a very good
father figure,'' said Fred Myers, a nephew who was 8 when he came
to live with the family. ``There's a sense of mission about the
magazine in the family and it keeps us all involved.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the current editor of Highlights is Myers' nephew, and
many family members serve on the board of directors. Every year,
they gather in Pennsylvania for a family council meeting to discuss
the magazine. As the oldest living member of the family, Myers'
opinion is highly valued. ``He's definitely the man that everyone
looks up to for advice in the company,'' said Myers' granddaughter
Carrie Holland. ``Whenever I have a question about something he's
the first person I would think to ask because he has such a great
knowledge about things.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Jack
</P>
<P>
   Even nonfamily members in the company regard Myers fondly,
calling him Uncle Jack around the office. ``The editorial staff
here has great respect for Jack as a scientist and an editor and a
writer who speaks to kids in a very honest, forthright way, and we
also have great affection for him,'' said Chris Clark, managing
editor of Highlights. ``He is just a wonderful man, and you always
have the sense that he is going to be very fair with you, even if
it means telling you your judgment's flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   While Myers' research and accomplishments earn respect from
family and friends, what really stands out about him, they say, is
his sense of humor. After raising four daughters he has plenty of
jokes about being outnumbered in a house full of women _ ``It
doesn't take them long to convince you that you have to put the
toilet seat down,'' he said _ and his deep belly laugh completely
envelops listeners. ``Daddy starts every single day with the funny
papers,'' said Myers' oldest daughter, Shirley Wendlandt. ``That's
the first thing he reads, before the news or anything else, and he
almost always finds something to really laugh out loud about.''
</P>
<P>
   This genuine joy for life stems from the fact that he's had a
great one, Myers said. He had such a fulfilling career at UT he
says he often can't understand it when he asks older people how
they stay busy and they say they worked all their lives so they
could retire and do nothing. ``I'm very grateful for being so
lucky,'' Myers said. ``I am grateful that I could be part of a
family endeavor, and that I had 60 years with a great lady who was
my wife. I was able to work as a scientist in an era which I think
was the golden age of science. There was always another challenge
because there was always another question.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Myers to stop answering them anytime soon.

WHO SAYS PLAYS DON'T PAY? ITEMS ON `THE UNEXPECTED MAN,' `THE

WIFE,' `SEUSSICAL,' `REFERENCES TO SALVADOR DALI MAKE ME HOT,'
`JESUS HOPPED THE A TRAIN,' AND `COBB.'

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Continuing a winning streak from last year, when the
plays ``Copenhagen,'' ``Dirty Blonde,'' and ``True West'' all did
big business, two new dramatic entries were ringing up impressive
numbers at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   The first was the Off Broadway production of ``The Unexpected
Man,'' at the Promenade Theater. The play, by Yasmina Reza, author
of the Broadway hit ``Art,'' racked up some $55,000 on Monday, its
first full day of sales. Tuesday's take was $63,000. By Wednesday
the daily tally topped $75,000, all before the show has run a
single advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   All of which left the show's producers as happy _ and bewildered
_ as lottery winners. ``If I could tell you with confidence why
these things happen,'' said Ben Sprecher, one of the producers, ``I
would only produce shows where this happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The hot ticket could be attributed to the popularity of ``Art,''
or to the appeal of the play's two stars, Eileen Atkins and Alan
Bates, who play strangers on a train. Whatever the reason, the
early take will surely help mitigate some of the expense from the
production's elaborate design, which includes some four tons of
gravel and a suspended glass floor. The sales will also probably
fan speculation that ``Man'' might jump to Broadway if the 399-seat
Promenade proves too small to accommodate audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man'' wasn't the only play that got out of the gate quickly
this week. ``The Dinner Party,'' the new comedy from Neil Simon,
also posted impressive first-day sales, taking in more than
$100,000 on Monday. It joins two other Broadway plays with good to
great sales: ``The Best Man,'' whose producers say has a $1.2
million advance, and ``The Tale of the Allergist's Wife,'' which is
nearing the $2 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, none of the productions _ except ``Tale,'' which had
an acclaimed Off Broadway run last spring _ have met the New York
critics, and advances can evaporate as quickly as they came, if new
sales don't materialize to refill the till.

   THING 1 AND THING 2
</P>
<P>
   Revisions of the forthcoming Broadway musical ``Seussical'' were
under way in Boston this week, with a wide range of tweaks and
structural changes, primarily in the second act and primarily to
clarify the musical's story.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Weissler, one of the show's producers, said revamping was
commonplace for a new musical. ``I've never done a show out of town
that didn't require changes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the changes were being mulled well before Boston critics
gave the show mixed notices last week. Two of next week's
performances were canceled to allow time for rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   Weissler dismissed rumors that David Shiner, who plays the Cat
in the Hat, would be replaced, though he said some of Shiner's
blocking had been altered to gel with the show's overall tone.
``David brings an edge to the show,'' Weissler said, ``and a
certain artistic danger.''
</P>
<P>
   `I'M A BIG GIRL'
</P>
<P>
   When producers first began to call Rosie Perez several years ago
to offer her roles onstage, her reaction wasn't exactly what they
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' she said. ``I felt I was nowhere near ready.''
</P>
<P>
   But last spring George C. Wolfe, the artistic director of the
Public Theater, found a part for which he felt Perez might be
perfect. His only worry was it might be ``too weird'' for her.
Again her response was something of a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Don't insult my intelligence, George,''' Perez
recalled, with a laugh. ``I'm a big girl.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is that Perez will appear next spring in the premiere of
``References to Salvador Dali Make Me Hot,'' a surreal-sounding
play by Jose Rivera that features actors in the characters of the
moon and a coyote. Perez will play an unhappy wife opposite John
Ortiz, the rising actor who will also be seen this fall in ``Jesus
Hopped the A Train.'' (See below.) Performances for ``Dali'' are to
begin in March.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, 36, a Brooklyn native whose only other New York stage
experience was a short stint in ``The Vagina Monologues,'' said she
was still nervous about her debut. But she added that acting in New
York was what she wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to do L.A., but I have too little patience,'' she
said, ``and too much attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOORAY FOR HOLLYWOOD  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A couple of Off Off Broadway companies are learning how nice it
can be to have well-known, and well-connected, friends.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the Melting Pot theater, which confirmed this week
that its production of ``Cobb,'' the 1989 Lee Blessing drama about
Ty Cobb, would move to a commercial run at the Lucille Lortel
Theater in Greenwich Village. Performances begin in late October.
</P>
<P>
   The move is being financed largely by Kevin Spacey, who saw the
show last May then paid for a two-week extension for the production
and urged other producers to take a look. He had originally come to
see ``Cobb'' because it starred Matthew Mabe, who was an understudy
last year in ``The Iceman Cometh,'' in which Spacey played the
central role.
</P>
<P>
   Across town the Labyrinth Theater Company was also preparing for
its first commercial transfer: ``Jesus Hopped the A Train,'' the
prison drama by Stephen Adly Guirgis about a pair of Rikers Island
thugs.
</P>
<P>
   The production had short run over the summer but has since been
optioned by two commercial producers, Ron Kastner and Roy Gabay,
who have a professional connection to the show's director, Philip
Seymour Hoffman. Kastner was the lead producer of last spring's
runaway hit ``True West,'' in which Hoffman received a Tony
nomination for his performance. Gabay was that show's general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial run is to begin previews on Nov. 21 and open a
week later at the East 13th Street Theater in the East Village, the
home of the Classic Stage Co.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, 33, joined that company about five years ago after
doing a production of ``The Merchant of Venice'' with Ortiz in
Chicago. Last year he directed ``In Arabia, We'd All Be Kings,''
also by Guirgis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his writing has gotten a lot stronger,'' Hoffman said.
``And as he matures, I think the whole company matures. And I think
it's a great kind of evolution.''

DISNEY TO INTRODUCE A REVAMPED GO.COM 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Go.Com is starting up again after a nine-month pit stop.
</P>
<P>
   Go, which was Walt Disney Co.'s attempt to build an Internet
portal to take on the likes of Yahoo, will start testing a new
design starting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For users, it's a much leaner model, focused almost entirely on
searching, rather than the complex, all-purpose vehicle of Go's
previous design. As a business, think NASCAR, not Formula One, as
the site is covered with more and bigger ads than any of its
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Go.Com _ and the broader concept of the Go Network linking all
of Disney's online efforts _ was started with great fanfare in
December 1998. Disney owned ESPN.Com, the top-rated sports side;
Disney.com, the No. 1 site for children; ABCNews.com, the No. 3
news site; and a controlling interest in Infoseek, a popular search
engine and portal.
</P>
<P>
   Disney figured that all of its content, combined with promotion
on ABC television network and other properties, would give Go a
lift that Yahoo and the others did not have. Although Go vaulted to
No. 6 in the ratings it has lost audience share as Yahoo, America
Online and Microsoft's MSN have grown briskly.
</P>
<P>
   Disney is hardly alone in finding the portal business to be
difficult. Next Month, NBC's internet affiliate is expected to
introduce its new redesigned portal, NBCi.Com, with a focus on
automatically filtering information from the Internet to meet each
user's interests.
</P>
<P>
   For Disney, one of the biggest changes is that its various sites
are not trying as hard to promote their corporate cousins. No
longer will every page of every service have links to Disney.com,
ESPN.Com, and so on. Nor will promotions on television for, say
ABC.com, refer to it as part of the Go Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Go Network is not something that resonated with
consumers,'' said Steve Bornstein, the longtime president of the
ESPN cable network that Disney assigned last year to run its
Internet Group. That approach, moreover, had made Go's competitors,
like Yahoo and America Online, reluctant to provide links to
Disney's sports, news and kids sites.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there has been a focus on creating new formats for
advertising that are more effective than the rectangular ad banners
that dominate most web sites. Banner prices have been falling
sharply, as advertisers find their effectiveness to be modest.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has created a rectangular unit, much the same shape as a
television screen, that has 30 percent greater area than a banner
and will be placed at the top of the front screen of Go.Com and its
other services.
</P>
<P>
   The Go.Com service itself has been streamlined to eliminate vast
sections of the site including ``channels'' about a wide range of
topics and de-emphasize other features like chat rooms. Instead,
the vast bulk of the site will be focused delivering answers for
queries typed into the web search box.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in addition to a banner advertisement, there are three
new bigger advertisements with technology that let the ad be more
interactive and related to the user's search. On a search for ski
resorts, for example, L.L. Bean could offer links to it's three
hottest selling sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   Disney hopes advertisers will pay $65 to $85 per thousand
impressions for these units, compared to $10 per thousand for its
current banners. And of course it hopes revenue will rise even more
than that because it has far more advertisements on a page than it
used to.
</P>
<P>
   But competitors say this strategy may not be all it's cracked up
to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may sell six ads but that doesn't mean that people click
on any more of them,'' said George Bell, chief executive of Excite
(at)Home. He said his company's Excite portal tried pages with more
advertising, but all it did was reduce the average number of
responses each advertiser received. ``We sold more units, but the
advertisers were displeased,'' he said.

 &HT;    Fox Family's Elian movie Sunday night
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems like only last month that Elian Gonzalez was big news.
Actually, it was 11 weeks ago that the boy and his father returned
to Cuba, effectively ending the saturation news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven weeks may be a long time by CNN or Internet standards,
but it's blazingly fast for filming and editing a two-hour movie.
On Sunday, Fox Family Channel runs a new TV movie, ``The Elian
Gonzalez Story'' (8 p.m., 487630).
</P>
<P>
   Elian doesn't hold the record, though. That goes to the Amy
Fisher trifecta of docudramas in 1993 and ``Ambush in Waco,'' both
of which ran within about a month of the news events. And it's hard
to measure how fast CBS moved on its JonBenet Ramsey four-hour
movie in February, which aired even though her murder remains
unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some major news events and how fast they became
TV movies:

 &HT;    Hearings to decide if gays can give blood
 &HT;    By Gracie Bonds Staples
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For as long as he could remember, Jim Marks had made it his
civic duty to donate blood at least once a year. Then the rules
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that gay men were not allowed to give blood no matter
what their HIV status was, so it became less of a priority for me
then,'' Marks said this week.
</P>
<P>
   But with the development of improved AIDS tests and a recent
rise in HIV cases among heterosexuals, federal officials will
consider today whether to modify the lifetime ban on blood
donations from gay men.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's blood products advisory
committee will hear testimony and discuss recommendations. There is
no timetable on when members will vote. The committee concluded in
December 1997 that the ban should be relaxed, but it was dissuaded
by federal blood experts urging caution.
</P>
<P>
   Gay men have been forbidden from donating blood if they have had
sex with a male since 1977, once considered the starting date of
the deadly virus. The FDA imposed the ban in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Marks, deputy director of AID Atlanta, a nonprofit organization
that serves HIV and AIDS clients, and others say that no one knew
enough about the AIDS virus then, so the ban served a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it first went into effect it made sense,'' said Philip
Rafshoon,owner of the Outwrite Bookstore and Coffee House in
Atlanta. ``But times have changed, medical knowledge has changed
and the policy should reflect that. Today there are plenty of
screening tests they can do so there's really no reason to have
this antiquated policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue becomes especially important because demand for blood
is outpacing donations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some blood banks remain cautious about modifying the ban.
Officials estimate that blood donations would increase by only 1
percent if the ban were relaxed, but the small number of
HIV-infected donations entering blood banks could rise by 1,200
units. That would put more pressure on tests to catch bad blood.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued Thursday by the American Red Cross, said the
organization ``cannot change its procedures in a way that would
result in increased numbers of infectious donations in our blood
supply. If the Public Health Service could assure the American Red
Cross that introducing previously deferred donors into the donor
pool could be accommodated without increasing risk, we would
support appropriate actions to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Blood Banks has urged the FDA to
lift the ban on gay males who have not had sex within a year of
their donation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longest window we know to detect the virus is a year,''
said Karen Shoos Lipton, the association's chief executive. ``The
science is there.''
</P>
<P>
   And The Committee of 10,000, a group for hemophiliacs who
contracted HIV through blood donations, has also abandoned support
for the lifetime ban. The group now favors a five-year ban.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Gair, chief operating officer of LifeSouth Community
Blood Centers based in Gainesville, Fla., said he has not yet seen
anything that would support loosening the restriction. LifeSouth
has 10 regional collection centers, including Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not to say that that might not come forth (at the
committee hearing),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gair added that while he doesn't feel the industry discriminates
against any group, it does discriminate against anyone who might be
in a high risk group .
</P>
<P>
   ``You might be deferred and deemed ineligible as a donor for any
number of reasons, not just your sexual orientation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before donating, a potential donor must answer a battery of
questions. Men are asked whether they have had sex with a male
since 1977, to determine if the donor might pose a risk for
infectious disease. If the donor answers yes, he is sent home and
entered on a national ``deferral'' database of people banned for
life from donating. The same is true for other high risk groups
such as intravenous drug users, prostitutes and people with
hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   What's changed, however, is HIV rates among gay men have
declined. Heterosexuals now make up more than half of new HIV
cases. Blood tests also have become more precise, allowing for
detection of the virus' genetic material after as little as 20
days. A decade ago, tests looked for antibodies to HIV, which could
develop months after infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that while gay men continue to account for the
majority of AIDS cases in the U.S., the numbers among women and
heterosexuals is rising dramatically and, in particularly, among
minorities,'' said Peter Velasco, director of communications for
the National Minority AIDS Council. ``We feel to exclude gay men
not only discriminates but also creates a false sense of
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Graham, executive director of the AIDS Survival Project, a
nonprofit AIDS advocacy organization in Atlanta, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some time, science has clearly proven that sexual
orientation has nothing whatsoever to do with HIV transmission,''
said Graham. ``As an HIV-negative gay man, I personally feel that
it is my civic duty to donate blood and I have not been able to do
that my entire adult life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay activists across the country say the ban should be lifted
completely. They note that the FDA imposes only a one-year ban on
women who have had sex with gay men and on men who have had sex
with a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``But yet we're being told we can't donate blood because of our
sexual orientation,'' said Marks. ``It's like saying you can't give
blood because you have red hair.''
</P>
<P>
   As of June 2000, 311 people in Georgia had contracted the virus
through blood, or 1.4 percent of the 22,011 reported AIDS cases in
the state. Nationally, an estimated 18 pints of HIV-infected blood
are transfused into patients every year, which works out to a risk
of one in 675,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short as we are on blood, we want to include as many people as
we can safely include, but at the same time we need to ... satisfy
the recipient that we've done everything we can to ensure the
safety of the blood,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Lennox, associate professor
of medicine in the division of infectious disease at Emory
University School of Medicine. ``That's a delicate balancing act.''
</P>
<P>
   He has mixed feelings about changing the ban. The issue, Lennox
said, is how likely is someone to be carrying an undetected viral
infection that would harm the blood recipient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee will have to decide if they want to single out
certain groups to be at greater risk based solely on their sexual
preference or whether behavior is a more reasonable marker for
risk,'' he said. ``If you want maximum safety of blood supply,
you'd want people who are not IV drug users and who are not
promiscuous. To me those criteria would not rule out many gay
men.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ebullient architect and designer Alexander Girard
(1907-1993) once declared himself more interested in atmospheres
than in buildings. Atmospheres are what his work is about. A
designer of fabrics, graphics, interiors, furniture, tableware,
radio cabinets and much else, he brought to his creations a vivid
sense of civilized living with more than a touch of panache.
</P>
<P>
   He devised a home of elegant yet inviting spaces for the J.
Irwin Miller family in Columbus, Ind. (1955-58), served up a
brilliant medley of Latin American motifs for the New York
restaurant La Fonda del Sol (1961) and from the 1950s to the early
70s designed more than 300 fabrics and wallpapers for the textile
division of the Herman Miller (no relation to J. Irwin) Furniture
Co. that pulse with color and rhythmic patterns. His whimsical,
sometimes flamboyant sensibility permeated everything he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Opulent Eye of Alexander Girard,'' at the Cooper-Hewitt
National Design Museum through March 18, is the first comprehensive
show devoted to Girard, who seems to have lacked the recognition
accorded his colleagues Eero Saarinen, Charles and Ray Eames and
George Nelson. It can be argued that Girard was basically a
middlebrow designer, less a theorist and inventor than they were,
and more involved with showmanship. His forte was fabrics and
interiors, domestic and commercial. The few pieces of furniture he
designed for the airport waiting rooms of Braniff International
Airways in 1966 seem timorous and derivative.
</P>
<P>
   But spontaneity and joy were hallmarks of his work, and there is
no denying that over all it has had an influence, even among
present-day practitioners. ``He has urged each of us toward a more
personal and expressive way of life,'' wrote the fabric designer
Jack Lenor Larsen in Design Quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   Well organized by Donald Albrecht, adjunct curator for special
projects, the show is a packed but lively installation. It displays
fabrics, sketches, collages, interiors, exteriors, furnishings,
tableware, graphic designs and other Girardiana, including a group
of rather kitschy dolls he designed. Here, too, are photographs and
films on his work, along with many examples of the folk art he
collected that often served as inspiration, as the show makes
clear.
</P>
<P>
   With modernism as his core belief, Girard _ known to colleagues
as Sandro _ saw himself as ``a reasonable and sane functionalist
tempered by irrational frivolity.'' He wanted home decor to be
accessible, affordable and personal. His contribution to
contemporary design was a freedom of approach that encompassed all
sorts of visual stimuli, from Italian stage sets to Mexican folk
art to motifs from modern technology. He made use of color,
pattern, texture and ornament with a vibrancy that seemed to catch
the beat of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   He pushed for convenience and informality by combining different
kinds of furnishings, accessories and tableware that avoided the
deadly matched look; devising walls for storage and display that
looked into other spaces; and inventing a cozy semienclosure known
as the ``conversation pit,'' a cushiony retreat that encouraged
sit-down talk in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   Girard was very good at public areas, too, particularly
restaurants. The show presents examples of his interior done in Op
Art and Art Deco styles _ fabrics and furnishings in glorious black
and white, including tables in the form of petalled flowers _ for
L'Etoile'' (1965), a very smart but short-lived restaurant that
once inhabited the Sherry-Netherland Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But his greatest extravaganza was La Fonda del Sol, the Latin
American dining complex installed by Restaurant Associates in the
old Time and Life Building. Girard saluted its banquet of Latin
American foods with folk art and themes from the same culture. As
he did for L'Etoile, he designed La Fonda's total environment, from
the room's canopy, festooned with embroidered Colombian skirts, to
the folk dolls used as decoration, to the geometrically patterned
buttons on the waiters' jackets. The leitmotif, shown here, was a
great golden sun of hammered brass and antique glass that
majestically shone down on diners.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition devotes a good deal of space to Girard's fabric
designs, with an entire room for the textiles he did for Herman
Miller. Always abstract, to avoid the distortion that occurs when
representational images are subjected to the folds of hanging
cloth, the designs, often geometric, are sometimes derived from
folk art motifs. In their freshness of color and pattern they
exuberantly push the envelope of middle-class taste.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights of his fabric designs are ``Manhattan''
(1958), a bouncy image of the skyline at night, and the intricate
``Cut-Out'' (1954-57), a drapery for the master bedroom of the
Miller house in Indiana. Although ``Cut-Out'' is flat, it combines
color and black shadow to give it the three-dimensional look of
sculpture. A more famous one is ``Feathers'' (1957), an overall
pattern of small diamonds in blue and mustard colors derived from
the plumage used in Peruvian and Hawaiian ceremonial cloaks.
</P>
<P>
   Girard's love of folkways and of theater apparently surfaced in
his childhood, with a fascination for Christmas nativity creches.
(An early acquisition is in the show.) Born in New York to an
American mother and an Italian father, he grew up in Italy and was
trained as an architect. He practiced in Rome for a while, but it
was a stint as a designer for the Nordiska department store in
Stockholm that put him in touch with the craft-based modernism
underlying his own style.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932 he returned to New York, where he did domestic interiors
and restaurants in a retro rococo mode, as several drawings in the
show attest. Five years later he and his wife, Susan, moved to
Detroit, then a budding design center, where they stayed for some
15 years before permanently settling into a historic adobe house in
Santa Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1950s Girard's thinking in newer terms was bringing
him recognition. He packaged two of the influential ``Good Design''
exhibitions for the Museum of Modern Art and the Merchandise Mart
in Chicago, and a backlighted photograph of silhouetted objects he
arranged in the 1953 show makes a stunning wall in the exhibition.
In 1958 he did a spectacular showroom for Herman Miller in San
Francisco, using gold leaf, garish paint, a mirrored carousel and
theatrical lighting to highlight the Victorian excesses of the
building as a setting for displays of supercool '50s Miller
furniture, designed by others.
</P>
<P>
   Textiles and Objects, the Herman Miller showroom in Manhattan
that Girard designed in 1961, is on view in a specially
commissioned three-dimensional model. It displayed more than 100 of
his fabric designs, surrounded by bright arrangements of folkish
figures (designed by Girard's brother Tunsi, and others), mirrors,
pillows and other domestic accessories.
</P>
<P>
   If Girard was not one of the real heavyweights in American
design, he was one of its liveliest figures, as this show happily
affirms. A nice endpiece to the exhibition, incidentally, is the
Cooper-Hewitt's tiny Design Museum Cafe, adorned with overhead
placards bearing quotes about Girard from colleagues and friends.
They were designed in a playful spirit by the graphic artist
Deborah Sussman, a colleague and longtime friend.

   SYDNEY _ This really is the other side of the world. Been here
for four days and not one person has asked about Bernard Gilkey,
Rico Brogna, or Tebucky Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the 2000 Olympics, where the buses aren't running on
time and cab drivers are upset that there's not much business
(Atlanta redux). Drug allegations, fat cat kickbacks, ticket
fiascos, and political protests still dog the International Olympic
Committee (Atlanta again), but the good people of Sydney plan to
enjoy themselves for these Games.
</P>
<P>
   There'll be 110,000 at Olympic Stadium Friday night and more
than 3.5 billion folks around the globe will watch the Parade of
Nations fill an infield wide enough to accommodate four supersonic
aircraft. Aussie basketball star Andrew Gaze (who played at Seton
Hall) will carry the flag for the 600-strong local team and we're
bound to see Olivia Newton-John sometime during the night.
</P>
<P>
   What will be the signature moment of these Olympics? Will it be
Marion Jones's fifth gold medal or a heroic vault by a pixie
gymnast with a wounded foot? Will there be a Beamonesque leap into
history or a tragic dropped baton? Will the US men's basketball
team finally get a game and survive a scare? Will any Cubans
defect?
</P>
<P>
   The questions will all be answered between now and Oct. 1, and
let the record state that the locals have done everything possible
to accommodate visitors from afar. They've even painted ``look
right'' at busy corners and crosswalks so that Americans won't be
run over by vehicles driving on the ``wrong side'' of the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong side.'' There I go again. Ugly American that I am, it's
traditional to view anything different as incorrect. In an effort
to compensate for this skewered thinking, I've been wondering about
the whole Down Under thing. A Foster's beer ad claims that the
world is round and that Australia is actually on top. And why not?
Who decided what constitutes the top and bottom of a round object?
Are there not viewing areas in outer space from which Los Angeles
would appear to be an east coast city in South America in the
Southern Hemisphere?
</P>
<P>
   These are the things one thinks about during a 26-hour flight.
Most American athletes left the US weeks ago to compensate for jet
lag and time change. It takes a few days to adjust and woe is the
competitor who makes no allowance.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Boston Saturday afternoon, I set my watch 15 hours ahead
to Sydney time _ Sunday morning. Conveniently enough, I had the
bulldog edition of the Sunday Globe (which is printed early
Saturday) in my lap. So there I was, a modern time traveler, flying
out of Logan on Saturday, reading a Sunday newspaper, bound for a
place where it was already Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will take advantage of this time difference by furnishing no
live coverage of the Games. Everything you watch happened Thursday.
These are the Memorex Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney in 2000 so far reminds me a little of America during the
Eisenhower administration. You see kids in caps pushing barrels
that have upside-down pushbrooms attached. There's the usual
Olympic security (no trash bins at the Olympic train station _
probably a response to the Atlanta bombing), but folks are not
gripped with the fear of terrorism that has haunted other Games.
</P>
<P>
   The Melbourne Olympics of 1956 (Bill Russell and K.C. Jones won
gold) were held in December, which is the beginning of Australian
summer. These Games come at the end of winter and beginning of
Australian spring. The weather has been sunny, dry, cool at night,
and generally spectacular, though high winds may impact some
events.
</P>
<P>
   The pool is the place to be in these early days. We wait to see
if American Gary Hall can win his duel with Russian Alexander
Popov, while Australian teen sensation Ian Thorpe threatens to
change the sport. The swimming venue seats 17,500 and has a low
ceiling that will hold the considerable noise.
</P>
<P>
   Know this: when they drain the Sydney International Aquatic
Centre, the water will flow clockwise (I checked this already in my
hotel bathtub). It's the Coriolis effect, another reminder that
we're in the other half of the world.

 &HT;    Ngoma's days of glory are upon him
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ He was 12 years old and living in Lukasa,
Zambia, during the 1992 Olympics, but that spectacle from the
Summer Games of Barcelona left an indelible mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember sitting in front of a television set and watching a
broadcast of the Olympics,'' Wright State University swimmer and
Olympian Leonard Ngoma said. ``I didn't understand much of what the
announcer said _ it was in English _ but I remember I kept hearing
`16 Days of Glory.' It sounded magical. And I started thinking I
wanted that. I wasn't quite sure how, but one day I wanted to be
part of the `16 Days of Glory.'''
</P>
<P>
   As the years went by and those flickering TV images faded, they
were eclipsed by a reality that Ngoma understood only too well.
Instead of 16 Days of Glory, he had four years of hurt and
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, both of Ngoma's parents died of malaria. Soon after, he
left his home and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really was nothing for me,'' he said. ``I wanted
something more, but I didn't know where to turn.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee _ which has a program to
nurture Olympians in underdeveloped nations _ soon provided a road
map. Ngoma was a junior swimmer of some note in Zambia, and the IOC
provided the initial funds to send him to the United States. He
joined the high school swim team at Jacksonville's Bolles School,
one of the premier high school programs in the nation, and from
there _ thanks to an assistant coach with ties to Wright State _
Ngoma ended up with an invitation to join coach Matt Liddy's swim
program at WSU last season.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was contingent on Zambia _ as required by the IOC _
funding part of the college costs. Just when things were looking up
_ Ngoma had swum an Olympic qualifying time at the All-Africa
Championships in Johannesburg, South Africa _ he was hit with what
seemed to be a final KO punch.
</P>
<P>
   Zambia _ where the economy is in a downward spiral thanks in
part to the decline in the country's copper mining _ had no money
to spare. Because Liddy already had distributed his scholarships,
it looked as if Ngoma might be headed back home _ his finances
gone, his dream dead.
</P>
<P>
   Then out of the blue, he found a guardian angel in the City of
Dayton, which just so happens to have a developmental partnership
with Lukasa.
</P>
<P>
   City Manager Valerie Lemme _ after some conversations with Liddy
_ knew what Ngoma could achieve with some help. More importantly,
she knew what he'd go back to if no one stepped in. She's been to
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is very difficult there,'' Lemme said. ``Some 80 to 90
percent of the people live in abject poverty. Schooling from grades
K through 12 is not free. Many people live in overcrowded homes
without water or electricity. A lot of traffic is actually by foot.
For a lot of young people, there just isn't much opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, Lemme convinced various charitable
organizations to help fund Ngoma's stay at Wright State. The
20-year-old completed his freshman season with the Raiders last
year, got modest results and that kept his Olympic opportunity
alive. Since Zambia hadn't paid for his schooling, it was able to
come up with the $1,800 airfare to get him to Sydney, where Tuesday
_ when he dives into the pool for the 200-meter breaststroke _
he'll become his nation's first Olympic swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, he will be on the global stage, when he and seven other
Zambian athletes in their green blazers march into the massive
Olympic Stadium for the Opening Ceremonies of the 2000 Olympic
Games. In so doing, he'll join 11 other athletes with Miami Valley
ties who are competing in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Best known in Dayton is Tonja Buford-Bailey, the Meadowdale High
School graduate who will compete in her third straight Olympics.
She won a bronze medal in the 400 meter hurdles in Atlanta, the
same race Central State graduate Deon Hemmings _ who will compete
for her native Jamaica again these Games _ won gold.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other athletes linked to CSU also will be here. Former
Marauder basketball stars Maty M'Bengue and Marieme Lo, who now
works in the athletics department at WSU 0 will play basketball for
Senegal. CSU graduates Catherine Scott-Pomales and Beverly Grant
will run track for Jamaica, while current Marauder Vida Nsiah will
run sprints for Ghana. Former CSU sprinter Sayon Cooper will do the
same for Liberia, Neil De Silva will represent Trinidad and Tobago
and Ronald Promesse runs for St. Lucia.
</P>
<P>
   Sion Brinn, the newly hired Wright State assistant swim coach,
will be competing in his second Olympics. He's swimming relays for
Great Britain at these Games. Because of dual citizenship, he
competed for Jamaica in the 1996 Olympics and finished 12th in the
200 freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Brinn's presence in Sydney is a plus for Ngoma. Because Zambia
has no swimming coach, Brinn has taken Ngoma under his wing here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt if you'll find another college coach and one of his
athletes competing in the same sport at the Olympics,'' Liddy said.
``Imagine the two of them together on the pool deck in Sydney.
Wouldn't that make a good cover to our media guide?''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Willy, the swim coach at Bolles when Ngoma arrived and
now a coach at the University of Florida, said the Zambian swimmer
is a boon to any swim program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team needs a Leonard Ngoma as a reality check,'' Willy
said. ``These days, you hear so much about athletes being pampered.
... But he's come from a place where there weren't many facilities
and he hadn't gotten a lot of instruction. For a while, he'd even
coached himself. It's good for (the other swimmers) to see someone
doing something positive, even though he's had things a whole lot
worse. Leonard's an inspiration to anyone who knows his story.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemme knows and agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of our partnership with Zambia, we consider him one of
our own,'' Lemme said. ``We're proud of him for the way he's
overcome tremendous odds to get an education and advance his
swimming. He's really done something special.''
</P>
<P>
   That he has.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Ngoma managed to make his own magic. He took four years
of hurt and uncertainty and managed to turn them into 16 Days of
Glory.

FOR NBC, DELAYED AIRING WILL ADD UP TO PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's simple math.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way anyone would spend $705 million for the rights to
the Summer Olympic Games and have them air live between 1 a.m. and
6 a.m., when only 9 percent of the nation's televisions are on.
</P>
<P>
   The taped versus live debate is not new, and frankly NBC Sports
chairman Dick Ebersol, whose network is covering the Sydney Games,
sounded tired of answering the same old question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the height of ugly Americanism to suggest that the
Olympics should revolve around the prime-time schedule in the
United States,'' Ebersol said during a recent teleconference. ``We
told everyone back in May that all of our coverage would be taped
because of the 15-hour time difference and our need to reach the
largest possible audience. We won't have any plausibly live
coverage or virtually live coverage. It's all taped.''
</P>
<P>
   All 441 1/2 hours spread over NBC and its two cable networks,
CNBC and MSNBC. The 279 hours of cable coverage, including 30
gold-medal finals, represent the first time the Olympics have been
televised on basic cable. Ebersol has predicted an average of about
17 million households watching all or part of the Olympic telecast
each night. In addition, NBCOlympics.com projects 10 million
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   On paper at least, the taped coverage, filled with athletes'
personal stories _ more than half from foreign countries for those
keeping track of network jingoism _ and features on Australian
life, coupled with a staggering amount of information on NBC's Web
site, is a perfect marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've chosen not to treat the Internet as an enemy, but
instead to embrace it,'' said David Neal, NBC's head of production.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, for instance, NBCOlympics.com updated users with
the score of the American men's soccer team's game against the
Czech Republic. The fact that some knew before the game aired that
it ended in a 2-2 tie was not a bad thing. MSNBC showed the game
Wednesday night to kick off the network's coverage. Ebersol said
the game may get more viewers knowing the Americans put up a good
showing.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol, a passionate Olympics fan, said the Games are unlike
any other sporting event because viewers are, of course, interested
in the results, but they are also interested in the stories. ``The
journey is equally as compelling as the result,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol learned his up close and personal style from pioneer
Roone Arledge during ABC's coverage of the 1972 Winter Games in
Innsbruck, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fundamental reason why we do it this way,'' Ebersol
said. ``The Olympics bring families together for a shared viewing
experience. That is a rarer and rarer occurrence today. But there
is a gap of knowledge about most Olympic sports and the people who
are competing in them. That's why when you broadcast these sports
outside of the Olympics, you're lucky to get a 3 rating. We aim to
get the largest possible audience. That means doing some
storytelling, and putting the Games on when it's convenient for the
viewers, which is certainly not in the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Olympics, MSNBC's daily coverage will be from 10
a.m.-5 p.m. and CNBC's coverage from 5-9 p.m. On weekends, MSNBC's
coverage will be from 10 a.m.-4 p.m. and CNBC's from 4-9 p.m.
MSNBC's coverage is hosted by Jim Lampley and will focus on team
sports, including soccer, baseball, softball, and basketball. CNBC
has most of the boxing and will be hosted by Pat O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference in coverage from anything that's ever preceded
it either here at NBC or on any other network is staggering,''
Ebersol said. ``We have more than double the total amount of
coverage we had in '96 and the most prime-time coverage _ 84 1/2
hours _ of any Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't mention the Canadian Broadcasting Company to Ebersol. CBC
is showing the Games live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coverage is better than theirs,'' Ebersol said. ``We have
more resources, more coverage, richer stories, and much more of a
commitment of showing viewers who the athletes are and the impact
they have had in their home countries. But people are certainly
free to wake up at 5 a.m. to watch CBC.''
</P>
<P>
   A true testament to the drawing power of the Olympics is the
fact that rival networks delayed the release of their new fall
shows until after the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate test, however, is whether professional football and
baseball will cut into NBC's expected Olympic ratings.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for sure, NBC reports it has sold $900 million in
advertising, all but assuring the network of earning a profit.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Trial lawyer money to Democrats reviewed
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A trial lawyer at the center of a dispute with Texas over
tobacco litigation has given hundreds of thousands of dollars from
his law firm to the Democratic Party over the last four years since
Al Gore was asked to call him to seek a six-figure check. A Gore
aide said the vice president never made the phone call to Texas
trial lawyer Walter Umphrey. Gore was asked to make the call in
1995 by Democratic Party chairman Don Fowler at a time when they
were concerned with Republican legislation that would have put
limits on lawsuit awards. Democratic call sheets that recently have
been scrutinized by Justice Department investigators suggest Gore
and Fowler were asked to solicit Umphrey for contributions
beginning in late 1995.

<P>
   BUSH CRITICIZES GORE'S ALLEGED FUND-RAISING CALL
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush criticized Al Gore today over what he called
misuse of the White House to secure campaign contributions in 1995.
Bush said voters should elect a new administration to ``restore
honor and dignity'' to the Oval Office. Addressing a crowd of
National Guard members in Newport Beach, Calif., Bush also
criticized the Clinton administration for running down the
military. Bush also planned to visit schools, take in a county fair
and hobnob with donors during his 2 1/2-day visit to California _
his 15th in a year and the third since the GOP national convention
last month.
</P>
<P>
   GORE'S TIES TO VIOLENT-MOVIE PRODUCER DEFENDED
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's campaign is defending his raising of millions of
dollars with the help of celebrities and movie moguls who put out
the kind of films he and running mate Joe Lieberman have
criticized. Republicans seized on his close association with movie
mogul Harvey Weinstein, whose company, Miramax, has released
violent films like ``Reservoir Dogs'' and ``Pulp Fiction.'' The
Democratic ticket has threatened new federal legislation or rules
against the entertainment industry within six months if it doesn't
stop marketing violent and sexual products to young people.
Nonetheless, Gore was to attend a fund-raiser tonight at New York's
Radio City Music Hall that Weinstein helped organize, capping a
week of fund-raising reaching $9.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   GORE COMPUTERS STOLEN _ QUESTION IS WHY
</P>
<P>
   Someone broke into Al Gore's Midtown Manhattan campaign
headquarters and stole several computers containing confidential
information, according to WABC-TV and the ABC News Web site. The
question for investigators is whether the thief was interested only
in stealing pricey computers, or was someone looking for the
information they contained? The burglary took place on the 19th
floor of Number Two Penn Plaza. Campaign workers told New York City
detectives that three laptops and a Palm Pilot were stolen sometime
between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. Wednesday. Investigators say the
computers contain detailed financial information about Gore's gala
fund-raiser at Radio City Music Hall tonight. ABC News said some of
it included personal details about contributors to the fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   GORE HAMMERS AGAIN ON EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore spoke at a Manchester, N.H., middle school today,
continuing his focus on education. He said education issues provide
``one of the biggest differences in this election'' as he capped a
week of drawing contrasts with George W. Bush. Gore has argued
repeatedly that Bush would use up too much of a projected federal
surplus on tax cuts, leaving no money for bolstering schools. ``We
can't reform education with half an agenda,'' he said. ``We can't
make education our top priority if huge tax cuts for the wealthy
are already the first, second and third priority.'' Gore, who
revels in detailed policy talk, has focused on a specific aspect of
his education policy each day this week, and he presented the
entire package in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   OVERNIGHT STAYS FOR HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTERS
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration will soon release a list of overnight
guests at the White House and the Camp David presidential retreat
in response to suggestions that Hillary Clinton traded visits for
contributions to her Senate campaign, the White House said today.
``As soon as that list is ready and I have a chance to review it, I
will make it available,'' said White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart. Reporters sought the list to compare it to rosters of the
first lady's political supporters. Said Clinton: ``We have friends
and supporters come and spend time with us and spend the night with
us that we are getting to know and who like spending time with us.
I don't see what's news about that.''
</P>
<P>
   DEBATE MEETING AND MYSTERY PACKAGE
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the two presidential campaigns were meeting
today with the Commission on Presidential Debates to iron out
details for fall debates. And meanwhile, the FBI is reviewing a
package received by Tom Downey, an ex-congressman from New York who
has been helping Al Gore prepare for debates against George W.
Bush. Downey said the package contained documents and a videotape
apparently related to Bush's debate preparations. The commission
meeting got under way at midday today. Taking part for Gore were
campaign chairman William Daley, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman and
adviser Jim Johnson, while Bush was represented by campaign
chairman Don Evans, campaign manager Joe Allbaugh and adviser
Andrew Card.
</P>
<P>
   SPLIT DECISION IN NEW YORK DEBATE
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton bested her opponent, Rick Lazio, 49 percent to
36 percent in their stormy New York Senate debate in Buffalo,
according to a quickie poll conducted for WCBS and the New York
Daily News. However, the newspaper's own panel of media experts
gave Lazio the edge, 57-50 percent, in a grading system based on
the candidates' presentations. In the debate, he called her
``Clintonesque,'' she linked him to Newt Gingrich, and both
candidates accused the other of having ``chutzpah.'' Afterward,
Lazio boasted to supporters, ``We New Yorkers don't back down from
a fight.'' Clinton told her backers she was relieved: ``It was my
first debate, and I feel like I survived.''
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan inched closer to getting a $12.6 million check for
his Reform Party presidential campaign. The Federal Election
Commission rubber-stamped its decision to award Buchanan the
federal campaign funds at its meeting today, authorizing the
Treasury to issue a check. ``I'm feeling rich,'' said Buchanan's
sister and campaign chairwoman, Bay Buchanan. ``We're thrilled.
It's been a long time coming, but we're ready to get this campaign
kick-started.'' John Hagelin, who also had sought the money,
dropped his plans to appeal the FEC decision.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE BANS HAGELIN FROM PARTY NAME
</P>
<P>
   California Superior Court Judge James Wright has declared Pat
Buchanan the Reform Party's true presidential candidate, and
ordered Buchanan's Reform Party rival, John Hagelin, to stop
campaigning as the party's nominee. His supporters must also stop
promoting Hagelin as such, collecting and spending donations, and
operating its Web site. Hagelin said he'd honor that ruling, both
in California and nationwide. In the meantime, his lawyer said he
would seek to delay the force of the ruling while appealing it.
Hagelin said he'll continue to campaign as the Natural Law Party
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   A NIXON COMES OUT FOR BUSH
</P>
<P>
   Among the supporters who greeted George W. Bush in Monroe,
Wash., was Edward Nixon, younger brother of the late President
Richard Nixon. ``He's going to do fine,'' Nixon said of Bush, who
has been slipping in recent polls. ``My brother always said you
don't want to peak too early. Bush and his people have the means to
bring this thing together.'' Nixon, 70, is a retired geologist and
Navy veteran living in Lynnwood, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   LOCAL TV STATIONS THE BIG ELECTION WINNER
</P>
<P>
   Political advertising may annoy some voters, but it's a cash cow
for local TV stations, which are expected to take in up to $1
billion from sale of political ads this year. That's double the
haul from 1996, said the Alliance for Better Campaigns, which
argues that all that money compels broadcasters to provide
candidates free time to talk about issues. ``The broadcasters don't
own the airwaves; the public does,'' said Walter Cronkite, former
CBS News anchor and honorary co-chairman of the Alliance. The group
advocates five minutes of candidate discourse a day in the 30 days
before Election Day. A study earlier this year found there to be
less than one minute.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN COVERAGE BLASTED
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney lashed out at news reporters. Speaking to a business
club during a swing through western Michigan, Cheney said the need
to produce stories for a growing number of Internet-based news
sites and 24-hour cable TV news channels apparently has changed the
way campaigns are covered. ``So you end up with absolutely trivial
issues dominating an entire (news) cycle or maybe two cycles _ an
entire 24 or 48 hours _ that really have nothing to do with the
election or the fate of America or how the campaign ought to be
decided,'' he said. ``The way that works serves to distract
everybody and to take the focus off the basic issues that we ought
to be concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   A CHANGING FLORIDA NOW RATED A TOSS-UP
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is scrambling to salvage his campaign for 25
electoral votes in Florida, a Republican-trending state where he
once led comfortably, but is now in a dead heat with Al Gore. The
two are competing in a Florida that has changed dramatically in the
last decade. The population in the nation's fourth largest state
has become older, more independent and more Hispanic. A new
Mason-Dixon poll confirmed the belief of both campaigns that the
race is tightening. The poll put Bush at 45 percent and Al Gore at
43_ a statistical dead heat. That same poll had given Bush an
8-point edge _ 47 percent to Gore's 39 percent _ in June.
</P>
<P>
   WON OVER ON ENDANGERED BIRDS, BUSH SAYS
</P>
<P>
   They don't have salmon in Texas, George W. Bush told local
conservationists at a campaign stop highlighting local
save-the-salmon efforts in rural Washington state. But Bush said
he's done his part to save the golden cheeked warbler, an
endangered bird found only in Texas that nests in cedar trees found
on his own 1,600-acre ranch in Crawford, Texas. ``A man from the
federal government came down to see me,'' Bush said. ``I was a
little suspicious frankly.'' The man _ Bush didn't say what agency
he was with _ told Bush that the government wanted to protect the
cedar trees to help save the birds. A strong advocate of property
rights, Bush nonetheless decided that preserving the fate of a
5-inch songbird species outweighed his concerns about intrusive
federal government practices. ``I agreed after listening to the
man,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   IN-HOUSE FUND-RAISING BY DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   With Election Day less than two months away, House Democratic
leaders have asked their colleagues for $5 million more to help
finance the fall campaign. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt
(Mo.) and Rep. Patrick Kennedy (R.I.), chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, have received $1 million since
they began asking members a week ago, said DCCC spokesman Erik
Smith. The new effort is in addition to an earlier drive that
brought in $4.5 million from lawmakers. The House Democrats had
about $15 million more money in the bank as of June 30 than their
Republican counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDACY AS A DOOR-OPENER
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman told prominent Jewish leaders that he hopes his
candidacy opens doors for people from all walks of life. ``I'm here
for a principle _ the principle of inclusiveness and opportunity,''
he said at a fund-raiser in Brookline, Mass., near Boston.
Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, made his remarks at a $10,000-a-plate
fund-raising event at the home of Ahron Solomont, brother of former
Democratic National Committee finance chairman Alan Solomont.
Lieberman paraphrased John Kennedy, the first Roman Catholic
elected president, saying he hoped no one would vote for or against
him because of his religion.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH EXPANDS MESSAGE TEAM
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has added a Washington-based Republican
consultant, Ed Gillespie, to his communications team to help
sharpen his campaign message. Gillespie, 39, has been senior
adviser to House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, director of
policy and communications for the House Republican Conference, and
a senior staff member at the Republican National Committee. He was
one of six Washington advisers named by the Bush campaign earlier
this year when national Republicans complained that the
Austin-based Bush campaign was too insular.
</P>
<P>
   CHENEY-FORD REUNION
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney paid a call Wednesday on his old boss, former
President Gerald Ford, in a campaign swing through Grand Rapids,
Mich. Twenty-five years ago, Cheney, then 34, became Ford's White
House chief of staff. Warmly greeted by Ford and his wife, Betty,
outside the Gerald R. Ford Museum, on the banks of the Grand River,
Cheney said, ``It's fun just to come back and spend some time with
the president, get words of wisdom from somebody who has been where
I'm trying to go, as vice president.'' Cheney added that Ford was
``looking much better'' since his minor stroke last month at the
Republican convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   PAPA BUSH CHATS UP WITH IMUS
</P>
<P>
   Ex-President George Bush made a surprise call to the ``Imus in
the Morning'' radio show in New York where Don Imus has turned his
full satirical guns on Bush's son, George W., in recent weeks.
Calling from Kennebunkport, Maine, the elder Bush told Imus he had
just received a jar of the radio host's personal salsa. ``I haven't
felt that way since I threw up on the Japanese prime minister,''
Bush deadpanned. The former president invited Imus to his vacation
home for a horseback ride. Imus was seriously injured this summer
when a horse threw him. The horse's name, Bush said, is Subliminal.
Imus had a big laugh, and said later the ex-president ``was pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   FINAL DEBATE IN WASHINGTON STATE
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates for the Democratic nomination for senator
from Washington clashed at their final scheduled debate before next
Tuesday's primary. Speaking before the Rotary Club of Seattle,
state Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn and former Rep. Maria
Cantwell traded barbs over their records, Internet privacy issues
and Cantwell's largely self-financed and more lavish campaign
spending. But they also spent time criticizing the record of the
Republican incumbent, Slade Gorton, whom the primary winner will
take on in November. Senn identified protecting prescription drug
coverage for older Americans as her top legislative priority, while
Cantwell, a millionaire high-tech executive, singled out campaign
finance reform.

<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) When the group Americans for Balanced Energy Choices
issued a news release last month, its prediction was a gloomy one:
potential electricity shortages, higher prices, a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
   It said working families were canceling vacation plans because
of high gasoline costs. It said the high cost of electricity had
prompted large industrial facilities to limit production and lay
off workers.
</P>
<P>
   And the situation would get worse without improved national
energy policies, without ...
</P>
<P>
   Coal.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Americans'' in Americans for Balanced Energy Choices are
not what the name seems to imply _ regular folks who depend on
energy to earn a living and keep a family together. Rather, they
are large corporate interests: the U.S. coal industry, the
railroads that haul coal and the electric utilities that burn coal
to make electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ABEC, launched in April, is among the newest entrants in an
already crowded field of business groups using names with
``Americans,'' ``customers'' or ``coalition'' in an effort to
appear populist and reach consumers wary of corporate interests.
</P>
<P>
   Such groups include Consumers' Voice, a group known for bashing
Ameritech Corp. (the Midwest Baby Bell that now is part of giant
SBC Communications Inc.). Consumers' Voice lists mostly community
organizations as members; it takes a call to its Indianapolis
office to learn that financial backing comes from long-distance
phone leviathan AT&AMP;T Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition for Customer Choice, another telephone industry
group, notes that its members are companies, although its news
releases don't specifically mention AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom Inc. and
other phone and cable providers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say such groups can mislead consumers by failing to
disclose their financial interests in the issues they present.
</P>
<P>
   ``By putting in the word `consumer,' it makes them appear that
they are representing consumers rather than an industry group,''
said Roger Blackwell, professor of marketing at Ohio State
University and a marketing consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the word `American' is like waving the flag and hoping
that people stand up and salute. It would almost (appear) to be
un-American to be opposed to these organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Lucas, spokesman for Alexandria, Va.-based Americans for
Balanced Energy Choices, said the group's name accurately reflects
its purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a group of Americans talking about an important issue _
balancing America's growing demand for electricity while protecting
the environment,'' Lucas said. ``It was a name for the group that
was truly at the heart of (its) mission.''
</P>
<P>
   David Hughes, who heads the environmental and consumer group
Citizen Power Inc., said groups like ABEC engage in
``greenwashing'' _ putting out only facts that support their
arguments while ignoring those that don't.
</P>
<P>
   He said the strong presence of environmental groups like Citizen
Power, which often appeared at Ohio legislative hearings last year
to support electricity deregulation, spurred the creation of
corporate-funded ``consumer'' groups in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   As the environmental movement gained strength in the last 10 to
15 years, target industries ``started getting more creative in how
to offset its influence,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   So while the Sierra Club spent almost $6 million on its
Environmental Public Education campaign last year, Lucas said
Americans for Balanced Energy Choices this year also plans to spend
``millions'' of dollars advertising its message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some folks may not like it, but they're looking through their
own political beliefs,'' Lucas said. ``This is an honest dialogue
with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, corporate coalitions gather to fight one specific issue,
for example electricity deregulation laws, then disband.
</P>
<P>
   United, group members can share the costs of advertising and
legal assistance, a must when fighting proposed legislation or
other regulations. While most companies already have their own
lobbyists who meet with politicians and other decision-makers
individually to push corporate causes, a large group of businesses
may pack more punch.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   ``The message becomes clearer the more groups you get to agree
on certain things,'' said Larry Stelzer, general counsel for the
Ohio Council of Retail Merchants and a former member of the
now-defunct Coalition for Choice in Electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus-based group fought for business-friendly provisions
in Ohio's electricity deregulation laws, passed last summer. The
group was open about its corporate membership, and Stelzer said
some lawmakers appreciated the ability to go to one business source
with questions rather than calling the CCE's 51 members _ mostly
trade groups _ individually.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real value is information,'' Stelzer said. ``You need
lawyers, consultants to bring evidence and information forward to
bolster your arguments. To that degree, it can be an expensive
proposition. (But) in the end, it gave us a better product for
legislators to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, not consumers, are the ultimate target of corporate
coalitions, said Mark Cooper of the Consumer Federation of America,
a group made up of state and federal consumer groups. He said
corporate-funded coalitions work to change public opinion so that
lawmakers won't feel sheepish when pressed to vote in companies'
favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumers are not the ones the (groups) are trying to
mislead,'' said Cooper, CFA research director. ``It's policy
making. This is part of politics in 21st century America.''
</P>
<P>
   Some municipal and consumer groups have joined corporate-funded
``consumer'' coalitions, recognizing that businesses and consumers
can have compatible interests.
</P>
<P>
   Americans for Affordable Electricity, which works for cheaper
wholesale electric rates for mostly corporate members, also
includes the National Association of Neighborhoods and the National
School Boards Association; lower wholesale rates could mean cheaper
heating or lighting bills for such groups.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers' Voice, the AT&AMP;T-funded group, includes the Salvation
Army of Oklahoma and a homeless advocate as members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone should always ask where (groups') funding comes
from,'' Consumers' Voice Executive Director Robert K. Johnson said.
``At the same time, I don't think that's reason to discount the
message or the consumers that support us.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Americans for Balanced Energy Choices includes a low-income
housing advocate in St. Louis and ``people from all walks of
life,'' spokesman Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are always some folks who are going to be
skeptical,'' Lucas said. But ``it's just the facts, ma'am _
providing facts based clearly on government statistics.''

<P>
   (UNDATED) When the group Americans for Balanced Energy Choices
issued a news release last month, its prediction was a gloomy one:
potential electricity shortages, higher prices, a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
   It said working families were canceling vacation plans because
of high gasoline costs. It said the high cost of electricity had
prompted large industrial facilities to limit production and lay
off workers.
</P>
<P>
   And the situation would get worse without improved national
energy policies, without ...
</P>
<P>
   Coal.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Americans'' in Americans for Balanced Energy Choices are
not what the name seems to imply _ regular folks who depend on
energy to earn a living and keep a family together. Rather, they
are large corporate interests: the U.S. coal industry, the
railroads that haul coal and the electric utilities that burn coal
to make electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ABEC, launched in April, is among the newest entrants in an
already crowded field of business groups using names with
``Americans,'' ``customers'' or ``coalition'' in an effort to
appear populist and reach consumers wary of corporate interests.
</P>
<P>
   Such groups include Consumers' Voice, a group known for bashing
Ameritech Corp. (the Midwest Baby Bell that now is part of giant
SBC Communications Inc.). Consumers' Voice lists mostly community
organizations as members; it takes a call to its Indianapolis
office to learn that financial backing comes from long-distance
phone leviathan AT&AMP;T Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition for Customer Choice, another telephone industry
group, notes that its members are companies, although its news
releases don't specifically mention AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom Inc. and
other phone and cable providers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say such groups can mislead consumers by failing to
disclose their financial interests in the issues they present.
</P>
<P>
   ``By putting in the word `consumer,' it makes them appear that
they are representing consumers rather than an industry group,''
said Roger Blackwell, professor of marketing at Ohio State
University and a marketing consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the word `American' is like waving the flag and hoping
that people stand up and salute. It would almost (appear) to be
un-American to be opposed to these organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Lucas, spokesman for Alexandria, Va.-based Americans for
Balanced Energy Choices, said the group's name accurately reflects
its purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a group of Americans talking about an important issue _
balancing America's growing demand for electricity while protecting
the environment,'' Lucas said. ``It was a name for the group that
was truly at the heart of (its) mission.''
</P>
<P>
   David Hughes, who heads the environmental and consumer group
Citizen Power Inc., said groups like ABEC engage in
``greenwashing'' _ putting out only facts that support their
arguments while ignoring those that don't.
</P>
<P>
   He said the strong presence of environmental groups like Citizen
Power, which often appeared at Ohio legislative hearings last year
to support electricity deregulation, spurred the creation of
corporate-funded ``consumer'' groups in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   As the environmental movement gained strength in the last 10 to
15 years, target industries ``started getting more creative in how
to offset its influence,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   So while the Sierra Club spent almost $6 million on its
Environmental Public Education campaign last year, Lucas said
Americans for Balanced Energy Choices this year also plans to spend
``millions'' of dollars advertising its message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some folks may not like it, but they're looking through their
own political beliefs,'' Lucas said. ``This is an honest dialogue
with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, corporate coalitions gather to fight one specific issue,
for example electricity deregulation laws, then disband.
</P>
<P>
   United, group members can share the costs of advertising and
legal assistance, a must when fighting proposed legislation or
other regulations. While most companies already have their own
lobbyists who meet with politicians and other decision-makers
individually to push corporate causes, a large group of businesses
may pack more punch.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   ``The message becomes clearer the more groups you get to agree
on certain things,'' said Larry Stelzer, general counsel for the
Ohio Council of Retail Merchants and a former member of the
now-defunct Coalition for Choice in Electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus-based group fought for business-friendly provisions
in Ohio's electricity deregulation laws, passed last summer. The
group was open about its corporate membership, and Stelzer said
some lawmakers appreciated the ability to go to one business source
with questions rather than calling the CCE's 51 members _ mostly
trade groups _ individually.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real value is information,'' Stelzer said. ``You need
lawyers, consultants to bring evidence and information forward to
bolster your arguments. To that degree, it can be an expensive
proposition. (But) in the end, it gave us a better product for
legislators to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, not consumers, are the ultimate target of corporate
coalitions, said Mark Cooper of the Consumer Federation of America,
a group made up of state and federal consumer groups. He said
corporate-funded coalitions work to change public opinion so that
lawmakers won't feel sheepish when pressed to vote in companies'
favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumers are not the ones the (groups) are trying to
mislead,'' said Cooper, CFA research director. ``It's policy
making. This is part of politics in 21st century America.''
</P>
<P>
   Some municipal and consumer groups have joined corporate-funded
``consumer'' coalitions, recognizing that businesses and consumers
can have compatible interests.
</P>
<P>
   Americans for Affordable Electricity, which works for cheaper
wholesale electric rates for mostly corporate members, also
includes the National Association of Neighborhoods and the National
School Boards Association; lower wholesale rates could mean cheaper
heating or lighting bills for such groups.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers' Voice, the AT&AMP;T-funded group, includes the Salvation
Army of Oklahoma and a homeless advocate as members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone should always ask where (groups') funding comes
from,'' Consumers' Voice Executive Director Robert K. Johnson said.
``At the same time, I don't think that's reason to discount the
message or the consumers that support us.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Americans for Balanced Energy Choices includes a low-income
housing advocate in St. Louis and ``people from all walks of
life,'' spokesman Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are always some folks who are going to be
skeptical,'' Lucas said. But ``it's just the facts, ma'am _
providing facts based clearly on government statistics.''

PHILIPPINES FINANCIAL MARKETS TUMBLE AMID WORRIES ABOUT ECONOMY,
REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concerns about rising unemployment, inflation and lawlessness in
the southern islands of the Philippines badly hurt the country's
financial markets Thursday, sending the value of its currency to
the lowest level since the depths of the Asian financial crisis of
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   As the government contemplates whether to use force against
Muslim rebels who this week conducted a second raid on a Malaysian
resort in search of people to kidnap, investors seem to be losing
their remaining faith in the ability of President Joseph Estrada's
administration to ensure economic security. The benchmark stock
index fell Thursday to a five-week low, and the Philippine peso
dropped at one point to its weakest level against the dollar in 32
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's low confidence in the system,'' said Gary del Rosario,
research chief at Salomon Smith Barney in Manila. ``It's getting
out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is building on the nation's central bank to halt the
peso's slide and keep inflation in check. Bank policy-makers plan
to meet on Friday to decide whether to raise interest rates a
second time in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts and economists worry that further rate increases
may only dampen growth. Some are urging the bank to strengthen the
currency's value by buying Philippine pesos with the nation's
dollar reserves. The central bank governor, Rafael Buenaventura,
denied rumors Thursday that the bank was in fact selling dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists remain confident that increasing exports will
keep Philippine growth intact and that the latest pieces of bad
news are not the beginning of a wider crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are more skeptical. Also among their concerns is
swelling government debt, with many expecting the government to
report on Friday that it has already exceeded its deficit target
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the National Statistics Office reported Thursday
that despite continued economic growth, unemployment rose in July
to 11.1 percent, up sharply from 8.4 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Manila residents say gloom surrounds the economy, and rising oil
prices, are making matters worse. Buenaventura warned this week
that higher prices for fuel and energy could stoke inflation and
keep the country from meeting its target for economic growth this
year of 4 to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And in what could lead to a repetition of events in Europe, a
militant group Thursday threatened to blockade the country's three
main refiners to protest rising gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   Manila's investment climate has also been undermined by
persistent complaints of official corruption, including a still
unresolved insider-trading scandal implicating a friend of
President Estrada. In the latest ``corruption perceptions index''
compiled by an independent group, Transparency International, the
Philippines ranked 69th of 90, behind India and China.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors are choosing to pull out of the Philippines. The
central bank said on Wednesday that foreign investors had withdrawn
more than $390 million from Philippine financial markets this
year. &QL;

&HT;     INDEPENDENT VOTERS SPLIT ON GORE, BUSH, NOW POLL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent voters are evenly split between Vice
President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, and 15 percent of
them have not made up their minds yet, according to a new poll
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the survey by the Pew Research Center for the
People &AMP; the Press differ sharply from another poll this week
showing Gore far ahead of Bush among voters in the crucial
unaligned bloc.
</P>
<P>
   That poll, by the Utica, N.Y.-based John Zogby, showed Gore over
Bush 43 percent to 32 percent among independents. But a New York
Times poll, also out this week, showed Bush with 36 percent of the
independent vote and Gore with 35 percent _ a statistical dead
heat.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Pew poll showed Gore with 39 percent and Bush
with 38 percent of the independents. Last June a Pew poll found
Bush with 40 percent of independents and Gore with 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen percent of the independents surveyed said they had not
decided whom to vote for. That figure compares with 3 percent of
Democrats and 5 percent of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Pew survey polled 1,999 registered voters between
Aug. 24 and Sept. 10. The margin of error was plus or minus 2
percentage points. Of the total sample, 547 said they were
independents.
</P>
<P>
   Pew research center director Andrew Kohut said at a news
conference where the results were released that ``whoever wins the
independents wins the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall in the Pew poll, Gore led Bush 47 percent to 41 percent
among registered voters. But the gap narrowed to 48 percent to 43
percent among the 1,495 in the sample who said they were likely to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew survey differs from other polls in that it attempts to
dissect the electorate and divide it up into sociological
categories of voting types.
</P>
<P>
   For example, among the unaffiliated voters are ``new prosperity
independents'' _ affluent, business-oriented and well educated _
and ``disaffected independents'' _ those who are less educated,
distrustful of government and less likely to have prospered
financially in the boom economy. Both groups favor Bush by wide
margins, as do another group, called ``conservative-oriented
independents.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``liberal-oriented independents'' like Gore, yielding a
dead-heat in the poll among unattached voters.

&HT;     CHEESE GOURMETS FEAR FDA POLICY COULD LEAVE A BAD TASTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Sept. 17)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gourmets, beware! Angel hair pasta with cheese
grated over basil marinara sauce will never be the same if the
federal government has its way.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration is considering new rules that
either would ban or drastically limit the manufacture and import of
raw milk, or unpasteurized, cheeses. The FDA has commissioned
scientific studies out of concern that the cheeses may pose a
health risk by carrying potentially deadly bacteria such as E.
coli, listeria and salmonella.
</P>
<P>
   For the gastronomically inclined, who dispute the health risk
claim, such a ruling would be the equivalent of the apocalypse. If
the FDA wins, say goodbye to such tasty and pungent favorites as
Parmigiano-Reggiano, a favorite on pasta, and Gruyere, which is
used in fondue.
</P>
<P>
   Other unpasteurized cheeses that are in the federal cross hairs
include Swiss Emmental and Appenzell; French Vigneron and Comte;
certain Vermont and English cheddars; and Spanish Idiazabal and
Manchego.
</P>
<P>
   Raw cheeses account for only a small portion of the cheese sold
in the United States, perhaps 10 percent, and most are imported,
according to industry estimates. But they are arguably among the
best tasting and most sought after by cheese sophisticates.
</P>
<P>
   Gourmets say the pasteurization process, in which the milk is
heated to high temperatures, destroys flavor. While some of these
raw-milk cheeses have less flavorful pasteurized cousins, others
such as Comte, rarely if ever are made from pasteurized milk.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 50 years, the government has allowed raw-milk cheeses
to be sold here provided that they are aged at least 60 days. The
belief had been that the aging process, along with a minimum amount
of heating of the milk, killed most bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   As a comparison, most European nations have no such rule. If a
raw cheese is made in the morning, it can go to market in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. David Armstrong, associate director for research with
the FDA and the National Center for Food Safety and Technology in
Chicago, said the agency is justified in taking a new look at the
60-day rule, especially, given the virulence of modern day
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been reports in scientific literature that
pathogens such as E. coli 0157 and salmonella may survive the
60-day aging process,'' Armstrong said. ``We are conducting
research to assess the adequacy of the 60-day aging process.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has flatly warned that raw-milk cheeses are ``potential
food safety concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a United Nations panel that influences rules about
the international shipment of foods is considering whether to limit
the availability of raw-milk cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA argues that while there have been no recent recalls of
raw-milk cheeses, there have been cases of illness linked to some
of the cheeses in California and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Dun Gifford, of the Cheese of Choice Coalition to defend
raw-milk cheeses, questions the claim, although he concedes that
two people in California became ill after consuming Mexican-style
raw-milk cheese. ``Hamburger and poultry are killing people but
nobody's is dying from this cheese,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cheese coalition was founded by the Wisconsin-based American
Cheese Society, which represents artisan cheese makers, and
Cambridge, Mass.-based Oldways Preservation and Exchange Trust,
which promotes traditional foods. The coalition has hired a
lobbyist here to defend the cheeses before the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the organization gathered some 1,500
signatures at 10 stores around the country in protest of possible
FDA action. The group plans a more extensive petition in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The future of raw cheese in this country in large part will fall
or rise on the results of ongoing tests conducted by Armstrong's
staff at FDA labs. In one key study, scientists are injecting
raw-milk cheeses with a cocktail of pathogens as part of an
extensive assessment of whether the cheeses are dangerous to public
health. Armstrong said that scientists likely will have preliminary
results by early next year. The agency is spending some $60,000 on
the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford's group is attacking the methodology, arguing that
because the tests use abnormally high levels of bacteria, they are
skewed toward linking the cheeses with illness.
</P>
<P>
   If the FDA opts to take action, a decision likely wouldn't come
for a year or more. But the gamut of possible options runs from
requiring blanket pasteurization of all cheese sold in the United
States, to requiring producers to age raw-milk cheeses up to 180
days instead of 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, cheese aficionados say, the result would be the
same. ``It would mean that those (raw) cheeses would go the way of
the Studabaker,'' Gifford said.
</P>
<P>
   Daphne Zepos, a cheese consultant in San Francisco, said any
change to the current 60-day rule would have ``huge repercussions''
for raw-milk cheese lovers and manufacturers. If the FDA took the
less dramatic option of increasing the 60-day rule to 180 days,
requiring manufacturers to age raw-milk cheese six months before

cheese, she said. Most raw-milk cheeses are four to six months old
when they are at their best, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans, meanwhile, are watching the cheese battle unfold with
bemusement. ``They laugh at the Americans,'' said Gifford. ``They
say, `The great American cowboy has a bad stomach and can't handle
cheeses.'''

   Responding to reports that Olympic athletes may be using two of
its products to enhance performance, Biopure Corp. said Thursday it
will make available a laboratory test to detect the presence of the
drugs in the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass. company said it decided to release the test
after media reports suggested athletes were using Hemopure and
Oxyglobin instead of better-known performance-enhancing drugs
because the two products can not be detected by commercially
available tests.
</P>
<P>
   The company is developing Hemopure as a potential subsitute for
blood transfusions. The product, in late stages of human clinical
trials, is not yet commercially available. Oxyglobin, a similar
drug used to treat anemia in dogs, is sold in the United States and
approved for use in Europe. It has not been tested in humans and is
not intended for use in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Both drugs increase the amount of oxygen in the bloodstream and
would give competitors in endurance sports such as cycling,
running, and swimming an enormous advantage. Although the use of
Hemopure and Oxyglobin by athletes has not been confirmed, coaches
and physicians associated with the Olympics say they believe it is
happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not condone the use of our products by anyone other than
licensed practitioners for approved purposes,'' said Carl Rausch,
Biopure's chairman and chief executive. ``If this news gives those
athletes pause, then all the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Hemopure and Oxyglobin are designed to take immediate
effect, athletes would most likely inject the drugs shortly before
a race. The products have been shown to have an effect on oxygen
levels in the blood even in small doses.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of articles in recent weeks, including one in Time
magazine and another in the London Times newspaper, have reported
that athletes are turning to drugs as their cheating supplements of
choice. Canadian track coach Dan Pfaff has said that he believes
many athletes switched to Hemopure after the introduction of a
viable test for EPO, a drug developed to treat anemia in patients
with kidney disease. EPO, well-known for its use by athletes, is
banned by the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Biopure also received calls from three IOC-accredited
laboratories about the availability of a test to detect the use of
Hemopure and Oxyglobin. Maria Gawryl, Biopure's senior vice
president of research and development, said the company is in
discussions with an IOC-accredited lab in Sydney. But, she said,
she does not know whether that means athletes will be tested during
this summer's Olympic events.
</P>
<P>
   Rausch said it makes sense that athletes would try to misuse the
drugs. But he thinks it is highly unlikely that they could get
their hands on Hemopure. The company tracks every unit of the drug
sent to its testing sites in accordance with strict regulatory
requirements. But with more than 60,000 units of Oxyglobin in the
market, Rausch said, the veterinary version may be available
through ``unapproved channels.''
</P>
<P>
   Biopure plans to begin marketing Oxyglobin in Europe later this
year and to apply for regulatory approval next year to begin
marketing Hemopure in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company developed its test to monitor how the body
metabolizes the hemoglobin-based drugs and to evaluate the
products' efficacy in treating animals and people. Since Biopure is
not in the business of testing for the illegal use of drugs, the
company decided to make its testing technology available through
licensing agreements to commercial labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make the test available because this is only going
to build in the future as the commercialization of these products
extends,'' Rausch said.

ADVERTISERS GEAR UP FOR OLYMPIC EXTRAVAGANZA 
</HEADLINE>

 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Olympics begin Friday night, but other than companies paying
big sponsorship fees, are many Americans paying attention yet?
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the Atlanta summer games started in July, and for
Americans, the viewing was easy.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance this year's games in Sydney 15 time zones away
shape up as much more of a marketing challenge, but such is the
global power of the Olympic brand that corporate sponsors still
think they will get their money's worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic rings give you instant credibility all over the
world,'' says vice president Steve Burgay of John Hancock Financial
Services Inc. of Boston, a worldwide Olympic sponsor. ``There's a
halo effect that enhances and differentiates your brand.''
</P>
<P>
   As befitting a world event, the Olympics are a moveable feast,
and to accommodate the late Australian summer, the 17-day games in
Sydney are beginning about two months later than the 1996 games did
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Up against summer reruns, July Olympics tend to score high US
ratings. But a September start means Sydney will compete for the
attention of busy Americans with baseball pennant races, a new
football season, a new fall TV season, and a new school year. And
the 15-hour time difference could make it even harder for American
viewers to get excited about the Olympics this year.
</P>
<P>
   Will a fan opt to watch the Red Sox in real time or the delayed
coverage of an hours-old shotput contest won by some large and
obscure athlete from Tajikistan?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, which at one
point had Hancock hinting that it might withdraw its sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   But despite scandals, time differences, and busy fall schedules,
marketers remain bullish about Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Over its current four-year budget cycle, the International
Olympic Committee says it could rake in $3.5 billion, in part
because big companies such as Hancock, Eastman Kodak Co., and Xerox
are willing to pony up big bucks to link some of their marketing
efforts to the fabled Olympic rings.
</P>
<P>
   Among companies with some Olympic ties are Monster.com of
Maynard, Mass., which operates a job-search and career-management
Web site, and Reebok International Ltd. of Canton, Mass., a maker
of athletic footwear and apparel.
</P>
<P>
   As the games unfold and heroes emerge, the Olympics should once
again win over Americans, but a sense of anticipation seemed
lacking as the opening cermony drew nigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so conditioned to the Olympics in July that beating the
drum in September'' seems odd, says Larry Moulter, a prime mover in
the building of the FleetCenter in Boston and someone who's devoted
much of his professional career to sports marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence of three teenagers, the Moulter household
is so far immune to Olympics fever; its more preoccupied by school,
baseball, and a new football season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In September, it's hard to get mind-share,'' says Moulter,
chief marketing officer of Mirror Image Internet Inc. of Woburn,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But he's quick to note that such a perspective is
``America-centric.'' For a corporation seeking global reach, he
says, ``The Olympics are the biggest footprint you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Looked at this way, the $40 million to $65 million that some top
sponsors are paying for four years of Olympic marketing rights
could well turn out to be a shrewd investment.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Hancock, worldwide sponsors include Coca-Cola Co.,
McDonald's Corp., and IBM. The 11 top sponsors paid a total of $605
million, up 51 percent from the amount collected for the Atlanta
games, according to IEG Sponsorship Report.
</P>
<P>
   If the scandals had involved athletes, sponsors might have
reason to fear a fan backlash and a drop-off in TV viewership.
</P>
<P>
   But few fans are likely to tune out Sydney because some
officials took bribes to pick Salt Lake City as the site for the
2002 winter games, says IEG managing editor Sean Brenner.
</P>
<P>
   Already Syndey seems a good bet for the NBC network, which has
sold $900 million worth of air time to advertisers after paying
$705 million for the US television rights, according to Advertising
Age. NBC plans to parcel out coverage between itself and its two
cable sister stations, CNBC and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Past Olympics have drawn audiences of upscale US viewers who
normally don't watch a lot of TV. The games are also something that
families watch together, a phenomenon that has become more rare in
an age of three- and four-TV households with cable access to 40
different channels. For US advertisers, this big audience makes the
Olympics highly desirable.
</P>
<P>
   To a fan, the games are 17 days of sports, but to a corporate
sponsor, the Olympics are about long-term benefits that can't
always be seen on TV or measured in ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, for example, has invited about 500 top sales agents to
Sydney, both as a reward and for retraining. Mornings will be
devoted to business, the rest of the day to fun and games.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsorship offers other benefits. In a country where a company
is unknown, the Olympic rings can be a calling card.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock recently received permission to operate in China, Burgay
says. If Beijing wins its bid to host the games in 2008, Hancock
stands to reap a marketing bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   For a company with a global perspective, this may be the
ultimate payoff, says marketing guru Moulter. Keep something in
mind, he says: ``We're never going to see what McDonald's does with
its Olympic promotions in Italy or Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   As a new sponsor of the US Olympic Committee, Monster.com is
looking ahead to Salt Lake City and the 2002 winter games.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers expect Olympic sponsors to be more than mere
advertisers, says Monster.com vice president Peter Blacklow;
consumers expect sponsors to contribute something to the games.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Monster plans to offer online training to the
25,000 volunteers who will help stage the Salt Lake City games.
When the games end, Monster plans to help athletes find jobs. Not
only should such programs generate good will, but they should also
build awareness around what Monster does.
</P>
<P>
   Sneaker-maker Reebok won't have as a big a presence in Sydney as
it has had in some past Olympics. Looking to re-energize its brand,
Reebok has decided not to run TV ads during the games.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it has been testing other marketing initiatives,
including a successful tie-in to the ``Survivor'' TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Reebok will have a big ``on-field presence;'' more than
2,500 Sydney athletes or officials will wear its gear, says Denise
Kaigler, senior director of public relations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several local ad agencies have produced ads that are
scheduled to air during the games.
</P>
<P>
   Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos of Boston has some new ads for
Hancock. Mullen of Wenham has done a spot for Monster. And Boston's
Arnold Communications plans to air new work for Volkswagen of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Internet is ``globalizing commerce'' and forcing
companies to enter new foreign markets, marketing guru Moulter
thinks that Olympic sponsorships can only gain in value.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, the Olympic rings have emerged as one of the
few marketing icons that have worldwide currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about global commerce and the Internet revolution,''
he says. ``It used to be the global village. Now it's the village
laptop. And the Olympic rings gives you a marketing tool you can
take to any part of the world.''

   RIDING THE INFORMATION HIGHWAY
</P>
<P>
   A fleet of 10 Internet-enabled taxis hit the streets of New York
on Thursday in a venture between Yahoo, Team Systems, a large taxi
fleet operator, and Medallion Financial, which provides loans for
taxi operators. The purple and yellow, purple-upholstered taxis are
equipped with Palm hand-held computers, offering passengers access
to the Internet at no extra cost. ``This will be a great
opportunity for taxi passengers to stay on top of their business
and personal lives while riding in the comfort of a taxicab,'' said
Andrew Murstein, president of Medallion Financial. The initiative,
which follows a similar effort by Yahoo in San Francisco, is part
of a trend by many companies to deliver Internet content on
wireless devices in a variety of ways.

<P>
   In an effort to extend its business from office printers to
business publishing, Hewlett-Packard said Thursday that it would
invest $100 million in Indigo, a Dutch maker of digital color
printing systems. The move, which a company vice president said was
the largest single investment that Hewlett's printing division has
made in at least 18 months, sent Indigo's American depository
receipts soaring $1.156, or 17.6 percent, to $7.7188. Hewlett
shares gained $1.25, to $106.25. &QL;

   The Irish security software company Baltimore Technologies
acquired Content Technologies Holdings, a London-based developer of

702.5 million pounds ($992 million). The deal increases Baltimore's
North American presence, through Content Technologies' four United
States offices. Content Technologies' MIMEsweeper software, which
protects against junk e-mail and computer viruses, has an installed
base of 6 million users at 6,000 customer sites, and is

   `GARAGE SALE' MODEL FOR WEB SALES

   Aiming to mimic the deals available at yard sales, where prices

WebSwap.com introduced a new ``Garage Sale'' service Thursday
through which prices of goods for sale decline over time. Sellers
set starting and minimum prices for an item, and the service
automatically decreases the price by a set amount every hour over
the course of seven days _ or until someone snaps up whatever is
being offered for sale. WebSwap.com also offers a regular listing
service where sellers can post an item for sale at a set price,
without charge for 30 days or, for a 25-cent fee, for 90 days.

   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Randy Ableman has been dreaming the same
dream for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   He's climbing the ladder to the 3-meter springboard for his last
dive. The meet is on the line and Ableman hasn't practiced. He's
out of shape. He's terrified he's about to launch into a big, fat
belly-flop with 10,000 eyes glued to his every move.
</P>
<P>
   And then the dream ends.
</P>
<P>
   If his subconscious had any sense of proportion he'd nail the
dive and wake up happy. Ableman is, after all, a former Olympian
and a collegiate champion. Now a diving coach at the University of
Miami, he has been named NCAA coach of the year nine of the last 11
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the dream mirrors his fate. Ableman had the misfortune of
reaching his athletic peak in 1980. The year the Soviets invaded
Afghanistan. The year the hostage crisis in Iran was making
President Carter look like a wimp.
</P>
<P>
   And the year America boycotted the Olympic Games in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Just like in his recurring dream, Ableman never got to make the
biggest dive of his life.
</P>
<P>
   It's true, he wasn't favored to win a gold medal that year. He
was slated to compete against the legendary Greg Louganis, who made
four Olympic teams and dominated American diving for almost two
decades. But Ableman was 21 years old, confident, 40 pounds slimmer
and cheerily optimistic. ``I had a shot,'' he said. ``I've seen
divers that have nailed a dive for years suddenly miss it in big
meets. You never know how you'll respond in a situation like that
and in our sport there is nothing like the Olympics. Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   As the nation winds up for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney and
the worldwide media machine starts recounting glorious moments from
Olympics past, about 400 members of the 1980 U.S. Olympic team are
taking deep breaths and trying to keep some old ghosts at bay.
</P>
<P>
   These Olympians from that forgotten team have moved on with
their lives. They've become lawyers, brokers, coaches and
psychologists. But even after two decades, flashes of disgust and
even despair spark when they talk about what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Marshall Duane. Duane could be a poster boy for Merrill
Lynch, where he's worked almost since the boycott. With his
impeccable manners, country-club tan and corner office, he exudes
the confidence you might expect from someone who handles other
people's money. But when he talks about the Games, about what
should have been, his blue eyes narrow ever so slightly.
</P>
<P>
   As a former member of the U.S. Olympic sailing team, Duane _
like all Olympians _ still gets first crack at Olympic tickets
every four years. But when the Games were held in Atlanta in 1996,
he said he just couldn't bring himself to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been there eating my heart out,'' he said.
``Maybe that's a terrible way to think about it, but I'm extremely
competitive. It happens every four years. I think that somehow that
should have been me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ableman missed the 1984 U.S. Olympic Diving Team by three spots.
Duane, training with a wife and a child to support, could muster
only a half-hearted attempt at the sailing trials. He wasn't close.
</P>
<P>
   They are left to wonder about the shot they did have in 1980.
They are left to wonder: What if?
</P>
<P>
   BOYCOTT THWARTS LIFETIME GOAL
</P>
<P>
   Doug Brown is the head coach of the track and cross-country
teams at the University of Florida. On the wall in his office are
photos from his athletic career. Among them: a shot of the 1980
U.S. Olympic track and field team. ``It was a good one,'' Brown
says.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has something to compare it to. The 48-year-old
represented the United States in the steeplechase on the 1972 and
1976 Olympic teams as well. In neither Games did he run as well as
he'd hoped. Steeplechasers _ who leap over hurdles and water
ditches along a 3,000-yard course _ don't typically peak until
their late twenties, so he took aim at the Moscow Games. He wanted
one more chance to reach his lifelong goal of an Olympic medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my life on hold,'' he said. ``I put off kids, I put off
a career.''
</P>
<P>
   To support himself and his wife, Brown sold lumber part time in
Eugene, Ore., while he trained four hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   He had one of the fastest times in the world and was in the best
shape of his life when the trials were run in June. He qualified
easily. And even though President Carter had threatened to boycott
the Games in January and the United States Olympic Committee had
voted to boycott in April, Brown said he didn't believe it would
actually come to that by the time the teams were chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't make sense,'' he said. ``There were too many other
alternatives there that could have worked.''
</P>
<P>
   President Carter felt otherwise. Convinced that the world map
could be drastically altered if the free world ignored Soviet
aggression, the president dispatched Vice President Walter Mondale
to Colorado where Olympic committee delegates were meeting. Mondale
called the boycott vote ``truly a referendum on freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is at stake is no less than the future security of the
civilized world. . . if we and our allies and friends fail to use
every single peaceful means available to preserve the peace, what
hope is there that peace will be long preserved?''
</P>
<P>
   The USOC voted by a 2-to-1 margin to boycott the Games.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate the athletes for the sacrifice, Carter had the
entire U.S. Olympic Team to the White House for a reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was honoring the office, not the man,'' said Brown, who did
not race at the next trials because he had children and a full-time
job with Nike and was too busy to train. ``To this day I tell
people I was a member of Jimmy Carter's Special Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   The boycott had no immediate discernible effect on the Soviets
and many believed it accomplished nothing at all. The
Soviet-installed government in Afghanistan remained in place until
1992 when it was overthrown by Islamic resistance groups.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State under
President Nixon, said that although he favored the boycott at the
time, ``in retrospect, I think it was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still get angry when I think about it how dumb it was, how
short-sighted,'' says Brown. ``It didn't have any impact on the
world of politics but it had a lot of impact on the young Americans
that Carter was supposed to represent.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Hogshead-Makar, who made the U.S. Olympic Swimming Team in
1980 and again in 1984, said she supported the boycott at the time.
``I got suckered into the rhetoric of the day which was 'You
Olympians are going to save us from World War III,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing years, she came to believe Carter had used the
Olympics as political tool. ``I think he backed himself into a
corner and couldn't get out of it,'' Hogshead-Makar said from
Jacksonville, where she is now an attorney. ``We had the hostage
crisis and he was getting crucified every day, he was seen as
inept. Here was something he could do operatively . . . as I got
older I realized I had been a sap.''
</P>
<P>
   From Hogshead-Makar's perspective the boycott cost not only her
_ she would have been tremendously marketable if she had gone into
the Los Angeles Games in 1984 with a few gold medals under her belt
_ but an entire generation of athletes, particularly women.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, women were believed to peak athletically by their
late teens and they had few role models or opportunities to prove
otherwise. The Olympics were one of the few events that turned
girls on to sports.
</P>
<P>
   While she got a chance to compete in the 1984 Games, she said
she sympathizes with the athletes who were shut out of the Games
altogether. ``I've been to pretty much every sporting event in the
world, the Tour de France, the Super Bowl, the World Series, the
World Cup, the Kentucky Derby, you name it. Either as a commentator
or a spectator I've been there, and there is nothing like the
Olympics. There's a spirit of wonder and of humanity that's there
that I just haven't found anyplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Potter knew enough about that spirit to know what she
was missing in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   An Olympian in 1972 and 1976, she had been an elite diver for
almost a decade and won the Olympic bronze medal in 1976. She came
out of retirement to give the 1980 games one last shot.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare, she took a leave of absence from her job and moved
to Texas where the trials were to be held so she could train full
time. For six months she practiced twice a day, lifted weights, ran
and stretched.
</P>
<P>
   When she heard the boycott was for real she remembers thinking
it was a bad a joke. ``I thought, he's got to be kidding. (The
situation in Afghanistan) has nothing to do with me.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later she was driving north on Highway 75 in Texas and
she broke down in tears. ``I still had not dealt with it and all
that anger was ruining my life,'' Potter said. She sought
counseling and has since come to look at the boycott as a sort of
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't think it was a good decision but it was an
opportunity to learn about ourselves. About how we could accept
hard truths and not hold onto resentment or bitterness.'' Potter
will be in Sydney this year working for NBC as a commentator for
diving.
</P>
<P>
   Meg Neyer was another member of the women's 1980 Olympic Diving
Team and she has had to go through her own grieving process because
of the boycott which, she says, is reintroduced every time the
subject comes up. The conversation almost always goes the same way,
she says. She tells people she was an Olympian. They ask if she won
a medal and she tells them she was on the team that didn't get to
compete. They say something like 'Oh that stinks,' and change the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Vietnam vets,'' said Neyer. ``I don't want that
analogy to be misunderstood, but from a public perception
standpoint we did something really stupid so we don't want to talk
about it and people don't know what to do with it. And this
generation of kids who weren't even alive during the Cold War, to
them it sounds so stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Neyer was favored to lead the 1984 Olympic women's diving team
but missed a dive and did not qualify for the team. She quit diving
for a year but came back and finished her career at the University
of Florida, where she went on to win her eighth consecutive NCAA
diving title.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately Neyer went on to get her Ph.D. in sports psychology.
She practices today in Atlanta, part of her speciality is helping
athletes leave athletics and enter different fields.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her own ``what if's,'' she takes some solace in her one
encounter with the Russian diver who won the 1980 Olympic gold
medal in Moscow. The two competed in 1982 at the world diving
championships in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' Neyer said. ``I kicked her ass.''

ADVERTISERS GEAR UP FOR OLYMPIC EXTRAVAGANZA

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Olympics begin Friday night, but other than companies paying
big sponsorship fees, are many Americans paying attention yet?
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the Atlanta summer games started in July, and for
Americans, the viewing was easy.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance this year's games in Sydney 15 time zones away
shape up as much more of a marketing challenge, but such is the
global power of the Olympic brand that corporate sponsors still
think they will get their money's worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic rings give you instant credibility all over the
world,'' says vice president Steve Burgay of John Hancock Financial
Services Inc. of Boston, a worldwide Olympic sponsor. ``There's a
halo effect that enhances and differentiates your brand.''
</P>
<P>
   As befitting a world event, the Olympics are a moveable feast,
and to accommodate the late Australian summer, the 17-day games in
Sydney are beginning about two months later than the 1996 games did
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Up against summer reruns, July Olympics tend to score high US
ratings. But a September start means Sydney will compete for the
attention of busy Americans with baseball pennant races, a new
football season, a new fall TV season, and a new school year. And
the 15-hour time difference could make it even harder for American
viewers to get excited about the Olympics this year.
</P>
<P>
   Will a fan opt to watch the Red Sox in real time or the delayed
coverage of an hours-old shotput contest won by some large and
obscure athlete from Tajikistan?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, which at one
point had Hancock hinting that it might withdraw its sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   But despite scandals, time differences, and busy fall schedules,
marketers remain bullish about Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Over its current four-year budget cycle, the International
Olympic Committee says it could rake in $3.5 billion, in part
because big companies such as Hancock, Eastman Kodak Co., and Xerox
are willing to pony up big bucks to link some of their marketing
efforts to the fabled Olympic rings.
</P>
<P>
   Among companies with some Olympic ties are Monster.com of
Maynard, Mass., which operates a job-search and career-management
Web site, and Reebok International Ltd. of Canton, Mass., a maker
of athletic footwear and apparel.
</P>
<P>
   As the games unfold and heroes emerge, the Olympics should once
again win over Americans, but a sense of anticipation seemed
lacking as the opening cermony drew nigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so conditioned to the Olympics in July that beating the
drum in September'' seems odd, says Larry Moulter, a prime mover in
the building of the FleetCenter in Boston and someone who's devoted
much of his professional career to sports marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence of three teenagers, the Moulter household
is so far immune to Olympics fever; its more preoccupied by school,
baseball, and a new football season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In September, it's hard to get mind-share,'' says Moulter,
chief marketing officer of Mirror Image Internet Inc. of Woburn,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But he's quick to note that such a perspective is
``America-centric.'' For a corporation seeking global reach, he
says, ``The Olympics are the biggest footprint you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Looked at this way, the $40 million to $65 million that some top
sponsors are paying for four years of Olympic marketing rights
could well turn out to be a shrewd investment.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Hancock, worldwide sponsors include Coca-Cola Co.,
McDonald's Corp., and IBM. The 11 top sponsors paid a total of $605
million, up 51 percent from the amount collected for the Atlanta
games, according to IEG Sponsorship Report.
</P>
<P>
   If the scandals had involved athletes, sponsors might have
reason to fear a fan backlash and a drop-off in TV viewership.
</P>
<P>
   But few fans are likely to tune out Sydney because some
officials took bribes to pick Salt Lake City as the site for the
2002 winter games, says IEG managing editor Sean Brenner.
</P>
<P>
   Already Syndey seems a good bet for the NBC network, which has
sold $900 million worth of air time to advertisers after paying
$705 million for the US television rights, according to Advertising
Age. NBC plans to parcel out coverage between itself and its two
cable sister stations, CNBC and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Past Olympics have drawn audiences of upscale US viewers who
normally don't watch a lot of TV. The games are also something that
families watch together, a phenomenon that has become more rare in
an age of three- and four-TV households with cable access to 40
different channels. For US advertisers, this big audience makes the
Olympics highly desirable.
</P>
<P>
   To a fan, the games are 17 days of sports, but to a corporate
sponsor, the Olympics are about long-term benefits that can't
always be seen on TV or measured in ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, for example, has invited about 500 top sales agents to
Sydney, both as a reward and for retraining. Mornings will be
devoted to business, the rest of the day to fun and games.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsorship offers other benefits. In a country where a company
is unknown, the Olympic rings can be a calling card.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock recently received permission to operate in China, Burgay
says. If Beijing wins its bid to host the games in 2008, Hancock
stands to reap a marketing bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   For a company with a global perspective, this may be the
ultimate payoff, says marketing guru Moulter. Keep something in
mind, he says: ``We're never going to see what McDonald's does with
its Olympic promotions in Italy or Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   As a new sponsor of the US Olympic Committee, Monster.com is
looking ahead to Salt Lake City and the 2002 winter games.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers expect Olympic sponsors to be more than mere
advertisers, says Monster.com vice president Peter Blacklow;
consumers expect sponsors to contribute something to the games.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Monster plans to offer online training to the
25,000 volunteers who will help stage the Salt Lake City games.
When the games end, Monster plans to help athletes find jobs. Not
only should such programs generate good will, but they should also
build awareness around what Monster does.
</P>
<P>
   Sneaker-maker Reebok won't have as a big a presence in Sydney as
it has had in some past Olympics. Looking to re-energize its brand,
Reebok has decided not to run TV ads during the games.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it has been testing other marketing initiatives,
including a successful tie-in to the ``Survivor'' TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Reebok will have a big ``on-field presence;'' more than
2,500 Sydney athletes or officials will wear its gear, says Denise
Kaigler, senior director of public relations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several local ad agencies have produced ads that are
scheduled to air during the games.
</P>
<P>
   Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos of Boston has some new ads for
Hancock. Mullen of Wenham has done a spot for Monster. And Boston's
Arnold Communications plans to air new work for Volkswagen of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Internet is ``globalizing commerce'' and forcing
companies to enter new foreign markets, marketing guru Moulter
thinks that Olympic sponsorships can only gain in value.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, the Olympic rings have emerged as one of the
few marketing icons that have worldwide currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about global commerce and the Internet revolution,''
he says. ``It used to be the global village. Now it's the village
laptop. And the Olympic rings gives you a marketing tool you can
take to any part of the world.''

NFL MATCHUPS FOR WEEK 3 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAME OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (2-0) at Jets (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   The Jets seek their first 3-0 start since 1966. That's almost 40
years of history working against them. But this team has courage.
The Jets were completely outplayed by New England until the final
six minutes Monday night and still won. If they play that poorly
against the Bills, New York will lose. The Jets should play much
better, however, and win a close one.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Jets, 21-17
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY, 1 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (1-1) at Carolina (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons looked awful last week against Denver. They were
slow, ragged and disorganized. The games between these two teams
are usually close and high scoring, which means Atlanta will likely
play better. The difference maker is Carolina quarterback Steve
Beuerlein, who is first in the conference with a 116.1 passer
rating. Atlanta's defense gets torched for 300 passing yards.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Panthers, 28-24
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati (0-2) at Jacksonville (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Mark Brunell, for one of the first times in his
career, has spent the early part of this season as a classic
dropback passer. Brunell loves to roll out and play loose, so the
fact he has stayed in the pocket and is playing well, is a good
omen for the Jaguars. Not to mention that against Cincinnati,
Brunell is 3-0 with a passer rating of 113.2.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Jaguars, 25-10
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia (1-1) at Green Bay (0-2)
</P>
<P>
   Winning at Lambeau Field is not as difficult as it used to be.
The Jets did it in the season opener and the Eagles are capable.
After running back Duce Staley (11 yards) was shut down by the
Giants, he will rebound against a weak Green Bay defense. The
Packers are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Eagles, 17-14
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (0-1) at Cleveland (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Kent Graham injured his throwing hand during
practice this week after banging it on teammate's helmet. He will
likely start but there is no question his throwing motion will be
affected. Backup Kordell Stewart had a touchdown pass and run in
last game against Cleveland last season. The Browns showed a spark
last week against Cincinnati but the Steelers have a much better
defense than the Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Steelers, 18-14
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (0-2) at St. Louis (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   How good are the Rams? Their defense has allowed 382 yards a
game and they are still undefeated. How bad are the 49ers? They
give up 404.5 yards a game. When Rams coaches were looking at game
film, they were shocked at just how far San Francisco's defense has
fallen. The Rams will score so many points the wide receivers will
need track shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Rams, 40-17
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (2-0) at Detroit (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the more intriguing games of the week, mainly
because both teams have outstanding defenses. Tampa Bay is one of
the fastest, most well coached defensive units of the past decade.
Surprisingly, the Lions also have a solid unit, allowing just 292.5
yards of offense in the first two games, second best in the
conference. The better defense will win this one, and it belongs to
Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Buccaneers, 13-9
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES:
</P>
<P>
   Denver (1-1) at Oakland (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   Broncos' quarterback Brian Griese is first in the league with a
quarterback rating of 120, so Denver has found its replacement for
John Elway. The Raiders are a surprising 2-0 because of _ guess
who? _ Tyrone Wheatley, the Giants' castoff. Whenever the Raiders
venture inside the 20-yard line Wheatley is a major weapon with his
bull rush up the middle or his sprinter speed to the outside. These
games are always close and Oakland wins in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Raiders, 24-21
</P>
<P>
   San Diego (0-2) at Kansas City (0-2)
</P>
<P>
   Coach Gunther Cunningham hasn't talked about quitting the past
few days, so other than the Chiefs' poor start, everything is fine
in Kansas City. Actually, it's disastrous, because the Chiefs have
had two extremely brutal close losses, the last one coming to
Tennessee in overtime. Those losses are still eating at the Chiefs
and will prove too great a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Chargers, 20-17
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (2-0) at New England (0-2)
</P>
<P>
   Rookie quarterback Daunte Culpepper was supposed to be in over
his head, but he has performed more proficiently than that of his
Pro Bowl counterpart, Drew Bledsoe. The Patriots have an excellent
secondary overall, but few teams can stop Randy Moss and Cris
Carter, and Minnesota's defense is playing extremely well.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Vikings, 20-10
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans (1-1) at Seattle (0-2)
</P>
<P>
   The Saints finally have a decent offense mainly because
quarterback Jeff Blake has added the long pass to the arsenal. The
Seahawks are in total disarray. General manager and coach Mike
Holmgren is discovering that doing both jobs is much harder than it
appears.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Saints, 35-28
</P>
<P>
   Giants (2-0) at Chicago (0-2)
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have an offense for the first time since Phil Simms
was the quarterback. The defense is playing inspired because for
the first time in years those players can actually have a break,
and not go right back on the field after stopping an opposing
offense. Michael Strahan manhandled Philadelphia offensive tackle
Jon Runyan, linebacker Jessie Armstead is again playing at a Pro
Bowl level and cornerback Jason Sehorn is blanketing receivers.
This game will be tough because the Bears know if they lose any
playoff hopes are all but gone.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Giants, 27-16
</P>
<P>
   Sunday Night
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore (2-0) at Miami (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   Tony Banks has to be considered one of the hotter quarterbacks
in the game, mainly because he has demonstrated poise and great arm
strength. The offense, surprisingly, is carrying this team, when
its defense is clearly the better half. When Baltimore's defense
does catch its breath, the team will be that much better.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Ravens, 20-6
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY 9 P.M.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (0-2) at Washington (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the Washington organization is waiting for impatient
owner Daniel Snyder to go on one of his firing binges, beginning
with Coach Norv Turner. One day Snyder will go off, but not this
week. He knows there is no reason to panic _ the Cowboys are not
very good. The team is old and quarterback Troy Aikman, because of
numerous concussions, is becoming more frail as each season passes.
Washington's defense is playing well and will shut down what little
offense the Cowboys possess.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction; Redskins, 28-12.

BETTER-LOOKING TEENS SHORTENING CHILDHOOD, SOME WORRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some trademarks of the teenage face are eternal: the scowl, the
eye-roll, the smirk. Whether they grow up listening to vinyl
records or CDs, the adolescent appearance has always had a certain
rebellious sameness.
</P>
<P>
   But look closely at the current crop of teenagers and one
indisputable fact becomes clear: They have better-looking faces
than their parents did at the same age several decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   New treatments for acne, crooked teeth and vision problems give
today's teens more options, even cures of sorts, for these scourges
of adolescence. The nicknames Pizza Face, Metal Mouth and Four Eyes
aren't entirely things of the past, but new medical devices and
drugs give these young people far more control over how they look _
even more than they can get from hair gels, blow dryers and
designer clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have to suffer the same kind of growing pains as we
did,'' said Robert Doyle, a child psychiatrist at McLean Hospital
in Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Howe, a 16-year-old, is virtually cured of his severe acne
after taking a drug called Acutane, whereas his mother suffered
from serious acne for years as a teen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now when I look in the mirror, there's nothing to remind me of
how bad it was.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lopez, 53, the head football coach at Lincoln-Sudbury
(Mass.) High School, said teens today, including his son, look
better than he did at the same age. He recalls his awkwardness as a
gangling 6-feet, 4-inch teen, with silver bulky braces and thick
glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, standard braces are on for shorter periods of time and come
off usually by high school, and contact lenses are a popular option
as early as middle school. At least in the facial looks department,
``Teens today have a smoother run through adolescence,'' Lopez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some psychologists and physicians worry, however, that these
cosmetic improvements may only heighten the standards of good looks
for an age group already preoccupied with looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're shortening the time from childhood to adulthood,'' said
Lynda Young, a Worcester, Mass. pediatrician in practice for more
than 20 years. ``We've also raised the bar. Now, if a teenager has
a few pimples, people say, `Why don't you do something about it?'
It's not, ``Don't worry. It will be better in a few years.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of buying a tube of Clearasil to attack simple pimples,
teens today quickly think of a dermatologist. As Amy Thebearge, 15,
of Medford, put it: ``Now, if you have some bad acne, it really
stands out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some psychologists say even if teens today have some advantages
over past generations, it's a drop in the mammoth self-esteem
bucket. In this celebrity culture, many teens strive to look like
T.V. stars such as Jennifer Love Hewitt of Party of Five or James
Van Der Beek of Dawson's Creek, or compare themselves to photos of
glamorous models _ where blemishes are often air-brushed out of the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Attaining a certain look can also be costly. A standard set of
braces, for instance, costs about $4,000 to $5,000, with only some
part potentially covered by insurance. If patients seek the novel
invisible braces, the cost goes up by the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Some physicians worry that treatments for braces or acne are
beginning too early or too aggressively. Many drugs have unwanted
side effects, and there's a heated debate in the orthodontic
community about the growing practice of putting braces on
youngsters before all their adult teeth are in.
</P>
<P>
   Enhancing beauty through surgery is also on the rise in this age
group, with 175,000 teens choosing some kind of aesthetic plastic
surgery last year, a tripling of the number from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a more aggressive can-do attitude about physical
woes, Young has listened to numerous teenage girls inquire about
costly breast augmentation or mole-removals. Entertainment
publications have speculated that teen pop star Britney Spears has
had breast-enlarging surgery, but she has not confirmed this.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the greatest rise in teenage cosmetic
surgery cases is in the areas of chemical peels, laser hair removal
and breast augmentation, according to statistics from the American
Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.
</P>
<P>
   While surgery on noses and ears remain the most common cosmetic
procedures, there's evidence that teens are exposing themselves to
novel ones, too. Some physicians report that some teenage boys are
asking about calf implants to increase the shape of that part of
the leg.
</P>
<P>
   Leida Snow, spokeswoman for the American Society for Aesthetic
Plastic Surgery, said while teen cosmetic surgery has grown, it's
far from common: Teenage cosmetic surgery cases last year represent
fewer than 1 percent of U.S. teens. She added that such procedures,
particularly when they alleviate a disfiguring problem, gives a
psychological boost to many teens.
</P>
<P>
   While teen cosmetic surgery remains controversial _ so much so
that federal regulators recently set age 18 as the minimum age for
cosmetic breast augmentation _ today's new treatments have
indisputable advantages for teens like Howe, a Medfield, Mass.
football player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so much better about myself,'' said Howe, who took
Acutane for six months last year. ``I don't have to avoid getting
my picture taken or feel embarrassed and disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Sandy, 44, remembers avoiding her senior prom
because of her bad acne. The available creams and antibiotics never
worked for her.
</P>
<P>
   While Acutane has some side effects, such as a sense of
excessive drying, and potential birth-defect risks for pregnant
women, she said the drug spared her son years of emotional trauma:
``We're so glad his face is clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Even moderate or mild acne is far more treatable, said Dr. Ivor
Caro, a dermatologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who has
been in practice for 25 years. An array of new drugs and topical
ointments are available that control acne by regulating hormones,
bacteria, oil production or skin inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   With all the available treatments these days, Newton
dermatologist, Dr. Lynn Baden, said: ``There's no reason someone
should get acne scars now.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the hideous bulky metal braces of decades past have
now been replaced by new devices that are less obtrusive. Some
teens go so far as to say they are ``fashion statements'' in middle
school.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of thick metal bands that go around each tooth,
orthodontists now use thinner brackets that are glued on to each
tooth. Dr. Barton Tayer, a Brookline, Mass. orthodontist, said the
nickel titanium wire, which has a memory for the shape it wants to
create, has helped abbreviate the length of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Many teens like the option of selecting different color elastic
ties, which go around each bracket. Ziva Reimer, a junior at
Brookline High School, said she used to change the color of her
ties often, picking traditional Judaic blue and white for Jewish
holidays and orange and black for Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fifth grade, it was cool to wear braces,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   New advances in contact lenses means that more teens get them at
an earlier age, and are trusted to use them properly.
Color-changing contacts are also available with prescriptions.
While many teens inquire about it, laser eye surgery is not usually
done on teenage patients because their eyes are still changing.
</P>
<P>
   Though only partly a cosmetic issue, physicians also point out
that menstruating girls now have the option of easier-to-use
tampons. Baby boomers going through their teen years often just
used bulky pads, feeling uncomfortable with the cardboard-dispenser
tampons. Today's teens can use the narrower, easy-to-glide
plastic-dispenser tampons, and the comfort and convenience of them
is particularly helpful for girls in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists say if today's teens don't fully appreciate their
cosmetic advantages, it's because they compare themselves to each
other, not teens of past generations. The size of the pimple, in
other words, is in the eye of the beholder.
</P>
<P>
   If teens are spared thick glasses or bad acne, they are still
wrestling with surging hormones, new body shapes, voice changes and
body hair growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're not worried about zits, it's something else,'' said
Dr. Gregory Fritz, a psychiatrist who is editor of the Brown
University Child and Adolescent Behavior Letter. ``There's a
certain awkwardness that is just in the minds of teens.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents say anything that helps teens through this
turbulent time is a good thing, but they also hope they develop a
more tolerant attitude about any perceived blemishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want a magical cure for everything,'' said Anita Cote,
42, of Salem, Mass., mother of two teens. ``With us, we just had to
live with it. It was an accepted part of growing up.''

COURT ORDERS SUHARTO TO BE EXAMINED BY INDEPENDENT MEDICAL TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (No byline)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ A court in Jakarta ordered an independent
medical team Thursday to determine whether the former President
Suharto was fit to stand trial for corruption after he again
declined a summons to appear in court, citing ill health. Suharto
failed to appear when the trial opened on Aug. 31, forcing a
two-week delay.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing Thursday opened just hours after a powerful car bomb
exploded at the Jakarta Stock Exchange building on Wednesday,
killing 15 people.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's continued absence and the intensifying violence in
Jakarta at each stage of the case have increased pressure on the
government to show that it has the will to prosecute him.
</P>
<P>
   The police acknowledged that the latest explosion might be
linked to bombings in recent weeks that had been blamed on
supporters of Suharto. Senior government officials have accused
military and political extremists linked to him of trying to derail
both the corruption trial and investigations into human rights
abuses during his 32-year regime.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Reuters, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman
said: ``There is a perception that any time the government raises
the pressure on Mr. Suharto or any of his cronies, then these
things happen in Jakarta or in the regions. I think there are
elements connected to the military establishment who make these
incidents possible, rogue elements, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, 79, is accused of stealing $571 million from the state
and funneling the money into the businesses of his family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers deny the charges and insist that he does not have
the mental capacity to stand trial because strokes last year left
him with brain damage _ a defense that has been compared to that of
the former Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet, who fought an
extradition battle in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Lalu Mariyun, chief of the South Jakarta District Court,
ordered physicians from the Indonesian Doctors Association and from
three prominent universities to ``conduct a comprehensive medical
checkup'' on Suharto and report to the judges at a hearing on Sept.
28.
</P>
<P>
   The government has so far declined to escort the former leader
forcibly to court from his villa in Jakarta, where he lives under
house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant's chair sat empty Thursday while the panel of five
judges heard medical testimony from the prosecution and defense for
three hours. More than 400 uniformed police officers stood guard
outside the auditorium in South Jakarta where the trial is being
held.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's entire medical team of 23 doctors, wearing white
hospital coats, appeared in the courtroom to testify about his
ailments, which they said included hypertension, kidney stones and
heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   His chief doctor, Teguh Ranakusuma, and two colleagues presented
Suharto's health history, projecting images of his brain on a large
screen. They said Suharto had suffered three strokes last year, and
warned that forcing him to attend the trial could trigger a fourth
and fatal one.
</P>
<P>
   A state-appointed medical team examined Suharto three times in
the past six months, and although they conceded that he had trouble
communicating, they determined that he could stand trial.

BLAIR GOVERNMENT BEARS BRUNT OF FUEL-CRISIS ANGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As Britain's fuel crisis began to recede Thursday, the
nation's most popular government in recent history was pondering
how it so badly misread public opinion by steadfastly refusing to
cut the highest fuel tax in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel deliveries rose to levels unseen in a week as most
demonstrators ended their blockades of refineries, officials said
it could be two weeks before supplies return to normal.
</P>
<P>
   At Stanlow refinery, where the uprising began last week, protest
leader Brynle Williams, a farmer, said the demonstrators _ urging
an end to the tax _ should quit while they still enjoyed the
support of most Britons and before widespread hardship was caused.
</P>
<P>
   For the third day in a row, a chastened Prime Minister Tony
Blair faced reporters after spending the day twisting the arms of
oil executives. Blair blames the industry for the crisis, saying it
did not do enough to force its drivers to defy the relatively small
number of protesters who congregated at the gates of the nation's
nine main refineries.
</P>
<P>
   But polls suggest the vast majority of British people blame not
the protesters or the oil companies, but the government. There is
widespread anger with the government for setting the fuel tax at
what most Britons consider too high, and for not being more
creative in finding a way to defuse the protests that led to panic
buying of gas and food, causing shortages and chaos.
</P>
<P>
   At nearly $5 a gallon, with 76 percent of that price going to
taxes, gasoline in Britain is the most expensive and most-taxed in
Europe. For many Britons, living in a nation that produces oil, and
which is enjoying what even Blair calls a golden period of economic
growth and low unemployment, such prices seem unfair, the product
of a greedy government.
</P>
<P>
   As the crisis deepened, Gordon Brown, chancellor of the
Exchequer, reminded Britons that their income taxes are among the
lowest in Europe, and that for nearly two decades important
services such as health and education have been subsidized by the
more than $50 billion the gas tax raises each year.
</P>
<P>
   Most British people don't want to hear it. They look east and
see that the Irish, who are enjoying record budget surpluses, pay a
third less for their gasoline, while only 58 percent of the price
the Irish pay at the pump is tax. Britons look west and see that
the French pay 20 percent less for gasoline, but enjoy a national
health service that is superior to Britain's. Britons don't accept
that the Germans, Dutch and Belgians can pay less for fuel, and are
hardly mollified by the fact that there are growing protest
movements against the fuel tax in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bill Clinton, Tony Blair moved his left-wing party to the
center and in 1997 won a landslide victory, ending 18 years of
Conservative rule. In doing so, he secured the largest
parliamentary majority in nearly two centuries, and has pretty much
had his own way legislatively. But the bloom is coming off the
rose, which is the Labor Party's symbol.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, there was a series of embarrassing leaks of
memos in which Blair and top aides openly questioned whether they
were losing touch with the public. Andrew Marr, the BBC's political
editor, said the widespread public support for the fuel tax
protest, which was confirmed in a BBC poll, is the first emperical
evidence that Labor is out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the rebirth of the opposition,'' said Marr.
</P>
<P>
   That opposition, however, is hampered in its attempts to make
the fuel tax the key issue in the next general election, which
could come as early as next year and must be held by May 2002. The
Conservatives instituted the current fuel tax, which besides
raising revenue for the government is aimed at forcing people to
drive less and rely more on public transportation. While
Conservative leader William Hague has tried to use the fuel crisis
as a stick to beat Blair with, he refused to promise to cut the tax
if the Conservatives win the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Hague's deputy, Michael Portillo, predicted Labor will eventully
be done in by what he called a ``taxpayer revolt.''
</P>
<P>
   As the foot soldiers in that revolt, the truckers and farmers
and self-employed business people, pulled back from the barricades
Thursday, Blair and his braintrust were left to pick over the
debris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a kicking,'' admitted one Downing Street official,
speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``We've got to sit down and
look at all this and try to find the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   They have time. They won't be driving much the next few days.

POST-MORTEM AT LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE KAPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Senior members of the London Stock Exchange's board
managed to hang on to their jobs Thursday during a heated
shareholder meeting, but the exchange is back to Square One in its
goal of forming a pan-European market for trading stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the London Stock Exchange abandoned plans to
merge with the Deutsche Boerse in Frankfurt to form what would have
been Europe's first over-arching stock exchange. The plan for the
merged market, to be called iX, had been facing increased
opposition from both retail brokers and large institutions who were
uncertain how the regulations, technology, and clearing and
settlement systems of the two exchanges would meld. The situation
was further complicated by a hostile bid for the London exchange
from OM Gruppen, a Swedish technology group that runs the Stockholm
stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was right to explore iX, and it was right to abandon it,''
Don Cruickshank, the London exchange's chairman, said as he faced a
barrage of criticism, mainly from retail brokers who feared the
merger plan would hurt their livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   Cruickshank and Michael Marks, executive chairman of Merrill
Lynch, the London exchange's adviser on its plan to form iX, were
both re-elected during a show of hands at the tense meeting held in
the gilded ballroom of the Hotel Inter-Continental. Marks has been
under pressure ever since a report commissioned by Merrill Lynch
that was highly critical of the iX plan leaked last week.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive Gavin Casey was voted out during the show of
hands, but he was reinstated by a narrow margin during a secret
ballot later Thursday afternoon. (In a secret ballot, a
shareholder's vote is proportional to the the number of shares
held, whereas in a show of hands each shareholder has one vote.)
</P>
<P>
   Several retail brokers took the opportunity to express
disappointment with the leadership provided by the exchange's
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had iX gone to a vote, it would not have succeeded,'' said
Michael Spencer, chief executive of Garban Intercapital, who had
called for Cruickshank's removal in a piece published in The London
Times over the weekend. ``Doesn't that raise questions about the
competence of the board?''
</P>
<P>
   The board must now focus on how best to achieve a pan-European
exchange, and decide whether such a strategy is even viable.

PATRIOTS STRUGGLE TO REDUCE MISTAKES, INCREASE CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Everyone's looking for the silver lining, the
bright side, the ray of hope _ something that would make one
believe that the power of positive thinking can be applied to
Patriots football. Thursday talk of ``constant improvement''
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive lineman Henry Thomas gave it some thought, then mowed
the notion down like a patch of tall weeds beneath a John Deere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that improvement thing; that's a nice concept,'' he
said. ``But we want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words, or some variation thereof, became a refrain in the
Patriots locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to win,'' said defensive back Lawyer Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 0-2, and it ain't great,'' said wide receiver and
specialist Troy Brown, when asked about being off to a good start
personally. Twice afterward, when asked about his personal
achievements, he uttered the same answer.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team in need of a win. A convincing win. An ugly win.
A controversial win. Right now, the Patriots merely want to walk
off the field with more points than the adversary. Period.
</P>
<P>
   ``A win would get things going,'' said Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   But what do you do until then? How do you keep team morale up
between now and that first triumph of the season, particularly when
it's coming off two games it could have won and has a tough stretch
ahead (home against Minnesota on Sunday, then at Miami, at Denver,
and home against Indianapolis)?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it this way. My approach isn't, `Well, everything
is going to be fine. Don't worry about it,' '' said first-year
coach Bill Belichick. ``You know, we're 0-2, and we need to address
the things that made us 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really where my focus is _ to explain to the players
what we need to do to make a difference in a few close games.
That's what I tried to do. Whether it's a morale thing, a coaching
thing, a strategy thing, call it whatever you want to call it.
You're trying to get your team ready to play another opponent, a
good one.''
</P>
<P>
   And how. Minnesota (2-0), which will be playing its first road
game this weekend, is second in the NFC in total offense (265.5
yards per game) and is averaging 6.54 yards on first down, tops in
the conference. The Vikings beat Chicago, 30-27, in their opener,
and edged Miami, 13-7, last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are coming off a disheartening 20-19 Monday night
loss to AFC East rival New York, which was outplayed by New England
most of the game before rallying with two touchdowns in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Couple that with the 21-16 season-opening debacle against Tampa
Bay and you have a team that says it needs a win, one that has
given up 12 sacks in two games yet had chances to win both in the
closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frustrating loss (on Monday) but it's time to put that behind
us now and move on to Minnesota,'' said Brown. ``We had one in the
bag and let it get away, and we had a chance to win the Tampa game
going down the stretch. It didn't work out, but now we have to go
from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Belichick said talk of low morale is exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like it's gloom and doom; it is what it is,'' he
said. ``It's not like we've been beaten, 58-0, in the past two
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether victories beget positive thinking or vice versa, the
Patriots know they need to cut down on their mistakes in order to
enjoy either. Thomas admitted the team is making progress while
adjusting to the new staff.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, save the sack total, the Patriots have been
statistically similar to their opponents. For instance, while New
England has struggled running the ball (188 yards, 55 carries, 3.4
average), the opposition hasn't fared much better (199 yards, 55
carries, 3.6 average).
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting better, performing better, especially the
defense,'' Thomas said. ``We're playing together better, starting
to understand things better. We have a long way to go but we have
begun to minimize mistakes.''

 &HT;    The cast gets costumes, but Mickey's the star
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ What does the well-dressed mouse wear to
receive royalty?
</P>
<P>
   If he's Mickey Mouse shaking paws with the late King Hussein of
Jordan, he dons kaffiyeh and galabiyya, the headdress and flowing
white robes of a sheik. Custom-fitted to his truly one-of-a-kind
mouse physique.
</P>
<P>
   And what does the chipper rodent sport when he wants to go
incognito in the Magic Kingdom? The tourist's uniform of Hawaiian
shirt and comfy sneakers, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Call Mickey the mouse that hoards. His clothes closet holds more
than 500 different outfits, one for any possible Disney World
occasion _ business meeting, wedding, parade, party.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Mickey au courant are the 250 employees of the Creative
Costuming department, which designs and develops all aspects of
wardrobes for Walt Disney World Resort.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to almost 1,000 ensembles for Mickey and Minnie
alone, they stitch enough costumes to outfit an army 50,000 strong.
</P>
<P>
   They keep parking-lot attendants cool and comfortable, yet
neat-looking. They dress dancing girls in costumes with kick. They
even provide Audio-Animatronic presidents with suits that can be
donned without the robotic heads of state moving a single limb
(Velcro is key).
</P>
<P>
   But the star of the show, with the accompanying headliner's
wardrobe, is Mickey Mouse, whose costumes are cataloged in a fat
three-ring binder.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Wednesday morning, Mickey paid a visit to Creative
Costuming, which is headquartered behind a nondescript fence inside
the Disney-MGM Studios theme park.
</P>
<P>
   The Creative Costuming folks had hung a couple dozen of Mickey's
outfits in their conference room. Dressed in his standard costume
of red pants, white shirt and black tails, the Mouse looked over a
pair of lederhosen and modeled his Uncle Sam hat. New outfits are
designed for Mickey whenever a party, show or visiting dignitary
dictates a special ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   He then retired to a dressing room, with a human assistant, to
don his China costume. With matching hat, Mickey's China ensemble
is aswirl with color. A dragon breathes satin fire on the front,
and the lizard's vivid tail wraps around Mickey's back. The pants
and jackets are richly appliqued and decorated with Swarovski
crystals. Only the best for Disney's master of ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   When the Disney design team creates a costume with national
flavor, they try to keep it authentic, referring to a library of
reference and travel books. (Concessions have to be made for
Mickey's special shape and the fact that the outfits need regular
laundering.)
</P>
<P>
   On rare occasions, aesthetic concerns override safety. Creative
Costuming was asked to sew Mickey a scuba outfit so he could dive
in the Living Seas exhibit. They chose a cheery lemon hue. But when
the Living Seas team saw it, they said, ``Uh-oh, yum-yum yellow,''
so-called because the color makes sharks hungry. ``So Mickey
decided to feed the sharks before he got in the pool,'' said Pamela
Carver, costume design manager.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his mariachi, Beefeater and Boy Scout costumes,
Mickey has an outfit made of black satin and kente cloth, created
for his appearance at an African-American beauty pageant. The
pattern and colors of the cloth symbolize royalty, Carver said.
``People of a very high stature would wear this cloth, and Mickey's
as high as he could get here. He's tops.''
</P>
<P>
   Carver estimated that 90 percent of Mickey's costumes are period
attire (such as his Colonial America white knickers, red coat and
cream ascot), and in general, Mickey doesn't follow trends. You
won't see him wearing cargo pants and a guyabera shirt over a white
T. ``He's classic,'' she said. ``We don't want to keep changing''
his image.
</P>
<P>
   But they're happy to change his clothes, again and again and
again . .
</P>
<P>
   MOUSE OF A MILLION FACES
</P>
<P>
   An astronaut, for the opening of Space Mountain. He wore
bubble-shaped headgear, a spacesuit and silver gloves.
</P>
<P>
   _ A '50s sock hopper, for an Eisenhower-era-themed party. Yellow
pants, green letter sweater.
</P>
<P>
   _ An artist, for a visit to France in Epcot. White smock, red
beret, black trousers.
</P>
<P>
   _ George Washington, for a Fourth of July show. Three-cornered
hat, white wig, knickers.
</P>
<P>
   _ A doctor, for a convention of physicians. Lab coat,
stethoscope, medical bag.
</P>
<P>
   _ A ghost, a scarecrow, a sorcerer.
</P>
<P>
   _ A farmer, a football player, a mailman.
</P>
<P>
   _ A chef, a movie director, a pirate, a member of the press. . .
</P>
<P>
   HOW THEY BEAT THE FLORIDA HEAT
</P>
<P>
   In the South Florida version of summer, you can break a sweat
simply walking from house to car.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine spending the season of swelter in a Goofy suit.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping cast members cool is a priority for Disney costume
designers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``that's our No. 1 consideration,'' says Pamela Carver,
costume design manager. ``Except for the Audio-Animatronics. We can
make (their clothes) any way we want.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ways Disney helps its employees chill:
</P>
<P>
   _ Finding ways to let off steam.
</P>
<P>
   The designers look for ways to allow air-flow through costumes.
Most hats have holes poked in the tops so that hot air can escape,
and a new line of hats for Disney security guards has tops made of
mesh.
</P>
<P>
   _ Relying on the touch, the feel of cotton.
</P>
<P>
   The costuming department tries to make sure that only cotton
touches the bodies of cast members. To decrease the number of hours
spent ironing, they use polyester fibers wrapped in cotton. They've
also started using CoolMax, a DuPont fabric that pulls moisture
away from the body and helps speed its evaporation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bending the dress code.
</P>
<P>
   Every effort is made to shade those wearing long dresses, and to
give dancing-and-singing entertainers longer and more frequent
breaks than their stationary counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   In the heat of the summer, those who operate the Haunted
Mansion, for example, are allowed to remove their long jackets, and
others get permission to roll up their sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Faking it.
</P>
<P>
   Synthetic hairpieces keep dancers looking tidy and uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``You use a real-hair wig, and it does the same thing that real
hair does in Florida,'' Carver says. ``It flops.''
</P>
<P>
   The lone exception: The stationary fellas in the Hall of
Presidents are coiffed with human locks, for they never leave
air-conditioned comfort.
</P>
<P>
   DISNEY'S LAUNDRY ROOM: NO SMALL WORLD
</P>
<P>
   How huge is Disney's costume operation?
</P>
<P>
   Much bigger than a certain mouse's oversized ears.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mickey alone can choose from more than 500 different
ensembles, from Boy Scout to Beefeater. Minnie needs to hit the
mall to catch up with her male counterpart. Her closet is stocked
with more than 450 different outfits, including cheerleader skirts
and ballgowns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Walt Disney World Resort has to outfit close to 55,000
employees, making it the largest single-site employer in the United
States. Roughly 90 percent of those workers are in costume. To
simplify, costumers try to keep as many of them in the same black
pants while theming them very specifically from the waist up _ the
part of the body that guests see most often.
</P>
<P>
   _ An example of outfitting a single department: To make sure the
resort's 800-driver bus division is adequately covered, costuming
keeps on hand 6,400 pairs of pants and 6,400 shirts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Each day, Disney uses Ecolab products to clean an average of
240,000 pounds of clothes. If you were to wash and dry one load of
laundry every day for 44 years, you'd clean as much as the Disney
laundry department in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   _ You think you've got dry-cleaning bills? Between 30,000 and
32,000 Disney garments are dry-cleaned daily.
</P>
<P>
   ANIMAL KINGDOM
</P>
<P>
   `Vogue' and `Harper's Bazaar' are touting animal prints for
fall. At Disney's Animal Kingdom, they're always in style:
</P>
<P>
   _ The 2,500 cast members _ who man gift shops, serve snacks and
drinks, sing and dance in shows, and act as ``safari guides'' _
wear 62 different designs. In all, more than 61,000 items of
apparel are required.
</P>
<P>
   _ Twenty percent of the costumes are made with lyocell, a fiber
made from wood pulp harvested from trees grown specifically for the
production of fabrics. It has the absorbency of cotton and the
strength and versatility of a synthetic fiber.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cast members in Safari Village wear tunics in which the colors
are shaded gradually from a deep coral to pink, orange, yellow,
green, blue and purple. Each band of color contains a menagerie _
turtles, flamingos and fish on one blouse, crabs, frogs and
alligators on another, and beetles and lady bugs on a third.
</P>
<P>
   _ Employees who work the Kilimanjaro Safari wear safari and
game-warden attire in bronze and khaki with patch pockets and
national park-style emblems sewn on sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ``Festival of the Lion King'' stage show alone requires
136 costumes, inspired by authentic tribal attire. They include an
aerialist dressed like a chartreuse-and-yellow bird, trampolinists
in monkey costumes, and a storytelling tribal chief in an amber
headdress, leather tunic and lion-mane cape. Other members of the
tribe are dressed to portray a gazelle, a snake, a crocodile and a
sandy-colored leopard.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ``student paleontologists'' who dig at DinoLand U.S.A.
wear green, rust and blue jeans with lime green or yellow Henley
T-shirts and baseballs caps bearing the Dino Institute logo. Some
outfits are accessorized with tool belts and bandanas.
</P>
<P>
   _ For the high-energy ``Tarzan Rocks!'' show, in-line skating
performers are dressed to resemble members of the ape family. Their
costumes are made of painted spandex, which allows them to skate
through the theater with the greatest of ease. The only fur used in
Animal Kingdom attire is faux.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tribal costumes from the Ivory Coast to Nigeria to Kenya
inspired the Harambe costumes, which feature bright colors, beaded
trim and geometric designs. Both men and women wear tunic tops
bearing Swahili greetings and knee-length trousers with
drape-effects sewn into them. The outfits are topped off with
matching headscarves and turbans, beaded belts and leather panels.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Animal Kingdom Lodge will open next spring, and the
costume department recently held a fashion show to preview the
staff's uniforms, which were all based on designs indigenous to
Africa. Many of Disney's employees from foreign countries brought
examples of traditional costuming from their homelands, but they
had to be adapted to the Orlando sun. Turns out it's hotter in
Florida than in South Africa.

 &HT;    Boxing always had been good for Dion Craig
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ The dream supposedly went like this:
</P>
<P>
   Mary Craig was up in heaven. Her son, Dion, was down in
Cincinnati. They were talking by phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing Dion said he asked Mom was if she'd gotten her
wings yet,'' his brother, Dante Craig said. ``Mom told him no, that
getting your wings takes a while. He started to ask her something
else about them and that's when she told him, 'Stop! Now listen to
me. Get Dante back in boxing. Get your brother back in the ring.'''
</P>
<P>
   As he sat here on this Sydney afternoon wearing his red, white
and blue Olympic warm-up jacket, the Cincinnati welterweight retold
his brother's dream in almost reverential tones. Not that it was
always like that. When Dante first heard about the Pearly Gates'
plea, he didn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   After becoming a Junior Olympics champ in 1994 and then winning
the National Golden Gloves title the following year, he thought
he'd certainly make the 1996 Olympic team. Instead, he was beaten
in the Olympic Trials and the loss devastated him.
</P>
<P>
   He quit his sport and got a job pressing pants at Teasdale
Cleaners in Cincinnati. After a year, he was earning $8 an hour and
making a name for himself with the steam set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could press 70 pair of pants an hour,'' he said so proudly
that his grin soon revealed the golden caps he wears on two teeth.
``Nobody else could press 70 pair. I was the best they had.''
</P>
<P>
   While he worked for the cash, he also used his job as an escape
from all that had gone wrong. First, he'd left boxing, then he'd
lost his mother, who died of breast cancer in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Dion told me his dream, he begged me,'' Dante said. ``He
said, 'Oh man, give it one more shot.' I told him, 'No, I'm making
$400 a week. I'm not giving that up.' But the more he explained how
the dream went, the more I said, 'Dawg, you're right. That had to
be Mom talking. It sounded like her. It sounded so real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dion was working for TV Guide and he told me he'd give me $200
a week, if I quit my job and just trained. The dream felt real to
him. And pretty soon it felt real to me. too.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxing always had been good for him. Back when he was going to
Crest Hills Middle School in Cincinnati, schoolyard bullies began
forcing him to give up the weekly $10 his mom gave him for meal
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Daddy didn't want me to get picked on anymore, so he took
me to the Findlay Street Neighborhood House,'' Dante said of the
Over-the-Rhine fight club. ``I ended up doing pretty good and soon
I was winning tournaments. Back then, my mom was my biggest fan.
Maybe that's why when I dream of her now, I don't hear what she
says. I'm always too busy hugging her and kissing her like she's
still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   He figured since he doesn't listen, she had to talk to someone
else. That got the message across. The Woodward High School
graduate returned to the gym last year, won his second National
Golden Glove title and once again was invited to the Olympic
Trials.
</P>
<P>
   Everything seemed to be working out perfectly, until _ just
three weeks before the Trials _ he got a frantic phone call just
before he was to get into the ring at the 2000 U.S. Championships
in Colorado Springs. The call was from Evelyn DeLoach, the mother
of their 1-month-old son.
</P>
<P>
   She said Dante Jr. had been having some respiratory problems for
a couple of days and then all of a sudden, he'd just stopped
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She called 9-1-1 and then she revived him herself with CPR,''
Dante said. ``I rushed home...but by the time I got there, he was
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, I wanted nothing to do with boxing. But my Daddy
wouldn't hear of it thought. He said, 'C'mon you've earned that
spot. You've lost so much already, don't lose this too.'''
</P>
<P>
   After first getting a large tattoo on his right biceps _ one
that features the names of his mother and son with a rose and a
cross _ he went to the Trials that year and was beaten 15-5 by
Larry Mosely, the nation's top ranked boxer at 67 kilograms (147
pounds). The only way Dante, ranked eighth, still could make the
Olympic team was to turn the tables dramatically at the box-offs.
And that's just what he did, beating Mosely twice in three days.
</P>
<P>
   After that, there was one last hurdle. He had to qualify
internationally. After losing to an Argentine boxer in March, he
went to Tijuana the next month and overwhelmed Dominican boxer
Yovanny Lorenzo, 16-3.
</P>
<P>
   But as has been the case too often for him, triumph was followed
by tough times. It turned out he had torn ligaments and a chipped
bone in his right hand during those bouts in Mexico. He had
immediate surgery, wore a cast for eight weeks and wasn't cleared
to begin punching again until Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   That layoff _ along with the fact that he's only had six
international bouts _ have most people writing him off in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   While he should get by Egypt's Fadel Showban Showban in
Saturday's Olympic opener, his division features Oleg Saitov, the
Russian who won gold at the Atlanta Games and Dorel Simion, the
Romanian world champion at 139 pounds in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never mind that, I'm bringing out the dog here,'' said Dante,
who now points his right arm skyward and places his padded left
mitt across his tattoo just before the opening bell. ``For these
fights here, I'm bringing out everything I got. And sometimes that
surprises me. When I see myself fight on video or see pictures of
myself, it's like 'Dawg...You've got real anger in your eyes.' I
got so much built up in me, I scare myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's times when I get to the last rounds and I think I
don't have any energy. Then all of a sudden I feel something
pushing me on. It's energy out of nowhere. I figure it's got to be
my mom. And I figure she'll be in there with me at these Games.
She's the only reason I'm back, the reason I finally made it to the
Olympics. That says a lot about her.''
</P>
<P>
   It says that while she may not have gotten those wings, she's
still managed to get her son soaring higher than ever before.

 &HT;    ``Bait'' review: It's just not that good
 &HT;    By Richard O. Jones
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was going to begin this review of ``Bait'' by saying that
Jamie Foxx's cheap one-liners marred an otherwise fine paranoia
action thriller.
</P>
<P>
   But then, I started thinking about the paranoia action thriller
and realized that there wasn't much there to ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there's a good movie buried in there somewhere. But it would
take some serious re-thinking to smooth out the improbabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Foxx is small-time crook Alvin Sanders who gets busted for
stealing seafood. Prawns. It becomes a running joke that someone
will ridicule him for stealing shrimp when he really stole prawns.
Bigger than shrimp. That's the joke. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   He gets put in a cell with Robert Pastorelli, who stole
something even bigger _ $42 million in gold bullion _ but is in
jail for drunken driving. He ditched Bristol, (Doug Hutchison) his
maliciously evil partner, at the scene of the crime, hid the gold
and then got hammered. By the time the feds catch up with him for
the gold, he's had a heart attack and dropped dead.
</P>
<P>
   But not before he gives Alvin clues to the gold's whereabouts,
asking him to tell his wife. Alvin and the feds scour a
preposterous hiding place, thinking the gold is there because
Pastorelli's character was a heavy equipment operator. It's not
where they think it is, however, and the real hiding place, when it
is finally revealed, is even more preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   David Morse stars as U.S. Treasury investigator Clenteen, the
kind of hard-edged guy who takes his job so seriously that he rants
and scowls at any opportunity, especially when someone on the team
tries to make a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Morse is a fine actor, but this is a one-note performance, and
the drone gets to you after a while.
</P>
<P>
   Clenteen gets the bright idea to draw out Bristol by planting
hints that Alvin knows where the gold is. In order to keep track of
Alvin, they plant a combination global positioning device and
microphone in his jaw. The rest of the movie concerns the feds
trying to stay close enough to Alvin to nab
</P>
<P>
   Bristol but without giving themselves away. It would have made
more sense to let Alvin in on the deal. If a man is desperate
enough to steal seafood, surely he would be desperate enough to
actually work with the investigators if they paid him to - which
they do anyway. They let him ``find'' money so
</P>
<P>
   that he won't commit any crimes and get in trouble before they
can catch the
</P>
<P>
   bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few funny moments in ``Bait,'' and I enjoyed the
climactic scene at the race track even though the sequence was
lifted straight from ``The Screenwriter's Idea Book'' (how many
movies feature a bomb on a timer with big red numbers?).
</P>
<P>
   It might have been better if they paid more attention to the
story and characters and less on trying to make it funny. A movie
like ``Enemy of the State'' works much better by allowing the star
(Will Smith in that case) work his charm in the context of a
coherent script. It's a balancing act in any case. It just doesn't
work here. Fans of Jamie Foxx's television show may relish the
chance to see him in a
</P>
<P>
   big-budget, big-screen caper, but the rest of us might wait
until it plays on video or cable.

 &HT;    Tucker grad gets a tuneup
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ A day after settling into the Olympic Village, Tucker
High grad Dwight Phillips won the long jump at an informal meet
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, second at the Olympic trials, took just two jumps and
won with a best of 25 feet, 8 inches. ``I haven't competed much
since the trials, so it was a good little practice,'' Phillips
said.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the meet from the stands were Southwest DeKalb products
Terrence Trammell and Angelo Taylor, neither of whom elected to
compete. Taylor and Phillips are roommates here, and both stood out
in the crowd wearing their Atlanta Braves caps.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he's motivated to perform well at the Games after
Australian long jumper Jai Taurima referred to the American jumpers
as ``dark athletes'' and suggested they wouldn't fare well in the
cool Sydney conditions. In addition to his racial remarks, Taurima
dimissed Phillips, Melvin Lister and Savante Stringfellow as a
``bunch of dribblers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely motivates me more than ever,'' Phillips said.
``At the Games, it's going to add a couple inches, maybe a foot,
because of that comment. I hope it's 30 degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Taurima didn't show at Thursday's competition, and hasn't
approached the Americans since his remarks last month. ``I guess
he's dodging us,'' Phillips cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor had his own side issue to address, saying he'd be
disappointed if U.S. coaches don't have him run the 1,600-meter
relay final. The coaches have said they won't finalize the relay
teams until after the athletes finish competing in their individual
events, with Taylor being a gold medal favorite in the 400 hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   However, assistant coach Bubba Thornton, who handles the 1,600
relay, spoke of Taylor as something of a luxury: ``We know he's
sitting there if we need to go that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring injury, three relay spots appear set with open 400
runners Michael Johnson, Antonio Pettigrew and Alvin Harrison.
Taylor has beaten the other Americans when he's run the open 400
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I should be able to run the relay,'' said Taylor,
who earned a gold medal on the relay at last summer's World
Championships. ``I've beaten these guys in the 400. A lot of guys
can only run from behind. I've proven I can run out front, and
that's important because we're probably going to have the lead.''

   POMONA, Calif. _ Eleven days after he drew a line in the sand
about a debate schedule, Gov. George W. Bush on Thursday walked
across it and signed on to the plan demanded by Democratic foe Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the capitulation marked another strategy-gone-bad in a
campaign that has taken him from frontrunner to self-proclaimed
underdog. Bush has gotten little traction with a tax-cut plan that
is a campaign centerpiece, and, according to polls, now trails Gore
on all major issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, still blaming Gore for the debate impasse,
said it had gained a more free-flowing format by not agreeing to a
schedule set earlier by a bipartisan Commission on Presidential
Debates.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates agreed Thursday to square off Oct. 3 in Boston,
Oct. 11 in Winston-Salem, N.C. and Oct. 17 in St. Louis. Each
debate, sponsored by the Presidential Debates commission, will last
90 minutes in a format yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Vice presidential candidates Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman will
debate Oct. 5 in Danville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased that the campaigns have agreed to these
plans,'' the commission said after meeting with Gore and Bush
campaign officials in Washington. ``The American public can look
forward to four substantive discussions of the issues central to
this general election.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said a campaign
attorney had confirmed that a videotape anonymously mailed to the
Gore campaign was a tape of a Bush practice debate. Gore supporter
Tom Downey had turned the tape over to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said there was still no word on who sent the tape and
related materials to Downey. She said she had no way to know
whether Bush's debate effort would be compromised by the purloined
tape.
</P>
<P>
   If it does, then it would mark another setback in what has been
a troublesome three weeks for the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Recent state-by-state surveys, for the first time, indicate Gore
has solid leads in states with electoral votes approaching 270, the
number needed for victory.
</P>
<P>
   The polls show Gore leading in 15 states plus the District of
Columbia with a total 224 electoral votes. Bush led in 21 states
with 171 electoral votes. Another 14 states and 143 electoral votes
are toss ups.
</P>
<P>
   The debates that could go a long way to determining the race
have been a sticking point for several weeks, with each camp
blaming the other for the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the debate schedule intensified on Sept. 3, when
Bush was firm in opposing the commission's proposed schedule. He
said he would accept only a three-debate schedule including
appearances on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' and CNN's ``Larry King
Live'' and the St. Louis debate proposed by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our final answer,'' Bush campaign chairman Don Evans
said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, that answer turned out to be semi-final for Bush,
who is trailing in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is very eager to debate,'' Evans said after a
meeting in Washington with Gore Chairman William Daley and
commission officials.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the GOP nominee has gained a lot by initially
rejecting the commission debate schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we were arguing for all along is what we are now
succeeding with, which was a more unstructured, more free-flowing
format which we think serves the American public much better than
which candidate can best memorize a 30-second response,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kirk, a commission co-chairman and former Democratic
National Committee chairman, did not want to talk about who had won
or lost in the battle over the joint appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major thing is that the debate debate is over,'' said
Kirk.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had rejected Bush's proposed schedule, criticizing it as an
effort to reduce the audience by limiting two of the debates to
single-network coverage. Bush tried to shift the blame to Gore,
noting the Democrat had promised to debate ``anytime, anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   As late as Wednesday, Bush was still trying to blame Gore for
the debate imbroglio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to the debates, if the man will show up,'' Bush
told a rally in Westminster, Cal.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, before the agreement was announced, Bush, in a Los
Angeles television interview, was defending his earlier plan to
include two debates that probably would have been carried by a
single broadcast network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the thing,'' Bush said, ``if people want to watch the
debates there will be plenty of outlets for them to watch the
debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's efforts to blame Gore, a CBS/New York Times poll
completed this week showed the GOP nominee was losing the debate on
debates. Seventy percent of the respondents said they believed Gore
truly wants to debate. Only 59 percent said they believe Bush wants
debates.
</P>
<P>
   GOP strategist Scott Reed, campaign manager for Bob Dole's 1996
presidential bid, said Bush's position was untenable for a
candidate trailing in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to get the debate schedule set sooner rather than
later and begin to focus on the first debate,'' said Reed. ``It
appears to me that the race is frozen until the first debate and
that all this campaigning is just background noise.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush on Thursday, all this campaigning included pitching his
military message in a speech beamed to the National Guard
Association convention in New Jersey, and his education message in
an appearance at Santa Ana High School.
</P>
<P>
   The military speech included a shot at Gore, based on a New York
Times report concerning Documents being reviewed by the Justice
Department indicating Gore was asked to make a fund-raising phone
call in 1995 to a trial lawyer Walter Umphrey of Beaumont involved
in tobacco industry litigation. Umphrey and his firm later gave
$790,000 to the Democratic Party after President Clinton vetoed a
bill to limit liability lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore aide said the vice president never made the phone call.
But Bush pounced on the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll restore the bond of trust between a president and all
Americans,'' Bush said near the end of the speech. ``Just today
there are new revelations about the potential misuse of the White
House for fundraising purposes. New evidence that my opponent may
have crossed a serious line, solicitation of campaign contributions
linked to a presidential veto.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has tried to make character an issue, drew applause
when he said, ``The appearance is really disturbing. Americans are
tired of investigations and scandal and the best way to get rid of
them is to elect a new President who will bring a new
administration who will restore honor and dignity to the White
House.''

 &HT;    Was Hodges Mitchell the best player for the UT?
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question made Hodges Mitchell pause. He rubbed his head for
several moments, then wiped the sweat off his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have to ask that question to someone else,''
Mitchell said, obviously uncomfortable with the topic.
</P>
<P>
   The question?
</P>
<P>
   Was Hodges Mitchell, pound for pound, the best player for the
University of Texas?
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell deferred to a higher authority, anyone other than
himself. He really is one of those humble team guys.
</P>
<P>
   So I'll say what others should be saying. Mitchell, all 5 feet 6
1/2 inches and 181 pounds of him, is the best and most reliable
player the Longhorns have on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   He wins top player because of his versatility and his ability to
prove others wrong. He is the smallest Longhorn starter, yet he can
run, catch and block like he's 6-0 and 220, the size he wishes
genetics had assigned him. He even is returning punts this year,
knowing that some kamikaze special teams player, running at him
with a full head of steam, could ruin his season with a single
spear.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell didn't start his season last Saturday with
headline-making numbers. With the Longhorns choosing to hurry up on
offense against Louisiana-Lafayette, Mitchell carried only eight
times for 31 yards. But he returned five punts for an average of
8.6 yards and caught two passes for 30. Statistics don't show the
number of blocks he made to protect quarterbacks Major Applewhite
and Chris Simms.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Mitchell walked out of the locker room with a
broad smile on his face and a bounce in his step. He only had UT's
52-10 victory on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 thing with Hodges is if we win,'' said UT running
backs coach Bruce Chambers. ``That's all he cares about. If he ran
for a million yards, and we lose, he's not happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing about Hodges is he's so versatile. He can run
back punts and kicks. Heck, he can go out and play wide receiver,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers coached against Mitchell when the tailback was playing
for Skyline High School in Dallas and Chambers was at nearby
Carter. Chambers jokingly tells Mitchell that he hasn't forgiven
him for going to Skyline, a magnet school in the Dallas Independent
School District, rather than staying close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to coach Hodges Mitchell,'' Chambers said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell lived only a five-minute drive from powerhouse Carter,
yet it was Skyline that benefited from Mitchell's 5,005 career
rushing yards and 65 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   When Mitchell first arrived at Texas in 1997, he knew he was
there to be the chief backup to Ricky Williams. That was the season
Williams, the future Heisman Trophy winner, started playing
tailback after spending his first two years at UT as a fullback.
Early in 1997, then-Coach John Mackovic actually found himself
answering questions as to why he wouldn't move Williams back to
fullback to allow Mitchell to see more action at tailback.
</P>
<P>
   So it was Mitchell who had the misfortune of following Williams'
historic presence in the Longhorns' backfield last season. He
responded the best way possible, with an All-Big 12 Conference
year, rushing for 1,343 yards, the fifth-best single-season
performance in UT history.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing a lot of people don't know about Hodges is that he's
so strong,'' said UT defensive tackle Casey Hampton. ``He can run
over you. It's hard for one person to bring him down. He's so
short, he's got more leverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's like really quick and real shifty.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the off-season, it was a common topic in the media, on
radio talk shows and in internet chat rooms that the Longhorns'
running game was the offense's weak link. A running back who can
put up those kind of numbers shouldn't be subject to such
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard all that talk, too,'' Mitchell said earlier this week.
``I listened to it, but I didn't let it bother me. Everybody got
spoiled with Ricky Williams. They've got to adjust to a new running
back now.''
</P>
<P>
   The pros have noticed Mitchell as well, although NFL scouts are
well aware of Mitchell's less than intimidating physique. The
National Football Scouting Service, based out of Tulsa, Okla.,
graded Mitchell at 4.8 on an 8.0 scale after evaluating him in the
spring. His grade classifies him as a priority free agent for next
April's draft. It says Mitchell can improve on that score with a
nice senior season and move into the draft's mid-to-late rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The scouts like his speed and the fact that he can catch. His
skills at returning punts also will be scrutinized this fall, which
could move him out of the category of third-down back.
</P>
<P>
   If Mitchell is looking at the pros, he isn't saying. He is set
to earn his degree in business next summer. His grade point average
is 3.1 on a 4.0 scale, which is as impressive, given his course
load, as his accomplishments last season.
</P>
<P>
   But the one thing Mitchell has yet to handle is public praise.
It makes him squirm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not deserving of any hype,'' he says. ``I'm just trying to
be a team player. The team deserves the hype, not me. I do believe
in myself, I'm just not cocky.''

ADVERTISING: CASTING A NEW IMAGE FOR CUERVO TEQUILA 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD STAMLER  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a drink whose brand name has long evoked images of
salt-covered hands, limes and single shots, college parties and
some none-too-pleasant mornings after.
</P>
<P>
   But all that is about to change, if the people at Jose Cuervo
tequila have their way.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next week with a kick-off reception at the Playboy
mansion in Los Angeles, they are introducing a global campaign
called ``Vive Cuervo.'' The goal is to elevate tequila from a mere
``party catalyst'' to a medium of ``self-expression,'' said Carlos
Arana, the managing director of Jose Cuervo International Inc.,
based in New York, the marketing arm of Jose Cuervo of Mexico,
which owns the brand. United Distillers and Vintners North America
in Stamford, Conn., part of Diageo PLC, is the brand's U.S.
distributor.
</P>
<P>
   The brand has not been languishing by any means. Cuervo is the
most popular tequila in the world, with global sales of more than 5
million cases a year, and is also one of the best-selling liquors
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Adams Handbook Advance 2000, an industry
publication, Cuervo sold 3.2 million cases in the United States
last year, making it No. 5 in total sales in America after Bacardi
rum (7.2 million cases), Smirnoff vodka (6.3 million), Absolut
vodka (3.9 million) and Jack Daniel's Black (3.6 million cases).
Cuervo's sales put it far ahead of its closest tequila competitor,
Sauza, which sold about 700,000 cases.
</P>
<P>
   And Cuervo is growing, too. Despite a shortage of agave, the
plant from which tequila is made, sales last year increased 8.3
percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Still, according to Arana, that is not enough for Cuervo's
owners, who include the descendants of Jose Antonio de Cuervo, who
began distilling the spirit in the town of Tequila in 1795. While
supplies are tight, he says there is enough agave available to fuel
even more growth for Cuervo. And to change and widen its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be more than just a tequila brand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And just how do you do that?
</P>
<P>
   By going to a national _ and then global _ introduction,
according to Arana, who said that most Cuervo advertising was
previously done at a local level.
</P>
<P>
   And by being ``very simple and focused on bringing forward the
spirit and culture of Cuervo,'' said Peter Arnell, chairman and
chief creative officer for AG Worldwide, part of the Draft
Worldwide unit of Interpublic Group of Cos., the agency handling
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   AG Worldwide won the account earlier this year in a competition
that included Bartle Bogle Hegarty in London, which is 49 percent
owned by the B Com3 Group; J. Walter Thompson in New York, which is
part of the WPP Group; and Leo Burnett Co., Chicago, part of B Com3
. Its approach, which will be replicated abroad in ads that will
run over the next couple of years in other big tequila markets like
Greece, Brazil, Britain and Spain, is to be ``more sophisticated
and more contemporary,'' Arnell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making it less young,'' he added, ``and going after the
25 and older market. And we are upscaling it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads _ for which Arnell himself did the photography _ feature
short, snappy copy alongside pictures of stylish young men and
women in their 20s who, despite their model good looks, are
supposed to be ``normal, approachable real people,'' Arnell said. A
picture of Cuervo Especial _ known universally to consumers as
Cuervo Gold _ is also shown, together with the ``Vive Cuervo''
slogan. The core ads include one that carries the tag line ``All
work and no play is totally missing the point,'' uttered by a
casually dressed blonde woman with a wide, toothy grin; another,
featuring six apparently delirious men and women, declares ``Carpe
Cuervo!''
</P>
<P>
   Arnell concedes that the tequila category ``skews male.'' Still,
the placement of attractive women in the ads is meant not only to
draw men's eyes but also to help Cuervo widen its appeal. Where the
ads run also reflects the diversity of the audience that Cuervo
wants to reach.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, primarily in print for now, will begin running next
month not only in magazines like Playboy and Maxim but also in
Cosmopolitan, Entertainment Weekly and People. There are also ads
focused on the gay market, like one with three men, arms around
each other's shoulders, that declares ``We're here, we're Cuervo.''
That one will appear in Out magazine within a few months, Arnell
said.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes a lot of sense, said Michael Bellas, chairman
and chief executive of the Beverage Marketing Corp., a research
company based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is doing this,'' he said. ``In this economy,
everybody is trying to move themselves to a premium position, to a
sophisticated, co-ed social look.'' That is especially important in
the case of tequila, he said, because its price _ now generally $15
to $20 a bottle _ will probably be going up because of the agave
shortage, if it already hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, tequila now accounts for ``as much as 20 percent of the
sales gain'' in the liquor industry, he said. To continue that kind
of increase, the product has to be seen as more than it was in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, you want something that is sophisticated, approachable
and fun,'' Bellas said. ``If you've got it, then the future is
quite positive.''

   NET-SAVVY: United Parcel Service and Delta Air Lines are two of
corporate America's most Net-savvy businesses, according to the
latest edition of BusinessWeek magazine. In a special e.biz section
in its Sept. 18 edition, the magazine praises the two Atlanta-based
companies and 48 others among the ``nifty-fifty'' for having a
knack for using the Web to gain a competitive edge. UPS, through
its online logistics services, helps companies manage everything
from inventory control to tracking shipments. The company has
generated $1.4 billion in revenue and commands 55 percent of the
e-business-related shipping market. Delta, the nation's
third-largest carrier and the largest one operating at Hartsfield
International Airport, also gets a nod from the magazine for using
the Web to automate ticketing, offer wireless network links at its
gates and offer its employees free Internet access and subsidized
computers. BusinessWeek said all of the companies are using the Web
to ``set new standards for speed, efficiency and service.''

   BANKING ON THE NET: Bank of America will link 10 of its Atlanta
ATMs to the Internet this year as part of a plan to create
full-service banking centers. Eventually all of its 14,300 ATMs
across the country will be ``Web-enabled.'' Transactions on the
high-tech cash machines should be faster, officials say. That's the
only immediate difference customers should expect. The machines
won't have access to e-mail accounts, for example. But in the
future, customers may be able to view images of checks, send
messages to the bank, monitor investments and buy goods and
services. Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. debuted its Internet ATMs in May.

 &HT;    Rollins to appeal Ala. verdict
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta-based Rollins Inc. said that a recent $80.8
million verdict in Alabama against its Orkin Exterminating unit
will have ''a material adverse impact'' on the company if the award
is not reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins will appeal the award, said the company's filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, dated Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a jury in Macon County, Ala., found that Orkin
breached a longtime termite contract with Artie Mae Jeter of
Tuskegee and committed fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter and her lawyers had alleged that Orkin hid extensive
termite damage to her home for at least 15 years. Orkin employees
propped the house up on cinder blocks and jacks to conceal the
damage, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded Jeter's family $800,000 in compensatory damages
and $80 million in punitive damages. Jeter died in December at age
88.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the company's position that it complied with its
contractual obligations and that it did not attempt to conceal
alleged misconduct or suppress material facts,'' Rollins said in
the SEC filing. Orkin spokeswoman Martha May said Thursday that the
Rollins filing was voluntary, designed ''to inform shareholders
that this event has occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   If the award is upheld, May said, ''it would affect the
profitability of the company, which would affect the stock.'' But
Orkin believes the award will be reduced upon appeal, she said.
``Historically, Alabama juries will award enormous verdicts against
companies,'' May said. ``Almost every single one of them has been
reduced substantially.''
</P>
<P>
   Orkin is also the defendant in a class-action lawsuit in Alabama
that alleges the company skipped annual termite reinspections and
forged customers' names on inspection tickets. A similar suit seeks
class-action status in Florida, with homeowners claiming thousands
of dollars each in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Orkin denies the charges in each case.
</P>
<P>
   The pest-control industry, meanwhile, is drawing increased
scrutiny from government officials in several states. Questionable
termite practices have sparked a multistate investigation of the
industry, in conjunction with a Federal Trade Commission inquiry.
And according to Florida Assistant Attorney General Bob Buchner,
Florida and five other states are investigating Orkin. Georgia is
not among them.
</P>
<P>
   The Jeter lawsuit, filed in 1999, grew out of the Alabama class
action after a memo from an Orkin branch manager surfaced,
describing Jeter's termite damage. That 1988 memo, said Jeter
co-counsel Jock Smith, was ''by far, the most compelling evidence
in the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   In the memo, Branch Manager Bill Maxwell wrote to Orkin District
Manager Jim Turner that Jeter ''feels people have taken advantage
of her over the years, and she is tired of being ripped off. My
personal observation of work done to her home indicates this is a
true statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell, a co-defendant, added, ``To my knowledge, no one has
really told her the true extent to which her house is infested. We
sold her a termite treatment in Sept. 1977 and a moisture and jack
job in Dec. 1984. Nothing has ever been graphed or documented as to
termite damage in her house. We took her money and never really
told her the truth about the serious termite problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo discussed Orkin's treatment choices, with Maxwell
saying it would be cheaper and faster to build Jeter a new house
than repair her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can spend $5,000 now and have her put in small claims over
the years until she dies and her children sell the house, or if any
attorney gets involved, we will probably buy her a new house,
thousands in punitive damages and attorney fees,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Maxwell nor Turner is still with Orkin, May said
Thursday. The memo, she said, was intended to urge an Orkin vice
president to pay termite claims.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins, in its SEC filing, said the company made $23,000 in
repairs to Jeter's home.
</P>
<P>
   May said the house had termite damage prior to Jeter's first
contract with Orkin, in 1977. The jacks and cinder blocks, she
added, addressed structural problems in the house, not the termite
damage.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeter co-counsel Steve Etheredge of Dothan said that ''from
1977 up until 1998, in each of the annual reinspections of this
property, Orkin indicated to her no evidence had been found of
subterranean termites.'' Orkin did the repairs to ''conceal the
fact the house was totally destroyed,'' Etheredge added.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter's son Robert, also of Tuskegee, said Thursday, ``I wish my
mother had lived to see the outcome of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury sent a message to Orkin to get their act together,''
Jeter said. ``You don't ruin people's homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, internal memos written by Orkin executives in
Florida, Georgia and Texas showed that company employees falsified
reinspections of homes for termite damage. The memos, written in
April 1996 after an internal company audit, said many Orkin
customers are ''being charged for services not rendered.''
</P>
<P>
   The memos, which surfaced in connection with the Florida
lawsuit, told Orkin branch managers to stop practices of ''fraud,
theft and forgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Orkin acknowledges a problem with reinspections and forgeries in
Georgia and Florida, though it says it was not an extensive
practice. Orkin has cleaned up the reinspection problems, company
spokeswoman May said.
</P>
<P>
   Orkin is the No. 2 pest-control company in revenues behind
Terminix. Rollins, which reported 1999 revenue of $586.6 million,
has its headquarters on Piedmont Road in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins shares rose 13 cents to close at $15 Thursday in New
York Stock Exchange trading.

MANY CHILDREN IN TURKEY DON'T GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO SCHOOL

<TEXT>
<P>
   YENIDOGAN, Turkey _ Murat Kilic summoned forth all the bravado a
14-year-old could muster, shook his head back and forth vigorously
and said he never liked school anyway and he was proud to be
working to help support his family.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as he watched his friends clowning around nearby, his
facade collapsed in a deep shrug of his frail shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard and dirty work,'' he said, displaying the scars and
calluses on his hands from toiling in a metal-fabrication shop 10
hours a day for $200 a month. ``I'm there _ and they are learning
something in school.''
</P>
<P>
   About 14 million children started the new school year across
Turkey this week, donning uniforms and filling overcrowded
classrooms. But a million other children were not there. Instead,
most were working in factories, fields, shops and the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Like Murat, many of these children dropped out of school at the
end of the fifth grade before the government raised compulsory
attendance to eighth grade two years ago. Thousands of other
children never start school.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the reasons are the same as in other developing
countries. Many children are needed to earn money for their
families, or they stay at home and take care of siblings while
their parents work. Others come from families that do not value
formal education.
</P>
<P>
   But other factors have shut the school door for large segments
of the Turkish population. A new report by the World Bank said most
of the country's 30,000 villages do not have a school that goes
beyond fifth grade. To continue their education, students must
commute by bus to another town or go to a boarding school. Both
options are often too expensive for poor families.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis also found that girls, particularly those from poor
rural families, are twice as likely as boys to drop out before
finishing eighth grade. Nearly half the women are illiterate in
southeastern Turkey, the poorest region, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in richer urban areas like Istanbul or Ankara, poor people
who want to send their children to school face difficulties. The
uniforms that are mandatory at most public schools cost $75 or $80,
and families must pay at least as much for textbooks and other
basic supplies because schools do not get enough money from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   On top of those costs, parents who want their children to attend
good public schools are often required to pay $200 to $300 a year
under the table for each child for additional expenses that are not
covered by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The schools themselves are overcrowded and teachers are
underpaid. The average class size is 64 pupils, and Turkey's
525,000 teachers earn an average of about $300 a month, according
to statistics from the education workers union. That is barely
above the country's per capita income of $3,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey needs 190,000 more teachers and 106,000 more classrooms
and only then can we have 30 kids to a class,'' said Alaattin
Dincer, president of the education union.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of increasing, the percentage of government budgets
spent for education has declined steadily in the last decade to a
level below the standard of countries with comparable income, the
World Bank analysis said.
</P>
<P>
   The national government, which provides the money for education,
has been increasing military defense spending instead, although the
Ministry of Education said that 152,000 new teachers had been hired
in the last four years in an attempt to reduce overcrowding and
that there were plans to hire more next year.
</P>
<P>
   While Germany spends $817 per student annually and Greece $240,
Turkey spends only $90.
</P>
<P>
   No one understands those statistics more clearly than Mehmet
Kapuca, the principal of the elementary school in this poor
village.
</P>
<P>
   When the doors of Huseyin Tolgacan Sipahi Elementary School
opened this week, he was confronted by 1,876 pupils in eight
grades. They are deployed in double shifts, with half starting at
7:30 a.m.and the others at 12:50 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   And the crowded classrooms defy most prescriptions for good
learning. The older pupils are jammed 80 to a classroom, with a
single teacher. Even in the smallest classroom, for 50 first
graders, three children share each desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very hard job to teach here and to go to school here,''
Kapuca said as he rifled through drawings for a badly needed new
school, something that was promised years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Yenidogan's 5,000 or so residents fled rural areas for
this extended suburb about 20 miles southeast of Istanbul. They
live in half-finished houses and struggle to find the money to send
their children to school.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to a stack of textbooks in his office, Kapuca said
donations had provided some books for the poorest children, and
collections are taken up for their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Murat Kilic would have been wearing the tie and blazer of an
eighth grader at Huseyin Tolgacan Sipahi had he not left to help
support three brothers and sisters. Instead of rising before dawn
to accompany his father to the metal shop where they work side by
side, he would have been sitting alongside his friends, snickering
at slides of the human body or struggling to understand a math
problem.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had never liked school and does not miss it, but he
pretended to be sick Monday and Tuesday to skip work and hang out
with his friends after they finished classes. And when they put
their bags on the dirty field to play, he admonished them to be
more careful with the books inside.

   POWER-DEREG _ In the summer of 1997, Wisconsin got an early
taste of the electricity shortages that now threaten several other
regions of the country. An unusually large number of nuclear plants
that supply the northern Midwest were closed for maintenance just
as an unexpected heat wave drifted into the area. Milwaukee's
Wisconsin Electric shut off electricity to 80 businesses; every few

Electric averted blackouts, but the scare profoundly changed the

 &HT;    TURRIALBA, Costa Rica _ Few Costa Ricans can name the teams
likely to face off in the World Series, yet the country sits front
and center in this season's baseball headlines. And it's not due to
a surge in local talent, that's for sure.
 &HT;    The question is whether it's all in the balls.
 &HT;    For the past 10 years, the town of Turrialba, tucked in a lush
valley 40 miles east of the country's capital, San Jose, has served
as the Costa Rican home to Rawlings Sporting Goods, the U.S. firm
with a coveted sports distinction: its the exclusive provider of
major league baseballs. Now its become the setting for the Great
Baseball Conspiracy.
 &HT;    Eyebrows rose as batters started slugging Rawlings baseballs out
of major league stadiums at a record pace this season. Everyone
from sportswriters to baseball fans to the players themselves began
weaving theories about whether the league was ``juicing'' the balls
to draw fans to the nation's ballparks.
 &HT;    At the factory in Costa Rica, workers and supervisors alike
insist there's been no change in the way baseballs are made _ at
least, not since the switch from horsehide to cowhide in 1974.
 &HT;    ``The last half of the '90s has been very home-run friendly,''
concedes Steve Hirdt, executive vice president of Elias Sports
Bureau Inc., the official statistician for major league baseball.
``Last year, there were 2.28 home runs hit in every Major League
game, the highest ever. This year so far, it's 2.63, 15 percent
over last year's record,'' Hirdt said about halfway through the
season.
 &HT;    Still, Hirdt and other industry experts insist that it's not the
balls. They cite a combination of other factors, including stronger
players, smaller ballparks, aerodynamically designed bats, diluted
pitching talent and a smaller strike zone.
 &HT;    Tell that to the fans. They expect Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa
to slam away at the plate, but this season's stream of unknowns
morphing into overnight heroes has kept the buzz high. At one
point, sports forecasters were predicting the season would top last
year's by nearly 800 home runs. The fans became so convinced that
the balls were bogus that major league executives booked a one-day
trip to Costa Rica at the end of May.
 &HT;    The seven-member delegation included Sandy Alderson, major
league baseball's executive vice president of baseball operations;
Steve Rogers, special assistant to the players association; and Ted
Sizemore, a senior vice president at Rawlings. A day after the
official visit, the notoriously secretive officials at Rawlings
headquarters in Missouri finally caved into pressure and opened the
Costa Rica plant to journalists interested in their own tour of the
50,000-square-foot factory.
 &HT;    ``People have been talking about the balls having a slick
feeling this year,'' acknowledges Rawlings Vice President Doug
Kralik, the factory's general manager for the past 11 years. ``But
if you feel this,'' he says of the whitened cowhide that gets cut
into a figure-eight shape with something akin to a giant cookie
cutter, ``you'll see that this is a natural tanned leather.
Nothing's been added to the surface.''
 &HT;    One cowhide yields eight dozen balls, Kralik says. There are
variations in the stretch, texture and firmness of leather within
the same piece of cowhide, so Rawlings saves the very best for the
majors. In the end, what separates the 75,000 dozen balls Costa
Rica sends to the pros each year from those sold commercially is
esthetics, Kralik says.
 &HT;    Kralik's wife, Diane, who serves as quality-control manager,
conducts 17 different quality audits on the balls each week. She
contends that 97.5 percent of all balls manufactured meet tight
requirements: they are 9.25 inches in circumference and weigh
between five and five and a quarter ounces.
 &HT;    Every baseball starts with a cushioned cork sphere covered with
two layers of rubber known as the ``pill,'' which is then wrapped
in three layers of woolen yarn and a fourth layer of cotton yarn.
Whether on purpose or accidentally, a ``juiced'' or ``lively'' ball
is one with a more resistant inner core or a ball where the yarn
between the core and the leather surface has a tighter weave. After
his two-and-a-half-hour tour, major league baseball's Alderson was
convinced the balls were not causing the home-run epidemic.
 &HT;    ``Baseball is a sport where people keep a lot of stats,''
Rawlings President Howard Keene notes. ``Any time the numbers
change a little, people ask why. It's happened before and it will
happen again, but the baseball is probably the most consistent
thing in the game.''
 &HT;    Rawlings also made quick work of the rumor that its balls are
machine made. In an assembly area the size of two large gymnasiums,
some 500 Costa Ricans bob to their Walkmans while racing against
the clock. The average Turrialba worker sews about 150 balls a
week. But a sewer with dexterous fingers _ one who has mastered the
v-stitch _ can spin out more than 250. A couple of balls from each
day's batch are funneled into a Jugs pitching machine and fired at
a piece of ashwood to see if they bounce back at the required 57
miles per hour.
 &HT;    While there was talk of experimenting with the height of the
pitcher's mound in the short-season Class A leagues, no one wants
to run out and change the game, Alderson says. Besides, except for
baseball ``purists,'' those in the industry aren't convinced more
home runs are a bad thing. And fans like the excitement.
 &HT;    ``In baseball history, there have been several times where the
game has changed similarly,'' Hirdt says. ``In the early part of
the 20th century, all the scores were very low, 2-1, 3-1. When Babe
Ruth came along, he hit a lot of home runs and popularized a new
way to play the game. From then on, there was less bunting and
running and more power hitting.''
 &HT;    Rawlings isn't complaining. The company expects to grow by 10
percent this year, according to Keene. He says the pro baseballs
manufactured in Costa Rica account for 20 percent of the company's
total production and net $10 million to $12 million a year along
with souvenir-related products. Of this, roughly $300,000 per month
stays in Costa Rica.
 &HT;    Including the NCAA, minor and Little League baseballs made in
China, Rawlings generated $165 million in sales last year, Keene
adds. Still, the conspiracy theories haven't been put completely to
rest _ yet. The final word on baseballs will come from an
independent study being carried out at the University of
Massachusetts in Lowell at the request of major league baseball
Commissioner Bud Selig, whose stamped signature guarantees every
ball. In a facility dubbed the ``Bat Lab'' following a major league
baseball-funded study two years ago, researchers Jim Sherwood and
Larry Fallon search for the truth.
 &HT;    But there are doubts whether they will find anything _ that is,
unless the Costa Ricans are spiking the balls with some
high-potency coffee beans.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    TURRIALBA, Costa Rica _ Pocos costarricenses conocen los nombres
de los equipos que probablemente se midan en la Serie Mundial de
las Grandes Ligas, pero el pais esta en el candelero de esta
temporada.
 &HT;    La pregunta es si todo se debe a las pelotas. Turrialba, un
pueblo ubicado en un valle de exuberante vegetacion 64 kilometros
al este de la capital, San Jose, es desde hace diez anos la sede de
Rawlings Sporting Goods, firma norteamericana con una codiciada
distincion deportiva: el suministrador exclusivo de pelotas de las
Grandes Ligas. Y ahora es la sede de la Gran Conspiracion
Beisbolera.
 &HT;    Ha cundido el asombro ante el record de jonrones con pelotas
Rawlings en los estadios de las Grandes Ligas esta temporada.
Todos, desde redactores deportivos y fanaticos del beisbol, hasta
los propios jugadores, han hilvanado teorias sobre si se habian
modificado las bolas para que rebotaran mas, con el fin de atraer
mas espectadores a los estadios.
 &HT;    En la fabrica de Costa Rica, tanto los obreros como los
supervisores afirman que no se ha cambiado nada, por lo menos desde
que en 1974 se abandono el uso de cuero de caballo y se comenzo a
usar el cuero de vaca.
 &HT;    ``En la ultima mitad de la decada de 1990 se ha bateado una
cantidad enorme de jonrones,'' reconoce Steve Hirdt, vicepresidente
ejecutivo de Elias Sports Bureau Inc., la firma de estadisticas
oficiales de las Grandes Ligas. ``El ano pasado se batearon 2,28
jonrones en cada juego de las Grandes Ligas, un record. En lo que
va de ano, el promedio es de 2,63, 15 por ciento por encima del ano
pasado,'' dijo Hirdt, casi a mitad de la temporada.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, Hirdt y otros expertos reiteran que no se trata de
las pelotas. Mencionan una combinacion de otros factores, como
jugadores mas fuertes, estadios mas pequenos, bates de diseno
aerodinamico, menos lanzadores de gran talento y una zona de strike
mas pequena.
 &HT;    Los fanaticos esperan que Mark McGwire y Sammy Sosa bateen una
profusion de cuadrangulares, pero la avalancha de desconocidos que
esta temporada se han convertido en heroes de la noche a la manana
da lugar a muchos rumores. En cierto momento, los expertos
pronosticaron que en esta temporada se batearian 800 jonrones mas
que en la pasada. Los fanaticos estaban tan convencidos de que las
bolas eran las culpables que varios ejecutivos de Grandes Ligas
viajaron a Costa Rica a fines de mayo.
 &HT;    En la delegacion de siete integrantes iban Sandy Alderson,
vicepresidente ejecutivo de operaciones beisboleras de las Grandes
Ligas; Steve Rogers, asistente especial de la asociacion de
jugadores, y Ted Sizemore, vicepresidente de Rawlings. Un dia
despues de la visita oficial, ejecutivos de la sede de Rawlings en
Missouri finalmente cedieron a la presion y abrieron las puertas de
la fabrica a los periodistas interesados en recorrer la instalacion
de 4.600 metros cuadrados.
 &HT;    ``La gente dice que este ano las pelotas se sienten mas
rapidas,'' reconoce Doug Kralik, vicepresidente de Rawlings y
gerente general de la fabrica desde hace 11 anos. ``Pero si toca
esto,'' dice mientras palpa el cuero de vaca blanqueado que se
corta en forma de ocho con una maquina, ``vera que es cuero curtido
natural. No se le ha agregado nada a la superficie.''
 &HT;    Una piel de vaca es suficiente para casi 100 pelotas, explica
Kralik. Hay variaciones en la elasticidad, textura y firmeza del
cuero en la misma pieza, de modo que Rawlings separa las mejores
para las Grandes Ligas. Al final, lo que distingue a las 75.000
docenas de pelotas que Costa Rica envia a los profesionales cada
ano de las que se venden comercialmente es la estetica, dice
Kralik.
 &HT;    La esposa de Kralik, Diane, que es gerente de control de
calidad, realiza 17 pruebas de calidad todas las semanas. Diane
sostiene que el 97,5 por ciento de las pelotas cumplen requisitos
estrictos: tienen 23,5 centimetros de circunferencia y pesan entre
141,7 gramos y 148,8 gramos.
 &HT;    Para fabricar una pelota de beisbol se comienza con una esfera
de corcho cubierta con dos capas de goma, que luego se envuelve en
tres capas de hilo de lana y una cuarta capa de hilo de algodon. Ya
sea a proposito o por accidente, una bola ``viva'' tiene un nucleo
mas resistente o las capas de hilo entre el nucleo y la superficie
de cuero tienen un tejido mas apretado. Despues de su recorrido de
dos horas y media, Alderson, de las Grandes Ligas, quedo convencido
de que las pelotas eran la causa de la epidemia de jonrones.
 &HT;    ``El beisbol es un deporte que genera muchas estadisticas,''
senala Howard Keene, presidente de Rawlings. ``Cuando las cifras
cambian un poco, la gente pregunta por que. Ha sucedido antes y
volvera a suceder, pero la bola probablemente sea la mayor
constante del juego.''
 &HT;    Rawlings tambien salio rapidamente al paso del rumor de que sus
pelotas se hacen a maquina. En un area de ensamblaje del tamano de
dos gimnasios grandes, unos 500 costarricenses escuchan la musica
de sus Walkman mientras trabajan contra reloj. El obrero promedio
de Turrialba cose unas 150 pelotas a la semana. Pero un operario
habil, que ha dominado la costura en forma de V, puede producir mas
de 250. A manera de prueba, se colocan un par de pelotas del lote
diario en una maquina que las lanza contra un madero de majagua
para verificar que reboten a la velocidad requerida de 92
kilometros por hora.
 &HT;    Aunque se hablo de experimentar con la altura del monticulo en
las ligas de Clase A, nadie quiere cambiar el juego, dice Alderson.
Ademas, excepto por los ``puristas,'' la gente del beisbol no esta
convencida de que batear mas jonrones sea malo. Y a los fanaticos
les gusta la emocion.
 &HT;    ``En la historia del beisbol, varias veces el juego ha cambiado
de manera similar,'' dice Hirdt. ``A principios del siglo XX, las
anotaciones eran muy bajas: 2-1, 3-1. Cuando llego Babe Ruth, bateo
una gran cantidad de jonrones y popularizo una nueva forma de
practicar el deporte. En lo adelante, hubo menos toques de bola y
robo de bases y mas bateo fuerte.''
 &HT;    Rawlings no se queja. La compania espera crecer el 10 por ciento
este ano, segun Keene. Dice que las pelotas profesionales
fabricadas en Costa Rica representan el 20 por ciento de la
produccion total de la compania y recaudan de US$10 a US$12
millones al ano junto con souvenirs. De esta cifra, aproximadamente
US$300.000 al mes se quedan en Costa Rica.
 &HT;    Incluidas las pelotas hechas en China para la NCAA, las Ligas
Menores y las Ligas Pequenas, Rawlings genero US$165 millones en
ventas el ano pasado, agrega Keene.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, las teorias de conspiraciones aun no han cesado. La
ultima palabra sobre las pelotas la tendra un estudio independiente
que se realiza en la Universidad de Massachusetts en Lowell, a
pedido del comisionado de las Grandes Ligas, Bud Selig, cuya firma
estampada garantiza cada pelota. En una instalacion apodada el
``Bat Lab,'' siguiendo un estudio costeado por las Grandes Ligas
hace dos anos, los investigadores Jim Sherwood y Larry Fallon
buscan la verdad.
 &HT;    Pero se duda que encuentren algo.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    TURRIALBA, Costa Rica _ Pocos costarricenses conocen los nombres
de los equipos que probablemente se midan en la Serie Mundial de
las Grandes Ligas, pero el pais esta en el candelero de esta
temporada.
 &HT;    La pregunta es si todo se debe a las pelotas. Turrialba, un
pueblo ubicado en un valle de exuberante vegetacion 64 kilometros
al este de la capital, San Jose, es desde hace diez anos la sede de
Rawlings Sporting Goods, firma norteamericana con una codiciada
distincion deportiva: el suministrador exclusivo de pelotas de las
Grandes Ligas. Y ahora es la sede de la Gran Conspiracion
Beisbolera.
 &HT;    Ha cundido el asombro ante el record de jonrones con pelotas
Rawlings en los estadios de las Grandes Ligas esta temporada.
Todos, desde redactores deportivos y fanaticos del beisbol, hasta
los propios jugadores, han hilvanado teorias sobre si se habian
modificado las bolas para que rebotaran mas, con el fin de atraer
mas espectadores a los estadios.
 &HT;    En la fabrica de Costa Rica, tanto los obreros como los
supervisores afirman que no se ha cambiado nada, por lo menos desde
que en 1974 se abandono el uso de cuero de caballo y se comenzo a
usar el cuero de vaca.
 &HT;    ``En la ultima mitad de la decada de 1990 se ha bateado una
cantidad enorme de jonrones,'' reconoce Steve Hirdt, vicepresidente
ejecutivo de Elias Sports Bureau Inc., la firma de estadisticas
oficiales de las Grandes Ligas. ``El ano pasado se batearon 2,28
jonrones en cada juego de las Grandes Ligas, un record. En lo que
va de ano, el promedio es de 2,63, 15 por ciento por encima del ano
pasado,'' dijo Hirdt, casi a mitad de la temporada.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, Hirdt y otros expertos reiteran que no se trata de
las pelotas. Mencionan una combinacion de otros factores, como
jugadores mas fuertes, estadios mas pequenos, bates de diseno
aerodinamico, menos lanzadores de gran talento y una zona de strike
mas pequena.
 &HT;    Los fanaticos esperan que Mark McGwire y Sammy Sosa bateen una
profusion de cuadrangulares, pero la avalancha de desconocidos que
esta temporada se han convertido en heroes de la noche a la manana
da lugar a muchos rumores. En cierto momento, los expertos
pronosticaron que en esta temporada se batearian 800 jonrones mas
que en la pasada. Los fanaticos estaban tan convencidos de que las
bolas eran las culpables que varios ejecutivos de Grandes Ligas
viajaron a Costa Rica a fines de mayo.
 &HT;    En la delegacion de siete integrantes iban Sandy Alderson,
vicepresidente ejecutivo de operaciones beisboleras de las Grandes
Ligas; Steve Rogers, asistente especial de la asociacion de
jugadores, y Ted Sizemore, vicepresidente de Rawlings. Un dia
despues de la visita oficial, ejecutivos de la sede de Rawlings en
Missouri finalmente cedieron a la presion y abrieron las puertas de
la fabrica a los periodistas interesados en recorrer la instalacion
de 4.600 metros cuadrados.
 &HT;    ``La gente dice que este ano las pelotas se sienten mas
rapidas,'' reconoce Doug Kralik, vicepresidente de Rawlings y
gerente general de la fabrica desde hace 11 anos. ``Pero si toca
esto,'' dice mientras palpa el cuero de vaca blanqueado que se
corta en forma de ocho con una maquina, ``vera que es cuero curtido
natural. No se le ha agregado nada a la superficie.''
 &HT;    Una piel de vaca es suficiente para casi 100 pelotas, explica
Kralik. Hay variaciones en la elasticidad, textura y firmeza del
cuero en la misma pieza, de modo que Rawlings separa las mejores
para las Grandes Ligas. Al final, lo que distingue a las 75.000

POLL SHOWS DEATH PENALTY SUPPORT WANING IN US

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A poll released Thursday shows that a flurry of
recent reports of innocent inmates being freed from death row has
left a deep impression with the public and cut into support for
capital punishment in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, a joint effort by Republican and Democratic polling
firms, showed that overall support for the death penalty has
slipped to 60 percent, and 64 percent of Americans would support a
moratorium on capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Before the cases began to capture headlines, about 80 percent of
Americans endorsed capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, conducted by Peter D. Hart Research
Associates, a Democratic firm, and American Viewpoint, a Republican
company, voters are increasingly worried that the judicial system
might make a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what worries them most about the death penalty, 69 percent
said they feared that an innocent person might be executed, and 24
percent worried about a guilty person avoiding execution.
</P>
<P>
   Nine out of 10 voters thought death row inmates should be given
the opportunity to have DNA testing done. More than 80 percent of
those polled wanted defendants in capital cases to have
experienced, capable lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 802 registered voters was conducted in late August
and was commissioned by the Justice Project, a nonprofit group that
specializes in death row issues.

 &HT;    Conference to to focus on strong families
 &HT;    By Mary Lolli
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Ohio _ Country music star Barbara Mandrell is helping
Butler County commissioners launch what they hope will be an annual
conference focused on building strong families and keeping children
safe in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the ``Safe Kids, Strong Families Conference,'' Mandrell
will be keynote speaker for the forum's kickoff event Monday at
Lakota East High School.
</P>
<P>
   Mandrell, twice-named Mother of the Year, will talk about
family, parenting and her life experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Mandrell in the kickoff event will be Ohio First Lady
Hope Taft and musician Todd Snyder. The conference coincides with
Ohio's Parents Week observation, designated by Gov. Bob Taft.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the conference will be held at the Harry T.
Wilks Conference Center and Parrish Auditorium at Miami
University's Hamilton campus.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, to run through Sept. 21, is designed to create a
forum to engage community groups as agents in building strong
families and to promote safety for children, according to
conference coordinator Katie Weber.
</P>
<P>
   Among those expected to participate are people involved with
family and social service organizations and law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something commissioners had been thinking about doing
for a while,'' Weber said. ``And with all the problems that cropped
up recently with (Butler County) Children Services issues and the
duplication of efforts among different county agencies, the time
was right to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber said the conference is a vehicle for initiating
discussions between families and the professional agencies that
serve them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The professionals need to hear what the families have to say,
and the families need to hear what the professionals can offer
them,'' Weber said. ``They need to start to listen to each other
and learn what works in making families stronger and keeping kids
safe. It's kind of a combination. We're hitting the issues from
both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Each day of the conference will include general sessions with
keynote speakers covering a range of topics such as ``Ethics,
Confidentiality and the Courts'' and ``Help Create a World Where
All Children Are Safe and Happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference also includes smaller breakout sessions on
narrower topics such as intervention, diversity, violence, signs of
child abuse, learning disabilities and parenting after a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Mandrell, others who will be giving keynote
addresses include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Adele Faber, who co-wrote the book, ``How To Talk So Kids Will
Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Lonise Bias, mother of University of Maryland basketball star
and Boston Celtics recruit Len Bias, whose drug-related death
stunned the sports world in 1986. Four years later, the Bias family
lost another son, Jay, in a drive-by shooting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thom Hartmann, an internationally known psychologist who will
share his unique perspective on learning, living and parenting in
today's society and discuss the myths of attention deficit
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   n Joanne McDaniel, associate director of the Center for the
Prevention of School Violence, who will talk about creating schools
that are safe and secure.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the kickoff featuring Mandrell and other evening
sessions are $10. Tickets for the workshops and seminars are $25
each day. Tickets and registration will be available the day of
each event or may be purchased in advance. For more information,
call (513) 785-5957.

BARAK TARGETS CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS PARTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak has made a bid for
political survival by mounting a direct challenge to the power of
Israel's conservative religious parties.
</P>
<P>
   But observers said it remains to be seen if Barak's move will
prove to be a genuine new direction for his government or political
ploy to turn the tables on the religious parties that provided key
support in forming his coalition government last year only to
mutiny this July.
</P>
<P>
   Saying Barak had gone too far in making concessions to
Palestinians in the failed peace talks at Camp David, the powerful
ultra-Orthodox Shas party broke from Barak's now fractured
coalition Thursday and vowed to join other conservative parties to
topple his government when the parliament convenes in October.
</P>
<P>
   The plan outlined by Barak would redraw the lines between
religious and secular life in Israel by dismantling the powerful
Religious Affairs Ministry, establishing civil marriage outside the
control of Ultra Orthodox rabbis, and permiting planes and expanded
bus lines to operate on the Jewish sabbath. It would also impose a
national service requirement on religious Yeshiva students who are
currently exempt.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary plans also call for completing a constitution
that would, after more than a half century, define the Israeli
democracy in terms that make room for Palestinian Muslims and
Christians and other non-Jewish citizens who live within it.
</P>
<P>
   After an impassioned debate Thursday, 100 leaders of Barak's
Labor Party voted overwhelmingly to confront the religious parties
head-on and unanimously adopted Barak's platform for a ``civil
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli media dubbed the plan ``a civil revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   By confronting the religious parties on the issues that matter
to them most, Barak seemed to recognize the hemorrhaging of secular
voters from his traditionally liberal Labor Party. Many of them
objected to Barak's failed partnership with Shas, an increasingly
powerful party whose base is the ``sephardim,'' immigrant Jews
predominantly from North African countries such as Morroco.
</P>
<P>
   It is also an attempt to extend a hand to the predominantly
secular Russian immigrants of Natan Sharansky's Yisrael ba-Aliya
party, which also broke with Barak's coalition and vowed to join
Shas in an effort to call for early elections when the parliament,
or Knesset, reconvenes next month.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak's dramatic change in direction _ away from Shas and
back to his traditional secular supporters _ made even ardent
supporters of civil reform nervous. Barak is regarded as solidly
secular at his core, but many felt that he unforgiveably betrayed
that core by siding with Shas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost his way. It seems like he is panicking,'' said
Shulamit Aloni, the gray eminence of the civil reform movement and
one of the founders of the Meretz Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked all my life for these reforms, but I can't take this
proposal seriously. He lost his credibility,'' added Aloni, 70, who
retired in 1997 after 30 years in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak is very smart. But ultimately he is a commando who works
with secrecy, undercover tactics, and anything it takes to get the
mission accomplished,'' she said. ``Unfortunately, you can't
achieve peace that way. You can't achieve civil revolution either.
To do that you have to act like a prime minister, like a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak is has been struggling to break the deadlock in the peace
talks and clinch a final agreement with the Palestinians just as
the move to topple him is taking hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we conclude conditions are not ripe for a (final peace)
agreement, then the civil agenda will come center stage,'' said
Barak in his speech at the storied Labor Party Headquarters,
beneath huge portraits of Israel's founding father David Ben Gurion
and assassinated prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and some party officials said Barak's reversal was a
designed to assemble a new political base that would allow him to
survive politically if there is no peace deal by extending a hand
to the strongly secular constituencies within the conservative
Likud and Russian immigrant parties.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of his plan platform could be enacted immediately by
executive fiat, Labor officials said, including the dismantling of
the Religious Affairs Ministry. Critics have charged that it has
become a huge patronage mill for Shas and other religious parties.
</P>
<P>
   Other proposals would require another vote next Thursday by the
Labor Party's 2,600-member Central Council, and would then need the
approval of the Israeli parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Although Israeli politics are famous for fractious coalitions,
passionate rhetoric, deep divisions, and elaborate political ploys,
there is no more powerfully emotional fault line than the one that
cuts between the secular and the religious. It is a divide that has
everything to do with how the Jewish state defines itself.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including some of Barak's supporters, called Barak's
criss-crossing of this line a cynical and potentially dangerous
expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Menachem Friedman, professor of sociology at Bar Ilan
University, a modern Orthodox believer, and a respected analyst of
the growing power of the ultra-Orthodox, said he was worried about
launching a political debate that would pit the secular against the
religious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israeli society has the seeds within to even have a civil
war on this issue. And I say that not as an exaggeration, but as a
truth,'' said Friedman. ``It pulls the country apart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a maneuver, a tactic to win by putting together a
secular agenda. But Barak has a problem: It doesn't look real.
People do not take him seriously. They don't know who he is, and
Israelis don't like that. They like to know who they are dealing
with.''

 &HT;    Road to recovery after the flood is rough
 &HT;    By Chad Dunbar
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ For Beanie and Jeff Collins, the roughest
part wasn't watching floodwaters ruin their family home. It wasn't
throwing away heirlooms and cherrywood furniture pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having to start all over again _ that's the toughest part,''
Beanie Collins said. ``It takes so much to start all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   As with scores of others across Eastern North Carolina, the
Collinses have waited all these months after the water receded for
life to approach normal _ but still a full recovery seems distant.
</P>
<P>
   The Collinses doled out money in December to buy a home on
higher ground, and now they await their day in the buyout program.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration still is evident everywhere one year after Hurricane
Floyd. With recovery programs in cities, towns and wide spots in
the road after the historic storm, it is hard to see much progress.
Although it is one year after the flood, hard-hit areas are just
now receiving money and gearing up recovery projects.
</P>
<P>
   The behemoth storm pinwheeled up the East Coast last September,
putting communities in 66 Eastern North Carolina counties under the
largest swath of flooding in state history. Entire neighborhoods
now are abandoned, people still live in travel trailers and nearly
$850 million is set aside for disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Mount Mayor Fred Turnage said the Twin Counties _ one of
the hardest-hit areas _ has traveled the roughest part of the road
to recovery. The treetop rescues and evacuations are over, and the
city is focusing its efforts on buying ruined homes and moving
residents into higher homes, well away from the threat of future
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge is not being able to see an end in
sight,'' Turnage said. ``It will be a number of years until we
really realize the impact of Hurricane Floyd.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's buyout program is the largest disaster recovery
program in the history of the United States, and it promises to
last through 2001. State leaders were not prepared for such a
widespread natural disaster, not to mention recover from one. For
months, people complained about the slow trickle of money and the
wall of red tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, we've never done this before,'' said Leza
Aycock, director of the N.C. Hurricane Floyd Redevelopment Center.
``We had to start from scratch, develop programs and implement
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, just finding and contacting all the flood victims was
difficult. Most called the Federal Emergency Management Agency's
toll-free number to register for federal disaster assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, FEMA is not permitted by federal law to release
those names to the state,'' she said. ``FEMA's been great in
cooperating with us, and they've done a lotoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question in Grand Forks is `When is it going to be like it
was before the flood?''' said Kevin Dean, Grand Forks disaster
recovery center spokesman. ``They want the whole idea of recovery
behind them. But I don't think we will ever be normal like it was
before the flood.''
</P>
<P>
   The flood's scars remain evident in the Twin Counties. The
water-stained shell of Tarrytown Mall, the first mall built in
Eastern North Carolina, stands as a glaring example of the ill
effects Floyd left on Twin Counties business.
</P>
<P>
   The main business corridors in Rocky Mount soaked for days in
several feet of brown water. Now, a majority of flood-torn
businesses have reopened, paving the way for an explosion in
ribbon-cutting ceremonies in the last six months. But getting to
that point has placed a heavy financial burden on the business
owners' shoulders, said Charlie Glazener, president of the Rocky
Mount Area Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the businesses have to pay off 30-year loans,''
Glazener said. ``We still have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The flood discouraged Twin Counties leaders. Rivers and creeks
surged over their banks and stayed that way, in some places, for
weeks. Decades of work spent building the communities washed away
in a single event.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Mount's arts center, a children's museum, swimming pools
and bridges - all were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   City Manager Steve Raper didn't tour the city until the chaos
settled six days after Floyd - and the sights of destruction hit
him like a knockout punch. The city's recovery effort, he said, is
well ahead of other communities in the state, but there are miles
of road left until recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even one year later, we have a lot of accomplishments, and
there's still a lot of stuff left to do,'' Raper said. ``Getting
everyone back to where they were is a long-term effort. The people
in Grand Forks said we will come back bigger and better than ever,
and I believe that is true.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has set up a full-scale hazard mitigation office to
lead its recovery effort, concentrating efforts on rebuilding homes
and businesses and preventing future flood catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
   The buyout program, the city's biggest project, will move 400
homes built in the floodplain. Houses will be bulldozed to the
ground and acres of land will be cleared, never to be developed for
residents again.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have several land-use options. The leveled land
can simply lie barren, or the city could use it for additional
parks space, adding hiking trails and picnic tables. But the city
is far away from such an endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of things that can be done,'' Raper said,
``and that's what we are going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The city could follow in the footsteps of its flood-disaster
predecessor, Grand Forks. Residents there have become experts on
the rigors to recovery. Dean said some of the same hurdles lie
ahead for Eastern North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what it is like,'' Dean said. ``It has taken longer
than any of us ever expected. It's something that has impacted
people so completely and permanently that no one's lives will be
the same.''

CONFRONTATIONAL LAZIO GIVES HILLARY CLINTON A BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robin Gelburd is one of those people who have long
confounded Hillary Clinton _ a white, liberal, professional woman
in New York's suburbs who agrees with the First Lady on the issues
but is reluctant to vote her into the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But while watching the New York senate candidates' debate
Wednesday night, Gelburd started shifting her view. ``I think I can
look beyond the things I don't like about her personally,'' she
said Thursday. ``I probably will vote for her.''
</P>
<P>
   What got to her was the intensity of the attacks on Clinton by
her opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, he showed a lot of spunk in confronting her
directly,'' Gelburd said. ``On the other hand, I saw for the first
time a slight chink in her armor. To see her in the rough and
tumble, I could feel for her as a human being. Lazio came close to
crossing the line of a schoolyard bully.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, too early to gauge the effects of the debate.
But Gelburd's response raises some questions that go beyond the
reactions of many professional commentators.
</P>
<P>
   One typical comment, going into the debate, was that the
boyish-looking Lazio would win marks just by showing he could hold
his own with the worldly Clinton. He certainly accomplished that
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lazio didn't get run out of the room and that's what he had to
worry about,'' Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College
Polling Institute, said after the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a draw _ and if it's a draw, give the win to Lazio,''
pollster John Zogby agreed.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Lazio scored his best points when he _ or the
debate's aggressive moderator, Tim Russert _ had Clinton on the
run, especially when discussing her 1993 health-care plan and the
whole complex of issues involving, as Lazio put it, ``trust and
character.''
</P>
<P>
   This could only have boosted Lazio's standing with his core
constituency _ those who support him precisely because they so
dislike Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But what about those in the middle, those who have problems with
Clinton but are waiting for Lazio to give them a strong reason to
vote for him?
</P>
<P>
   Women like Gelburd are in this grey area. So are many in one of
New York's critical constituencies _ Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   Dov Hikind is an outspoken conservative state assemblyman from
Brooklyn who has a lot of contacts and influence in the Orthodox
Jewish community, and he did not like Lazio's approach at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lazio did himself a tremendous disservice with all those
personal attacks,'' Hikind said Thursday. ``I've talked with a lot
of conservative people and without exception, they felt he was
nasty. This is not the way a senator should handle himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Hikind plans on publicly endorsing one candidate or another in
the next couple weeks. Though he would not say which way he is
leaning, he said he was ``considering Hillary Clinton _ and that
alone surprises me.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Lazio's campaign were not returned Thursday. It is not
known whether, buoyed by his own feistiness, Lazio will continue
the assault on Clinton when the two meet at their next debate, in
New York City on Oct. 8 _ or whether, having made the point that he
can stand in the same ring with her, he will tone things down.
</P>
<P>
   One well-placed New York Republican thought he would keep up the
punching. ``The people around Lazio,'' this Republican said,
``really think Hillary Clinton is evil personified, that she's
actively corrupt and motivated solely by ambition. To them, this is
war.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, when Lazio threw her his attack-lines _ calling
some of her statements ``beyond shameless,'' ``more evasions,'' and
``positively Clinton-esque'' _ he had two things in mind.
</P>
<P>
   First, as a tactical matter, he felt he needed to show he hold
his own with Hillary Clinton. But second, he meant what he said: He
really does hold her in contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts thought the debate was a wash. Hank Sheinkopf,
a Democratic consultant, spoke for many when he said, ``I don't
think it's going to cause much movement in either direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they agree that, whatever the debate's net effect, Lazio
cannot have done himself any good with those who at least claim to
like their politics more dignified.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls, taken before the debate, show Clinton's favor
rising among two such groups that she has had trouble attracting _
white women like Gelburd and conservative Jews like Hikind.
</P>
<P>
   An instant-poll by the Daily News and WCBS-TV _ a telephone
survey of 274 voters taken right after the debate _ showed Clinton
judged the winner, by 49-36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, its significance is unclear, given the very small
sample. Four statewide polls, taken in the week leading up to the
debate, all showed the two candidates virtually tied, with Clinton
leading but by a margin smaller than the statistical margin of
error.

 &HT;    Habitat celebrates victory at home
 &HT;    By Bill Osinski
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMERICUS, ,Ga. _ After 24 years of righteous sweat, there are no
more shacks in Habitat for Humanity's home county.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a weeklong, home-building blitz led by longtime
Habitat volunteer former President Jimmy Carter, the Americus-based
nonprofit organization declared the virtual elimination of poverty
housing in Sumter County.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration comes as Habitat also marks international growth
that has totalled 100,000 homes, mostly for people who otherwise
could only have dreamed of home ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done is provide housing for everyone we could
locate who needed a house,'' Carter said. The victory claim means
that virtually everyone in Sumter County who desires to leave
substandard housing can do so, he said. Joined by his wife,
Rosalynn, Carter helped put the final touches Thursday to five new
homes outside Plains. The houses were built on land where his
family used to grow cotton, corn and peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   He worked through the late-morning heat and gnat swarms, pausing
briefly to track down a trowel that someone had borrowed from his
toolbox.
</P>
<P>
   The victory celebration is perhaps sweetest for 50-year-old Vera
Thomas, owner of the Habitat home in Americus designated as the
``Victory Home.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending her youth picking cotton on a Sumter County farm,
and the last 20 years caring for Alzheimer's patients as a nursing
assistant, Thomas and three of her four children will soon move
into their first real home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come a mighty long way,'' Thomas said. But, she added,
she might never have been able to step up to a home of her own if
she'd had to qualify for a regular bank loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I can plant me some flowers,'' she said. ``And maybe I
can rest better.''
</P>
<P>
   The cadre of strangers who built her house have become ``like
family,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers were part of the corps of approximately 1,200
workers who came to Sumter County for the housebuilding blitz,
which consists of 30 new homes in Americus, five in Plains and more
than 120 in other locations around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The group is a mixture of experts, idealists and everyday people
who want to use their spare time to help someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Brandon, a New York-based senior editor of This Old House
magazine, was putting into practice the topics she features. ``Now,
I really understand what I'm talking about,'' she quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon said the Habitat homes are built to standards equal to
those of some of the most demanding construction tradespeople she
routinely works with. ``It's amazing how exacting everyone is,''
she said. ``If we don't do something right, we do it over.''
</P>
<P>
   For Brandon and the other volunteers, the biggest rewards for
their labor are the emotional ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do a lot of good things for others, but this is
something that abslutely changes someone's life,'' said Carol Tebo,
of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Tebo and her husband Larry have been full-time construction
volunteers for the past five years. They sold their home and most
of their possessions, bought a recreational vechicle, and travel
around the country to various work sites.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat For Humanity has flourished in a time when other
non-profits are struggling, said Millard Fuller, Habitat's founder.
While it took the organization 24 years to build its first 100,000
homes, it expects to reach 200,000 in about five years from now, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the expansion, he said, is that Habitat taps into
the philosophy preached at practically every church: love one
another. ``You can't express love just by talking; we give people
an opportunity to put what they hear in church into practice,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And those who move into the Habitat houses are challenged to
give in return, Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not charity,'' Fuller said. ``The only thing we give
away is an opportunity to help someone else.'' The mortgage
payments for each new Habitat home are put into the fund that is
used to build more homes, so the new homeowner knows that each
payment he or she makes is directly helping someone else, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A house is to a family what good soil is to a plant,'' Fuller
said. ``A good place to live enhances a good life.''

&HT;     BUSH ATTACKS GORE FUND-RAISING AFTER AGREEING TO DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican George W. Bush on Thursday ended an impasse with
Democrat Al Gore over their debates by accepting Gore's position.
Then, going on the offensive after several campaign setbacks, Bush
charged that the vice president may have solicited an illegal
campaign donation in 1995 from a Texas trial lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's moves came on a day that he and Gore showcased their
rival plans to strengthen public education and four nationwide
polls showed Gore leading Bush by margins of 3 percentage points to
7 percentage points in the popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of arguing over the timing and format for
presidential debates, Bush had his campaign lieutenants agree with
Gore counterparts in Washington, D.C., on four campaign debates
sponsored by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush abandoned his earlier insistence that he and Gore appear on
two interview-style broadcasts and hold only one formal
commission-sponsored debate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement Bush and Gore will debate on nationwide
television on Oct. 3, 11 and 17, and the vice presidential
candidates, Republican Dick Cheney and Democrat Joe Lieberman, will
face off on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also raised questions about Gore's fund-raising in 1995
after documents leaked from a Justice Department task force showing
a ``call sheet'' that the Democratic Party prepared for Gore's use
during a planned telephone solicitation of campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Jim Kennedy said records show the vice president
never made the requested solicitation to a Beaumont, Texas, trial
lawyer named Walter Umphrey.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyer and his firm have donated $790,000 to the party
over the last four years since President Clinton in 1996 vetoed a
GOP-sponsored bill, opposed by trial lawyers, that would have
capped damages in liability lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Justice Department's recent opening of a
preliminary probe of the alleged solicitation, Bush said,
``Americans are tired of investigations and scandals.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to 3,000 National Guard officers and defense industry
representatives in a satellite address from California, the Texan
said, ``The best way to get rid of them is to elect a new president
who will restore honor and dignity to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the allegations provide ``new evidence that my
opponent may have crossed a serious line _ solicitation of campaign
contributions linked to a presidential veto.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Kennedy said both the Justice Department and
Republicans in Congress have ``had these documents for more than
1,000 days, and nobody found it interesting until 1,000 hours
before the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who has refused to name a special
prosecutor to investigate Clinton-Gore fund-raising tactics, said
of the new charge, ``I'm going to approach it with respect to
anybody concerned, based on the evidence and the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's criticisms of Gore came after two Republican Party ads
came under attack as unfair and were withdrawn. Also, a microphone
at a campaign event picked up Bush's use of a barnyard epithet to
describe a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Bush allies, led by GOP chairman Jim Nicholson, also attacked
the vice president's participation in a $5 million fund-raiser at
Radio City Music Hall in New York City Thursday night that was
organized by Miramax Co-chairman Harvey Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein released a film, ``Kids,'' about adolescents using
drugs and having sex in 1995 and underwrote the violent film ``Pulp
Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson criticized Gore for accepting campaign donations from
the ``Hollywood elite'' after criticizing them for marketing
violent films, music and video games to children.
</P>
<P>
   Before arriving at the fund-raiser, Gore told a school audience
in Manchester, N.H., that he would ``demand more restraint and
responsibility'' from Hollywood, adding: ``Parents should not have
to battle to protect their kids from a culture that glorifies
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Mark Fabiani rejected suggestions that Gore was
being hypocritical. Democrats ``aren't afraid to tell their friends
when they think those friends are wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, meantime, belittled Bush's $47 billion
education plan, saying that it would be financed with the budget
leftovers after a $1.3 trillion across-the-board tax cut that the
governor has proposed. Gore highlighted his own $170 billion
10-year plan for education improvements at a campaign appearance in
Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't make education our top priority if huge tax cuts for
the wealthy are already the first, second and third priority,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, hoping to counter Bush's emphasis on the
popular education issue, said his rival's education plan stands as
``one of the biggest differences in this election'' between Bush
and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush calls for the use of state-created standardized tests to
assess schools' performance and the diversion of federal education
funds to parents in the form of $1,500 vouchers to pay for private
schools or tutors if the public schools fail for three years in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan calls for a wider federal role in assisting local
school disricts by providing 100,000 new teachers to bring down
class sizes and repairs on 25,000 dilapidated schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also took part in New York City in an internet broadcast
chat with 11 young adults ranging in age from 18 to 28 that had
been organized by his oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 27.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, hoping to boost turnout among the 26.5 million potential
voters aged 18 to 24, vowed to boost college attendance by
college-age Americans to 75 percent by 2010 by providing a tax
break for the first $10,000 of annual college tuition expenses.

   SYDNEY, Australia _ A beleaguered Olympic movement sought to
sustain its viability and to shift its focus toward the
possibilities of international brotherhood and the achievements of
the world's greatest athletes as the 27th Summer Games open Friday
in what is late winter in the Southern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The 110,000-seat Olympic Stadium in this sports-mad country was
sold out as 10,500 athletes from 199 nations readied to march in
the opening ceremonies, viewed as a restorative, celebratory
pageant that would deflect attention from the ominous threats of
corruption, burdensome size and the perception that
performance-enhancing drugs are used pervasively.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes from North and South Korea were scheduled to march
together, a symbol of the hopes of reuniting the bitterly divided
peninsula, and four athletes from East Timor were to march as
individuals under the Olympic flag, granted special entry into the
Games even though the embattled island has no independent
government and no Olympic committee.
</P>
<P>
   Australia fielded the largest Olympic team, with 628 athletes,
led by the flag bearer, Andrew Gaze, who played for Seton Hall
University in the 1989 national collegiate basketball championship
game. The United States had a contingent of 603 athletes, including
the sprinter Marion Jones, who is attempting to become the first
female track and field athlete to win five gold medals in one
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Team competition has already begun, with the American women's
soccer team winning Thursday night and the men's soccer team
playing to a tie the night before. Individual competition will
begin Saturday morning. Australia is expected to win its first gold
medal in the triathlon and to follow with another victory Saturday
night by the freestyle swimming sensation Ian Thorpe, who is 17
years old and wears a size 17 shoe that propel him through the
water like flippers.
</P>
<P>
   It is the hope of the International Olympic Committee, Sydney
organizers, worldwide broadcasters and corporate sponsors, who have
billions invested in the success of these Games, that spectators
and television viewers will make a clear distinction between the
revelations of official venality in the Salt Lake City bribery
scandal and the remarkable performances that are certain to be
achieved here in the pool and on the track.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Redgrave, the British rower, is attempting to become the
first athlete to win gold medals in five Olympic Games. Alexsandr
Popov, the Russian swimmer, is seeking to win the 50- and 100-meter
freestyles for the third consecutive Summer Games, as is the
Australian Kieren Perkins in the 1,500-meter swim event. One of the
most poignant stories of the Games will involve Hicham el-Guerrouj,
the Moroccan world-record holder in the 1,500-meter run, who is
seeking redemption after falling with one lap remaining and
finishing last four years ago at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   For Australia, the Sydney Games will be presented to the United
States and the rest of the world as a kind of travelogue,
showcasing the Opera House, the crisply azure weather, along with
the good humor and inestimable friendliness of the people.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's swimmers, who are the hosts' most popular Olympians,
will be accorded rock-star status. And the attempt to win a gold
medal by the world champion Cathy Freeman in the 400-meter run will
bring attention to the plight of the Aborigines, Australia's
indigenous people who have been marginalized by European settlers
the past two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Anger and indifference seemed to prevail among Australians as
the Games approached. Both of the country's IOC delegates have been
compromised by scandal, Phil Coles for excessive travel and
gift-taking in the Salt Lake City episode, and Kevan Gosper for
giving his daughter a preferred spot in the torch relay. Organizers
were embarrassed by a ticket fiasco in which 500,000 of the best
seats were withheld for corporate bigwigs. More than 1.5 million
tickets remain unsold.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Sydney appears to be warming up for the Games. Ticket lines
are long, school children are out on Olympic holiday and the
interlocking Olympic rings hang from the Harbor Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the only remaining connections that an ordinary person
can have to the heavily commercialized Olympics, the torch relay
has been exceedingly popular here. Photographs of each torch bearer
have appeared in local newspapers and tens of thousands of people
have showed up daily to watch the torch on its procession to the
Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinary people want to believe in the Olympics,'' said
Richard Cashman, director of the Center for Olympic Studies at New
South Wales University. ``They might think the officials are
hopeless and crooked and greedy and arrogant, but they still get
excited. The Olympics are part of Australian identity. People
admire our best athletes as moral exemplars. I suppose this is the
biggest event in our history. It's a quasi-religious festival;
ceremonies like the torch relay and the lighting of the torch are
very powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Frequently isolated from the mainstream sporting world by
distance, seasonal differences in the Southern Hemisphere and
unfamiliar sports like cricket, rugby and Australian rules
football, Australia for the first time since the 1956 Melbourne
Games will play host to the largest multisport event on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, that world stage is creaking under the
burgeoning size of the Summer Games, a troublesome weight that
threatens the manageability of the Olympics for any host city.
Organizers recently needed a $140 million bailout from state
government underwriters as sponsorship targets were not reached and
the budget for the Sydney Games swelled to $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney's transportation system will be groaning to deliver
50,000 people an hour _ as many as 500,000 total on the busiest
days _ to Olympic Park, where the Olympic Stadium, pool, basketball
and gymnastics arena and baseball stadium are located and where
there is limited public space for moving around.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the public transportation system is struggling like
Atlanta's did, with drivers unfamiliar with their routes and
athletes missing training sessions because their buses were late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be deeply concerned about the economic model and how much
stress it can take putting on the Games,'' said David D'Alessandro,
president of John Hancock Financial Services, one of a dozen
worldwide Olympic sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The weather will also play a significant factor in the success
or failure of these Games. Strong winds have blown down electrical
lines on the train system to Olympic Park, and have interfered with
training at the rowing venue; some races may have to be held single
file instead of side by side, so boats do not knock into each
other. Sprinters will be facing a stiff headwind at Olympic
Stadium, which could preclude any world records in track and field.
</P>
<P>
   Further diminishing the credibility of athletic performances
here is a deficiency in drug testing. A new test for the
endurance-enhancing drug EPO will be used, but the test will only
punish athletes caught using the drug in the previous three days.
And there will be no tests for human growth hormone, insulin growth
factor and artificial blood, doping that is believed to be widely
used.
</P>
<P>
   So while the Olympics profess to be the purest form of sport,
not a single performance at the Sydney Games will escape the cloud
of suspicion caused by the use of performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good first step, but I'd say we're only a third of the
way there,'' said Gen. Barry McCaffrey, head of the White House
drug policy office who is here to help monitor the drug-testing
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   A successful Games will undoubtedly lift a sagging Olympic
movement, while a failure could deal a punishing blow with the
uncertainty of Athens' preparations for the 2004 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desire on the part of Sydney is to make the Games fun,''
said Richard Palfreyman, a spokesman for the Olympic organizing
committee. ``The pressure is on us to deliver a great Games that
keep the Olympic movement running past Sydney.'' &QL;

households log on to the Internet while they're watching
television, a 39 percent increase from last year, says a study

   BY GEORGE: The diaries of the original George ``Dubya'' _
Washington _ go online today. The Library of Congress is posting
2,300 personal logs the Founding Father kept since age 16.
Included: bedbug encounters, farm woes and entries that The Weather
Channel would love (e.g., the snowy conditions on Dec. 13, 1799,
the day before his death). A rare look inward came on April 16,
1789, after his election as president: ``About 10 o'clock I bade
adieu to Mount Vernon, to private life and to domestic felicity;
and with a mind oppressed with more anxious and painful sensations
than I have words to express, set out for New York ... with the
best disposition to render service to my country in obedience to
its call, but with less hope of answering its expectations.''

&HT;     BUSH ATTACKS GORE FUND-RAISING AFTER AGREEING TO DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: INSERTS clarification _ (the scandals) _ in 10th graf)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican George W. Bush on Thursday ended an impasse with
Democrat Al Gore over their debates by accepting Gore's position.
Then, going on the offensive after several campaign setbacks, Bush
charged that the vice president may have solicited an illegal
campaign donation in 1995 from a Texas trial lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's moves came on a day that he and Gore showcased their
rival plans to strengthen public education and four nationwide
polls showed Gore leading Bush by margins of 3 percentage points to
7 percentage points in the popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of arguing over the timing and format for
presidential debates, Bush had his campaign lieutenants agree with
Gore counterparts in Washington, D.C., on four campaign debates
sponsored by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush abandoned his earlier insistence that he and Gore appear on
two interview-style broadcasts and hold only one formal
commission-sponsored debate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement Bush and Gore will debate on nationwide
television on Oct. 3, 11 and 17, and the vice presidential
candidates, Republican Dick Cheney and Democrat Joe Lieberman, will
face off on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also raised questions about Gore's fund-raising in 1995
after documents leaked from a Justice Department task force showing
a ``call sheet'' that the Democratic Party prepared for Gore's use
during a planned telephone solicitation of campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Jim Kennedy said records show the vice president
never made the requested solicitation to a Beaumont, Texas, trial
lawyer named Walter Umphrey.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyer and his firm have donated $790,000 to the party
over the last four years since President Clinton in 1996 vetoed a
GOP-sponsored bill, opposed by trial lawyers, that would have
capped damages in liability lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Justice Department's recent opening of a
preliminary probe of the alleged solicitation, Bush said,
``Americans are tired of investigations and scandals.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to 3,000 National Guard officers and defense industry
representatives in a satellite address from California, the Texan
said, ``The best way to get rid of them (the scandals) is to elect
a new president who will restore honor and dignity to the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the allegations provide ``new evidence that my
opponent may have crossed a serious line _ solicitation of campaign
contributions linked to a presidential veto.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Kennedy said both the Justice Department and
Republicans in Congress have ``had these documents for more than
1,000 days, and nobody found it interesting until 1,000 hours
before the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who has refused to name a special
prosecutor to investigate Clinton-Gore fund-raising tactics, said
of the new charge, ``I'm going to approach it with respect to
anybody concerned, based on the evidence and the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's criticisms of Gore came after two Republican Party ads
came under attack as unfair and were withdrawn. Also, a microphone
at a campaign event picked up Bush's use of a barnyard epithet to
describe a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Bush allies, led by GOP chairman Jim Nicholson, also attacked
the vice president's participation in a $5 million fund-raiser at
Radio City Music Hall in New York City Thursday night that was
organized by Miramax Co-chairman Harvey Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein released a film, ``Kids,'' about adolescents using
drugs and having sex in 1995 and underwrote the violent film ``Pulp
Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson criticized Gore for accepting campaign donations from
the ``Hollywood elite'' after criticizing them for marketing
violent films, music and video games to children.
</P>
<P>
   Before arriving at the fund-raiser, Gore told a school audience
in Manchester, N.H., that he would ``demand more restraint and
responsibility'' from Hollywood, adding: ``Parents should not have
to battle to protect their kids from a culture that glorifies
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Mark Fabiani rejected suggestions that Gore was
being hypocritical. Democrats ``aren't afraid to tell their friends
when they think those friends are wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, meantime, belittled Bush's $47 billion
education plan, saying that it would be financed with the budget
leftovers after a $1.3 trillion across-the-board tax cut that the
governor has proposed. Gore highlighted his own $170 billion
10-year plan for education improvements at a campaign appearance in
Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't make education our top priority if huge tax cuts for
the wealthy are already the first, second and third priority,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, hoping to counter Bush's emphasis on the
popular education issue, said his rival's education plan stands as
``one of the biggest differences in this election'' between Bush
and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush calls for the use of state-created standardized tests to
assess schools' performance and the diversion of federal education
funds to parents in the form of $1,500 vouchers to pay for private
schools or tutors if the public schools fail for three years in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan calls for a wider federal role in assisting local
school disricts by providing 100,000 new teachers to bring down
class sizes and repairs on 25,000 dilapidated schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also took part in New York City in an internet broadcast
chat with 11 young adults ranging in age from 18 to 28 that had
been organized by his oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 27.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, hoping to boost turnout among the 26.5 million potential
voters aged 18 to 24, vowed to boost college attendance by
college-age Americans to 75 percent by 2010 by providing a tax
break for the first $10,000 of annual college tuition expenses.

<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ By the time Tiffeny Milbrett had
completed her woodwork hat trick early in the second half on
Thursday, an eerie silence enveloped the cavernous Melbourne
Cricket Ground.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the U.S. had sewn up a persuasive 2-0 win over Norway
in its first Olympic group match, a crowd of 16,043 roused only
when Milbrett cracked shots against both posts and the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   Swirling around in the chilly, early-spring breeze was a flock
of seagulls, whose numbers grew as the temperatures dipped deeper
into the 40s.
</P>
<P>
   Chilean fans waiting for their men's team to play Morocco in the
following match were providing the only authentic soccer
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   It did not feel like the Olympics, even though the MCG was the
main stadium for the 1956 Melbourne Games. The Australian Gallery
of Sport and Olympic Museum, adjoining the main entrance, boasts of
such past Aussie Olympic heroes as Betty Cuthbert and such current
hopefuls as Cathy Freeman, who call Melbourne their home.
</P>
<P>
   Because Olympic soccer is contested at various sites around the
host nation, soccer players often feel left out at the beginning of
the Games. But the U.S. women, who took part in Opening Ceremonies
in Atlanta four years ago, will be in Sydney today and will march
into Stadium Australia with their fellow American athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Even with an important match on Sunday against China, which got
two goals from Sun Wen to beat Nigeria 3-1 in the other women's
game Thursday, a first-hand glimpse of the central Olympic venue is
important enough for the team to hop a 90-minute flight from
Melbourne, spend the night and return on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After beating Denmark in its first 1996 Olympic game in Orlando,
the Americans flew to Atlanta. It was their only visit there,
because the medal round was contested in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the U.S. might not get back to Sydney unless it
reaches the gold-medal match.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '96, it was such a huge factor for us,'' midfielder Julie
Foudy said about the ceremonies. ``It's such an emotional boost. We
decided that we wanted to be a part of it again. It's worth the
travel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have all three of its group matches scheduled for
the 92,000-seat MCG.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach April Heinrichs said she decided three months ago to
let her players attend the Opening Ceremonies. She re-evaluated
after the team got its tough draw. Medal contenders Norway and
China were lumped in with the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Foudy and captain Carla Overbeck conducted another vote, and the
decision was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very good self-motivators,'' Heinrichs said. ``They're
well-traveled and know how to pace themselves after doing this for
as long as they have. What we get is a great Olympic experience.''
</P>
<P>
   IN MEN'S GAMES The second day of men's competition saw gold
medal contender Spain defeat South Korea 3-0. Japan, with a late
goal, rallied for a 2-1 victory over South Africa; Brazil beat
Slovakia 3-1; and Chile beat Morocco 4-1.

LAWMAKERS SEEK GREATER CERTAINTY IN CAPITAL CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt., Mass., Ill., Ore.)   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bolstered by findings that even Americans who favor
capital punishment worry that innocent people might be put to
death, several lawmakers vowed Thursday to renew their push for a
law to see that defendants in death-penalty cases have competent
lawyers and access to DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are ahead of the politicians,'' said Sen. Patrick
Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary
Committee and a sponsor of the Innocence Protection Act. ``They
know the death-penalty machinery is broken.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator referred to a survey taken in mid-August showing
that feelings among those who favor capital punishment are far from
monolithic. The survey found that 31 percent of the respondents
strongly supported the death penalty, 21 percent strongly opposed
it and 19 percent were not sure.
</P>
<P>
   But an additional 29 percent who support capital punishment also
acknowledged doubts and reservations about it. And among those who
said they were troubled, nearly three times as many were more
worried about an innocent person being executed than about a guilty
person evading execution.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 802 registered voters was conducted jointly by
Peter Hart Research, a Democratic research firm, and American
Viewpoint, a Republican firm. It had a sampling error of 3
percentage points and was done for the Justice Project, a national
organization that focuses on criminal-justice issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Innocence Protection Act is a carrot-and-stick package
intended to assure that states make DNA testing available for
capital defendants and provide more federal money to assure
competent legal representation. It was introduced in both houses
last winter but has not gained traction.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy and another sponsor, Rep. Bill Delahunt, D-Mass., said
that good defense counsel was even more important than DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The availability of DNA testing has really shown the
inadequacy of counsel,'' Delahunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy and Delahunt are former prosecutors who oppose capital
punishment. Two other sponsors, Rep. Ray LaHood of Illinois and
Sen. Gordon H. Smith of Oregon, both Republicans, favor it in
principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reservations are removed if this bill is passed,'' Smith
said. ``Let's have one standard of justice when it comes to the
ultimate remedy.''

PUBLIC WANTS SIMPLER DEBATES, SURVEYS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ Memo from voters to the presidential campaigns:
Keep the journalists out of the debates, and let real people pose
the questions.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule and sites of presidential debates was set Thursday,
but the formats are still in play. And while Americans may not have
paid much attention to the debate over debates, pollsters say
voters do have strong preferences about the way candidates are
questioned, who does the asking, and whether the session seems, in
the end, a satisfactory interview for one of the world's most
powerful and influential jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show the voters' favorite debate format is the town-hall
meeting in which candidates are questioned directly by citizens.
What they like the least are more formal interrogations of
candidates by panels of journalists who don't coordinate their
queries, won't follow up on serious issues, and savor ``gotcha''
moments.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Brown, the commission's executive director, said the issue
of debate format was not finalized in Thursday's meeting. A
proposal for a town-hall debate for one of the sessions is ``on the
table,'' Brown said, and neither campaign objected to it. Earlier,
the commission recommended at least one of the presidential debates
be in the form of a town hall, and that all the forums have single
moderators rather than reporter panels.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell McKinney, who surveyed Americans in both 1992 and 1996
about the presidential debates, said the level of voter cynicism
falls and political participation increases when voters are
satisfied that they got a good measure of the candidate in a
presidential debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough evidence to suggest that the debate is one form
of communication in a presidential campaign that actually makes
voters feel better about the political process,'' said McKinney, a
professor of political communication at the University of Missouri.
``In town-hall meetings, they feel like they are getting answers to
their questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The first town-hall presidential debate was held in 1992 in
Richmond, Va., between Bill Clinton and President George Bush.
Clinton, a gregarious campaigner, pushed for the format. Bush, who
wasn't as warm or glib, opposed it. At one point, Bush stole a look
at his watch, which had the effect, McKinney said, of ``sending the
signal that he was bored.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the son of the president, George W. Bush, suggested
the candidates replace formal, stand-behind-a-podium debates with
more informal and shorter sit-down sessions with TV hosts Tim
Russert and Larry King. Viewers could accept that, said Diana
Carlin, an academic adviser to the debate commission, as long as
the moderator gave the candidates plenty of time to answer
questions, allowed them to address each other directly, and pursued
serious issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are really critical of the 60-second soundbite. If they
could chose, they would have the candidates take four different
issues in each of the debates and spend 20 minutes on each one,''
said Carlin, a University of Kansas communications professor who,
with McKinney, published a 1992 book on public opinion on
presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin says research confirms that voters want not only specific
policy discussed in debates, but they also want the candidates to
articulate how they will govern, work with Congress, build
coalitions, and get things accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``For voters, the debate is a job interview, not a
competition,'' Carlin said. ``It is their chance to see who better
fits the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1996 election, presidential debates were normally
conducted by a moderator and panel of journalists. The data
collected by Carlin and McKinney after the 1992 debates was so
negative about the format that the commission selected Jim Lehrer
of PBS's ``NewsHour'' as the sole moderator of the three 1996
debates, including a town-hall session in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney said viewers feel journalists ask too many ``insider''
questions and turn the debates into game-like sparring sessions.
Voters are much less alienated, McKinney said, when they hear real
people ask the candidates about issues that hit close to home, like
crime in their neighborhoods or sending their children to failing
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters know candidates have a strategy for dealing with the
media _ they've answered or evaded their questions so many times
before,'' McKinney said. ``It is much more difficult for a
candidate standing 10 feet away from Joe Six-pack to be dismissive
or hostile. They have to give him a straight answer.''

SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT STATE DEREGULATION OF ELECTRICITY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Over a few sultry days in the summer of 1997, the state of
Wisconsin got an early taste of the electricity shortages that now
threaten several other regions of the country. An unusually large
number of nuclear plants that supply the northern Midwest were
closed for maintenance just as an unexpected heat wave drifted into
the area. Wisconsin Electric, which serves Milwaukee, shut off
electricity to 80 businesses; every few hours, it beseeched
consumers to limit their energy use.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Electric averted blackouts, but the scare profoundly
changed the state's approach to deregulating the power industry, a
process it had begun to explore only a year earlier. Like many
other utilities, Wisconsin Electric initially pushed for what it
and others called the Big Bang: state regulators should give up
control over the production and pricing of electricity almost
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   But after the 1997 power shortage, Wisconsin Electric, along
with most local businesses and consumer advocacy groups, began to
support a go-slow approach to deregulation, first building in an
extra margin of reliable power before encouraging the state to
remove its decades-old grip on the electricity industry.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the rest of the country has been drawing the same
conclusion. Just like Wisconsin, several other states have lost
their early faith in the instantaneous, smooth creation of a free
and fair electricity market. Deregulation has faltered as surging
consumer demand outstripped the supply of electricity, and
regulators and utilities scrambled to cope with successive summers
of price volatility and power failures.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year ago, the wholesale price of electricity charged
by power plants in the Midwest surged to $6,000 a megawatt-hour,
compared with average costs of $21 to $22 for the same amount of
power. Consolidated Edison customers in New York paid 43 percent
more for electricity this June than last year. Prices have spiked
elsewhere as well.
</P>
<P>
   When rolling blackouts rippled through Silicon Valley and
electricity bills doubled in San Diego over several weeks this
summer, California's pioneering approach to deregulation came to
embody what many see as the failings of the process.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the second thoughts about deregulation, few experts
expect a return to the days of strict government control. A world
in which various power generators compete openly to provide
electricity at market prices still offers the prospect of both
lower costs for business and consumers and higher profits for
utilities than is possible under the traditional, more inefficient
system in which monopoly suppliers are supervised by government
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is an indication to the rest of us that we need to
do our homework to make deregulation work,'' said Dick Olson, legal
counsel with the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group, an association
of large companies. ``Some people want to stop the process, but the
genie is out of the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   But getting from here to there is proving far more difficult
than expected. Lacking a clear federal approach, states are finding
their own way and, in the process, casting doubt on some early
promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deregulation was definitely oversold to consumers by many
people,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute
at the University of California at Berkeley. ``To economists and a
few others, deregulation was a calculated experiment, and we knew
it would have its costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, a regional electric utility, which was owned by
investors and regulated by the state, generated power, transmitted
it over high-voltage lines and then distributed it in low-voltage
form into homes and businesses. In broad terms, deregulation calls
for separating generation, transmission and distribution into
distinct businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation advocates argued that if power plants were sold to
private owners, they would compete among themselves to sell power
to transmission and distribution companies at cheaper prices,
driving down the cost of electricity. But that outcome was
predicated on the realities of the mid-1990s, when power plants had
spare capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But with few power plants coming online recently, particularly
in California and the Northeast, deregulation was introduced in the
late 1990s at the worst possible time. In the thriving economy,
businesses demanded more electricity, people built bigger homes and
bought more gadgets, sharply narrowing the gap between available
supplies of electricity and peak demand. Fuel for generation has
also become more expensive, especially natural gas, whose price has
doubled even as it has grown increasingly popular because it is
cleaner than other fuels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the expectation that deregulation will always
give you lower prices is unrealistic,'' said John B. Ramil,
president of Tampa Electric Co., a unit of TECO Energy Inc.
``Consumers think that competition will lead to lower prices
automatically, when actually they will be paying market prices for
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates rallied support for electricity deregulation by
asserting that it would deliver the choice and the low prices that
deregulation of telecommunications has brought. But they forgot
that the restructuring of the telephone industry, like power
deregulation now, angered consumers early on, when local calling
rates rose and the proliferation of choices baffled many people.
Lawmakers and regulators took years to iron out the process, which
is still going on.
</P>
<P>
   And because electricity is even more vital than telephones,
there is far less tolerance for interruptions in service and
volatile prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't assume that you can deregulate in one year and sit
back and watch how things work,'' said Barry Abramson, senior
utility analyst with PaineWebber. ``Regulators and utility
officials have to come back frequently and correct problems they
never expected until the system gets it right.''

   Doing It Right In Pennsylvania  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, 24 states have attempted some form of deregulation, but
regulators and utilities in other regions say changes in their
local electricity industry are inevitable, too.
</P>
<P>
   Among states where deregulation has occurred, Pennsylvania has
emerged so far as the place where the promises of competition and
lower prices are being met most successfully. The state began to
draw up a deregulation blueprint in 1996, around the same time
California did, driven by electric rates in Philadelphia and other
major cities double the average in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Pennsylvania opted for a plan that calls for substantial
government involvement in the market at every step. The state
protected the utilities against losses from their older plants; in
return, utilities had to agree to freeze rates until 2006 at 1997
levels to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The state aggressively advertised a choice of new electricity
providers. More important, it set the benchmark generation rates
for traditional utilities at a fairly high level, which made some
outside competitors' prices look favorable in comparison and which
spurred consumers to choose new power providers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, more than 528,000 residential and business users,
about 10 percent of the total, have switched to other providers
that sell them power at a fixed price over long periods. A recent
study by the state of Pennsylvania estimated that consumers have
saved about $2.84 billion in energy costs over the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   As consumers sought new power providers, those same companies
began to build new plants in and near Pennsylvania, shoring up
electricity reliability in the area. About 19,000 megawatts of
power, adding 50 percent more capacity, are expected to come on
line in Pennsylvania in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania also cobbled together the independent system
operator PJM from a network of neighboring states that could
transmit power easily to one another, creating a grid third in size
behind the entire transmission systems of France and of Japan.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Trying Rate Caps in California  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet the lurching progress of deregulation in the country as a
whole and the loss of old certainties like reliable power at steady
prices have ignited a popular backlash in many communities, most
vividly in California. There, the state has decided to cap rates in
San Diego at 1999 levels for the next two years. Other Californians
have urged a rollback of deregulation, demanding that power plants
sold to private owners be placed under government control again.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread short supply of electricity and the peculiarities
of the commodity itself have given generation companies enormous
leverage in the marketplace. Unlike most other goods, electricity
cannot be stored to be used when there is a shortage. Nor is it
something consumers can do without, which means the companies that
supply people with electricity will pay just about any price to
keep the lights on.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts say that the exercise of such influence is not
illegal _ nor unexpected _ since companies can be expected to try
to maximize their profits. But California's complex power buying
mechanism has created a situation in which relatively small players
enjoy extraordinary influence.
</P>
<P>
   On June 14, for example, the temperature in San Francisco hit
103 degrees and heat records were broken all over the Bay area. The
state's Independent System Operator, which coordinates transmission
of electricity, predicted that during peak usage on that weekday
afternoon, California would need 43,000 megawatts. But reports from
the power plants working that day showed only 36,000 megawatts
available. As a result, California ISO paid $1,500 a megawatt to
various plants that were not running, some that bet on a shortage
and delayed generation until the price of power reached the cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world knows we'll make up that energy shortfall
somewhere,'' said Spence Gerber, director of settlements at
California ISO. ``People go in and make their bids knowing we're
not going to shut the lights off. We have no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, rate freezes have prevented most utilities from
passing on much of the higher price of power to consumers. In San
Diego, however, the rate freezes were lifted just as the city
strained under a heat wave. That led to the doubling of customers'
bills in the span of a month.
</P>
<P>
   One part of any long-term solution, experts say, is to increase
the supply of electricity, through building new power plants and
transmission lines. But few communities want power plants or
transmission towers on their turf, adding to delays.
</P>
<P>
   So far, states have relied on caps on the wholesale price of
power to keep costs down. In California, the price cap, until
recently, was $750 a megawatt, and in Pennsylvania, it is $1,000.
But California officials concede that power plants sometimes get
$1,500 a megawatt-hour _ $750 for being on standby and $750 for the
power itself.
</P>
<P>
   Caps, if set too low, may dissuade companies from producing
electricity and from building new power plants. ``If you fix caps
at $250, you have to realize that if in a neighboring state someone
is offering $251 for power, you will have a serious shortage,''
said Richard Priory, chairman of Duke Energy, a nationwide power
generation and trading company.
</P>
<P>
   Given the complexities, deregulation, with its connotation of a
laissez-faire management of an industry, seems a misnomer. The
focus is now on restructuring the electricity industry, rather than
cutting it loose, and of using sophisticated forms of regulation to
foster competition and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking at is re-regulation, regulation in a
different manner than we had before,'' said Douglas Hale, senior
economist with the Energy Information Administration in Washington.
``Electricity is not one of those commodities that you can walk
away from and let take care of itself. You need a central authority
to make sure it doesn't all come crashing down.''
</P>
<P>
   Transmission Before Generation  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, rather than having the legislature adopt an
overall scheme, the central state authority has moved to
restructure the transmission sector before tackling generation, the
reverse of what most other states have done. The Midwest price
spikes in 1998 revealed that while neighboring states were willing
to provide power, there were not enough transmission lines in
Wisconsin to bring it in.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Wisconsin government has compelled the state's
four major utilities to surrender operation of their transmission
lines to the Midwest Independent System Operator, which covers
several states, to make sure all companies have equal access to
power lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the Big Bang in an industry like ours is that
you take a large risk,'' said Larry Salustro, senior vice president
of Wisconsin Electric. ``Maybe in three years, the market will be
better. But in those three years, people will go through difficult
personal and financial times.''
</P>
<P>
   The transmission company will be responsible for building new
lines to improve the importing of power, and though they own shares
in the concern, no single utility controls it. Wisconsin plans to
double transmission capacity in the next four or five years, by
which time the state would be ready to deregulate generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't have low prices unless you create an effective
market structure,'' said Lee Cullen, counsel for Customers First!,
a Wisconsin consumer advocacy group. ``Everybody can support
competition as a superior system, but we're not rushing headlong
into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Building safeguards against the volatility deregulation brings
will clearly take years, as more generation _ mostly in small
natural gas-fired power plants _ starts up, as more power lines get
built to move electricity to where it is needed most and as
business and consumers respond to higher prices by finding ways to
conserve power and limit use during peak periods.
</P>
<P>
   Some businesses and the occasional residential customer have set
up links with their utilities to respond to electricity prices in
real time, by turning down lights or allowing air conditioning to
shut down briefly when a computer message informs them of price
spikes. So far, however, such operations are rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until consumers can see and respond to real-time prices, price
caps will remain a necessary evil,'' Borenstein said. ``The dirty
secret of restructuring is that it is replacing old forms of
regulation with new ones.''

CHINESE FORMER POLICE OFFICIAL ARRESTED FOR CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese prosecutors announced Thursday that they had
arrested a former senior national police official in connection
with the government's continuing investigation of corruption and
smuggling in the southern port city of Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
   It was the highest-level arrest so far in the billion-dollar
smuggling scandal surrounding the Yuanhua Corp. Several trials of
lower-level officials implicated in the same scheme began earlier
this week in five cities in the southern province of Fujian.
</P>
<P>
   Li Jizhou, a former vice minister of Public Security, was
arrested late last year for taking ``huge bribes'' in connection
with the Yuanhua smuggling case, Zhao Dengju, deputy chief of the
national prosecutor's office told Chinese journalists at a news
conference Thursday. He added that Li had also been charged with
taking bribes in two other smuggling cases, both in Guangdong
province, according to the state-run China Radio International.
</P>
<P>
   Until a recent government crackdown on graft, vast smuggling
rings in southern China _ generally working in collaboration with
government officials _ made huge profits by illegally importing a
wide range of goods, including fuel, cars, cigarettes and
electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the same crackdown, the former vice chairman of
China's parliament, Cheng Kejie, was executed Thursday for taking
$5 million in bribes and kickbacks. Cheng, who was sentenced to
death last July, is the highest-ranking official executed for
corruption since the Communists took power in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no place for corrupt elements to hide in the Party,''
said a commentary in People's Daily, the main Communist Party
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is widespread at virtually all levels of China's
government, a fact that has greatly tarnished the party's image.
China's leaders and, according to opinion surveys, ordinary
citizens both point to corruption as the country's greatest
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The central government began a major campaign late last year to
clean up government, led by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji. As part of
that effort, hundreds of investigators were dispatched to Xiamen to
delve in to the smuggling empire of the Yuanhua Corp. and its
collusion with dozens of local officials.
</P>
<P>
   But critics have complained that the investigations tended to
focus too much on low and mid-level officials and that the
government's enthusiasm for public arrests went cold when the trail
led to officials closer to the top. When it seemed like government
investigators were poised to implicate the wife of Beijing's
Communist Party chief, Jia Qinglin, a protege of President Jiang
Zemin, in the Yuanhua case, a central government press office took
the offensive to clear the couple's name.
</P>
<P>
   The exact extent of the crackdown is unclear, since most
high-level investigations are kept under wraps. But over the past
six months, the arrests have slowly moved somewhat further up the
chain of command and have become somewhat more public _ presumably
in part to satisfy public demands for more action.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the arrest of Li took place at the end of last year,
Zhao, the prosecutor, said. But it was only announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's relatively candid discussion of some aspects of
the Yuanhua case also marks a change from the general secrecy that
has surrounded the investigation. Zhao said that from January to
August of this year, the national prosecutor's office had
investigated four officials at the rank of minister or provincial
governor as well as 100 officials at the rank of bureau head.

 &HT;    Triathlete sets a new course
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Sheila Taormina makes triathlon look easy. Barely two
years after taking up the sport, the swimming gold medalist made a
smooth transition onto another Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a classic overachiever,'' said Jack Bauerle, Taormina's
college coach at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The women's triathlon opens the Games here Saturday morning on a
picturesque course centered around the Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of funny,'' said Taormina, who won the Olympic
triathlon trials and is ranked No. 43 in the world, ``to think
maybe I shouldn't have been a swimmer all those years, I should
have been a triathlete.''
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old from Livonia, Mich., wasn't sure what she was
supposed to be when her eligibility ran out at Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of typical college female issues,'' said Taormina,
who is now a motivational speaker with her own company. ``Your head
just screws up what your body is capable of doing. Girls, we can
make such a big deal out of little things.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of eight kids, Taormina was homesick, often tired
because of the tough Bulldogs program and admittedly scared of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember sitting with Harvey (Humphries, the Lady Bulldogs'
assistant coach) and saying, `I don't really want to live, I don't
like my life a whole lot,'' Taormina said. ``I wasn't suicidal, but
I remember thinking if my car slipped off the road and crashed into
a tree, that wouldn't be so bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no reason I should have felt that way, other than
that I was a hormonal female.''
</P>
<P>
   Humphries counseled Taormina, who had gotten her MBA, to get a
job and move on with her life. She joined an auto industry supplier
near her family, but couldn't leave swimming behind. When she was
rejected by the U.S. Swimming Resident Program in Colorado Springs,
Colo., Taormina began training with an age-group club.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing was she found a way to enjoy the
journey a little bit,'' Bauerle said.
</P>
<P>
   For Taormina, making the Olympic squad in 1996 was just as
unexpected as it is now. She swam the third leg on the winning
800-meter freestyle relay and met President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for two years after the Games, she didn't train for any
sports. ``I wanted to just be a normal person,'' said Taormina,
``who could go to bed at midnight, instead of always falling asleep
at 9 o'clock. I didn't want to always eat healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   She got a small-business loan and traveled the country in a
camper, giving swimming clinics, and gained 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed being in shape,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Taormina, who is a commissioner for the city of Livonia's Parks
and Recreation Department, decided to enter a local triathlon with
her brother in the summer of 1998. She was already a swimmer and
runner, and thought, ``How hard can the bike be?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it, and I won the race.''
</P>
<P>
   The race director, Lew Kidder, sensing her potential, quickly
offered to coach her.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the best thing about Olympic triathlon compared to
swimming? No tickets required.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's key,'' said Taormina, who spent about $4,000 on tickets
in Atlanta.

 &HT;    Bear attacks two hunters in Colorado
 &HT;    By Dave Buchanan
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Two archery hunters from Missouri
suffered minor injuries Wednesday during an attack by a black bear
on Grand Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, a father and son duo whose names were not released,
surprised the bear while walking in dense brush along Buzzard Creek
east of Vega Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   According to DOW spokesman Todd Malmsbury, the attack occurred
around 11 a.m. Wednesday. The two hunters walked out of the woods
and were treated for minor injuries at at local hospital and then
released.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hunters apparently were hunting big game and working this
draw when a 'big black bear' come out of the brush and attacked the
25 year old son, biting him on the buttocks,'' said Malmsbury.
``The father was carrying a .44 (caliber) revolver but was unable
to cock it and ended up throwing it at the bear, which in turn
attacked the father and bit him on the left thigh.''
</P>
<P>
   Malmsbury said a third member of the hunting party managed to
fire the revolver at the bear and chased it away.
</P>
<P>
   According to Division of Wildlife regulations, any bear that
attacks humans must be destroyed and checked for disease,
particularly rabies. Officers from the Wildlife Services division
of the federal Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service are
searching for the bear, Malmsbury said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first such attack reported by the Colorado Division
of Wildlife in four years. At that time, a hunter was attacked and
injured when he surprised a bear. That bear was killed by the
hunter's companion.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sept. 1, 130 bears have been killed outside of the
permitted hunting seasons. Rick Kahn, the DOW's state big game
supervisor, said 78 of the kills have been by private landowners
trying to solve predation problems. Another 25 have been killed by
DOW officers and eight have been killed by Wildlife Services
(formerly known as Animal Damage Control).
</P>
<P>
   In additions, 19 bears have been reported killed by other means,
including roadkills and unidentified causes.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado has a limited September rifle bear hunting season.
Approximately 2,000 September licenses were issued during the
limited license drawing in May.
</P>
<P>
   Unlimited muzzleloading and archery seasons overlap the limited
September rifle season. Deer and elk hunters also may purchase an
over-the-counter bear license for use during the deer or elk
hunting season.
</P>
<P>
   Over-the-counter bear tags are valid for either sex and may be
purchased at any license agency or DOW office in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, hunters killed 847 bears.

BUSH PREFERS ABSTINENCE, INSTRUCTION ON TEEN SEX, PREGNANCY &HT;     

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   SANTA ANA, Calif. _ George W. Bush's teen-age questioner was
persistent, but the Republican presidential nominee stuck to his
message on sex education. He still prefers instruction that
stresses abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age sex and pregnancy were among several issues tossed at
the Texas governor on Thursday during a 20-minute exchange with
several dozen Santa Ana High School students and teachers on a
campaign swing through southern California.
</P>
<P>
   There also were questions about illegal immigrants, teachers'
pay, gun control and rebuilding the military. But the first
questions were about sex education.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Nguyen, a 17-year-old senior, not only got to ask the
presidential candidate a question but also squeezed in three
follow-up questions or comments as well, more than most reporters
get to throw at Bush at one time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best sex education takes place at home. I think schools
ought to be focused on reading and writing and adding and
subtracting,'' Bush responded to her first question, asking what he
thought about sex education in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Her second question was inaudible to reporters at the back of
the room, but Bush replied, ``If the sex education course includes
abstinence, that's the kind of thing as a parent I would support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to believe a full education course that teaches
children right from wrong will include abstinence education as
well, something in our state of Texas we've tried to encourage,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen then tried a third question, pointing out that many
teen-agers are sexually active.
</P>
<P>
   ``My answer to that is I wish people would understand the
consequences of the decisions they make in life,'' the governor
replied. ``One of the things we've got to do is have character
education in our schools, early in a child's career, the difference
between right and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate's patience obviously neared its limit when the
young woman offered a fourth question or comment, which was
inaudible to most onlookers, but his message didn't change.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who opposes abortion, has consistently stressed abstinence
as a component of sex education. His position is that federal
funding for sex education should include at least as much money for
teaching abstinence as for teen contraceptive programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance at the high school was generally well-received
by his audience, but Nguyen wasn't pleased with her dialogue with
the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abstinence is great, but what about the other teens who don't
practice abstinence? Over 50 percent of the students don't practice
abstinence,'' she told reporters later.
</P>
<P>
   She said she believed that Bush was ``kind of ruffled'' by their
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that he was saying that sex was wrong,'' she added.
``We're curious. It's only natural that we want to explore.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen said the only sex education she had received at any
school was in the sixth grade, ``when you have sex ed and they
teach you about the female parts and stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   During the same appearance at Santa Ana High School, a teacher's
aide asked Bush about teen-age pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about it because a cause of poverty is a child
born out of wedlock,'' Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would provide federal funding for ``character
education'' classes ``so that young children understand there are
right decisions to make and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to make it clear to people that having a baby out of
wedlock will make it awfully difficult for the baby and the mom.
And we've got to make it clear to the men of society that the
definition of a man is not somebody who fathers a child and walks
away,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday, Bush toured the Los Angeles County Fair and
attended Republican fund-raisers in San Diego. Bush also planned to
campaign in San Diego Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, he will have spent one full day and
parts of two others in southern California, although polls indicate
that Democratic nominee Al Gore has a strong lead here.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has vowed to fight for California's treasure trove of
54 electoral votes and plans to return to the state later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident we can carry California,'' Bush said at a GOP
fund-raiser in Irvine Wednesday evening. ``I know that goes against
conventional wisdom, but this is a state that wants change.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said at the fund-raiser that he's sticking to his
proposal for a
</P>
<P>
   $1.3 trillion tax cut, despite reports that Republicans in
Congress are now more favorably inclined to paying down the
national debt with federal budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to yield on this issue,'' Bush said. ``We are
on the right side.''

THE RIGHT THING: THE VALUES STATEMENT VS. CORPORATE REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 17) 
 By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the heart of the recently settled strike between Verizon
Communications and its telecommunications workers were the high
stress levels experienced by service representatives. One possible
culprit _ and something not explicitly addressed by the settlement
_ was the fact that a companywide values statement clashed with
reality in the area of customer service.
</P>
<P>
   The conundrum is common in business: How can a company ensure
that a stated set of values, put into place to help drive it
forward, does not conflict with that goal or with how employees are
treated?
</P>
<P>
   The core values in Verizon's statement, recently published on
one page of the company's newsletter, are integrity, respect,
imagination, passion and service. But one stark example of the
disconnection at Verizon was the company's request that customer
service representatives end each call with the scripted question,
``Did I provide you with outstanding service today?'' Having just
calmed an irate customer, a representative offering such a response
_ clearly tied to Verizon's core value of service _ could set him
off again. The request was cited by strikers as one cause of
stress.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with scripts is that they ``don't sound natural, and
you wouldn't believe that I was even concerned about you, '' said
Melissa Morin, the president of local 1400 of the Communications
Workers of America, based in Portsmouth, N.H., and a customer
service representative for Verizon and its predecessors since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling, scripts, even if intended to promote better and
more measurable service and sales, may fly in the face of Verizon's
other stated values. What kind of imagination does a company value,
for example, if it is asking service representatives to stick close
to a script? What kind of respect does it show for their abilities?
</P>
<P>
   In the notes accompanying its values statement, Verizon said it
had relied on the framework set forth in the best-selling book,
``Built to Last'' (HarperCollins, 1994), which said visionary
companies have core values and a core purpose. But James Collins,
its co-author with Jerry Porras, said those values were not enough
in themselves. The key ``is to preserve the core values and
purpose, and stimulate change, improvement, innovation and renewal
_ at the same time, all the time,'' Collins said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of stimulating progress is giving people a lot of freedom
to adapt to specific situations in the best, most progressive
way,'' he added. ``It sounds like the scripts were a very
well-intentioned step, but a step that took away the freedom that's
needed to truly live the values.''
</P>
<P>
   James Smith, a Verizon spokesman, said that customer service
representatives ``don't have to do anything by script,'' and that
the scripts were just a ``management tool of measurement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Service representatives are taught to analyze the caller,'' he
added, ``and then lay against him a script that works to promote a
specific product.''
</P>
<P>
   As Smith pointed out, their compensation is tied not only to
whatever product is sold but also to how well customers, in later
surveys, rate the service provided.
</P>
<P>
   So the service representatives may be getting a mixed message
about what the company really values. ``When there's such a strong
incentive to meet a production number, in some sense you can be
tacitly encouraging shortcuts,'' said David Gebler, president of
Working Values, an ethics training firm based in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   At Verizon, the conflict of such demands with stated values is
not lost on employees _ and has wide implications. ``Employees
understand the values statement,'' Morin said. ``But I don't know
that they believe the company is following its own words. They went
into this micromanaging period where they started timing
everything, picking every single word apart. People sort of just
look at the values statement and go, `yeah, right.' It's just a
piece of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Values statements that do not reflect reality can do more harm
than good, by fostering cynicism and anger. Rather than creating a
statement just because great businesses do so, a company's managers
may better spend their time finding what values exist within the
company, and determining whether those values foster the type of
company they want. If the answer is no, the managers should figure
out how to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a big fan of the `right statement' model of the
world,'' Collins said. ``I'm more a fan of the `get clear, skip the
statement' part.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Born two months premature, 15-year-old U.S. gymnast
Tasha Schwikert gained a chance to become an Olympian. Because she
turns 16 this year (Nov. 21), she is eligible for the Games. A
child of Las Vegas whose parents are both craps dealers at Caesar's
Palace, Schwikert knew the odds were long to make the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   She was ninth in the team selection process, then was named the
second alternate. But Schwikert was added to the squad when Morgan
White suffered a stress fracture on her left foot and selectors
bypassed first alternate Alyssa Beckerman. Schwikert, the second
African-American to make the team (the other is Dominique Dawes),
outperformed Beckerman at some mock meets.
</P>
<P>
   National team coordinator Bela Karolyi calls Schwikert, who is
excelling in floor exercise, an ``up-and-coming, very, very strong
athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Joy Schwikert, was a professional tennis player in
the 1970s, who competed at Wimbledon with her twin sister, Jill.
Tasha doesn't know how they did, but offered, ``I could ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwikert's mother wanted Tasha and her 13-year-old sister,
Jordan, to take up tennis, but Schwikert said, ``Being 3 years old,
it's really hard to hold a racket, so she put us in gymnastics for
something to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a year ago, she said, ``I would not even think I
would be here right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But she felt bad for White. ``That kid has been working so hard
her whole life for this,'' Schwikert said, ``and it's pretty
devastating for her. I'm dedicating whatever I do here to her.''
</P>
<P>
   In another injury development, Jamie Dantzscher rolled her ankle
at podium training Thursday, but she and her coaches said it was
minor.
</P>
<P>
   ATHLETES GET TOP BILLING
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Baldwin, vice president of the USOC, said the alignment in
which the United States will march into the Opening Ceremonies will
be different for the first time since 1896.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a clear protocol,'' she said, ``the flag bearer, the
president, officials and so on. . . . Well, we're going to change
that. And the executive committee and athletes agreed 100 percent.
This year, it will be the flag bearer, the team captains and the
athletes _ with the (Olympic) officials on the side (of the
athletes).
</P>
<P>
   ``For the athletes, this is saying that it's their Games. We
don't need to see a bunch of `old fogies' leading the parade.''
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ APPEALING RULING
</P>
<P>
   Mike Moran, the U.S. Olympic Committee's managing director, said
an arbitrator's ruling against an appeal allowing kayaker Angel
Perez to compete with Team USA will not deter the USOC from
exhausting ``everything legally and morally in our power'' to get
the decision reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, born in Mexico, has been disallowed from competing with
the United States although he fits the three-year rule as a
national, Moran said. ``Since 1993, he has been a national,'' Moran
said. ``He's paid his taxes, had jobs, gotten married, had
children. We're not out of bullets yet.''
</P>
<P>
   TRANSPORTATION SLIPUPS
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin said the city's troubles with bus service have not been
limited to the media. She said athletes have had similar troubles.
``Anytime you try an endeavor this big. . . .'' she said. ``It was
the same thing in Atlanta, where they hired drivers from all over
the country who didn't know their way around. Here, we've had bus
drivers who've gotten lost and athletes standing on the streets
waiting for buses. But we'll get it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the U.S. women's water polo team missed a
scrimmage Thursday because the bus driver went to the wrong venue.
</P>
<P>
   NEVER TOO OLD TO ENTERTAIN
</P>
<P>
   Still a showman at age 103, Hal Haig ``Harry'' Prieste drew a
crowd Thursday at Darling Harbor by doing wheelchair calisthenics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get this,'' the New Jersey centenarian said to photographers,
standing up and bracing himself on the arms of his chair.
</P>
<P>
   Prieste, the oldest living Olympic medalist, won the bronze in
platform diving at the 1920 Antwerp Olympics. He journeyed to
Sydney to return to the International Olympic Committee the first
flag to bear the Olympic rings.
</P>
<P>
   Prieste had shinnied up a flagpole to grab the banner on a dare
from swimmer Duke Kahanamoku, who is known in Australia as the man
who popularized surfing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'm not going to be around much longer _ it's no
good in a suitcase,'' Prieste said when he handed over the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Prieste was one of the original Keystone Kops, then a star of
vaudeville, the circus and in the Ice Follies, where he did a
comedy routine.

 &HT;    Things Australian, from A to Z
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _Australian crawl. Not what happens after happy hour. The
basic freestyle swimming stroke was popularized a century ago by
Australian Richard Cavill, who adapted the technique from Solomon
Islanders. Those sleek Speedo swimsuits come from Australia, too _
although they weren't very speedy in the beginning. An early woolen
model from the 1920s weighed 10 pounds and formed air pockets that
actually slowed swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   Bligh. One of the first governors of the Sydney penal colony was
none other than William Bligh of HMS Bounty infamy. The tyrannical
captain fared no better in Australia than he had on the South Seas.
In 1806, naval officers in the colony mutinied and toppled Bligh in
what became known as the Rum Rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola. The boss man is an Aussie. Douglas Daft, who became
chairman of Atlanta's signature business this year, grew up 80
miles north of Sydney near the coal mining town of Cessnock.
</P>
<P>
   Didgeridoo. The long, wooden wind instrument creates weird
vibrations that, under the right conditions, can open clogged
sinuses. Usually heard at Aboriginal ceremonies and souvenir shops,
where clerks just love to pronounce that word, which rhymes with
Dippety-do.
</P>
<P>
   Errol. As in Flynn, one of the many Hollywood stars who came
from Australia. The list includes Cate Blanchett, Russell Crowe,
Mel Gibson, Nicole Kidman and Geoffrey Rush. Many Australians no
longer claim Paul Hogan, but the facts don't lie.
</P>
<P>
   Foster's. Not Australian for beer _ not in Australia, anyway.
The quickest way to brand yourself a tourist in Sydney is to step
up to the bar and order Foster's. Though it's a popular brand,
locals are as likely to call for something Americans have never
seen on the telly, like Cooper's, XXXX (Four-ex) or VB (Victoria
Bitter).
</P>
<P>
   Gays. Twenty years ago, Sydney police cracked down on a gay
pride parade and started a riot. Now the cops have a float in the
Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade, which draws hundreds of
thousands of spectators and is broadcast on national TV. Sydney
Olympic planners have even invited drag queens to take part in the
Closing Ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, Harold. Imagine what would happen if a U.S. president
simply vanished. It happened in Oz. In 1967, Prime Minister Holt
went for a swim on the beach in Victoria and disappeared without a
trace. Melbourne built a memorial for him _ a municipal swimming
pool.
</P>
<P>
   Insects. Australia is famous for them. The Outback swarms with
termites that build man-sized mounds and bush flies that'll suck
the moisture off your eyes. The Sydney suburbs are home to the
funnel web spider, the deadliest on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Jet lag. Australia is the Timbuktu of continents, so far and
isolated that natives have a phrase for it: ``the tyranny of
distance.'' Americans visiting for the Olympics will understand
what that means after a 20-hour trip that may not end until two
days after it began, thanks to the international date line.
</P>
<P>
   Kookaburra. Still sitting in the old gum tree _ and, now, on
souvenir shelves. The kingfisher with the cackling call is one of
three official mascots of the Sydney Games. They're Olly the
Kookaburra, Syd the Platypus and Millie the Echidna (a
quill-covered anteater that resembles a porcupine). Unlike
Atlanta's computer-generated Izzy, Sydney's troika of mascots have
real-life antecedents and have drawn little ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   Laughs. Speaking of cackling birds, Australians are renowned for
their irreverent sense of humor. They've even made a satirical TV
show based on the travails of the Olympic organizers. One episode
of ``The Games'' was about a bloke who ticked off the Ollies by
copyrighting his new legal name: Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Melbourne. Remember the 1956 Summer Olympics? Not likely. That's
Melbourne's problem: People seem to have forgotten the city that
Sydney passed in population and replaced as the capital of
Australian culture and business. Melbourne, you may recall, bid for
the '96 Games and lost to Atlanta. Now that its old rival Sydney
has the prize, Melbourne is plowing its energies into a festival
for next year's centennial of the Australian commonwealth. Sounds
like a silver medal.
</P>
<P>
   Newton-John, Olivia. The Aussie thrush will be one of the stars
in the Opening Ceremonies, part of a lineup that has been
criticized for being bland, unimaginative and unrepresentative of
the nation's cultural variety. It could have been worse. As one
letter writer said in the Sydney Morning Herald, ``At least Ernie
Dingo isn't going to play the didgeridoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Outback. The fast-growing steakhouse chain began in Tampa, not
Australia, and was inspired by the ``Crocodile Dundee'' movies. The
company is opening its first Australian franchise in Sydney this
December. Maybe it will do better than Hooters, the Atlanta chain,
which brought jiggly waitresses to Sydney three years ago. It
bombed _ perhaps because you can see that kind of stuff for free at
Bondi Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Pokies. Sydney loves to gamble on everything from rugby to
horses to the poker machines that beckon inside every pub. The city
is said to have more gamblers per capita than any place outside
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Queenie. Almost a century after it became an independent nation,
Australia is still a commonwealth of the United Kingdom, and
Elizabeth Rex is still the official head of state. Last year
Australians had a chance to end this vestige of colonialism and
declare their country a republic. In a decision ripe for
psychoanalysis, they elected to stay with Mum.
</P>
<P>
   Roots. At every Olympics, Australians smirk when they see
Canadian athletes wearing gear made by Roots, the Toronto sporting
goods company. The reason? In Ozspeak, rooting doesn't mean pulling
for the home team; it's a bawdy term for doin' the nasty.
</P>
<P>
   Strange place names. The Australian map is sprinkled with words
amusingly transliterated from Aboriginal tongues. Some favorites:
Tittybong, Cocklebiddy, Knockibitoo, Wee Waa and the possibly
related Wangi Wangi.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Town. Sydney, on the other hand, was named for a British
politician, Secretary of State Thomas Townsend, who also went by
the title first Viscount Sydney. Robert Morley once said he would
have liked Sydney better if it had a more regular-guy name like
Bert.
</P>
<P>
   Utzon, Joern. The Danish architect who designed the Sydney Opera
House angrily resigned from the job in 1966, with the project
running years behind schedule and millions of dollars over budget.
He has never returned to see his masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Voting. Australians take it seriously. Not only did they pioneer
the secret ballot (first used in Victoria in 1855), but they've
made electoral apathy a crime. Every citizen must vote or be fined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waltzing Matilda.'' Some people think Australia's unofficial
national anthem is a children's song about dancing with a kangaroo.
It's actually a folk song about vagabonds wandering (waltzing) the
countryside with their bedrolls and knapsacks (matildas) over their
shoulders. The odd lyrics were written in the 1890s by the oddly
named poet Banjo Paterson.
</P>
<P>
   X Files: The Case of the Hungry Cod. A 97-pound fish caught off
the Great Barrier Reef last month revealed a grisly secret. When it
was gutted at a processing plant, a remarkably intact human head
rolled out. Enjoy the triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   Yanks. The Brits colonized Australia, but a couple of American
natives shaped its capital. King O'Malley, an American-born
politician, led the movement to establish an independent nation in
1901. And Walter Burley Griffin, an Illinois architect, laid out
the broad boulevards and parks of the new seat of government,
Canberra, which was built from scratch midway between Sydney and
Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   Zero. The amount of debt Georgia taxpayers had to pick up after
the Atlanta Games. New South Wales taxpayers have spent $1.5
billion and may end up getting stuck for far more. Remember that if
the pundits start saying these Olympics are better than the last
one.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Psychologists call it ``projection'' _ attributing to others the
behavior that we refuse to recognize in ourselves. And the practice
is widespread on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the longstanding concern on Wall Street that naive
investors will be quick to dump their stocks during market
corrections, thereby exaggerating declines and increasing the
probability of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   New research by two finance professors, Patrick Dennis of the
University of Virginia and Deon Strickland of Ohio State
University, shows that a far bigger worry is the behavior of Wall
Street's institutional investors _ defined by the Securities and
Exchange Commission as those who manage more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Before the study _ called ``Who Blinks in Volatile Markets,
Individuals or Institutions?'' _ the connection between
institutional investors and market volatility was hidden. Because
the SEC requires such investors to report their holdings only
quarterly, it is difficult to know how these large investors were
behaving during short periods of volatility. But the two professors
devised an ingenious solution: They focused instead on the
percentage of each stock's shares owned by institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   That focus let them test Wall Street's stereotype of the
individual investor as fickle and erratic, vulnerable to whichever
way the wind is blowing. If, in fact, individual investors are more
likely than institutional investors to dump stocks during a
correction, then the stocks with the lowest levels of institutional
ownership will fall the most.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality was just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   The professors studied all the trading days from 1988 to 1996 on
which the stock market dropped more than 2 percent. The stocks that
fell the most were those most owned by institutions. Conversely,
the stocks that fell the least were those with the lowest levels of
such ownership. The results of the study can be found at
http://gates.comm.virginia.edu/pjd9v/research.htm.
</P>
<P>
   So what leads Wall Street's largest investors into behavior that
they are so ready to criticize in others? I think the answer lies
in the odd incentive system under which they operate _ they
constantly feel obliged to do things that they believe will reduce
their long-term performance.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors are much more afraid of being alone at
the bottom of the rankings than they are eager to be at the top.
After all, a dead-last finish could well result in firing. Running
somewhere in the pack _ even if lagging behind the market _ is
unlikely to draw much attention.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, means herdlike behavior, even when it is
foolish. An institutional investor who makes a bad decision needn't
worry much about his reputation if others make that decision, too.
So these investors will sell into market declines, even when they
think the stocks they are selling are undervalued. They reason that
the decline might be the start of something worse, and though they
may think that unlikely, they cannot afford to be both alone and
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, these perverse incentives create opportunities for
the rest of us. How we exploit them depends on our risk tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to avoid the most volatile stocks, you might seek
stocks with the lowest levels of institutional ownership. (You can
learn how much of a company's stock is owned by institutions
through Web sites like Yahoo's.) To whittle down the universe, you
might first look for companies with less than 20 percent of their
shares in institutional hands; that eliminates about half of all
stocks, according to the professors. To draw an even deeper line in
the sand, focus only on stocks with less than 10 percent
institutional ownership. That knocks out an additional quarter of
the market.
</P>
<P>
   If you are an aggressive investor, however, you can view
institutionally dominated stocks as trading vehicles. If you are
bearish on the overall market, for example, your list of short-sale
candidates should include such stocks. For a stock to be among the
quarter of the market that is most dominated by institutions,
according to Dennis, they must own more than around 40 percent of
it.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS: GIVE A LITTLE, GET A LITTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was a reporter covering Lebanon's civil war there were
mornings when the fighting was so bad I just wanted to write a
one-line story: ``Lebanon ended today _ period, paragraph,
goodbye.'' But the Lebanese people's indefatigable quest for a
normal life always proved me wrong. I've been reminded of that
reading all the recent doom-and-gloom stories about how the
Palestinian-Israeli peace process is over _ period, paragraph,
goodbye. How many times do we have to bury this thing for people to
realize that if you think it's over _ you don't understand it?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is a very tough juncture, but it is not
insurmountable. We are dealing now with the most sensitive issues:
who should control the spiritual heart of Jerusalem _ what Jews
call the Temple Mount, where the ancient Jewish Temple once stood,
and what Arabs call the Haram as-Sharif, where two of Islam's
holiest mosques now stand _ and what will happen to the Palestinian
refugees outside of Israel and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1967 Israel has occupied and claimed sovereignty over the
Temple Mount. But out of respect for Muslim sensibilities _ and
because most rabbis ban Jewish prayer on the Temple Mount for fear
that Jews might be treading on the ancient Temple below _ Israel
has voluntarily granted Palestinians administrative control there.
But the Palestinians are now demanding full sovereignty for any
final peace.
</P>
<P>
   Quite shockingly, though, both Palestinian and Arab leaders have
been scoffing at Jewish claims that the ruins of the ancient Jewish
Temple are under the Temple Mount. Yasser Arafat and several other
Arab leaders have told U.S. officials that this was a story the
Jews just recently invented to justify their hold on Jerusalem. (If
Israelis heard the insultingly ignorant things Arafat has said in
private about Jewish claims to Jerusalem, the peace process would
really be over.) This is no way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most effective way for the Arabs to limit Israeli claims
to the Temple Mount is not by denying them, but by acknowledging
them and assuring Israelis that they will be respected, so Israelis
would feel comfortable enough to limit themselves,'' argued Stephen
Cohen, a Middle East expert at the Israel Policy Forum. ``But this
sort of recognition of the Israeli narrative by Arab leaders would
be a huge step. It would mean acknowledging that Israelis are in
Jerusalem, and in the Holy Land, not just because the Arabs could
not defeat them, not just because they were driven there by the
Holocaust, but because the Jewish people have a deep historical
connection to this place.''
</P>
<P>
   But the same is true for Israel regarding Palestinian refugees.
Israel refuses to acknowledge any role in the creation of the
refugee problem. Yet Israel wants Palestinian refugees to limit
their demands for any right of return to Israel. That is going to
be a very hard sell for Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Israel doesn't have to assume explicit responsibility, but it
should be generous in saying to Palestinians that they have
suffered a historical injustice and have a moral right to return to
their original homes _ but that as a practical matter Israel cannot
allow more than a symbolic number to return to Israel proper, and
the others will either have to reside in the West Bank or accept
generous compensation. For Palestinians to limit themselves they
need to feel that their narrative as a dispossessed people
struggling to recover their homeland is also affirmed.
</P>
<P>
   But while there is a certain symmetry in these two issues of
Jerusalem and refugees, there is no symmetry now between Arafat and
Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister. Barak may have bungled his
relationship with Arafat, but within his own political context
Barak has shown a willingness to offer unprecedented compromises,
re-educate his own people and stake his whole political career on
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has not gone that far _ yet. Some worry that the
Palestinian leader, now that he is shedding his revolutionary
cloak, is turning out to be an unreconstructed, provincial tribal
chief who may not be up to a grand compromise or running a modern
state.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, this struggle will end. Too many people now want it over.
But whether it is Arafat who seals the deal is still an open
question.

ATLANTIS `PLUMBERS' READY SPACE STATION WITH RUSSIAN POTTY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The visiting Atlantis astronauts equipped the
international space station with a Russian ``zero gravity'' version
of the household toilet on Thursday _ a strong indication the
orbital outpost can soon be staffed full-time.
</P>
<P>
   The toilet's installation was the latest in a flurry of home
improvements the shuttle's five American astronauts and two Russian
cosmonauts have engaged in this week as they prepare the station
for the arrival of its first resident crew in early November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are plumbers, carpenters, electricians _ you name it,''
joked astronaut Dan Burbank, who assisted cosmonaut Yuri
Malenchenko with the hook-up of the toilet's waste holding tank,
air and fluid hoses.
</P>
<P>
   Worried the privy might leak once the Atlantis crew departs this
weekend, mission control asked the astronauts to refrain from
engaging in a full fledged test of their handiwork. The honor has
been bestowed on Bill Shepherd, Yuri Malenchenko and Sergei
Krikalev who are preparing to move aboard for a four-month stay
within two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic systems are installed, but we will leave that for
later crews,'' said Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   Since docking with the 143-foot-long collection of early station
modules last Sunday, the shuttle crew has spent most of its time
bolstering the electrical power distribution system. Before they
return to Earth, the astronauts will assemble air generation and
recycling systems, an exercise bicycle and treadmill, a laptop
computer network and install fire extinguishers.
</P>
<P>
   Like the toilet, most of the new gear will be installed in the
station's latest addition, the Russian-built Zvezda crew habit
module. With its living and working quarters, the 43-foot-long
module's arrival in late July made the station habitable for the
first time since the first components were joined in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Still far from fully assembled, the growing outpost is
nonetheless impressive, said Atlantis commander Terry Wilcutt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful facility,'' he said. ``It's the equivalent of
a 13-story building right now. It's incredibly spacious and well
lit. I think all of us (astronauts) hope to spend some time up
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of gravity, the new station toilet relies on a
forceful flow of air rather than water to flush human wastes.
</P>
<P>
   Malenchenko and Burbank connected the toilet's waste storage
tank with fluid hoses and filled a reservoir with a sanitizing
chemical fluid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The installations are important because they will minimize the
amount of work the first crew has to do and make the station much
more habitable,'' said NASA's Kirk Shireman, the station's Russian
components manager. ``The toilet in particular is something that is
really important.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian economic problems slowed Zvezda's launching by two years
and stalled other major assembly work as well. When Zvezda did lift
off, the module was much too heavy to carry all of its live support
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the missing equipment including the toilet was launched
in August aboard an unmanned Russian Progress cargo capsule. The
shuttle brought more of the still needed gear as well as the
personnel to install it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Thursday, Russian ground controllers evaluated a
potential difficulty with one of the Zvezda module's eight power
storage batteries. The module was launched with just five in place.
It was equipped with three more by the shuttle crew earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   One of the five original batteries is having difficulty
charging, according to NASA's Mark Ferring, the station's lead
flight director.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on the ground hope to find a remedy.
</P>
<P>
   If they can't, Zvezda can draw adequate power with as few as six
batteries. Another loss would force control teams to impose
conservation measures.
</P>
<P>
   The batteries store power generated by solar arrays as the
station circles the Earth in sunlight. When the outpost slips into
darkness, the batteries discharge enough current to keep the life
support, communications and computer systems running.

 &HT;    It's chilly Down Under
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Welcome to the Summer Games _ Down Under. The winter
just turned to spring, and the weather is more like early March in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all bad if you're a basketball Dream Teamer or you're
going for gold in the boxing ring or swimming the pool. But if
you're out in the elements, it could get dicey.
</P>
<P>
   Sweat could give way to shivers at what might go down as the
Windbreaker Games. The weather could play a role in everything from
baseball and archery to beach volleyball and cycling.
</P>
<P>
   Cool temperatures aren't ideal for world-record performances,
especially in the track-and-field sprints that grab prime-time
television exposure. Track athletes already are complaining about
swirling, turbulent winds in the 110,000-seat Olympic Stadium. Most
finals are booked for evenings, after the sun goes down and when
the mercury hovers around 50 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   And Sydney organizers, along with International Olympic
Committee boss Juan Antonio Samaranch, have voiced concern whether
Mother Nature might rain on the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Their fears were heightened last September when thunderstorms
washed out a women's Olympic field-hockey qualifier in Sydney
Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, three days of torrential rains fell during a
late-September developmental-track camp in Sydney. ``If this kind
of weather hits, it'll be miserable,'' said Loren Seagrave, then a
consultant to the Australian track federation.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, athletes are of the mind-set to deal with it _ and
clear blue skies have been the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be the same for everybody,'' said track star Marion
Jones, who is trying to make Olympic history by winning five gold
medals. ``It's not just going to be windy in my lane. I'd love for
it to be 90 degrees, but it's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in the Raleigh area, I've experienced everything from
15 inches of snow to 98 degrees and 80 percent humidity,'' Jones
said. ``If anybody can handle various degrees in temperature, I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters are predicting at least traces of rain on five of
the 17 days of competition _ but it probably will be a typical
September, with total accumulation of 1/10th of an inch. The
average daily high temperature is forecast to be 68 degrees with a
low around 50 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the rain will be at night when no one really cares,''
said Elly Spark, manager of the Olympic Games weather service. ``It
won't be a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in case, Sydney officials debuted weather-tracking radar
last month to assist in detecting any freak severe storms. Weather
reports detailing temperature, rainfall, humidity and, most
important, wind, will be issued every three hours at the venues,
with sailing receiving hourly reports for conditions in the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Weather talk fueled ill winds recently when Aussie long-jumper
Jai Taurima dismissed his American rivals, all three of whom are
black, by saying: ``You can pretty much knock out all the dark
athletes'' because of the cool conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, sprinters and jumpers tend not to perform as well in
cool temperatures, which is the opposite for distance runners.
Athletes in the speed events also are more prone to muscle pulls
when temperatures dip.
</P>
<P>
   It should be interesting to see whether world-record holders
Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene, both of whom pulled up lame in
near-100-degree heat in the Olympic Trials, hold up in the chill.
</P>
<P>
   But fast times in the sprints? ``If the wind is in their face,''
U.S. coach John Chaplin said, ``you won't see it.''

GORE, BUSH AGREE TO THREE DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ending weeks of tension, the campaigns of George W.
Bush and Al Gore have agreed to three presidential debates,
including one in Boston, after Bush dropped his demands for
different locations and formats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has gone from a 17-point lead in the polls to being
even with Gore in recent weeks, decided on Wednesday that he
couldn't afford to drag out the dispute over debates any longer,
said a senior aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. Thus, when
the two campaigns met Thursday with the Commission on Presidential
Debates, the Bush camp quickly dropped its objections and agreed to
the original schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign chairman Donald Evans, after emerging from the
four-hour meeting at a Washington law firm, said the campaign
changed its position because ``we're eager to get on with debates.
The commission was very constructive and helped in these
discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior Bush aide said, ``We didn't want to spend another two
weeks talking about it,'' but he denied Bush had ``caved'' to
Gore's demands.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston debate will be held first, on Oct. 3 at the
University of Massachusetts. If history is a guide, the first
debate is likely to be the most-watched and most influential.
</P>
<P>
   The two other presidential debates will be Oct. 11 at Wake
Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., and Oct. 17 at Washington
University in St. Louis. Each 90-minute session is slated to be
televised during prime time.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns also agreed to the original schedule for a single
vice presidential debate on Oct. 5 at Centre College in Danville,
Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the agreement on the dates and locations, the campaign
left two major questions unresolved: the choice of the moderator or
reporters for each debate and the format. At least one of the
debates could be held in a town-hall style session. Also undecided
are details such as whether the candidates will stand behind
lecterns, sit in chairs or allow moderators to show video clips
during their questions.
</P>
<P>
   Boston officials, who had spent months preparing for the debate,
were relieved and thrilled with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy with the announcement today,'' University of
Massachusetts president William M. Bulger said. ``We couldn't think
of any reason why Governor Bush wouldn't want to debate here. We're
really most pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul G. Kirk Jr., the Democratic co-chairman of the debate
commission whose Boston roots played a major role in bringing one
of the forums to Massachusetts, said he was happy for the city and
praised local officials for the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credit goes to them. One of the things that we talked
about was how much these communities have contributed in preparing
for these,'' Kirk said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate commission has not invited Green Party candidate
Ralph Nader or either of the two people claiming to be the Reform
Party nominee, Patrick J. Buchanan or John Hagelin. Representatives
of those campaigns have argued that they should be included. But
the commission, which is chaired by former chairmen of the
Democratic and Republican parties, requires a third-party candidate
to reach 15 percent in a series of five polls in order to be
invited. That has angered the third-party candidates, who say their
best chance of climbing in the polls would be to participate in the
debates.
</P>
<P>
   Commission executive director Janet Brown said an analysis of
the polls will be conducted later this month to determine which
candidates are invited. A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, conducted
Sept. 10-12, showed Gore leading Bush among likely voters by 49
percent to 41 percent, with 4 percent for Nader and 1 percent for
Buchanan. Another 5 percent gave a different name or no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston debate will be held at the Clark Athletic Center on
the campus of UMass-Boston. Brown said it is too early to say
whether the public could apply for tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the nomination acceptance speeches at the national
political conventions, presidential debates are considered a
candidate's best chance to reach voters. With analysts saying this
could be the tightest presidential contest in many years, the
debates have grown even more important. While debates mostly
reinforce the views of voters already leaning toward a certain
candidate, they can be a decisive factor for millions of undecided
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bipartisan commission began sponsoring the debates in
1988, television viewership has ranged from 50 million to 97
million, with the first debate of the campaign usually receiving
the highest ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's original strategy in rejecting two of the three
commission debates was partly to pressure Gore, who had said he
would debate Bush ``anytime, anywhere.'' But after the Bush
campaign ran a television advertisement challenging Gore's
credibility on the debate issue, some top Republicans said the
strategy was backfiring with the public and reinforcing an
impression that Bush did not want the largest possible television
audience for the debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes, asked whether Bush had gained
anything from the two-week standoff, said: ``Absolutely. What we
got is the opportunity for the American people to see the
candidates in a more free-flowing and spontaneous discussion of the
issues that we think will far better serve the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Bush aides privately expressed opposition to the Boston
session, partly because the site is adjacent to the John F. Kennedy
Library. The library is also sponsoring some events connected to
the debate. Bush's initial reluctance to agree to the Boston debate
prompted Gore earlier this week to question whether Bush was trying
to distance himself from the Kennedy legacy. Hughes insisted Bush
was not wary of the Kennedy library or appearing in a traditionally
Democratic area.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign chairman William Daley, asked if this was a
victory for the vice president, said, ``No, it's a victory for the
American people. This is good because the American people want to
hear from these people in formal settings that give them the
opportunity to express what they will do as the next president of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who had said Bush's initial
reluctance gave ``a whole new meaning to the phrase `Boston
Chicken,' '' applauded the decision. Asked about the Boston Chicken
comment, Menino spokeswoman Carole Brennan said, ``I've never known
the mayor to take anything back.''
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's meeting, the commission's co-chairmen said they
were pleased. ``The major things about the `debate debate,'
happily, are over. There's a commitment to bring these debates to
the American people,'' said Kirk, former chairman of the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart, former Republican National Committee Chairman
Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., said: ``For all intents and purposes,
there was no disagreement with doing it, but when you get down to
the nitty gritty in each format _ time for answers and so forth _
that sort of thing is what we're now trying to reach closure on.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the debate is set, preparations are already beginning
for the inevitable ``spin'' sessions and post-debate rallies.
Indeed, Senator John F. Kerry, who has agreed to organize a rally
for Gore at UMass-Boston, got in some pre-debate spinning practice
Thursday, by sending out a news release saying: ``Unfortunately for
Governor Bush, Oct. 3 may go down in history as another Boston
Massacre.''

BUSH CRITICIZES GORE FUND RAISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. _ As Al Gore wrapped up a star-studded
week of campaigning with a gala fund-raiser in New York, George W.
Bush returned to a favorite theme by seizing on a fresh allegation
of fund-raising improprieties by the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, lagging in most national polls, heavily promoted news
reports Thursday that Gore once may have influenced a presidential
veto to curry favor with a large donor.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a group of National Guard members, the Texas
governor said Gore appeared to have ``crossed a serious line'' in
his dealings with a Texas trial lawyer in 1995. According to
various reports, aides instructed Gore to call the lawyer to
solicit a $100,000 contribution around the same time Clinton vetoed
a bill that would have limited awards in product-liability
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Gore never made the call. But Bush, relying on
newspaper reports, said it ``sounded like, on the surface, there's
a quid pro quo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just today, there are new revelations about potential misuse
of the White House for fund-raising purposes, more evidence that my
opponent may have crossed a serious line _ solicitation of campaign
contributions linked to a presidential veto,'' Bush said. ``The
appearance is really disturbing. Americans are tired of
investigations and scandals, and the best way to get rid of them is
to elect a new president who will restore honor and dignity to the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has long relied on the fund-raising scandals of the last
presidential election as a tool to disparage his opponent, and is
running ads that show Gore at a Buddhist temple where funds were
raised illegally. Gore later returned the money, but Bush
frequently uses it as evidence that Gore is untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore denied any wrongdoing. The Justice Department is reportedly
reviewing a memorandum showing what Gore was supposed to say in the
telephone call to Walter Umphrey, a Texas donor, who, as a trial
lawyer, favored the Clinton veto of the litigation bill.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Gore, the phone call was placed by Don Fowler, then
chairman of the Democratic National Committee, according to
reports. The Gore campaign Thursday tried to play down the entire
episode, mocking Bush for making an issue of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the governor _ who is surrounded by rats and
mired in mispronunciations _ is using desperate language because
he's a desperate candidate wallowing in desperate polls,'' Gore
spokesman Chris Lehane said. ``He has no positive message, so
therefore he's resorting to play one in the Republican play book.
He's focused on the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a week that included appearances with Oprah Winfrey,
Cher and James Taylor, attended a Radio City Music Hall bash thrown
by executive Harvey Weinstein and Rolling Stone publisher Jann
Wenner.
</P>
<P>
   The event, which was expected to raise $6.5 million, boasted a
concentration of celebrities unmatched anywhere outside a Hollywood
awards ceremony. Performers included singers Sheryl Crow, Lenny
Kravitz, Jon Bon Jovi, Bette Midler, Paul Simon, and members of the
Eagles. Actors Julia Roberts, Michael Douglas, Harrison Ford, and
Salma Hayek were to be masters of ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   GOP officials pilloried Gore and his running mate, Senator
Joseph I. Lieberman, for taking money from the entertainment
industry even though they have been lamenting its harmful effects
on teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   That smacked of hypocrisy, according to RNC co-chairs Jim
Nicholson and Patricia S. Harrison, who held a sidewalk-blocking
press conference outside Radio City Music Hall Thursday afternoon
to air their accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you something,'' Harrison added. ``If there was an
Academy Award for brazen hypocrisy, I hope they give it to him
tonight on that stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane scoffed at such accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign is not about our supporters,'' he said. ``It's
not about our opponents. It's about what's right for America's
children.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no need to put a tobacco-like moratorium on donations
from Hollywood, he said. Gore has been pushing the industry to
raise its standards for years, he said, and the industry is not all
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It elevates the culture in a lot of ways,'' Lehane said.
``Look at `Schindler's List' or `Saving Private Ryan.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gore arrived at the fund-raiser after taping an appearance of
``The Late Show With David Letterman.'' On the program, Gore
defended his now-famous, lingering, convention kiss with his wife
Tipper as completely spontaneous and ``just a peck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came out here, I felt like giving you a big kiss,''
Gore told Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you get a focus group on that and call me?''
Letterman deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also had his own top ten list _ Rejected slogans for the
Gore-Lieberman campaign. It included number nine, ``Remember
America, I gave you the Internet and I can take it away. Think
about it.'' And number six: ``We know when the microphone is on.''

   SYDNEY, Australia _ Finally, after weeks of waiting, the U.S.
swimming team gets its chance to positively glow when competition
gets under way at the International Aquatic Centre. And after years
of waiting, Australia's Michellie Jones could finally enjoy her
moment in the sun when the inaugural Olympic triathlon is
contested.
</P>
<P>
   The 27th Summer Games will commence in earnest Saturday with
four swimming finals (the women's 400-meter individual medley, the
men's 400 freestyle and the men's and women's 400 freestyle relays)
and the triathlon leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   Former Pepperdine swimmer Jennifer Gutierrez will be among those
tryingto prevent Jones, the No. 1-ranked competitor in the world,
from directing an Aussie sweep in the triathlon. Hart High graduate
Anthony Ervin, meantime, will try to help keep the U.S. unbeaten in
the sprint freestyle relay in Olympic competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Valencia resident will race in the morning heats of the
relay. A blistering 100-meter split would all but assure him a spot
on the four-mansquad that will go for the gold in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthony has looked good in training. He certainly has handled
the pressure well,'' said U.S. Olympic men's coach Mark Schubert.
``The guy can really compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Aussie superstar Ian Thorpe also will make his Olympic debut
Saturday, in the 400 freestyle and as a member of the 400 freestyle
relay team that figures to pose the most serious challenge to the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe is the overwhelming favorite in the 400. He holds the
world record in the event and is two-and-a-half seconds faster than
his nearest competitor. ``When you watch him, there's not one flaw
that I can see,'' said Laguna Hills' Chad Carvin, one of Thorpe's
U.S. challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Only 17, Thorpe already is such a celebrity here he counts Tom
Cruise among his mates.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is plenty of attention to go around the
International Aquatic Centre. The American swimmers have been made
to feel this week like NFL players in the days leading up to the
Super Bowl. The spotlight trained on the sport in this country led
U.S. sprinter Jenny Thompson todeclare, ''
</P>
<P>
   What better place, then, for Thompson, who failed to qualify for
an individual event in the 1996 Olympics, to stage a resurrection?
Her crusadebegins Saturday, in the sprint relay and the heats and
semifinals of the 100 butterfly.

BUSH BOWS TO GORE'S DEBATE DEMANDS 

</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush bowed to most of his
presidential opponent's debate demands Thursday as he and Vice
President Al Gore agreed to participate in three debates sponsored
by a bipartisan commission.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting for more than four hours, top advisers to Gore and
Bush announced the deal that also will include one face-off between
their running mates. The first presidential debate will be Oct. 3
at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement marks a turnaround for Bush, who earlier had
rejected most of the recommendations by the Commission on
Presidential Debates and instead proposed alternative forums.
</P>
<P>
   But with Gore pulling slightly ahead or even in the polls, Bush
now appears eager to engage his opponent in nationally televised
events that have the potential to shake up the race.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with commission officials, Bush campaign chairman
Don Evans said, ``We have agreed to the sites. We've agreed to the
time. The governor is very eager to debate. He's looking forward to
a free-flowing, substantive, real and genuine discussion of the
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore previously had embraced the commission's recommendations
and rejected Bush's insistence on face-offs on a special edition of
NBC's ``Meet the Press'' and CNN's ``Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign chairman Bill Daley, who led the debate
negotiations for the vice president, praised the progress in the
debate talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good because the American people want to hear from
these people in formal settings that give them the opportunity to
express what they will do as the next president of the United
States,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides will return Friday to hash out other details,
including the exact format of the 90-minute debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the governor has
been pressing for a more ``unstructured free-flowing format.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said that the Bush campaign had agreed to accept the
commission's dates and times with the expectation that they would
win concessions on format.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Boston debate, the presidential candidates will meet
at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., on Oct. 11 and at
Washington University in St. Louis on Oct. 17. The
vice-presidential debate between Democrat Joseph Lieberman and
Republican Dick Cheney will be held at Centre College in Danville,
Ky. on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement to hold the first debate at the University of
Massachusetts is particularly striking since Bush strategists had
been adamant that they did not want to meet in such a staunchly
Democratic city at a site across from the John F. Kennedy Library _
which honors the Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   But political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said the Bush campaign
has had to change strategy after a string of disappointing weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow there is a different perspective when you are 12
points ahead than when you are five or six points behind,''
Rothenberg said. ``Now Bush needs the debates. He needs as many as
he can get and needs to cross his fingers and hope they help him.''
</P>
<P>
   In a related matter, the FBI is continuing its probe of a
mysterious package of Bush debate preparation material that was
mailed to a Gore ally who was helping the Democrat prepare for the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Rep.Tom Downey immediately turned the package over
to authorities. It included a videotape of a practice debate
between Bush and Sen. Judd Gregg, playing the role of Gore. The
package was postmarked Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman, said the governor's lawyer has
examined the tape and determined that it is either the original or
copy of an authentic tape. She also said the package included
``copies of legitimate debate documents.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that the mock debate took place at the governor's ranch
in Crawford, Texas, and that only a handful of senior staff would
have had access to the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distribution was very, very small,'' she said. Those
members include Hughes, campaign manager Joe Allbaugh and advisers
Karl Rove and Mark McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said that whoever obtained it and sent it to the Gore
campaign did so ``in an unethical way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the FBI had asked to talk with members of the
campaign about the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gladly cooperating,'' she said.

HERE ARE EIGHT TV STORYLINES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Olympic Games are underway. Andres Cantor has already blown
a lung with his elongated ``Goooooooalll!'' call on U.S. soccer and
NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol was seen at a Sydney pub boasting
that Olympic fans will see what he wants and when he wants it, and
tough if they don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   These are half-truths, of course, kind of like NBC's plausibly
live coverage of the 1996 Olympics from Atlanta. The network
promises no semantics games this time, just no live coverage. That
noted once again, here are eight storylines to follow regarding the
Olympic TV coverage:
</P>
<P>
   1. NBC's ratings. The last time an Olympic Games was televised
from a time zone similar to Sydney, Australia, was NBC's coverage
of the 1988 Olympics from Seoul. Coming off a prime time Nielsen
average of 23.2 for the '84 Games in L.A., NBC was disappointed
with a 17.9 average.
</P>
<P>
   NBC promised advertisers a 17.5-to-18.0 average for the 2000
Games, which is notably modest. But with the media landscape having
changed dramatically in the last five years, much less the last 12,
it wouldn't be shocking if there was some audience erosion.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will once again hit a handful of sports hard -- swimming,
gymnastics, track and diving, with a touch of beach volleyball. It
is by design, too, that female athletes are featured in four of
those five sports, all the better to attract female viewers, who
traditionally aren't sports mad.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cable ratings. This marks the first Summer Olympics cable
coverage. In past Winter Games, cable carriers were able to earn
ratings of 3.0 for events like the bobsled, luge and ski jumping.
</P>
<P>
   This time, CNBC and MSNBC will offer full game coverage of teams
sports like baseball, water polo, softball and soccer, events that
got short-sheeted in Atlanta. But watching delayed telecasts of
team sports is anathema to most American sports fans. Will anyone
watch Mia Hamm and friends on tape if they know the soccer team won
its game?
</P>
<P>
   3. Bob Costas will wax eloquently. This is his fourth Olympics
and his third as prime time anchor host, and only Jim McKay has
ever done it better, and McKay never had to deal with 84 hours of
prime time air time.
</P>
<P>
   Costas took a few hits in Atlanta because of NBC's plausibly
live snafu, but he's always prepared and knows how to advance a
story and conduct an interview. He'll also have to play the role of
travel guide, since NBC plans a lot of Aussie beauty shots.
</P>
<P>
   4. No John Tesh. The broadcaster/composer is a very nice guy who
was out of his element as gymnastics play-by-play man four years
ago. A born gusher, he even managed to offend those viewers who
consider gymnastics an art form more than a sport. The competent Al
Trautwig replaces him.
</P>
<P>
   5. Not so dreamy. The one-sided nature of Olympic competition
since the berth of the Dream Team has led NBC to reconsider its
schedule. Of the first five games for the men's team, one will be
carried by CNBC and three will be televised in the late night
(12:41 a.m.) slot.
</P>
<P>
   6. Too close and way too personal. NBC has cut the number of
features it has prepared about 30 percent from 1996, mostly because
critics and viewers complained they got in the way of event
coverage. But even with that cut, one can expect between four and
five of them per prime time show.
</P>
<P>
   7. Programming changes. NBC has a game plan, but the network
will adjust its plans according to news value. Look for a cycling
event or two on NBC, like the road race that features Tour de
France champ Lance Armstrong, and for either of the gold medal
singles tennis games to pop up on NBC if an American, like Venus
Williams and Lindsay Davenport, gets to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   8. Goal. Andres Cantor is the Telemundo soccer announcer whose
work in Spanish on previous World Cups has earned him a cult
following. NBC hired him to do U.S. soccer games in English.
</P>
<P>
   It's not his first language, but he's more than adequate,
especially with the naturally enthusiastic Alexi Lalas as his
partner. The only question is the health of his vocal chords. The
first goal by the U.S. men's team in Wednesday's game earned four
load ``goal'' calls, a stiff pace. &QL; 
Changing channels
</P>
<P>
   Schaap at Knight: Jeremy Schaap, the son of longtime
sportswriter/sportscaster Dick Schaap, got the plum (or punk)
assignment of interviewing Bobby Knight live Tuesday night in his
first major response to his firing.
</P>
<P>
   Schaap acquitted himself nicely. Knight repeatedly would answer
a question by going off on a tangent, and Schaap repeatedly stepped
in to try and bring Knight back to the question and topic. The
ex-Indiana coach didn't like being interrupted, but Schaap's
mandate for a live interview was to keep him on topic.
</P>
<P>
   Knight obviously wanted to make his own points, like what a
great program he ran, how IU administrators never explained zero
tolerance, and how hard this was on his son, Pat. Schaap allowed
him to, but only for a short time before getting back on issue,
like how he could possibly misinterpret zero tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Nick at Knight: Nickelodeon was the only network that didn't
prepare a Knight-related show this week. The best of the bunch was
Keith Olbermann's treatment on his Sunday night ``Evening News''
show on Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann had four satellite interviews with particulars in the
case, including the sportscaster whose son was confronted by
Knight, the IU president, and an Indiana professor who has long
been a critic. One came away from the telecast having been treated
to a comprehensive look at all sides of the issue, with Olbermann
often playing devil's advocate to cover every angle of the story. &QL;

 &HT;    Texas man's persistence brings much-needed well to his Sudanese
homelandBy Mark Lisheron

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The unquenchable loyalty of an Austin man to his
family and friends is bringing fresh water to a village in northern
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Awad Abdelgadir persuaded Rotary International to donate the
bulk of $42,000 to build a water system for his ancestral village
of Kolomiseed, on the west bank of the Nile River about 200 miles
south of the Egyptian border.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the well and pipes that will bring pure water to
about 3,000 people is expected to start within the next month.
</P>
<P>
   Abdelgadir raised $6,000 by forming a company, Nile Valley Herbs
Inc. The company has sold Sudanese hibiscus mint tea for five years
to stores such as Whole Foods and Central Market in Austin and San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel privileged to work with Awad on this project to bring a
much needed well to his people in the Sudan,'' said Jason Osborn,
matching grants coordinator for Rotary International in Evanston,
Ill.
</P>
<P>
   From the time he left the Sudan 13 years ago, Abdelgadir has
devoted himself to the betterment of life in a village that draws
its drinking water directly from the Nile.
</P>
<P>
   Abdelgadir came to Austin for the similar climate and to get a
master's degree in education, which he received in 1990 from
Southwest Texas State University. His birthdate, Jan. 1, 1954, was
given to him by the U.S. government because he and the people of
his village do not concern themselves with those anniversaries,
Abdelgadir says.
</P>
<P>
   While teaching Arabic culture and language sporadically in
independent school districts and most recently Arabic language at
the University of Texas, Abdelgadir began devising ways to help
Kolomiseed.
</P>
<P>
   With the help and encouragement of a local group, Expanding
Cultural Horizons and Options, Abdelgadir raised money to install
solar panels to light and cool the village's community center.
</P>
<P>
   Next, in about 1995, he offered his old adobe home in the
village for expansion and renovation for a new school. Abdelgadir
returned to Kolomiseed and directed volunteer laborers from the
village and completed the 11-room school for about $6,000, most of
it raised through donations in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   His most ambitious project, to combat disease by providing a
safe water source for the village, required Abdelgadir to generate
more money than he could earn as a teacher. His inability to find
his favorite hibiscus-mint tea and the burgeoning market for herbal
beverages and remedies in Austin convinced him to start Nile Valley
Herbs.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Abdelgadir joined the South Austin Rotary Club. He
says the club embraced the water project with his pledge to raise
some of the money himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a combination of sales of tea, which have been good,
and donations through ECHO at local restaurants, we were able to
raise $6,000,'' Abdelgadir says. ``South Austin Rotary offered to
raise $18,000 and Rotary International agreed to match it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush on Thursday withdrew all his objections to a
bipartisan commission's debate schedule, agreeing to three
90-minute prime-time encounters with Vice President Al Gore next
month on college campuses in Boston, Winston-Salem, N.C., and St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, announced after a four-hour meeting in Washington
of top officials of the Bush and Gore campaigns and representatives
of the Commission on Presidential Debates, means that Bush and Gore
will debate under all the original conditions laid out months ago
by the panel, which has organized the nationally televised forums
in every presidential election since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The accord amounted to a wholesale retreat by the Bush campaign
from its efforts over the last two weeks to impose its own
schedule, moving some of the debates from campuses to television
studios, shortening them from 90 minutes to 60 minutes, and
designating moderators like Larry King and Tim Russert.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, in the face of mounting criticism from fellow
Republicans and a growing sense that the issue was becoming a
distraction, aides to Bush announced they were dropping the plans
to seek an alternative series of debates. But they continued to
insist they were opposed to aspects of the commission plan, like
staging the first debate in Boston, near the John F. Kennedy
Library, because it commemorated a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Bush campaign conceded even those points. Under
the agreement, the candidates are to meet at the University of
Massachusetts in Boston on Oct. 3; Wake Forest University in
Winston-Salem on Oct. 11 and Washington University in St. Louis on
Oct. 17. The vice-presidential contenders are to debate for 90
minutes at Centre College in Danville, Ky., on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The terms, precisely those the commission spelled out when it
unveiled the debate locations in January, were accepted months ago
by the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major thing is that the debate debate is over,'' said Paul
G. Kirk Jr., the former head of the Democratic Party who is
co-chairman of the debate commission. Kirk told reporters after the
meeting, which was held in the offices of the panel's legal
counsel, that the session had been without rancor. But he added
that ``some things we were not flexible on,'' like the notion of
moving any of the sites of the debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's four and a half hours in a long campaign,'' Kirk said,
referring to the length of the three presidential debates. ``And we
didn't think it was asking too much,'' he said, ``particularly at a
time when the electorate is paying more attention than they have
been in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides professed to be pleased with the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have agreed to the sites; we have agreed to the times,''
Donald L. Evans, Bush's campaign chairman, said. ``The governor is
very eager to debate. He is looking forward to a free-flowing,
substantive, real and genuine discussion of all the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   William M. Daley, the chairman of Gore's campaign, concurred.
``This is good because the American people want to hear from these
people in formal settings that give them the opportunity to express
what they will do as the next president of the United States,''
Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Bush officials sought to portray the outcome as less than
a setback, saying they were pleased that the commission was still
considering the kind of informal formats for the debates Bush had
sought. Karen P. Hughes, Bush's communications director, said the
governor had always thought the public would be better served by
more casual discussions than by ``the canned and stilted formats
that have been the case in past presidential debates.'' About
Bush's pledge to participate in three debates, she added, ``He has
kept his commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some political professionals wondered whether the Bush
campaign had badly miscalculated by offering a counterproposal and
trying to make it appear that Gore was the reluctant debater when
he refused to agree to Bush's terms. The Bush campaign even ran a
television commercial taunting the vice president on the issue
after Bush unveiled his debate plan on Sept. 3. In addition to
60-minute debates of CNN's ``Larry King Live'' and ``Meet the Press
on NBC,'' the Bush plan called for participation in one commission
forum, in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really does raise questions about the tactics here,'' said
a Democratic official. ``Who in the world was going to think that
Al Gore does not want to have debates?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who attended the meeting said it was not
contentious at all. In fact, they said, the two sides had agreed
quickly to the items that had been the subject of the dispute, like
the locations and lengths of the debates.
</P>
<P>
   What consumed most of the session, they said, was working out
the details; for instance, the question of how members of the
audience might be chosen if a town-meeting arrangement were used
for one of the debates.
</P>
<P>
   The formats and moderators for the debates are still up in the
air, though it was agreed that there will be one moderator for each
forum, participants said. Kirk said he believed that many of the
remaining issues could be resolved over the next day or two.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The resolution came as a relief not only to the commission, but
also to the hosts of the debates. One of the panel's central
missions is to involve young people in the process, and that is why
the debates have come to be held on college campuses. This year's
sites were chosen from dozens of colleges and universities that had
submitted proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic that we'll be the first presidential debate for
2000,'' said Annemarie Lewis-Kerwin, a spokeswoman for the
University of Massachusetts in Boston, the site to which the Bush
campaign raised its most serious objections.
</P>
<P>
   The school has had to raise about $2 million from corporate
sponsors and the state Legislature to stage the event, Lewis-Kerwin
said, and it had already spent about $300,000 when Bush's proposed
a plan that threatened to scuttle the Boston debate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the commission's guidelines, formal invitations are to be
sent to the candidates several days before each debate. To qualify,
a candidate must have on the date of invitation the support of an
average of at least 15 percent of those polled in five national
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   This standard has been criticized by Ralph Nader and Pat
Buchanan, third-party candidates who say the threshold is
impossible for them to meet. Many political observers say that
third-party candidates could hope to register that level in the
polls only after an appearance on a nationally televised debate.
</P>
<P>
   Jamin B. Raskin, a professor of constitutional law at American
University who represented Ross Perot in 1996 in an unsuccessful
effort to be included in the presidential debates, said a less
arbitrary standard would be 5 percent, the threshold required by
federal law for a candidate to qualify for public funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The co-chairmen of the Commission on Presidential Debates go
around saying they are not in the business of propping up
third-party candidates,'' Raskin said. ``They're in the business of
killing third-party candidates.''

DEBATE PRACTICE VIDEO STOLEN, BUSH AIDES HINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ A video tape of George W. Bush participating in
a mock debate must have been stolen from his campaign by an
intruder, then mailed to the Gore campaign, Bush aides intimated
Thursday, all but ruling out the possibility that the leak of the
debate materials was an inside job.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Bush campaign reviewed the video tape for the
first time Thursday and confirmed it was authentic. The tape shows
Bush debating Senator Judd Gregg, the New Hampshire Republican who
has been playing the role of vice president Al Gore in practice
sessions. It was received in the mail by former New York
Congressman Tom Downey and turned over to the FBI on Wednesday,
touching off a wave of conspiracy theories about who was
responsible for the security breach.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, the communications director for Bush, Thursday
dismissed concerns the leaked tape and the xeroxed briefing book
that accompanied it might give Gore an unfair competitive edge, and
said the Gore campaign had handled the incident in ``an appropriate
fashion.'' Downey, who has playing the role of Bush in debate prep
with Gore, said that after opening the anonymous package, he viewed
only 60 to 90 seconds of the tape before realizing it was in the
wrong hands and shutting it off.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been practicing for a showdown with Gore since May, and
has twice flown Gregg to his ranch in Crawford, Texas to stage mock
debates. The tape in question shows one of those sessions, Hughes
said, although she did not know exactly when it was made. At the
same time, the papers mailed with the tape appeared to be xeroxed
copies of ``legitimate debate preparation'' materials, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is now being investigated and it's clear that whoever
obtained it did so in an unethical way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate tape whodunnit, unfolding as negotiations over the
presidential debate schedule came to a head in Washington, lead to
a flurry of speculation in both campaigns, with some Democrats even
venturing that the material, which was postmarked in Austin, Texas,
was sent by a Bush campaign insider. By Thursday, the mystery was
in the hands of FBI investigators, who asked to interview members
of both campaigns. The Austin police are not involved, despite
statements Thursday by Bush officals suggesting the tape was
illegally obtained from the campaign office there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the very most senior members of our team are people who
would have had legitimate access to one of our debate tapes,''
Hughes said, ``The distribution was very, very, very small.''
</P>
<P>
   The other advisers with access to the tapes are campaign manager
Joe Allbaugh, senior political stratagist Karl Rove and chief media
advisor Mark McKinnon. It was unclear whether the tapes were kept
under lock and key, but aides said the firm which made them,
Maverick Media, kept a meticulous log of who had access to the
tapes and who had possession of them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the campaign was questioning employees of Maverick
or it's own staff, Hughes said, ``I don't really think there's any
need for an internal investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Downey has decided to end his involvement in Gore
debate preparations to avoid any appearance of unfairness.

CLINTON TO VISIT VIETNAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Ariz., Neb.)   By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House said Thursday that President
Clinton would visit Vietnam shortly after the November elections,
becoming the first president to step onto Vietnamese soil since the
end of the war that took 58,000 American lives, and completing a
reconciliation with the Communist government that has unfolded over
the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   In what may well turn out to be the last and one of the most
dramatic foreign trips of his presidency, Clinton will make a state
visit to Hanoi, the country's capital, which has been almost
entirely rebuilt since U.S. aircraft once conducted daily bombing
runs.
</P>
<P>
   But the trip will also take him through cities and countryside
that were burned into the American consciousness more than a
generation ago _ Ho Chi Minh City, formerly known as Saigon, and
some locations in the country's center, where much of the heaviest
fighting took place, perhaps including Hue or the port of Da Nang.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan to visit Vietnam has been widely discussed at the
White House for months. But his chief of staff, John Podesta, and
aides to Vice President Gore all said that the visit could not
occur until after the election was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too fraught with complex issues,'' one of Clinton's
top advisers said recently, recalling the accusations in the 1992
presidential campaign that Clinton dodged the draft while at Oxford
University in England. ``Gore's people, understandably, did not
want reminders of Clinton's past distracting from the messages of
the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   So 25 years after the last U.S. helicopter completed a panicked
evacuation from Saigon, Clinton will spend some of his waning
moments as commander in chief in the country that defined the
political crises of his youth. Clinton will likely strike the
themes he has when visiting other one-time U.S. adversaries:
Talking about using trade as an instrument of democratization, and
perhaps declaring that the two countries have found more common
ground as the imperatives of economic globalization have
overshadowed the divisions of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said that the
agenda of the trip will include commerce, the search for the bodies
of American soldiers who are still listed as missing in action, and
studies of the effects of the Agent Orange defoliant that was used
throughout the war. But, he added, the real importance of the trip
was the arrival of an American president on what was once enemy
soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just very much symbolic value in the president
visiting and going actually to visit the country,'' Lockhart said.
Under the current plan Clinton will not visit neighboring Cambodia,
whose suffering began during what its people called ``the American
war'' to differentiate it from so many conflicts that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional reaction reflected the divisions about Vietnam
that linger to this day. Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., and longtime
critic of Clinton, snapped: ``He should have gone 30 years ago.`
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton was applauded Thursday by the Republican and
Democratic veterans of the Vietnam War who provided Clinton with
political cover as he lifted the embargo on the country in 1994,
restored diplomatic relations in 1995 and concluded a broad trade
deal two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who spent 5 1/2 years as a prisoner
of war in the jail that became known as the ``Hanoi Hilton'' _ a
spot Clinton will constantly be circling in central Hanoi _ said
the president was making the right move. But he added, ``I
respectfully declined the president's invitation to join the trip
because I was just there in April and see no need to go back so
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., called the end of Clinton's term ``an
appropriate time in the history between our two countries for an
American president to visit Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said: ``The president has been very
brave on Vietnam. He's led and done the right thing. God bless him
for going.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will append the trip to his last summit meeting with
Asian leaders, which this year will take place in tiny, oil-rich
Brunei on Nov. 15 and 16. He will stay in Vietnam for ``several
days,'' a senior official said Thursday. ``We want to give him a
lot of opportunity to visit with the Vietnamese people,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   During the Vietnam War, President Johnson and then President
Nixon visited the country. Johnson went twice, to see troops
stationed at Cam Ranh Bay in October 1966 and December 1967. Nixon
met with the South Vietnamese president, Nguyen Van Thieu, in
Saigon in July 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnamese leaders have asked Clinton to come for many years,
starting when Warren Christopher, then the secretary of state,
arrived in Hanoi in the summer of 1995 to open diplomatic
relations.
</P>
<P>
   But the movement gathered steam this summer when, after five
years, the two countries concluded a trade agreement. It must still
be approved by Congress, with the vote probably next year, after
which Vietnam would receive ``normal trade status,'' meaning it can
export its products to the United States under favorable terms.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Veterans' groups are also largely in favor of the trip, though
officials of some organizations, including the American Legion,
have expressed fears that Clinton's economic message will drown out
his remembrances of the U.S. casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are happy that the president is visiting Vietnam,'' said
Scott Campbell, a spokesman for the Vietnam Veterans of America.
``His highest priority _ regarding our organization _ is bringing
closure to POW-MIA issues.''

</P>
<P>
   Actor Jon Cryer and his writing-producing partner, Richard
Schenkman, have &QL;
</P>
<P>
   followed up their first movie, ``The Pompatus of Love,'' with
``Went to Coney Island on a Mission From God ... Be Back By Five.''
The new film proves they have a talent for unusual-sounding titles,
if little else.
</P>
<P>
   The new film is, obviously, a New York buddy comedy, complete
with ironic voice-over narration, gritty yet unmistakably
nostalgia-tinged growing-up reveries and a whole lot of arrested
development. The movie itself tries to be street smart yet
ingratiating, specifically observant yet universally relatable, but
in the process it mostly displays arrested artistry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an annoying inability to clearly express his thoughts,
Cryer's Daniel is the storyteller and best-adjusted adult of the
film's central trio, even though he works a nowhere-bound, pawnshop
assistant gig alongside a sort-of girlfriend whom he tries to
impress with his nice guy but business unsavvy generosity. He's a
pillar of maturity, however, compared to Stan (newcomer Rick
Stear), his boyhood best friend. A self-destructive gambler and
ambition-deficient alcoholic, Stan's problems are simplistically
traced back to a childhood operation that left him in a leg brace.
Despite his unreliability, though, Stan has a good, long-devoted
gal, Ione Skye's Gabby, whom the idiot refuses to commit to.
</P>
<P>
   One winter day, Stan characteristically slacks off from his
pizza parlor job, grabs Daniel and heads out to the Brooklyn beach
on the title holy quest. Seems he's gotten wind that their
long-lost friend Richie (Rafael Baez) has been spotted among the
homeless living under the boardwalk and has gone totally nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Stan and Daniel spend the chilly afternoon searching the nearly
empty carnival grounds, meeting a few off-season eccentrics (Frank
Whaley has a nice bit as the world's most irritating skee-ball
clerk), reminiscing and reluctantly facing the fact that their own
lives have taken terribly wrong turns.
</P>
<P>
   With dialogue that's often too cute to ring honestly or
eloquently, let alone rattle or move, and epiphanies that are so
predictable from the start that they make the friends seem like
dolts for not realizing them sooner, ``Mission'' strenuously tries
but never succeeds in making us care about its wayward
protagonists. The ``colorful'' Coney characters, who include a
cranky waitress and a dramatizing gay couple, aren't very
interesting either. And Richie's big, mind-altering secret manages
to be both trite and florid, not to mention beside the point once
the full extent of his condition is revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Toss in some of the murkiest, ugliest cinematography ever lensed
and a muddy sound mix, and you've got a feature film that indicates
this team's future lies in creating title sequences. &QL;

   ENHANCED TUBE: Blame it on Regis, ``Survivor'' and all your
rowdy friends at ``Monday Night Football.'' Some 25 million U.S.
households log on to the Internet while they're watching
television, a 39 percent increase from last year, says a study
commissioned by Showtime Networks. Bottom line: Internet/TV
multitaskers could be ready for even more enhanced TV. In recent
weeks, TBS has put its Wednesday night lineup on the interactive
map; CBS has inked a deal with WebTV to augment dramas, comedies
and other Eye Network shows; and the just-wrapped Emmy Awards were
interactive for the first time. The study found that news, sitcoms
and sports accounted for nearly all the simultaneous viewing. Also:
Viewers are brewing homemade enhanced TV, getting content from

   BY GEORGE: The diaries of the original George ``Dubya'' _
Washington _ go online today. The Library of Congress is posting
2,300 personal logs the Founding Father kept since age 16.
Included: bedbug encounters, farm woes and entries that The Weather
Channel would love (e.g., the snowy conditions on Dec. 13, 1799,
the day before his death). A rare look inward came on April 16,
1789, after his election as president: ``About 10 o'clock I bade
adieu to Mount Vernon, to private life and to domestic felicity;
and with a mind oppressed with more anxious and painful sensations
than I have words to express, set out for New York . . . with the
best disposition to render service to my country in obedience to
its call, but with less hope of answering its expectations.''

</P>
<P>
   Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami has been lauded by cineastes
as one of the &QL;
</P>
<P>
   world's greatest filmmakers, a visionary whose minimalist,
painterly style represents cinema at its purest. ``The Wind Will
Carry Us'' will undoubtedly play to this audience, but newcomers to
Kiarostami's work may scratch their heads and wonder what all the
noise is about. This is a movie that takes the director's
anti-narrative ideas to the extreme; even Hercule Poirot would have
a difficult time solving the puzzle of a plot.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even to general audiences, the film has much to
recommend. As with all of Kiarostami's work, the movie is gorgeous
and full of perfectly composed shots that turn the Iranian
countryside into a land of poetic beauty. The pace is glacial, but
ideally calibrated to the story (yes, there is one) and message
that Kiarostami wants to impart.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens on a winding dirt road in an almost otherworldly
corner of sun-baked Iran. The landscape, particularly with its
towering lone tree, will be familiar to anyone who saw Kiarostami's
last film, ``Taste of Cherry,'' as will the general obliqueness of
what is to follow.
</P>
<P>
   A group of men are taking that winding road to go to Siah Dareh,
a tiny Kurdish village that is nestled, pueblo-style, into the
mountains. Throughout the film, we only meet one of the men, a
character known only as the ``engineer'' (Behzad Dourani). These
men seem to have come to the village to witness a local mourning
ceremony; in order for that to happen, an old woman must die. But
that seemingly certain death doesn't happen. If anything, the
100-year-old woman seems to improving in health.
</P>
<P>
   While he waits, the engineer explores the amazing village where
form beautifully follows function. He befriends a young boy, Farzad
(played, like all the other villagers, by actual inhabitants of
Siah Dareh) in order to obtain updates on the old woman's
condition. He talks to the locals, drinks tea and waits.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer's daily routine is frequently interrupted by calls
to his cell phone. In order to establish a clear connection and
answer the calls, he must drive up to the local hillside. This
becomes the film's ritual; the engineer must make the trip a dozen
times during the film. After he answers the calls (which come from
a mysterious Mrs. Godazi, who always asks about the old woman's
health), the engineer engages in metaphysical conversations with an
unseen ditch digger.
</P>
<P>
   And that's about it. The film's denouement comes slowly, but
come it does, and it's more or less stated by an old doctor, who
tells the impatient engineer that ``death is what happens when you
close your eyes to the world.'' And that's what the engineer, with
his set agendas and rut-like approach to life, has been doing.
</P>
<P>
   It's a modest message contained in a beautiful film. Just don't
go expecting something profound. &QL;

`BAIT' HOOKS SOME HUMOR, BUT IT'S CONTRIVED

<P>
   With ``Bait,'' Jamie Foxx fades back somewhat from his
startlingly powerful &QL;
</P>
<P>
   dramatic work in ``Any Given Sunday.'' An overproduced action-
comedy that isn't particularly bad but not in any way exceptional,
the film neither gives Foxx much opportunity to break out
comedically nor toplumb the serious chops he proved he had in
Oliver Stone's football headbanger.
</P>
<P>
   Foxx gives a likable, versatile enough performance here, but
he's required to do too much running -- and faces too much
competition from director Antoine Fuqua's overcharged, empty
stylistic flourishes -- to have much left for the energized,
inventive performance bits he's capable of.
</P>
<P>
   The film's complicated, derivative script doesn't help matters
much either. Sort of an ``Enemy of the State'' rehash run through a
conceptual blender with assorted, interchangeable Eddie Murphy and
Martin Lawrence movie formulas, ``Bait'' is your basic nice
criminal stops real bad guy thing, tricked-out but not very well
thought-out.
</P>
<P>
   Foxx's Alvin Sanders is the pathetically petty thief who gets
busted for stealing shrimp (``Prawns,'' he insists, like that
somehow makes it manlier) the same night two high-tech burglars
knock over the U.S. Treasury's Manhattan gold reserve -- and leave
two dead guards.
</P>
<P>
   A falling out among the thieves leads to one of them making off
with the whole $42 million in bullion and successfully stashing it
before being busted. In a holding cell with Alvin, he imparts
cryptic clues to the swag's whereabouts before having a heart
attack. All of this mightily consternates the ruthless T-man
Clenteen (David Morse), who wants both the goods and revenge for
his murdered colleagues, in no particular order of preference.
</P>
<P>
   This is all a setup. Eighteen months later, Alvin is
unexpectedly released from prison. He doesn't know that Clenteen
has engineered the whole thing, and has also implanted audio bugs
and satellite tracking devices in his jaw. Following Alvin's every
movement and word from a control room that looks like a leftover
``Men in Black'' set, the feds figure that the unknown, super
computer whiz behind the gold heist will come after Alvin, too.
They're right; but the evil genius Bristol (``Green Mile'' weasel
Doug Hutchison, who here steals every mannerism there is to take
from John Malkovich) has a way of using the government's own
technology against it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there's the wild card behavior of Alvin to
contend with. Trouble is, it's not wild enough. Though unsuspecting
and, by Clenteen's reckoning, expendable, the recidivistically
inclined Alvin is primarily interested in salvaging his pre-prison
relationship with Lisa (Kimberly Elise) and being a good father to
the baby boy he didn't know they had. Sure, he has a few schemes
going, and the feds' increasingly desperate efforts to keep Alvin
out of trouble until Bristol bites are mildly amusing, but overall,
the guy's rapidly expanding sense of responsibility squelches the
potential for gut-busting laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the whole constant surveillance angle's comic
possibilities get trampled in the film's headlong rush toward
contrived action climaxes. The workaholic eavesdroppers get a
little turned-on when Alvin and Lisa finally, um, reconcile, but
not much is done with the concept beyond that obvious gag.
</P>
<P>
   For all his music video flashmastering, Fuqua does keep the
convoluted storytelling as clear as it can get and moves things
along at a brisk pace. That's good in some ways, but ``Bait''
probably would have been better with a little less plotting and
more leisure time for Foxx and his friends to really develop
memorable moments. &QL;

   The Hollywood Bowl has attracted some Very Important Performers
over the years, but one of its headliners this weekend surely is
some kind of coup. Composer Sergei Rachmaninoff will ``perform''
the second movement of his Piano Concerto No. 2 backed by the
Hollywood Bowl Orchestra -- 57 years after his death. From 1919 to
1928 Rachmaninoff made piano rolls of his own pieces on equipment
that used electrical impulses to capture the pianist's keystrokes,
velocities, pedalwork and other nuances. His 1919 rendition of the
No. 2 concerto will be brought to life on a Yamaha disklavier.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood Bowl program -- its ``almost-end-of-season''
fireworks finale -- also includes the still very lively Debbie
Reynolds and, in their Bowl debuts, actor B.D. Wong and eclectic
band Pink Martini. Reynolds isn't announcing her musical selections
yet, but Wong's set includes ``Half as Big as Life'' from Burt
Bachrach's ``Promises, Promises'' and ``The Impossible Dream'' from
``Man of La Mancha.'' Pink Martini plans to perform Maurice Ravel's
``Bolero,'' which made movie history in ``10.''
</P>
<P>
   The shows will end with a big bang to the tune of ``Hooray for
Hollywood.'' Showtime is 8:30 p.m. tonight and Saturday, and 7:30
p.m. Sunday. Tickets range from $3 to $85 and are available at the
Bowl box office, at Ticketmaster outlets or by calling (213)
480-3232, or online at www.hollywoodbowl.org. For more information,
call (323) 850-2000.

Our rating: 3 1/2 stars

</P>
<P>
   It's hard to decide which is more impressive: the storytelling
daring of the &QL;
</P>
<P>
   unique new movie ``Urbania'' or the fact that first-time feature
director Jon Shear made such a rich, compelling work with an
experimental process, in a mere 18 days and for only $225,000.
</P>
<P>
   Guess both achievements are about equal. Especially since, like
all good films, ``Urbania's'' form and content are intricately,
happily married in the most intimate ways.
</P>
<P>
   The film's protagonist, Charlie (Dan Futterman of TV's ``Judging
Amy''), is not married, but he's obviously upset about it in the
most intricately intimate ways. Clearly depressed about a
mysteriously lost lover (Matt Keeslar), he wanders Greenwich
Village, visiting former gay friends and rivals, testing out a
pickup or two (they don't work out), behaving with increasing
obnoxiousness and obsessing over Samuel Bell's Dean, some rough
trade type whom Charlie's seen on the street but (or so he says)
has never spoken to.
</P>
<P>
   All of the issues the superficially mild-mannered Charlie is
wrestling with come very slowly into rapier-sharp focus. This is
partially because ``Urbania'' is a multipronged mystery, equal
parts whodunit (and who done what?) and psychological thriller. But
for a story that works some very dire themes indeed, the picture is
also unusually playful. Based on co-screenwriter Daniel Reitz's
play ``Urban Folk Tales,'' the film is constantly inserting
recitations and even stagings of those woo-woo myths into the path
of Charlie's mysterious quest.
</P>
<P>
   So we see some women seduce a guy only to drug him and steal a
kidney, a wet poodle gets microwaved, etc., usually in concert with
somebody insisting ``This one really happened.'' What Shear and
Reitz seem to be aiming for here is the creation of a whole new
urban legend, one that viscerally responds to the evil of
gay-bashing in something a bit more enlightened than kind.
</P>
<P>
   Shear, whose background is in stage acting (both he and
Futterman were in ``Angels in America''), juggles the film's
goofy/angry tonal shifts adroitly, even if his slightly surreal,
sometimes mystical presentation of the material gets too tricky for
anyone's good at times.
</P>
<P>
   The fast cutting that many of these effects require, however, is
astoundingly well-done, and was achieved by editing the film
footage, which was shot on easily damaged Super 16, digitally.
``Urbania'' is the first film since the last ``Star Wars'' episode
to be edited this way, and it's great to see that the process can
even more effectively explore the knottiest human motives than some
fantasy world far, far away. &QL;

ALL ABOUT HARRY POTTER IN ONE BOOK
</HEADLINE>
  For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By NANCY HEWITT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   cc,78p3 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just in case you are one of the folks not overly saturated with
Harry Potter, &QL;
</P>
<P>
   a book devoted to the idiosyncrasies of the young character and
his adventures is hitting the market today.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural edition of ``Beacham's Sourcebooks for Teaching
Young Adult Fiction'' focuses on the delightful character brought
to life in the four J.K. Rowling books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exploring Harry Potter,'' by historian and children's literary
expert Elizabeth D. Schafer, is a 478-page compendium of everything
you could ever want to know about Harry Potter, and more.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer admits to be being a Harry Potter fan. ``I read them
(the first four volumes) the first time for fun,'' she recalls.
``Then I discovered how rich they are. I really got into them.''
</P>
<P>
   And getting into them meant lots of research on things such as
alchemy, history, mythology, literature and other subjects
referenced in the novels.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer maintains that the Harry Potter books appeal to all
ages. ``Harry is a moral mentor,'' she says. ``He teaches kids to
help others. The books help with school work, with ways of
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Harry Potter books are so popular, it (this book) will
help kids realize that all of literature has these themes,''
Schafer says.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer also shares references and parallels to legends, fairy
tales and more. For example, there is a lightning bolt branded on
Harry's forehead that has a mythical origin. The lightning bolt is
a symbol of the Greek god Zeus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another feature of Schafer's book is discovering the origins
and meanings of Rowling's clever character names. For example,
Argus Filch, Hogwart's caretaker, is named after a mythic Greek
watchman who was covered with eyes. Then there is Hedwig, Harry's
snowy white owl, that is named for a medieval saint.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer is working on a source book based on L. Frank Baum's Oz
books. The second volume of the Beacham series is being done by
another author, and it will focus on C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of
Narnia series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beacham's Sourcebooks for Teaching Young Adult Fiction:
Exploring Harry Potter'' is available beginning today at local
booksellers or online at www.beachampublishing.com. Suggested
retail price of the book is $24.95. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Acceptance and friendship &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Young sleuths Christopher, Korina and Alex go searching for a
number of pets that have mysteriously disappeared. While on the
trail, they discover that they may have misjudged people they have
seen in a negative light in ``The Puzzle Club Pet-Napping
Mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   During the program, parents will be given a toll-free phone
number to call where they can obtain a free copy of the storybook
``The Puzzle Club Pet-Napping Mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   The program airs at 11:30 a.m. Sunday on KCOP (Channel 13). &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Attention designers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you are in kindergarten through sixth grade, then the folks
at Puffs Facial Tissues are interested in seeing what you can draw!
</P>
<P>
   The company is sponsoring a contest called ``What I Like Best
About School.'' Kids across the country are being asked to
illustrate any aspect of school they like and submit it to win
prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Each entry must be on an 8 1/2 by 11-inch sheet of paper. The
child's name, address and grade at time of entry must be hand
printed on the back of the design. A second sheet of paper should
include the child's complete name, address and phone number; the
school's name and complete address and child's grade at time of
entry. This entry must also be hand printed.
</P>
<P>
   The grand prize winner will receive a $25,000 savings bond for
college, a Gateway personal computer, a digital camera for his or
her classroom, as well as having his or her artwork displayed on
store shelves across the United States on boxes of Puffs Facial
Tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Three first place winners from each grade category _
kindergarten and first, second through fourth, and fifth and sixth
_ will receive Gateway personal computers. All winners will receive
a year's supply of Puffs Facial Tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Mail entries to: Puffs Back-to-School Design Contest, P.O. Box

 &HT;    Ceremonies celebrate Australia
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Today's Opening Ceremonies of the 27th Olympiad are a
celebration of the fantastical Australian landscape and a
procession of the athletes who've journeyed from around the world
to compete.
</P>
<P>
   With a cast of 12,700, performing on the 4 1/2-acre floor of the
Olympic Stadium for a global audience of about 4 billion, it's a
show that seems as big as the continent itself. The theatrical
first half combines elements of Cirque du Soleil, the films of
Busby Berkley and a canned score that runs the gamut _ candy-coated
pop, classical warhorses, even house music. There's a narrative,
albeit a loose one, that might remind you of ``The Nutcracker.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for these elliptical descriptions is that the press
has been sworn to secrecy, but after seeing a Wednesday night dress
rehearsal, we can report that the show meets all expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The final revelation, of course, is the lighting of the caldron.
Who will do it? And how? Some names on the short list have been
Dawn Fraser, the former swimmer who won a chest of medals for
Australia, and Betty Cuthbert, another home-grown champion.
Cuthbert suffers from multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the U.S. Olympic Committee announced that sprint
kayaker Cliff Meidl will be the flagbearer for the American team.
For the first time in history, the teams of North and South Korea
will march behind a single flag. Chelsea Clinton, who was a big fan
of the Atlanta Games, will attend the ceremony. This is a
production that has been handled with politically correct gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not this show captures the soul of Australia is an
open question, one that will be exhaustively debated over the next
few days.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the 2,000-member marching band, which includes kids
from Fayette County and around the world, it's an all-Aussie
entertainment lineup. Olivia Newton-John is the one face Americans
may recognize. She'll do a duet with John Farnham called ``Dare to
Dream.'' Tina Arena will sing ``The Flame,'' and Vanessa Amorosi
will perform ``Heroes Live Forever.'' These are all new songs, and
they will be recorded on a commemorative CD.
</P>
<P>
   You can bet there won't be any references to the nation's
penal-colony origins or kangaroos. To some degree, the Aboriginal
myth of dreaming _ which refers to the bridge of time that brought
them across the water _ is a springboard for the beautiful and
evocative opening fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the parade of athletes and some of the requisite
pomp and circumstance, will be the time when most of the world
visits the loo.

 &HT;    Games sponsors aren't guaranteed winners
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can you beat the market by investing in companies that sponsor
the Olympic Games, companies with global visibility and world-class
products? Yes. And no.
</P>
<P>
   Two of six big Georgia-based companies that spent big bucks on
the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta are well ahead of the market as
the 2000 summer games begin in Sydney. Scientific-Atlanta and Home
Depot have posted big, market-beating gains since the Atlanta games
ended on Aug. 4, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in the other four are up, but well below the 95.4 percent
rise in the Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500's rise of 124.3 percent and the 249.2 percent increase in the
high-tech Nasdaq composite.
</P>
<P>
   One Georgia-based sponsor, United Parcel Service, was not
publicly traded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A check of 10 other large 1996 sponsors found only one
market-beater _ International Business Machines, which is up 364.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The shares of three 1996 sponsors have declined: Xerox, by 40
percent, Eastman Kodak by 18 percent and Bausch &AMP; Lomb by 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say if there is a connection between the Olympics and
the stock market, it's something bigger than the Games themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have conjectured that the intensive media coverage
associated with the Olympics ought to benefit the stocks of
sponsoring companies, not to mention the added visibility of their
products.
</P>
<P>
   That idea prompted analysts at Robinson-Humphrey to cite the
Olympics as a potential factor in their 1996 investment forecast,
which said, ``The spotlight shines on the Southeast in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bloomberg News put together an Olympics index in 1996,
consisting of 24 companies that paid $40 million apiece to sponsor
the games. Bloomberg didn't duplicate the effort this year.
</P>
<P>
   The connection between the Olympics and the market is probably
indirect. If the sponsors' shares do well over time, it's because
only successful companies with strong track records have the kind
of money to be an Olympic sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Olympics is not big enough to change Wall Street's
ways, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   If there should have been a clear winner from the 1996 games, it
was Coca-Cola, which bought $60 million worth of commercial TV time
and was most closely associated with Atlanta and the Games.
</P>
<P>
   But Coca-Cola is not, and its problems have nothing to do with
the Olympics.

2 ECONOMISTS GIVE COST OF GUN VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Pa., Fla.)   By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gun violence costs Americans $100 billion a year, according to a
new book by two economists that is the first effort to make a
comprehensive estimate of the price the nation pays for criminal
shootings, gun accidents and suicides committed with guns.
</P>
<P>
   In arriving at that figure, the authors, Philip J. Cook of Duke
University and Jens Ludwig of Georgetown University, departed from
earlier approaches that looked only at costs like the medical
expense of treating gunshot wounds and the lost productivity of
gunshot victims. Those are only a small part of the real total, the
authors say.
</P>
<P>
   The much larger price, they say, involves ``the devastating
emotional costs experienced by relatives and friends of gunshot
victims, and the fear and general reduction in quality of life that
the threat of gun violence imposes on everyone in America,
including people who are not victimized.'' These include all manner
of costs, from the time lost waiting in line at airports to pass
through metal detectors, to the difference between actual property
values in violent neighborhoods and what those values would be if
there was no gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   In their book, ``Gun Violence: The Real Costs,'' to be published
next month by Oxford University Press, Cook and Ludwig applied a
method widely accepted by economists as a way of determining
hard-to-measure intangible costs. This method, known as contingent
valuation, asks people how much they would pay to avoid a problem.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationally representative telephone survey, 1,200 people
were asked how much they would pay per year to reduce criminal
gunshot injuries. The authors applied the results to the nation's
entire population to reach a figure of $80 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As for accidental shootings and gun suicides, the authors drew
on previous studies of losses in the workplace and on jury awards
to determine the statistical value of life and the costs of
nonfatal injuries. That sum came to $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The total, then, for criminal shootings (including murders),
accidental shootings and gun suicides is $100 billion, the authors
said.
</P>
<P>
   Their calculation was applauded by a number of economists,
criminologists and gun control advocates, who said it showed that
the cost was much larger than previously realized and therefore
should be given greater weight in debates over public policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One might quibble with the figure, since the question of how
much people would pay to avoid gun violence is hard to know,'' said
Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University,
``but it is very helpful to have two skilled economists try to
figure out how large the cost of gun violence really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Diaz, a senior policy analyst with the anti-handgun Violence
Policy Center in Washington, said, ``The gun industry offloads
tremendous costs onto people who don't use its products, like a
polluter dumping on a city, so it's good to force people to realize
what these costs are.''
</P>
<P>
   But the study was criticized by scholars who maintain that guns
contribute to public safety, and by gun industry officials, as
being too hypothetical and ignoring firearms' benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at
Florida State University, who is well known among gun enthusiasts
for his estimate that guns are used 2.5 million times a year in
self-defense in the United States, said the new study was ``too
hypothetical and too reliant on subjective judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is also a hopeless task,'' Kleck said. ``You are faced with
an unknowable problem: What is human life worth?''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Delfay, president of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, the gun industry's main trade association, said the
authors had failed to count guns' benefits, like their use by the
police to stop crime or by civilians in self-defense. The book,
Delfay said, ``is misleading, like looking at the costs of auto
accidents without measuring the benefits of cars.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush on Thursday withdrew all his objections to a
bipartisan commission's debate schedule, agreeing to three
90-minute prime-time encounters with Vice President Al Gore next
month on college campuses in Boston, Winston-Salem, N.C., and St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, announced after a four-hour meeting in Washington
of top officials of the Bush and Gore campaigns and representatives
of the Commission on Presidential Debates, means that Bush and Gore
will debate under all the original conditions laid out months ago
by the panel, which has organized the nationally televised forums
in every presidential election since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The accord amounted to a wholesale retreat by the Bush campaign
from its efforts over the last two weeks to impose its own
schedule, moving some of the debates from campuses to television
studios, shortening some of them from 90 minutes to 60 minutes, and
designating moderators like Larry King and Tim Russert.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, in the face of mounting criticism from fellow
Republicans and a growing sense that the issue was becoming a
distraction, aides to Bush announced they were dropping the plans
to seek an alternative series of debates. But they continued to
insist they were opposed to aspects of the commission plan, like
staging the first debate in Boston, near the John F. Kennedy
Library, because it commemorated a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Bush campaign conceded even those points. Under
the agreement, the candidates are to meet at the University of
Massachusetts in Boston on Oct. 3; Wake Forest University in
Winston-Salem on Oct. 11 and Washington University in St. Louis on
Oct. 17. The vice-presidential contenders are to debate for 90
minutes at Centre College in Danville, Ky., on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The terms, precisely those the commission spelled out when it
unveiled the debate locations in January, were accepted months ago
by the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major thing is that the debate debate is over,'' said Paul
G. Kirk Jr., the former head of the Democratic Party who is
co-chairman of the debate commission. Kirk told reporters after the
meeting, which was held in the offices of the panel's legal
counsel, that the session had been without rancor. But he added
that ``some things we were not flexible on,'' like the notion of
moving any of the sites of the debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's four and a half hours in a long campaign,'' Kirk said,
referring to the length of the three presidential debates. ``And we
didn't think it was asking too much,'' he said, ``particularly at a
time when the electorate is paying more attention than they have
been in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides professed to be pleased with the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have agreed to the sites; we have agreed to the times,''
Donald L. Evans, Bush's campaign chairman, said. ``The governor is
very eager to debate. He is looking forward to a free-flowing,
substantive, real and genuine discussion of all the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   William M. Daley, the chairman of Gore's campaign, concurred.
``This is good because the American people want to hear from these
people in formal settings that give them the opportunity to express
what they will do as the next president of the United States,''
Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Bush officials sought to portray the outcome as less than
a setback, saying they were pleased that the commission was still
considering the kind of informal formats for the debates Bush had
sought. Karen P. Hughes, Bush's communications director, said the
governor had always thought the public would be better served by
more casual discussions than by ``the canned and stilted formats
that have been the case in past presidential debates.'' About
Bush's pledge to participate in three debates, she added, ``He has
kept his commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some political professionals wondered whether the Bush
campaign had badly miscalculated by offering a counterproposal and
trying to make it appear that Gore was the reluctant debater when
he refused to agree to Bush's terms. The Bush campaign even ran a
television commercial taunting the vice president on the issue
after Bush unveiled his debate plan on Sept. 3. In addition to
60-minute debates of CNN's ``Larry King Live'' and ``Meet the Press
on NBC,'' the Bush plan called for participation in one commission
forum, in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really does raise questions about the tactics here,'' said
a Democratic official. ``Who in the world was going to think that
Al Gore does not want to have debates?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who attended the meeting said it was not
contentious at all. In fact, they said, the two sides had agreed
quickly to the items that had been the subject of the dispute, like
the locations and lengths of the debates.
</P>
<P>
   What consumed most of the session, they said, was working out
the details; for instance, the question of how members of the
audience might be chosen if a town-meeting arrangement were used
for one of the debates.
</P>
<P>
   The formats and moderators for the debates are still up in the
air, though it was agreed that there will be one moderator for each
forum, participants said. Kirk said he believed that many of the
remaining issues could be resolved over the next day or two.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The resolution came as a relief not only to the commission, but
also to the hosts of the debates. One of the panel's central
missions is to involve young people in the process, and that is why
the debates have come to be held on college campuses. This year's
sites were chosen from dozens of colleges and universities that had
submitted proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic that we'll be the first presidential debate for
2000,'' said Annemarie Lewis-Kerwin, a spokeswoman for the
University of Massachusetts in Boston, the site to which the Bush
campaign raised its most serious objections.
</P>
<P>
   The school has had to raise about $2 million from corporate
sponsors and the state Legislature to stage the event, Lewis-Kerwin
said, and it had already spent about $300,000 when Bush's proposed
a plan that threatened to scuttle the Boston debate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the commission's guidelines, formal invitations are to be
sent to the candidates several days before each debate. To qualify,
a candidate must have on the date of invitation the support of an
average of at least 15 percent of those polled in five national
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   This standard has been criticized by Ralph Nader and Pat
Buchanan, third-party candidates who say the threshold is
impossible for them to meet. Many political observers say that
third-party candidates could hope to register that level in the
polls only after an appearance on a nationally televised debate.
</P>
<P>
   Jamin B. Raskin, a professor of constitutional law at American
University who represented Ross Perot in 1996 in an unsuccessful
effort to be included in the presidential debates, said a less
arbitrary standard would be 5 percent, the threshold required by
federal law for a candidate to qualify for public funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The co-chairmen of the Commission on Presidential Debates go
around saying they are not in the business of propping up
third-party candidates,'' Raskin said. ``They're in the business of
killing third-party candidates.''

   RUSSIA: ECONOMY BRIGHTENS
</P>
<P>
   A healthier economy, lucrative oil exports and more effective
tax collection increased government revenues for the first half of
2000 to their highest level since the collapse of the Soviet Union,
Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said. The government said it took
in $18.3 billion, nearly two-thirds of its anticipated revenue for
the entire year, and predicted a further increase in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: RIGHTISTS BANNED
</P>
<P>
   The government banned the far-right group Blood and Honor for
spreading neo-Nazi propaganda and breaching the Constitution. Its
so-called White Youth wing was also outlawed. ``Germany is the
first nation to fight this organization this way,'' Interior
Minister Otto Schily said. The group, which was founded in Britain
and spread to Germany in 1994, has ties to the larger far-right
German National Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY: CARDINAL CALLED RACIST
</P>
<P>
   A leading cardinal has set off a political furor by suggesting
that Italy favor Catholic immigrants over Muslims to ``preserve the
identity of the nation.'' Many center-left government ministers
condemned Cardinal Giacomo Biffi's pastoral letter to his Bologna
archdiocese as dangerous and racist. But some center-right
politicians agreed with his proposal and the opposition leader
Silvio Berlusconi said the cardinal's ideas ``were deemed worthy of
attention.''

   CANADA: TORY CHIEF QUITS
</P>
<P>
   In the latest blow to Canada's shrinking Tory party, the party
president resigned, only two days after two Tory members of
Parliament defected to the Liberals. Peter Van Loan, a Toronto
lawyer was an effective fund raiser, and his loss will hurt the
heavily indebted party.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: CHARGED IN MURDERS
</P>
<P>
   The accused leader of one of Mexico's most powerful drug cartels
was charged in a United States federal indictment in El Paso,
Texas, with 10 counts of murder, including the killings of seven
people whose bodies were found last fall on ranches near Juarez.
Justice Department officials believe Vicente Carillo Fuentes, who
is a fugitive, ordered the murders to silence those who might have
given information to law enforcement agents.

   ISRAEL: MISSILE SYSTEM TESTED
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Arrow II antiballistic missile system was successfully
tested, intercepting a simulated missile similar to the Scuds fired
at Israel in the gulf war in 1991, the defense ministry said. It
was the seventh of eight tests that proved successful for the
system, which is heavily financed by the United States.

   The opposition Movement for Democratic Change said four party
officials were detained after its offices were raided by police
officers who said they were conducting an investigation into a
grenade blast this week outside the party's headquarters. No one
was hurt in the explosion, and the officers and intelligence agents
arrived at the offices with warrants allowing them to search for
firearms and explosives. They apparently found none.

   A Swiss aid group said it bought the freedom of 4,435 slaves in
southern Sudan this month, bringing the total freed to 38,000.
Christian Solidarity International has been criticized by the

captors to seize more people. The group said it paid $33 for each
slave.

THE GAMES WITHIN THE SYDNEY GAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Well, let the Olympic fun begin, along with
the doping, the scalping, the ghastly boxing decisions, the
politically-motivated gymnastic scoring, the shameless corporate
shilling and whatever shenanigans Juan Antonio Samaranch and his
IOC minions dispense during the next 16 days.
</P>
<P>
   The 11,000 participating athletes will go through that garish
flag-waving show of international solidarity tonight the
globalization wonks hyperventilate over the opening ceremonies at
the 110,000-seat Stadium Australia.
</P>
<P>
   And then Saturday the volleyballs and softballs and arrows and
shuttlecocks and handballs and even swords and live ammunition will
be employed by those hardy souls attempting to earn gold medals for
themselves in the upcoming days.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there will be jocks in subsequent days who will
depend more on their speed do I hear Marion Jones, Maurice Greene
and Michael Johnson? or leaping ability what about Vince Carter and
Kevin Garnett? or durability how about Morroco's incredible
distance runner Hicham El Guerrouj? when pursuing their artistry.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure what will happen during the remainder of
this month, except it's as much of a certainty as Juan Antonio
Samaranch dissembling during press conferences that some athletes
from countries you've never heard of and some from countries you
have will be kicked out of the Olympics for failing drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, for sure, the American basketball team will win the gold,
and I'm willing to bet anyone a princely sum that Venus Williams
and Serena Williams will do the same in tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, none of the 60,000 people expected to descend on this
picturesque city or even the 100,000 expected to come from other
parts of Australia will be able to bet on any event unless they're
able to find an illegal bookmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The myriad TAB (Totalizer Agency Board) sports book outlets
around town, which usually take action on everything including NFL
games will not be posting lines on any Olympic events.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will cost us millions,'' said one of the clerks at the
sports book at Star City, the biggest casino in town. ``The
decision came down from the government a couple of weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it's in the hallowed IOC by-laws that legalized
gambling on the Games is forbidden in the host city.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Juan Antonio Samaranch, Generalissimo Franco's old
crony in Spain whose IOC organization is such a beacon of
righteousness, went bananas, demanding that SOCOG (Sydney
Organizing Committee of the Games) pressure the Australian
politicians into keeping his beloved Games pure and honest.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the fact that two members of Samaranch's Olympic family
earlier in the week were refused entry into this country because of
their ties to organized crime, or that many of Samaranch's top
aides have been accused of accepting bribes, or that most of his
media session Thursday was centered around the rampant corruption
allegedly afflicting his organization.
</P>
<P>
   No way Samaranch would want his sterling event polluted by
tourists easily able to lay bets on the outcome of that
much-anticipated 400-meter duel at least it is around here between
national idol Cathy Freeman and France's Marie-Jose Perec.
</P>
<P>
   And so TAB was forbidden by the Australian government recently
to post Olympic bets an easy chore since TAB is a government agency
and Samaranch will at least not have to worry about gambling
scandals being added to all the other IOC scandals. ...
</P>
<P>
   --In the grand and glorious history of Olympic press
conferences, the one staged by Juan Antonio Samaranch Thursday
might ranks as the most camp. The arrogant, pretentious Juan
Antonio affected the comically-serious aura of a Third World
dictator shorn of his raiment.
</P>
<P>
   Before it even started, his earphones weren't operating,
creating pure havoc at the podium as aides frantically scurried
around trying to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Once they did, Samaranch went into a spiel so tedious and
meaningless I momentarily swore I was listening to Dennis Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must never forget that the athletes are an important part
of the International Olympics,'' was one of Samaranch's more
cornball statements.
</P>
<P>
   But not nearly as important as Samaranch's mighty organization,
which pockets untold millions from the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time for the international press to start grilling
Samaranch about the IOC's recent spate of unsavory incidents, he
either would respond he didn't understand the question and his PR
toady hurriedly would go on to the next interrogator or he would
give a vague answer that made no sense.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, who takes himself seriously, too seriously, was
visibly agitated by the negative tone of the journalists.
</P>
<P>
   But, as they say, he'll be laughing all the way to the bank, or
wherever he's been stuffing all those IOC profits. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how successful the Sydney Olympics will be 1.2
million tickets remained unsold as of Wednesday but I do know the
thousands of volunteers are the friendliest and nicest and most
helpful I've ever been around at any major athletic event. ...
</P>
<P>
   --It's a pleasure to be in a city where there are almost no SUVs
disrupting the scene. ...
</P>
<P>
   --The 18-hour time change it'll be Saturday morning here when
you read this conspires to make the jet lag lag far too long. ...
</P>
<P>
   --I know anything can happen Hicham El Guerrouj tripped over
himself in the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 and finished last in the
1,500 meters but Marion Jones should be the dominant figure in
these Games. ...
</P>
<P>
   Unless she trips over herself. ...
</P>
<P>
   --I still can't get accustomed to calling Tom Lasorda manager of
the U.S. Olympic team instead of manager of the Los Angeles
Dodgers. ...
</P>
<P>
   --With its beautiful harbors and coves and inlets and beaches,
Sydney reminds me of a cross between Seattle and San Francisco,
with a large pinch of Southern California. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Isn't it only fitting that they stuck the media in a sprawling
compound that once was Sydney's largest mental hospital? ...
</P>
<P>
   --San Fernando Valley public relations mogul Steve Brener is
here for the duration spreading propaganda for Speedo. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Venerable boxing PR guy Bill ``Bozo'' Caplan arrives next week
to hustle amateur fighters for promoter Bob Arum. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Jerry &AMP; Karen West of Bel Air will attend the Games. In case
you're wondering, West once worked for the Lakers. ...
</P>
<P>
   --The Australia team's top big man is Luc Longley, which means
the Australia team isn't destined to unseat the Americans. ...
</P>
<P>
   --OK, there has to be an unfriendly Aussie somewhere, or at
least one who doesn't smile. It's just I haven't yet come across
such a person.

THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE OLYMPICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Let the 27th Summer Games begin! But first,
a full disclosure: Like Helen Hunt, I'm mad about the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   I can completely understand why the distinguished actress made
the procurement of tickets to events at the Sydney Games a
condition for her signing on in 1998 for one more season of the
sitcom ``Mad About You'' (The show aired on NBC, remember, the
official network of the 2000 Summer Games).
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics are as good as it gets in sports. Where else can
you see 10 years of training come down to 10 seconds on the track?
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kidd in the stands rooting for Lenny Krayzelburg?
</P>
<P>
   North and South Koreans marching behind a single (albeit
neutral) flag?
</P>
<P>
   Opening Ceremonies singer Olivia Newton John and Olympic torch
bearer Greg Norman playing second fiddle to an echidna, a platypus
and a kookaburra?
</P>
<P>
   I'm addicted to the Olympics because you don't have to be a
sports junkie to get high off them. The first time the Star
Spangled Banner is cuedis when it usually hits me, or when I see an
athlete who has overcome untold hardships take his or her place
among the world's best.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rush I can't get from any other sporting event. The
Olympics arethe World Cup, the Final Four, the Kentucky Derby and
the Academy Awards all rolled into one heart-stopping,
chest-thumping, flag-waving, tear-shedding, dream-weaving drama.
</P>
<P>
   They are harder to hate than a puppy and harder to kill than
puppy love.
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows we've done our darnedest to make the Olympics seem
undesirable. We've been shameless meddlers, making the Games bigger
and more unwieldy.
</P>
<P>
   We've turned the Summer edition into a 17-day infomercial for
the official sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   We've bribed greedy blueboods to bring the Games to our
backyards.
</P>
<P>
   We've looked the other way while a good many of our Olympians
have become amateur pharmacists and professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much we muddle things, though, the human spirit
somehow keeps kicking human nature's butt. Every four years the
athletes sweep inand rescue the Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   This year they'll do it in 11,000 ways.
</P>
<P>
   Understand: The next fortnight does not belong to Cuban high
jumper Javier Sotomayor and Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey, who
are competing here despite having failed drug tests for cocaine and
steroids, respectively. These Games are not about the roughly three
dozen athletes who failedpre-Olympics drug tests or any who may
test dirty here.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to sit back and admire Cuban boxer Felix Savon,
who reportedly turned down $10 million from promoter Don King to
fight Mike Tyson. He preferred to remain an amateur and represent
his country because, as he explained, ``money is not everything.
There is no morebeautiful family than the country where you are
born and that's why I'll never stop loving my flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to be inspired by British rower Steve Redgrave
and U.S.swimmer Gary Hall Jr., both of whom battle diabetes and yet
can count seven Olympics and eight medals (six of them gold)
between them.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to be moved to tears by Manhattan Beach kayaker
Cliff Meidl, who'll carry the U.S. flag in today's Opening

jackhammer he was operating hit underground wires.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to be humbled by 10-meter air pistol shooter
Manijeh Kazemi, who has overcome constricting societal mores to
become the only woman on the 2000 Iranian Olympic team. Or American
rower Missy Ryan, who is crafting a comeback after donating a
kidney to her brother less than a month after winning a silver
medal in the 1996 Olympics in the pairs.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to take immense pleasure in the prospect of two
of the Valley's own, sprinter Marion Jones and swimmer Krayzelburg,
becoming the breakout stars of these Games (Krayzelburg has Kidd in

said he'll try to makeit to the pool to cheer on the backstroker).
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to marvel at Aleksandr Karelin, a Greco-Roman

<P>
   Now is the time to smile at the cheekiness of Aussie archer

</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to stock up on Kleenex and give idealism a

<P>
   Adam Barnes is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Or so his twin brother thought, until he switched on his
computer and fresh images of Adam flashed on the screen. Already
immersed in exploring the bizarre and purportedly paranormal via
his underground website, Freakylinks.com, Derek now must dig deeper
into the inexplicable.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the wild world of ``Freakylinks,'' a new television
series that Fox will unveil on Oct. 6. Joining Derek Barnes (Ethan
Embry) on his adventures will be webmaster Lan (Lizette Carrion),
partner Jason Tatum (Karim Prince) and Adam's former fiancee, Chloe
(Lisa Sheridan). They'll also have to deal with the creepy presence
of Vince Elsing (Dennis Christopher), a psychiatric-ward patient
who seems to know more than meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot clearly shows you that Derek will be tracking down
the mystery of his brother, and you'll have that backstory and that
lore,'' says David Simkins, the show's executive producer, whose
credits include ``The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.'' and the
sci-fi saga ``Mercy Point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll deal with that, but not as often as was originally
intended in the initial conception of the show,'' he adds. ``We'll
probably tap into those stories every four or five episodes. Those
shows will have a slightly different flavor, a more foreboding
tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other episodes will be more fun,'' Simkins says. ``There
is some comedy here. We want each episode to be just slightly
different from the one before it, so the audience is not quite sure
what they'll be getting every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Simkins' ascension to the executive producer's seat came with
enough intrigue to confound Mulder and Scully, much less Derek
Barnes. ``Blair Witch Project'' producer Gregg Hale and ``Blade''
scribe David Goyer co-created ``Freakylinks,'' which began life as
``Fearsum,'' and Tommy Thompson of ``SeaQuest DSV'' and ``Quantum
Leap'' fame started as its executive producer and day-to-day
showrunner. Fox liked the pilot and greenlit ``Freakylinks'' as a
series, but insisted on a name change and a lighter tone for
subsequent episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter, with those subsequent episodes still in the
process of being written, Thompson left the show, citing creative
differences with the network. Simkins, already a co-executive
producer, took over. A few weeks later, Fox announced that Hale and
Goyer likewise had severed their links with the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what Fox was asking for,'' Simkins says. ``I think I
do. I hope I do. No, I'm sure I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tommy's fear was that the network was asking for, in a
sense, a dumbing-down of the show,'' he says. ``I don't believe
that's true. I don't think the network would intentionally ask for
that, and I don't think that's what we are going to deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale, it should be noted, was more involved with Fox's
interactive website _ freakylinks.com _ than with the show's daily
production. And though Hale's gone, the familiar ``Blair Witch''
shaky camerawork will remain part and parcel of ``Freakylinks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got our actors walking around the sets (cameras in
hand), making their own discoveries,'' Simkins says. ``So we're
looking forward to using that immediacy of raw footage to tell a
visual story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The video aspect is completely in context with the show we're
doing,'' he adds. ``We can shoot more. We can get more coverage. We
can get deeper into the story and use that extra footage online, as
the show airs on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet aspect is freeing us up in quite a big way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line, ``Freakylinks'' is a dash of sci-fi, a touch of
horror and a dollop of the Web. It's a left turn from ``The
X-Files'' and a right turn from reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all of that,'' Simkins says. ``What we really are
focusing on is a sense of reality. These characters are us.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds so lame and everybody says that,'' he admits,
``but these guys are not professionals. They're in it because it's
interesting to them and because it's fun, and 10 times out of 10
they'll get into situations they had no idea were lurking in the
shadows. They'll just walk into stuff that can be sci-fi, that can
be supernatural, that can be of a psychic nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we want `Freakylinks' to be, it can be.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE SOUTHERN CROSS, off Gaza _ Drilling deep below the seas
off Israel and the Gaza Strip, foreign energy companies are
discovering gas reserves that could both lift the Palestinian
economy and give Israel its first taste of energy independence.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts, including those on this giant platform, say
the Palestinians and Israelis will both profit if they can work
together in a high-stakes partnership. They need each other for the
efficient development of these offshore reserves, since neither
side alone can fully afford the billion-dollar investment in
pipelines and pumping facilities that is being sketched out, the
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians and Israelis shy away from discussing a
collaboration, and territorial issues and long-lasting hostilities
could easily intrude. But both sides speak optimistically of the
potential bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is important to the Palestinian economy because we will
not be permanently dependent on foreign aid,'' said Nabil Shaath,
the Palestinian planning minister, who expects gas deposits here to
supply all local electricity needs within three years, with a lot
left over for exports.
</P>
<P>
   Yehezkeel Druckman, Israel's petroleum commissioner, who
supervises the offshore explorations from a tiny two-room office in
the Ministry of National Infrastructures, is also optimistic. He
recently calculated that Israel now has some 3 trillion to 5
trillion cubic feet of proven gas reserves. That is a tenth the
size of Egypt's reserves, which are among the world's largest. But
it is enough to supply Israel's current electricity network for 25
years, Druckman estimated. ``And there may be more,'' he said this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Systematic exploration began this year, and Israeli officials
are encouraged because already large deposits have been identified,
though the ultimate quantity _ and quality _ cannot be known until
the gas starts flowing, and many things can go awry before a
profitable production.
</P>
<P>
   But for Israel, a country that never had energy reserves of its
own, and that for political reasons has been forced to import
almost all its fuel from far beyond the Middle East, the
discoveries are stunning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israelis used to joke about how Moses wandered in the desert
for 40 years and ended up in the one place that had no energy,''
said Leonard Coburn, the ranking Middle East specialist at the
Energy Department in Washington. ``All of a sudden, they have
energy. It is an extraordinary change.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, just months after sinking its diamond-tipped bit into a gas
find near the Israeli coast, this drilling platform has moved to
anchor 19 miles off the Gaza Strip, in 1,900 feet of water, poised
to complete the first exploration project in Palestinian waters.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Southern Cross bored into the seabed here,
industry executives were confidently anticipating reserves larger
than the Palestinians can profitably absorb _ but that could
readily be sold to Israel to supplement its own newly discovered
deposits.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else are we going to do with commercial quantities of
gas?'' said Said Khoury, co-owner of Consolidated Contractors Co.,
the Palestinian minority partner in the enterprise.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Outside narrow industry circles and the upper echelons of both
governments, there is little awareness still of the scope of the
exploration or the dimensions of the projected reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government, now working on a strategy for a
long-term conversion to gas, has yet to publish its internal
estimates of its deposits, and appears reluctant to advertise its
collaboration with what could be a parallel gas bonanza for the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office declined to comment on the
issue, though Defense Ministry officials said Barak ordered the
Israeli Navy not to interfere with the Gaza drilling. On the
Palestinian side officials are also close-mouthed, declining even
to reveal the terms of their exploration agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Without recent advances in deep-water drilling and with
sonogram-like geological scanning, it would not have been
technically or financially feasible to pinpoint these deposits, say
executives at BG Group, the giant British energy company that has
an exclusive 25-year concession in Gazan waters and licenses for
another 1,500 square miles off Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it has already spent $25 million on the joint
exploration effort and will spend ``hundreds of millions'' more
within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Peering through a microscope at the first core sample unearthed
from Gaza Marine l, the geologists on board the Southern Cross
liked what they saw: distinct crystals packed just evenly and
densely enough to trap natural gas. ``Good porosity,'' pronounced
Hugh Miller, an Alabaman industry veteran who heads BG's operations
in Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, burly roustabouts wrestled fresh lengths of pipe onto
the milelong drill, now just 600 feet away from its target
reservoir of what BG believes are gas-saturated sands. ``Just like
a big Black &AMP; Decker'' drill, shouted Anthony Clark, the rig's
chief drilling engineer, as it drove deeper into the ancient
sediment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though the seas here are smooth and the weather benign, BG Group
_ the $25 billion successor to the former British Gas, with energy
ventures throughout the world _ says the politics of the operation
are as daunting as any it has ever faced.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, BG became the first big international energy company
to bid for an exploration concession in Israel's history,
effectively ending what Israelis had long denounced as a tacit
boycott of their country by the oil and gas majors. But when Yasser
Arafat, as president of the Palestinian Authority, then signed a
deal in London in November granting BG an exclusive 25-year
concession to explore for oil and gas off Gaza, the company knew it
was embarking on legally uncharted waters.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, it was not clear if there was such a thing as
Palestinian territorial waters, given the Authority's nonsovereign
status. The Oslo accords assigned the Palestinians a 20-by-20-mile
swath of sea for limited ``fishing, recreation, and economic
activity,'' but said nothing about resources beneath the
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   But by default, the Authority and BG reasoned, the area between
Egypt's eastern maritime boundary and Israel's self-identified
exploration zone was Palestinian. Though Israel could restrict
shipping off Gaza for security reasons, it never claimed economic
rights there.
</P>
<P>
   With Barak's quiet assent, BG negotiated an agreement with the
Palestinians to spend up to $500 million of its own money on
natural gas development off Gaza. Under still undisclosed terms,
the Palestinian Authority will get a share of the production and
can tax the business. (In Israel, the government collects 12.5
percent of any gas discovered, plus a 36 percent tax on profits.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to work this play as much as possible without
boundaries, because the rocks don't have boundaries,'' Miller said.
``The endgame here is to have Palestinian gas in the Israeli
market, which has to be good for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the gas business seems in better shape than the peace
process. The Israelis and Palestinians are both respecting the
unofficial division of coastal exploration rights, despite angry
objections from Israeli rightists and some local energy companies,
who are suing in Israeli courts to stop the Gaza drilling.
</P>
<P>
   But in a warning that a different Israeli government could stop
this venture cold, Danny Naveh, a leader of the opposition Likud
Party, charged that Barak could not authorize Palestinian
exploitation of what he termed ``Israeli territory'' without
parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating matters, gas has been located in at least
two large structures straddling the fuzzily demarcated line between
Israeli and Palestinian waters. The two sides must decide how to
allocate those reserves, which could have a production life of 10
to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   To efficiently develop these reserves, Israel and the
Palestinians would have to work together. Neither can afford
entirely separate plants and pipelines for pumping the gas to their
respective markets _ an investment that if undertaken jointly would
still approach $1 billion, Miller and other industry experts say.
</P>
<P>
   But the crux of this partnership, say officials on both sides,
should be a new Palestinian role as an energy supplier to Israel,
where electricity demand is 10 times greater than the Palestinians'
and growing by 7 percent yearly. In addition to Israel, Sha'ath,
the Palestinian planning minister, suggested, other potential
markets for surplus Palestinian gas include Jordan and, in time,
Turkish or European customers of a planned Egyptian pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the discoveries could provide not just energy to
Israelis and Palestinians, but fresh water, too. Natural gas would
make desalination plants an affordable adjunct to power plants
serving the densely populated Gaza and Israeli seacoast, helping to
resolve an acute potable water scarcity that is one of the region's
most difficult diplomatic and environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even with offshore gas, though, Israelis and Palestinians will
be importing oil for most of their transportation needs, experts
predict.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Palestinians, local gas would bring a welcome sense
of energy independence from Israel, which now supplies all
electricity in the Palestinian territories, at some of the region's
highest prices. The Palestinians already plan to use the offshore
gas at three new power stations they are building; the first, near
Gaza City, will be ready this year, followed by plants in Nablus
and Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will definitely save money,'' Sha'ath said.
</P>
<P>
   For the economically robust Israelis, whose gas will start
flowing first, the impact of this unexpected resource could be as
much psychological as financial.
</P>
<P>
   Because it had no choice, Israel has always relied on fuel from
far outside the Arab world: it now ships in coal from Australia,
Colombia and South Africa, and crude oil from Norway, Britain and
Mexico. Its one brief experience as an energy producer was after
the 1973 war in the occupied oil fields of the Sinai Desert, handed
back to Egypt in a 1979 treaty. Having its own gas reserves _ plus
access to nearby Palestinian deposits _ should make it easier for
Israel to buy additional gas from Egypt, which is now building a
gas pipeline to the Israeli border, analysts say. Israel's
objection to Egyptian gas was fear of dependence on a single Arab
supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Meiman, an Israeli businessman whose company proposed an
undersea piping of Egyptian gas to Israel's coastal power plants,
expects Israel and the Palestinians to develop an integrated gas
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a geostrategic interest here,'' Meiman said. ``If you
want to live in a region where people are not throwing stones at
one another, the best way of doing it is by creating mutual
dependency.''

 &HT;    Areas chied for uncontrolled growth
 &HT;    By Michael D. Pitman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASON, Ohio _ Mason and Deerfield Township are among the
nation's worst examples of uncontrolled commercial growth and
suburban sprawl, according to a Sierra Club report released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental group's members also said that additional
shopping malls proposed for the area in southern Warren County, on
the border with Hamilton County, should not be permitted because
they argue that Mason and Deerfield Township are too congested.
</P>
<P>
   A township government official responsible for development
issues disagreed with the Sierra Club's call for the development of
offices instead of retail shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Mason and Deerfield Township already have the largest
populations in the state's second-fastest growing county. The
Sierra Club report described the growth as out of control,
especially along Fields-Ertel Road. Malls planned at the two farms
on the corner of Irwin Simpson and Mason-Montgomery roads will only
worsen the congestion in the area, according to the report, ``Smart
Choices or Sprawling Growth: A 50-State Survey of Development''
</P>
<P>
   ``Smart growth development can help rejuvenate downtowns and
main streets, create transportation alternatives, build walkable
communities, protect open space, better balance jobs, shops and
housing,'' said Glen Brand, the Sierra Club's midwest conservation
organizer. ``The question now is whether we have the courage and
vision to follow through.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand said the traffic congestion on Fields-Ertel Road will move
north if the mall projects happen.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from Balance, a citizens' group whose members
want to preserve green space and control growth, and Deerfield
Township Residents for Controlled Growth, also voiced concerns
about the potential traffic problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Deerfield Township's administrator of economic development,
Dan Theno, said said the residents and the Sierra Club report make
no new arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more logical to have an upscale mall than more office
buildings,'' Theno said.
</P>
<P>
   Total population of Warren County, as of July 1,
</P>
<P>
   1999, was 153,292 _ an increase of 5 percent over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   A mall spreads out the traffic, whereas office buildings would
add to the morning traffic problems and to early evening traffic,
Theno said.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Club members said the impact of suburban sprawl like that
experienced in Warren County is higher pollution, more access roads
and highways could be needed, higher taxes, a potential threat on
area schools, and potential problems with the natural aquifer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can grow smarter,'' Brand said. ``We're not anti-growth or
anti-development. We're pro-smart growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club report includes a state-by-state description of
examples of what its members said are good and bad ways for
communities to grow. The only other Ohio city mentioned is
Cleveland, where the
</P>
<P>
   the proposed EcoVillage is intended to be an environmentally
friendly village within the larger city.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of EcoVillage's most innovative aspects is its commitment
to creating an urban oasis. Plans call for creating parks with
trails and bike routes, restoring environmentally degraded urban
habitats and enhancing open space. Residents, as well as wildlife
in the area, are sure to enjoy the tree-lined streets and plentiful
green space,'' according to the Sierra Club report.
</P>
<P>
   ``By locating housing next to an existing light-rail station,
the developers will be able to provide location-efficient
mortgages, giving homebuyers credit for reduced transportation
costs. Residents will have access via walking, biking or public
transportation to shops, markets and other resources within the
neighborhood. Many of the developments will also use passive solar
energy for heating and cooling.''

 ART NOTE: Includes two color slides of Sally Field directing
``Beautiful.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 c.2000 Ivor Davis 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Sally Field, still familiar in reruns as the bouncy star of
``Gidget'' and as the bubbly ``Flying Nun,'' isn't what comes to
mind when you hear the word ``grandmother.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, the two-time Oscar-winner is fiercely proud of the
fact that her son Peter has presented her with a 2-year-old
granddaughter _ even if, clad in a simple black dress worn with
flat shoes and a purple sweater knotted around her shoulders, she
hardly seems old enough to be a grandmother.
 &HT;    The 5-foot-2-inch actress, who will turn 54 in November, is
slender, girlish and little changed from the perpetually befuddled
teen-ager we knew way back then. But Field has grown up _ not only
to win her spurs as a dramatic actress but also to embark upon a
new chapter in her life: Sally Field, movie director.
 &HT;    Her first feature film as a director, ``Beautiful,'' will open
Sept. 29 and stars British actress Minnie Driver as the wildly
ambitious Mona Hibbard, clawing her way out of an unloving family
into the bright lights and dubious glamor of the beauty-contest
circuit.
 &HT;    She pursues her goal with such narcissistic passion that there's
no room in her world for her adorable, smart and illegitimate
daughter, Vanessa (Hallie Kate Eisenberg). Never having experienced
parental love, Mona doesn't know how to give it.
 &HT;    The tone of the film _ over-the-top satirical comedy meets
sentimental, feel-good family bonding _ would pose challenges for
any director, let alone one whose experience is limited to two
television outings: the ABC movie ``The Christmas Tree'' (1996) and
the astronauts'-wives episode of the highly acclaimed l998 HBO
series, ``From the Earth to the Moon.''
 &HT;    Field admits to having some qualms about the project, and
especially about the world of beauty pageants.
 &HT;    ``On one hand, it still seems incredible to me that in this day
and age we're still rating women on their physical appearance,''
she says. ``On the other hand, a lot of young women I talked to
while preparing to shoot this film told me that they were able to
find new opportunities in life through the pageants. They were able
to break out of impoverished backgrounds and get an education,
because the weird and wonderful and ironic part about pageants is
that they're still the largest scholastic organization for women's
education.''
 &HT;    While Field herself never marched down a runway in a swimsuit,
her experience as an actress left her knowing only too well what it
feels like to be scrutinized and judged by strangers.
 &HT;    The actress was only 18 when, in 1965, she was cast as the
boy-crazy Gidget after auditioning on a lark. The show lasted for
only a year, but she was promptly cast as the
pure-as-the-driven-snow ``Flying Nun,'' a role she played from l967
to 1970.
 &HT;    It took more than a decade for Field to convince Hollywood that
she was more than a lightweight television comedian, but she got
the job done, winning Best Actress honors for ``Norma Rae'' (l980)
and ``Places in the Heart'' (l985). She also proved that she could
handle big-screen comedy in films such as ``Steel Magnolias''
(l989) and ``Soapdish'' (l991).
 &HT;    Along the way the actress married twice and had three sons:
30-year-old Peter, 28-year-old Elijah and 12-year-old Sam. The
challenges of sustaining a family life while remaining active in
Hollywood were considerable, and Field says she brought that
experience to ``Beautiful.''
 &HT;    ``I didn't experience anything like Minnie's character in our
film,'' she says. ``but certainly the pull is something that I
completely identify with. Every working mother will tell you there
are times she'd like to pick her kids up and throw them out. Mostly
you spend your life being ripped to shreds, especially when you
support your family and you need to go out and earn a living and
also be there for your children.''
 &HT;    Field knew about single motherhood beforehand _ her mother and
father divorced when Field was 4, and her mother raised her _ so
she was glad to have her mother on hand to help out with her own
boys.
 &HT;    ``There were probably moments where I was just focused on my
work,'' she admits. ``But if any of my children needed me, that
would become the most important.''
 &HT;    Being a film actress is a plus, she says, in that it provides
all the household help that money can buy. At the same time, it's a
demanding job that takes its toll on parenthood.
 &HT;    ``You're away on location for long periods,'' she recalls, ``and
you've got to figure out how to get your children there as well as
to school. But there were long periods when I'd be at home and be
completely and utterly the mother. So I was always out of balance.
 &HT;    ``But I guess if you want balance you should join the circus.''
 &HT;    While she agrees with many of her contemporaries, 50-something
actresses who complain that the Hollywood studios' ``Boys Club''
attitude makes it tougher for actresses of a certain age to land
decent roles, she points out that it's nothing new.
 &HT;    ``It's always been harder for women,'' she says. ``If you read
Virginia Woolf's 'A Room of One's Own,' she was really talking
about women having a voice in literature. But you could certainly
apply that to women in film. A hundred years ago, women were not
allowed to have an education in this country. So would we expect
women by now to have caught up? No.
 &HT;    ``The lack of roles for women is a reverberation of history and
tradition,'' Field says. ``The movie industry tells us that
audiences aren't there for older actresses, but that's not really
true. If the product is there to bring the audience, things will
change.''
 &HT;    The actress began planning her big-screen directorial debut a
full five years ago, after having written and directed ``The
Christmas Tree.'' It took her a while, because she is still intent
on maintaining a career as an actress as well, most recently
playing Ashley Judd's biker mother in ``Where the Heart Is''
(2000).
 &HT;    This fall she'll return to the small screen to appear in six
episodes of ``ER,'' playing the estranged mother of medical student
Abby Lockhart (Maura Tierney). The producers are hoping she'll give
the show the kind of ratings boost that it got from Alan Alda's
appearance last year.
 &HT;    But the best sign that Field is happy with where she is has to
be a recent television commercial for a stock brokerage in which
she spoofs her much-maligned 1985 Oscar acceptance speech, with its
widely mimicked ``You really like me.'' Not that long ago, Field
would icily refuse to discuss that night at the Oscars.
 &HT;    ``Do you understand how tired I get of explaining this
question?'' she says, sounding a little peeved even now. But she
sips a glass of water and wades into one more round of explanation.
 &HT;    It all started with the 1980 Oscars, she says, when she won a
Best Actress award for ``Norma Rae.'' So stunned was she, so
dazzled by the magnitude of the event, that all she could do was
grab the statue, mutter some thank-yous and get offstage. She
didn't enjoy the moment at all.
 &HT;    ``It was all a blur,'' she recalls, ``like I was in a trance.''
 &HT;    Next time, she was determined, things would be different.
 &HT;    ``In this industry you face hurtful things, because of rejection
and because you just didn't do well,'' she explains, choosing her
words carefully. ``You feel those moments so acutely, and you allow
them to injure you like a bad blow. So you'd be a fool if you
weren't able to take the good, like the standing ovation. and say,
'I will feel this, goddam it, no matter how big the Academy Awards
are and how much pressure is on you to get offstage!'
 &HT;    ``So you cut to the chase, which is `I can't deny for this
moment that the work worked and you like me,''' she concludes.
``That's what it was about _ not, as it's been interpreted for
years, that somehow I thought I wasn't likable.''
 &HT;    Got it? Good, because Sally Field, actress and director, is
ready to move on.
 &HT;    And she hopes you are, too.

GOP'S ``90-10'' PROPOSAL HAS QUICK POLITICAL IMPACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas, Ariz., Mo.)   By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats deride it as a gimmick. Republicans
acknowledge that it is a Plan B fallback position from their
cherished tax cuts. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle give it
very little chance of being enacted by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet only two days after Republicans unveiled their proposal to
commit 90 percent of the budget surplus in the next fiscal year to
reducing the national debt, the plan is already having a political
and policy impact.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Clinton administration and congressional Democrats
have scorned it as an unneeded law, Democratic lawmakers are loath
to vote against it for fear of being tagged as not favoring
reduction of the national debt. On Thursday Democrats joined
Republicans in the House Ways and Means Committee to unanimously
pass a bill to implement the so-called 90-10 plan.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would require that the anticipated $198 billion
surplus in the Social Security and Medicare trust funds be applied
toward retiring the government's publicly held debt. The measure
also sets up a separate account and transfers $42 billion of the
non-Social Security and non-Medicare surplus into it. That money
would also be used for debt retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats warn that because the measure calls for such
action only for one year, Republicans will attempt to divert more
of next year's surplus into tax cuts if they gain control of the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   And they say that the Social Security and Medicare surpluses are
considered sacrosanct and in recent years have been used only for
debt reduction, and that President Clinton's spending proposals
still leave room to pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Democrats say, the Republicans' measure is not
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this bill is pretty meaningless,'' said Rep. Robert
T. Matsui, a California Democrat who is a member of the committee.
``But we know the political effort that will be made on the part of
Republicans, and we didn't want to put our members who are in
competitive races at a disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican proposal, the roughly $28 billion that
would remain in the budget after debt reduction would be used for
tax cuts or for federal spending above the budget ceilings adopted
by Congress last April. For the moment, Republican leaders envision
providing $14 billion for spending increases and $14 billion for
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans having committed themselves so publicly to
``90-10,'' congressional leaders may be less flexible in their
negotiations with the White House, which Democrats note with some
concern.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's vote in the Ways and Means Committee, the panel's
chairman, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, noted that in 1998,
Republicans, eager for Congress to adjourn so they could go home
and campaign for re-election, went along with Clinton's demands for
increased spending.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said he felt that the 90-10 plan would help Republicans
avoid caving in to Clinton _ an action that some political analysts
say hurt them at the polls. ``We're trying to make a priority to
pay down the debt and not be held hostage for more and more
spending,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Democrats say the Republicans' debt-reduction proposal
is having an effect on negotiations between the White House and
Congress on spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the White House and congressional Republicans were
only $30 million apart, talks over a $15.6 billion measure to
finance the Treasury Department, the IRS, construction of new
federal courthouses, and enhanced counterterrorism measures stalled
Friday because the bill contained a repeal of the telephone excise
tax that would cost the Treasury about $5 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority leader, said:
``The administration is saying , `Look, we got this 90-10 thing. We
don't want to sign a bill with a telephone tax repeal if we have to
commit 25 percent of what's left of the surplus into this tax cut.
There may be other tax cuts that we would prefer and there may be
other initiatives that we want.'''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans scoff at the notion that their plan caused problems
with the spending bill. They asserted that the real difficulty was
the White House's tossing up road blocks to keep Congress from
completing work on the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week it was the not-enough-money-for-the-IRS, then it was
courthouses, then it was counterterrorism,'' said Rep. Jim Kolbe,
R-Ariz. ``Now that 90-10 is on the table, suddenly it's 90-10. No
matter how many hurdles you go over, there's always one more.''
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement with the White House, Republicans brought
the measure to the House floor, bundling it with a small $2.5
billion spending measure to fund the legislative branch. The
package squeaked by on a vote of 212-209.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Congress moves to cap NASA's share of space station
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JOHN C. HENRY
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress took steps Thursday to cap NASA's share of
space station development costs at $25 billion and clear the way
for the controversial Triana satellite proposed by Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The programs are part of legislation approved by the House
outlining spending priorities and policies for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration during the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which faces a final vote in the Senate, authorizes the
space agency to spend $14.1 billion in 2001 and $14.6 billion in
2002. Both amounts are slightly higher than requested by the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The measure _ which sets policy for the agency through 2002 _ is
the first NASA reauthorization bill on which the House and Senate
have reached agreement since 1992. Since then, funding and policy
guidelines have been written year-by-year and included in annual
appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's budget for the 2001 fiscal year _ which begins Oct. 1 _
is still being debated in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sticking points in yearlong negotiations over the
authorization bill has been House Republicans' objections to NASA's
Triana Earth-observation satellite.
</P>
<P>
   As envisioned by Gore, who says the idea came to him on a
sleepness night in the late 1990s, the camera-equipped satellite
would be parked halfway to the sun and provide a real-time view of
the Earth. Images would be available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, who derided the project as an expensive
computer ``screen-saver,'' yielded to Senate negotiators and $221
million _ four times the original cost estimates _ was written into
NASA's Earth science budget.
</P>
<P>
   NASA and the White House have argued that the satellite would
provide scientists with valuable data on the Earth's climate, cloud
and wind patterns, and solar flares.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans also backed away from their outright
opposition to NASA's involvement in developing an inflatable but
rugged three-story facility, called TransHab, to house engineers
aboard the space station.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise bars NASA from using money to buy or design the
structure, but allows the agency to lease a privately developed
TransHab.
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of about $2.5 million, engineers at Johnson Space
Center south of Houston have constructed a TransHab prototype. The
agency is looking for a private-sector partner to develop and build
a larger facility for use on the space station and, someday, on
missions to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional negotiators finalized their agreement on the NASA
authorization bill Tuesday as a crew of five Americans and two
Russians prepared the space station for its first residents, who
are due to reach the orbiting outpost in November.
</P>
<P>
   The authorization bill, which cleared the House 399-17 on
Thursday, includes a $17.7 billion cap for NASA shuttle missions to
assemble the space station, which eventually will be operated by 16
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials said the limits being imposed by Congress are
not out of line. ``We can work with those numbers. We're not real
happy with them, but when we get direction from the Hill we try to
follow it,'' said Kathy Nado, of NASA's Office of Space Flight.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with unforeseen problems, lawmakers agreed to set up
contingency funds for emergencies over the next two years _ $5
billion for the space station and $3.5 billion for the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kevin Brady, R-The Woodlands, said the compromise signals
Congress's support for NASA's mission. ``We were able to overcome a
fairly difficult year that included two preventable losses of Mars
vehicles and the emotional debate that followed over NASA's
philosophy of `better, cheaper, faster''' space exploration, Brady
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the estimated cost of developing the space station was
$17.4 billion. Current estimates put the cost somewhere between $24
billion and $26 billion. NASA blames the overruns on delays by
Russia's space agency, which failed to stay on schedule for
building, then launching, the space station's service module.
</P>
<P>
   One section of the NASA authorization bill requires the agency
to obtain assurances from Russia that it puts a higher priority on
completion of the international project than on keeping its aging
Mir space station in orbit. Earlier this year, Russia diverted
three space missions _ each originally intended for the space
station _ to help keep Mir aloft.
</P>
<P>
   Government accountants estimate that the total U.S. cost of the
space station _ from initial planning during the Reagan
administration through development, assembly, occupation and the
expected 20-year life of the facility _ is expected to reach $100
billion.

U.S. WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS TEAM BRACES FOR FOR THE WORST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL OBERJUERGE  
 San Bernardino Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Bela Karolyi couldn't seem to remember
anyone's name. Which seemed fair considering U.S. Olympic Committee
officials misspelled his on the placard in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Dawes picked at her fingernails. Kristen Maloney
looked as comfortable as someone awaiting a dental procedure. Tasha
Schwikert appeared terrified. Elise Ray had that frozen,
deer-in-headlights stare. Amy Chow seemed to be wondering how she
got mixed up with this crew.
</P>
<P>
   And Palmdale's Jamie Dantzscher watched the festivities with her
sprained right ankle heavily wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Say hello, America, to your U.S. women's Sydney Olympics
gymnastics team, such as it is, presented for the media's
observation at a press conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   These are the successors to the Maginificent Seven of Atlanta,
and they have morphed into a rather motley crew of six athletes and
three coaches who appear to be bracing themselves for disaster
rather than getting ready for a victory parade.
</P>
<P>
   The team activity Thursday night?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to watch `Titanic,' &UR;  &LR; '' Dantzscher said.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Nothing like preparing for a disaster by watching one.
What's on tap Friday night, a showing of ``Armageddon''?
</P>
<P>
   We love our Olympics gymnasts. We love to watch them perform. We
love to watch them win medals.
</P>
<P>
   Would you settle for two out of three this time around?
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Miller, Kerri Strug and the gang won team gold (and a
nation's love) at Atlanta in 1996. Then they all retired, or quit
practicing. Bela Karolyi, architect of the victory, retired as
well.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. women's gymnastics fell like a stone. Or like an
amateur off the balance beam.
</P>
<P>
   The female Yanks were a distant sixth in world team competition
in both 1998 and 1999. It was after the latter disaster that the
U.S. gymnastics federation went riding down to Houston to summon
Karolyi out of retirement to see if he could scrounge up something
resembling a world-class squad in time for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Bela and the posse arrived too late, it would seem.
</P>
<P>
   If body language, palpable tension and things said and left
unsaid tell us anything about athletes on the eve of competition,
this crew is headed for the bottom of the Atlantic. Or the Tasman
Sea, in this case.
</P>
<P>
   The team is alternately too young (Schwiker), too old (Dawes,
Chow), too internationally inexperienced (Maloney, Ray) or too
nicked up (Dantzscher) to do much damage.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the women seem to think Schwiker shouldn't even be
on the team (a controversial injury replacement over the
higher-ranked Alyssa Beckerman). And team unity?
</P>
<P>
   Said Dawes, in a less-than-enthusiastic outburst: ``We all get
along, you know, fairly well.''
</P>
<P>
   United we stand. Divided, you know, we fall.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Karolyi, who could teach Don King a thing or two about
bombast, could come up with a coherent reason to like this team.
They are experienced, young, powerful, brave, eager, fresh and do
an excellent job choosing professional hair-care products.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Bela settled on ``most -balanced team,'' which in
this case seemed to mean they are equally inadequate in every area.
</P>
<P>
   If Karolyi had his druthers, Miller would be on this team.
Perhaps Dominique Moceanu, as well. But both sustained injuries
while attempting comebacks, and Dawes and Chow are the only Olympic
vets here.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan White was supposed to be here, too, but she's hurt. And
now Dantzscher has that sprained ankle she was trying to ignore
Thursday. We don't know how your sprained ankles go, but ours
usually preclude vigorous tumbling for a month or two.
</P>
<P>
   Women's gymnastics competition begins Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what to expect from this team, Karolyi was evasive.
We will fight on the mats, we will fight on the beaches, we shall
never surrender ... and if any of these girls gets a medal I'll do
a cartwheel right over the victory podium.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically? Ray has a shot in the all-around. Maloney could
medal in floor exercise if everything breaks right. And Chow has a
chance in the bars.
</P>
<P>
   Any medal would be a pleasant surprise. And by the looks of the
U.S. women's gymnastics team Thursday, they seemed to believe
``pleasant surprises'' are not on the Sydney itinerary.

<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. __ As college students around the nation began
classes earlier this month, the incoming class at Florida's 10
public universities made headlines just by showing up. In the first
year that Florida universities stopped using race as a factor in
admissions decisions, minority enrollment increased by 12 percent
for students entering the system for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, I proposed replacing traditional affirmative
action policies with race-neutral and legally defensible strategies
to expand diversity and opportunity in higher education.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, traditional affirmative action has been under
attack because it has lost public support and become legally
suspect: Ballot initiatives in California and Washington state have
eliminated affirmative action policies, and federal courts in
Georgia and Texas have ruled such practices unconstitutional as
applied to state university admissions.
</P>
<P>
   We have seen how diversity suffers in state universities where
policy-makers wait until a ballot initiative or court order
eliminates affirmative action and we know who has paid the price:
racial and ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, we saw the writing on the wall, and did not want to
be captive to ballot initiatives and court rulings.
</P>
<P>
   First, we have replaced race and ethnicity with other admissions
criteria that will promote diversity and preserve equal access to
state colleges. These include a student's socioeconomic background,
geographic diversity, and whether the student comes from a
low-performing public school or is a first-generation college
student.
</P>
<P>
   Second, we have increased capacity in the state universities so
that we can guarantee admission to every Florida student who
graduates in the top 20 percent of his or her high school class.
</P>
<P>
   Third, we have provided a 43 percent increase in need-based
financial aid, an expansion that will make our state colleges far
more accessible to low-income students.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, and perhaps most important, we are devoting
unprecedented resources and attention to our lowest performing
primary and secondary schools, where 85 percent of students are
African American, Hispanic or other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Among other changes, we are making the PSAT available free of
charge to all Florida 10th graders. We will also provide free SAT
prep courses at the lowest-performing schools, and guarantee
students at those schools access to Advance Placement coursework.
In addition, every college in the state will be required to
establish alliances with low-performing high schools to improve
achievement and college preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   This plan, called One Florida, can be a model for other states
because its goal is to transcend the increasingly tired debate
about affirmative action. We intend to prove that government can be
race-neutral in its decision-making without turning a blind eye to
equal opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   While we have moved beyond traditional policies, we have
succeeded in increasing the number of minorities enrolled in
college. In fact, the freshman class at state universities is the
most diverse in state history.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the practical benefits of such an approach are the
intangible, yet significant moral benefits that occur when
diversity is achieved with fairness. Every student entering
Florida's university system can be confident that achievement, not
skin color or ethnic background, is the measure of merit.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Is this America? To think of Wen Ho Lee in
his nine months of solitary confinement is to think not of Horatio
Alger, but of Kafka.
</P>
<P>
   Has the American dream turned into the American nightmare? We
are treated today to the pictures of Wen Ho Lee free to go fishing
but are haunted by our private visions of him shackled and alone.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not it can be proved he was a victim of racial
profiling, Lee's case dramatizes what many Americans believe to be
true: There is opportunity here, but justice? Equality before the
law? No, not for the model minority, it appears.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot know if Wen Ho Lee was singled out because of his
race. But the experience of many Asian-Americans, myself included,
is such that we would be more surprised to discover that he had not
than to learn that he had.
</P>
<P>
   We know too well the associative nature of the mainstream
imagination, which manages to link Asian-Americans of any type to
whatever Asian phenomenon might be momentarily tweaking its poor
gray noodle.
</P>
<P>
   This is sometimes funny. I once shared a stage with a former
senator who was so moved by his own account of the bravery of
Japanese-American soldiers in World War II that he turned from his
lectern and looked, dramatically, repeatedly, straight at me every
time he said ``Japanese.'' And what a moment for history it would
have been if only I had been Japanese or Japanese-American.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples are less funny: In 1982, Vincent Chin, a
Chinese-American, was murdered in Detroit by unemployed autoworkers
incensed by Japanese competition. Wen Ho Lee was assumed
sympathetic to the People's Republic of China even though he was
born and brought up in Taiwan, an island not known for its
adoration of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   We are sick of being seen as not quite American, of being
viewed, generation after generation, as guests to be welcomed _ or
not.
</P>
<P>
   The association of a Taiwan-born American citizen with mainland
espionage efforts might seem to be what Jody Armour would call
``reasonable racism'' _ but it is not reasonable, and causes real
hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Wen Ho Lee case began, the number of Asian and
Asian-American scientists applying to work in our nation's weapons
labs has declined dramatically. Many would-be applicants have
expressed fears of harassment and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is now investigating
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in response to claims of
discrimination by nine employees; the agency is also investigating
Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone can see this is unfortunate for United States defense
research. But less appreciated is the bitterness in the hearts of
the scientists involved, or of the many others seeking work
elsewhere. These were, by and large, people who believed in America
_ people who hoped to believe in it, and who deserved to believe in
it.
</P>
<P>
   Today Wen Ho Lee is free, and Asian-American advocacy groups are
flexing new muscle. In apologizing to Wen Ho Lee, Judge James
Parker displayed a courageous, refreshing, most American candor
that would be unthinkable in other parts of the world. The system
ultimately worked.
</P>
<P>
   Still this case gives us reason to raise the hue and cry. A
thorough investigation is certainly in order. Maybe the question
is: Who could most objectively mount such an investigation?
</P>
<P>
   As a friend suggested to me, perhaps in cases like this the
Justice Department should set up a citizen review board similar to
those that oversee police departments in some cities. This would be
a good first step toward restoring public confidence in our
judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   But how to restore faith in the American dream? That will take
investigations of a wider, deeper sort.

FORD CHAIRMAN DEFENDS COMPANY PRESIDENT'S MORE VISIBLE ROLE ON
TIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TIRE-RECALL) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ During his first news conference since
Bridgestone/Firestone announced the recall of 6.5 million tires
used mainly on Ford Explorers, William C. Ford Jr., Ford Motor's
chairman, Thursday defended his decision to let the company's
president, Jacques Nasser, handle all public appearances concerning
the tire problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said it was Nasser's responsibility as the head of Ford
Motor's management team to respond to the initial recall, and once
the recall became a much larger public relations and regulatory
issue it would have been confusing to change.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is the great-grandson of Henry Ford and his mother is a
daughter of Harvey Firestone, the tire maker's founder and a friend
of Henry Ford. But Ford said Thursday that his family relationships
had not prompted him to recuse himself in any way from the tire
issue.
</P>
<P>
   He was sharply critical of Firestone, which was purchased by
Bridgestone Corp. of Japan in 1988, saying that, ``It hurts to see
a family name and a family heritage tarnished so badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor also announced Thursday that it would buy back $5
billion worth of stock, and Ford defended that decision to
distribute cash to stockholders in the middle of a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said the move would not interfere with Ford Motor's
handling of the tire issue and represented a reward to shareholders
for not selling their stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is very much a tire issue, not a Ford issue,''
he said at the news conference, which was held Thursday afternoon
after Ford Motor's board had met to review the tire problems. He
spoke on a conference call with reporters instead of at Ford
Motor's briefing center, a move that made it impossible for
television cameras to film him.
</P>
<P>
   The moves by Ford Motor came as congressional investigators are
focusing on whether Ford Motor and Firestone chose too low a
pressure for the inflation of the tires _ 26 pounds per square inch
_ and whether the tires were adequately tested at that pressure
before being put on Explorers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., the chairman of the House Commerce
Subcommittee for Consumer Protection, scheduled a hearing next
Thursday morning on the companies' choice and testing of the tire
pressure. Tauzin has demanded that both companies provide all of
their test data to his subcommittee and the House Commerce
Subcommittee for Oversight and Investigation by Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   C. Tab Turner, a lawyer in Little Rock, Ark., who specializes in
tire failure and vehicle rollover cases and who has filed some of
the many lawsuits against Ford Motor and Firestone, said that he
had seen during litigation many of the Firestone test results that
Tauzin is now demanding.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled tire models suffered tread separations _ the type
of tire problem now blamed in dozens of fatal crashes _ in 600 to
700 of the roughly 1,000 tests that Firestone conducted over the
last decade, he said. Many of the tests were designed to push the
tires to their limit to determine when tread separation occurred,
but the sheer number of tests shows that Firestone suspected a
problem, he contended.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone officials did not return calls for comment Thursday
but have said repeatedly that the tire maker's safety staff only
became aware of a problem at the beginning of August, just before
the recall was announced on Aug. 9. But the company's financial
records show that the company's accountants had identified a
problem at least by 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Vaughn, a Ford Motor spokesman, said the company had
tested the tires at 26 pounds per square inch by driving Explorers
with the tires at 100 miles per hour for a distance of 200 miles on
a test track in Arizona. No problems were detected, he said. Ford
Motor proceeded Thursday with the buyback despite concerns raised
even by some Wall Street analysts that returning money now to
shareholders might be viewed as insensitive given the nearly 100
deaths linked to the failure of Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   Henry D.G. Wallace, Ford Motor's chief financial officer, said
the stock buyback represented a continuation of the company's plan,
announced last April, to distribute to shareholders $10 billion of
the automaker's cash reserves. The company set up a plan in April
to give stockholders a choice of cash or additional shares, but so
many chose the additional shares that the company only ended up
distributing $5.3 billion of the planned $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin declined to comment on the buyback. Joan Claybrook, the
president of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, said that
she was not concerned as long as the buyback did not affect the
recall.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts applauded Ford Motor's move even while noting
the awkward timing. ``You can be a little surprised they did it in
the face of the tire fiasco,'' said Ron Tadross, an analyst at
Credit Suisse First Boston. ``The tire issue is a completely
separate issue and this doesn't restrict at all Ford's ability to
deal with the recall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor shares rose 69 cents, to $25.94.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said that Ford Motor had $20 billion in cash now, so
disbursing $5 billion would have no effect on the company's
financial soundness or ability to handle the recall. William C.
Ford Jr., who took control of the company back from professional
managers when he became chairman at the beginning of last year,
also said that the tire issue would not prevent him from trying to
position Ford Motor as the auto industry's leader in safety and
environmental issues, although he acknowledged that the tire
problems had hurt that effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a flavor of the month, it's a flavor of a lifetime,
it's a flavor of a career,'' he said.

 &HT;    Old allies lament Lieberman shift
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Joe Lieberman was sharing the stage with Al Gore
last month when he joked that the way to halt his support for
school voucher programs was to elect him vice president.
</P>
<P>
   As the loyal soldier to Gore, Lieberman would follow the
president's agenda, not his own. And Gore has been an outspoken
opponent of using federal money to help pay for private schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Schwartz, the general counsel to the American Tort Reform
Association, was not joking when he made essentially the same point
on another issue Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has been the Senate's leading Democratic proponent of
efforts to limit Americans' right to sue and cap jury awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gore wins, then you get rid of him,'' Schwartz said,
lamenting Lieberman's potential exit from the Senate. ``On some
issues, maybe, Gore will listen to him, but not this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore does not favor reining in trial lawyers. In fact, trial
lawyers have contributed nearly $5 million to Gore's campaign,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the month since Democrats nominated him as their vice
presidential candidate, Lieberman has effectively silenced some
Democrats who worried about his stands on a number of key issues,
including affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman began embracing Gore's positions even before the end
of the Democratic convention. And in its aftermath, as the
Democratic ticket has risen in the polls, Lieberman has been widely
portrayed by Democrats as a boon to Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the earlier concern has been muted, if not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Face it, he's no longer so much `Joe Lieberman, the guy who
all conservatives like,' '' said David Bositis, who studies
African-American voting trends at the Joint Center for Political
and Economic Studies in Washington. ``He seems to have become more
of a populist, like Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   On affirmative action, for instance, Lieberman stood before the
Democratic convention and said he supports the ``mend it, don't end
it'' policy that President Clinton adopted in 1995 in the wake of
court decisions that said some affirmative action programs ran
afoul of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and Gore have been very reassuring about affirmative
action,'' Bositis said.
</P>
<P>
   And Lieberman's staff has worked hard to suggest to reporters
that on some of these issues, Lieberman's shift has not been
dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Gerstein, the senator's spokesman, pointed to three
instances in the past five years in which Lieberman opposed
Republican efforts to end racial preferences in federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   But days after Clinton announced the administration's position
in 1995, Lieberman said he favored ending most mandatory preference
programs. ``We have come to a different conclusion, respectfully,
than the President did,'' Lieberman said then.
</P>
<P>
   Much more recently, in the months before he vaulted to
prominence as Gore's running mate, Lieberman signed the Hyde Park
Declaration drafted by the Democratic Leadership Council, a group
of moderate Democrats that Lieberman chairs.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a call to ``resist an `identity politics' that
confers rights and entitlements on groups.'' And the document also
sets as a goal for 2010 to ``shift the emphasis of affirmative
action strategies from group preferences to economic empowerment of
all disadvantaged citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   On tort reform, Lieberman has been an unambiguous ally of
insurers and manufacturers in Senate battles over limiting
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   He has been one of a handful of Democrats to regularly join
Republicans in seeking to cap industry liability, once even voting
to shield gun makers from lawsuits by crime victims who had been
shot. Lieberman is a strong proponent of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   His support of insurance companies and their desire to limit
payouts to people who successfully sue businesses stems as much
from political philosophy as from the fact that Connecticut is home
to 36 insurance companies that employ 50,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   On this issue, Lieberman has not changed his views publicly, but
he has had little to say about it.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's shift on some issues since his selection may not be
surprising, given the necessity of falling in line with the
presidential candidate. But Schwartz said, ``There is a pattern
that saddens me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman did not come to his views on limiting lawsuits and
jury awards or on affirmative action overnight, Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   And Bositis, who supports affirmative action programs, described
Lieberman's opposition as ``principled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just view it as doing what he had to do, to the
chagrin of conservatives,'' Bositis said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman campaign media aides did not return calls for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Gore picked Lieberman, the Bush campaign and
the Republican National Committee began a steady stream of releases
that pointed up differences between the two Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans hit especially hard on school choice, personal
retirement accounts and managed care reform. On those issues,
Lieberman's rhetoric and voting record had somewhat resembled
Bush's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 31, for instance, a Bush campaign release said that
Lieberman last year ``blasted'' a Gore-supported Democratic managed
care reform bill because it allowed limitless legal assaults on
health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens up the system to the unlimited right to sue and
creates the same prospect for the lotteries that have been going on
elsewhere in the tort system,'' Lieberman said on the Senate floor,
as quoted by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on discrepancies has dissipated in recent weeks, but
Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett said it would intensify again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore's credibility is an issue. Using Joe Lieberman's
voting record is a good way to show that,'' Bartlett said. ``One
place you'll definitely see it invoked is in the debates.''

BUSH CITES NEWS ARTICLE TO RENEW ATTACK ON GORE'S FUND   RAISING 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ Gov. George W. Bush quickly turned a news
report that raised fresh questions about the propriety of Vice
President Al Gore's fund-raising efforts into a bludgeon against
Gore Thursday, saying the vice president ``may have crossed a
serious line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The appearance is really disturbing,'' Bush said in a speech
to a convention of National Guard members. His remarks about the
vice president's ethics were decidedly more forceful than his
standard fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are tired of investigations and scandals,'' Bush
added. ``And the best way to get rid of them is to elect a new
president, who will bring a new administration, who will restore
honor and dignity to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was referring to an article on Thursday in The New York
Times that reported the Justice Department had started a
preliminary investigation into the manner in which Democrats raised
money from trial lawyers in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The article noted the existence of a memorandum that suggested a
link between Democrats' solicitation of contributions from trial
lawyers and President Clinton's veto of legislation that would have
significantly curbed the size of the financial judgments that
juries can award in civil cases.
</P>
<P>
   The article also established Gore's role in nurturing the
relationship between the Democratic Party and a group of wealthy
Texas lawyers who are the subjects of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made a point of referring to the situation at his first
campaign event Thursday, the speech to the National Guard members.
Although their conference was in Atlantic City, Bush spoke to them
by satellite feed from Newport Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his speech was about the need to strengthen the
military, but Bush fashioned a transition near the end into Gore's
fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would not only ``renew the bond of trust'' between
the president and people in the military, but also ``restore the
bond of trust between the president and all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just today,'' Bush continued, ``there are new revelations
about the potential misuse of the White House for fund-raising
purposes, new evidence that my opponent may have crossed a serious
line _ solicitation of campaign contributions linked to a
presidential veto. The appearance is really disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's use _ twice _ of the word ``restore'' was a telling
measure of his eagerness, after several weeks on the defensive, to
put Gore in a similar position.
</P>
<P>
   Bush usually says that he wants to ``uphold'' the honor and
dignity of the presidency, and his occasional use of ``restore''
became the centerpiece of a news conference several weeks ago, at
which reporters noted that the latter word was much more loaded.
Bush said there was no special intent behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, said Thursday that Bush's
remarks represented ``the fact that George W. Bush and the
Republicans are resorting back to Rule No. 1 of the Republican
playbook: Attack, attack, attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's comments were desperate words from a desperate
candidate who is mired in a desperate campaign with declining poll
numbers,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   After addressing the National Guard, Bush visited a high school
in Santa Ana to talk about education, an issue that he hopes will
appeal to California voters.

ANALYSIS: 2 HEARINGS APPEAR TO HAVE PLAYED CRUCIAL ROLE IN JUDGE'S
STATEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With LEE-RELEASE-CLINTON) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Last December, Judge James A. Parker of the
Federal District Court here had two crucial encounters with John
Kelly, then the U.S. attorney for New Mexico, in hearings in the
case of Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of Parker's startling denunciation of the government's
tactics in the case, delivered on Wednesday before Lee was released
after pleading guilty to mishandling nuclear secrets, may have been
sown at those hearings. That is when, the judge appears to have
felt, he was misled by government officials driven by questionable
motives.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hearing, Kelly, who had not previously appeared in
the case, stood up in court and argued that if the judge agreed to
release Lee to home detention on bail _ something the judge was
clearly leaning toward _ the conditions would require so much time
and supervision that it would amount to the creation of a ``private
jail'' at Lee's home.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's message was clear: if Parker released Lee it would form
the basis of an appeal that would overturn the order, something
judges tend to avoid. Kelly's personal presence made it clear that
the full weight of the federal government would lie be behind any
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In the second and more important encounter, Parker met with the
two sides privately in a closed hearing. According to lawyers
familiar with the meeting, Kelly and a senior agent of the FBI,
Robert Messemer, vigorously warned the judge that enemy
intelligence agents were poised to search out and possibly capture
the nuclear secrets that Lee had improperly downloaded. They
saidthat if Lee, who they claimed had engaged in a pattern of
deceptions, were released even to closely supervised home
detention, the nation would be vulnerable to a catastrophic loss of
information.
</P>
<P>
   Parker agreed with the government and, for nine months, Lee, 60,
was held under conditions reserved for the most violent,
threatening defendants. For several months, the lights were kept on
in his cell without pause and every one of his actions was watched.
He has said he was underfed and constantly hungry. When he
exercised, one hour a day, five days a week, he was shackled. For
the one hour a week that he could meet with his wife and children,
an officer was at his side.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Parker apologized to Lee for those conditions,
said he was wrong in sending him to jail, and launched a scathing
attack on the government, and Kelly in particular, for misleading
him into making what he said was a faulty decision.
</P>
<P>
   While he criticized several aspects of the government's case,
Parker's most acid remarks focused on the lengths the prosecutors
went to keep Lee in prison. And though the judge was not specific,
previous comments he has made in the case suggest that he felt
misled to the point of betrayal by the warnings the officials made
at the closed hearing last December, which have not been previously
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tell you with great sadness that I feel I was led astray
last December by the executive branch of our government through the
Department of Justice, by its Federal Bureau of Investigation and
by the United States Attorney for the District of New Mexico, who
held office at that time,'' the judge said in court.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly resigned from his office in January, just days after the
bail hearing, and is now running for Congress from New Mexico as a
Democrat. He said in an interview on Monday that he felt the plea
agreement was a good result for the government.
</P>
<P>
   It received little notice at the time, but several weeks ago,
when Parker delivered a blow to the government and decided to
finally release Lee on bail, he took note of the fact that the
threats of enemy efforts to snatch up the nuclear secrets Lee
downloaded had proven hollow.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Parker himself asked Messemer, when he was testifying
on the witness stand, if a big increase in enemy intelligence
activity had materialized. Messemer quietly responded that it had
not. During the same hearing, Messemer also acknowledged that he
had provided misleading testimony last December in several other
critical issues.
</P>
<P>
   He had said Lee lied to a colleague to gain access to a
computer, then recanted. In addition, he had said Lee had sent
letters to a number of foreign scientific institutes seeking a job,
suggesting that Lee may have downloaded all the secrets in an
effort to enhance his job prospects. But during his latest
testimony Messemer recanted again, saying the FBI had no knowledge
that any such letters had ever been sent.
</P>
<P>
   Parker clearly had such events in mind when he read his
withering criticisms in court on Wednesday, which amounted to his
judgment and sentence of the government's actions. But one other
thing was clear, a touch of frustration that, with the criminal
case closed, there would be no further opportunities, in his
courtroom at least, to find out why the government had acted in
this way, or why it had singled out Lee.
</P>
<P>
   One of the judge's most important rulings for the defense was an
order several weeks ago that the government hand over to him a huge
volume of classified documents so he could decide whether there was
evidence that Lee had been unfairly singled out for prosecution.
The material he ordered was due this Friday, a deadline that was
lifted with the plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Parker noted Wednesday that the government's sudden change of
heart in its willingness to release Lee ``occurred shortly before
the executive branch was to have produced, for my review in camera,
a large volume of information that I previously ordered it to
produce.''
</P>
<P>
   He later said he was troubled that he did not know why the
government acted so irresponsibly, and he remarked, pointedly, ``We
will not learn why because the plea agreement shields the executive
branch from disclosing a lot of information that it was under oath
to produce that might have supplied the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker was careful to explain to Lee in his remarks the
differences between the three branches of government. What he did
not explain, but seemed to know others in Washington would
understand, is that one of the products of this distinction is
that, even though the courts no longer have the right to those
government documents, it is well within the right of Congress to
subpoena them. The judge's remarks were as close to an invitation
and road map as the Congress is likely to get.

CHINA RELEASES DETAILS OF RAPE CHARGES AGAINST LEADER OF HEALING
SECT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese officials released details Thursday
surrounding the rape charges that have been filed here against the
leader of a besieged healing sect who sneaked onto U.S. territory
in January and is seeking political asylum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The asylum request of Zhang Hongbao, founder of a large
spiritual and healing movement called Zhong Gong, has posed a
difficult choice for the U.S. immigration service. The United
States wants to foster the mutual extradition of criminals with
China, and failure to turn over Zhang _ who arrived in Guam with a
phony Chinese passport and is accused of raping some of his
followers _ would be deeply resented by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhang insists that he is a victim of political persecution
and U.S. officials know that, given Beijing's campaign to crush his
organization, he is extremely unlikely to receive a fair trial.
They also know that charges of rape or other criminal activities
have sometimes been trumped up by Chinese authorities to silence
dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang, 46, is currently in detention in Guam, awaiting the
delayed decision of an immigration court, expected to come this
month. Thursday, in an apparent effort to bolster their case,
officials here took the unusual step of providing copies to a small
number of journalists of what they said were statements by rape
victims, the victims' photographs (with eyes blacked out), arrest
warrants and other documents. These were a portion of the evidence
given to the U. S. government, a Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
   The materials were provided on condition that the alleged rape
victims not be fully identified, and that the office providing them
also be concealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to repatriate Zhang Hongbao because he broke the law,
not because of his work with Zhong Gong,'' said the official. The
crackdown on Zhong Gong and other independently organized
``qigong'' societies, devoted to the cultivation of cosmic energies
to enhance physical and moral well-being, started last year after
one such group, Falun Gong, held illegal demonstrations and then
was outlawed as an ``evil cult.''
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown in recent months of hundreds of Zhong Gong
businesses and the arrests of several leaders, the official
insisted, were because of tax fraud and other illegal business
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Zhong Gong _ its full name translates as China Health Care and
Wisdom Enhancement Practice _ is one of the largest of many groups
that arose in the last two decades using traditional concepts of
qi, or energy, in gong, or ritual exercises, to promote health and
enlightenment. Its Web site is www.ZGZG.net.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang founded Zhong Gong in 1988, four years before the start of
Falun Gong, and by the early 1990s it claimed tens of millions of
followers. Zhang was from the beginning controversial as he set
himself up as the ``master'' and made extravagant claims that his
followers could attain supernatural powers.
</P>
<P>
   As his organization and related businesses grew _ outside the
control of the Communist Party _ it clashed with local authorities
in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents provided Thursday, the authenticity of
which could not be verified, back in 1990, a Ms. Li accused Zhang
of raping her on June 26 of that year in his Beijing office, where
he had lured her for what he said would be a special healing.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1991, the materials indicate, Beijing police issued a
``notice of detention'' for Zhang. But he was never picked up,
according to the account, in part because he moved and began using
a pseudonym and forged identity documents, copies of which were
pro- vided.
</P>
<P>
   But in the ensuing years, Zhang also set up a large, well-known
healing center in Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
   The two other signed testimonies provided Thursday _ from a Ms.
Guo and a Ms. Zhang describing events that allegedly occurred in
Sichuan in 1994 _ were recorded by police only in November and
December of 1999, according to the documents. This was after the
campaign to destroy Zhong Gong was underway and Zhang Hongbao had
gone into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Guo's statement says Zhang Hongbao had her come alone into his
office , where he hugged her and ``forced me to touch and play with
his penis.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zhang alleges that Zhang Hongbao raped her in that same
location, claiming that ``men and women had to complement each
other, like Yin and Yang, to cure disease.'' Her testimony
describes features of Zhang's penis, his pubic hair and other
intimate details.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Hongbao was formally charged with rape, and a warrant was
issued for his arrest, on June 7, 2000 _ five months after he had
arrived in Guam seeking asylum.

 &HT;    Wide spreads tarnish divisional matchups
 &HT;    By Ken Seguira
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In college football, the cries would be deafening.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is St. Louis doing playing San Francisco?'' ``Why did
Jacksonville schedule a cupcake like Cincinnati?'' ``I have only
one thing to say about the Washington-Dallas game: BCS.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the NFL. Not only are these teams playing each other,
they play again later in the season because they are in the same
divisions. All three games have double-digit point spreads,
uncommon in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The consolation is that some good games are on the schedule. In
addition, the spread doesn't always hold. The two games with the
widest point spreads last week _ Kansas City-Tennessee and St.
Louis-Seattle _ both were decided by a field goal, and the Titans
won in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Three games will decide first place. Denver (1-1) will be at
rival Oakland (2-0) to decide early-season primacy in the AFC West.
In the AFC East, Buffalo and the New York Jets are 2-0 and a game
ahead of the Dolphins and the preseason favorite Colts. The NFC
Central lead is at stake in the Silverdome between Detroit and
Tampa Bay, both 2-0. The Buccaneers have lost five of six in the
Silverdome.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver-Oakland game might come down to a Broncos field-goal
attempt. The Raiders cut Joe Nedney after they drafted Sebastian
Janikowski, but they waited through preseason to let him go because
they were trying to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City was rumored to have been interested, but Nedney said
the Raiders wouldn't deal because they didn't want to trade him to
a team in the same division. So they let him go, and after Broncos
kicker Jason Elam hurt his back, Nedney joins the Broncos, also in
the same division as Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   GRUDGE MATCH: A week after Falcons coach Dan Reeves returned to
Denver, where he had his first head-coaching job, Broncos coach
Mike Shanahan goes back to Oakland, where he first was a head coach
before he was fired after a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   UPSET OPPORTUNITY: We go back to Oakland, where the Raiders have
lost four of their five games against the Broncos since moving back
from Los Angeles. The Raiders, favored by a field goal, will have
to outplay Denver by a lot to win.
</P>
<P>
   DIVISIONAL MATCHUP: San Diego will be at Kansas City in a game
both teams need desperately. The loser will fall to 0-3 and can
abandon hope for the season.
</P>
<P>
   INDIVIDUAL MATCHUP: Minnesota quarterback Daunte Culpepper ran
for three touchdowns the first week and then threw for 355 yards
last Sunday. New England coach Bill Belichick, the so-called
defensive genius, will try to work up a scheme to harness Culpepper
and his purple band.
</P>
<P>
   FANTASY PLAY: New York Giants receivers Ike Hilliard and Amani
Toomer must be drooling at the prospect of playing the Bears, who
have given up 71 points.

 &HT;    Lieberman's daughter a good campaigner
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Rebecca Lieberman has never been elected
anything, never even run for anything. But during her third day on
the campaign trail, Joseph Lieberman's second child handled the
crowd, the press and the local pols with the aplomb, of well, a
senator's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   She tackled sticky questions about her parents' divorce and her
departure from her dad's strict religious practices without so much
as a hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the risk of believing in my dad. I can tell you without a
doubt, it's warranted,'' Lieberman told an audience of mostly 18-
to-22-year-olds at Florida Atlantic University on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very personable,'' said Rhanda Wynds, a 23 year-old
business student.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personable,'' agreed Robyn Faust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, very genuine,'' said senior Marshal Klaven.
</P>
<P>
   To about 50 students, Lieberman called her father ``a good and
caring and judicious man ... who's open minded and really
listens.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, 31, stumped at the University of Florida in
Gainesville on Wednesday then swung through the Boca Raton
Elementary School Thursday morning before meeting student leaders
and local media at FAU.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with the earnestness of a grade school teacher,
Lieberman touched on health care, affordable housing and education
and managed a few jabs at what she called Bush's tax cuts for the
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview, she described her father in almost
reverential terms. He and her mother, Betty Haas, married young and
grew apart, she said.They called it quits when she was 12. After
the divorce, Rebecca and her older brother would stay at their
mother's house for half the week and their father's house the other
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still a very good packer,'' Lieberman joked. ``My parents
did an incredible job of getting divorced, which is a strange thing
to say, but they have always agreed on how to parent my brother and
I.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Lieberman said, she has her father's ear on politics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, after the Senator announced he would vote to confirm
Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, Lieberman, then 22, lobbied
him to vote against Thomas. She told him a Thomas nomination would
send a message that sexual harassment is not to be taken seriously,
according to a 1992 story in The Hartford Courant.
</P>
<P>
   When President Bush urged the senator to vote for Thomas, he
told the president of his daughter's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to say to him, 'You know it's totally plausible
that these things that she's saying happened, happened,'' Lieberman
said Thursday. ``It's inconceivable to you dad, because you're a
certain kind of man to whom these things are completely
unimaginable. But I know from being a woman in the world that every
man isn't like that...''
</P>
<P>
   The senator voted against Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who works part-time for the New York Board of
Education and lives in Manhattan, does not observe Jewish laws
nearly as rigorously as her father, whose strict observance has
made headlines ever since he joined Al Gore on the Democratic
ticket. But, she said, her father respects her choices.
</P>
<P>
   The respect has, so far at least, extended to the men she dates.
Are they a little bit intimidated when they meet the senior senator
from Connecticut?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a regular guy and he really works hard to make
people feel comfortable and I think the people I've dated have felt
that. And yeah, I think they're also a little bit intimidated.''

`STRANGERS' PUTS COMPELLING, HUMAN FACE ON HOLOCAUST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 4 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   cc,78p3 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Longtime documentarian Mark Jonathan Harris has an incredible
gift for &QL;
</P>
<P>
   illuminating aspects of the Holocaust others tend to overlook.
This was evident in his fascinating, Oscar-winning film ``The Long
Way Home,'' which chronicled the post-liberation struggles of
European Jews in the immediate aftermath of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   And Harris' new film, ``Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of
the Kindertransport,'' is arguably even more remarkable, not least
because it humanizes the subject as few documentaries have. Or
could have, quite simply because it's about one of the few
successful Holocaust rescue efforts, one that saved a good 10,000
lives to tell their tales.
</P>
<P>
   And what tales they are. As rich with complexity and ambiguity
as the human condition itself, these stories of the Kindertransport
-- the only government-sanctioned program to transfer Jews and
other Nazi-targeted individuals from prewar Germany, Austria and
Czechoslovakia to a safe haven -- uplift, of course. But the fact
that this great humanitarian gesture was so restrictive, isolated
and in its own unique way soulfully punishing to the most
vulnerable of victims is never far in the background.
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that history made this personal is the
greatest rebuttal to the lies that motivate genocide. ``Strangers''
rubs shoulders with the finest works of art about the Holocaust
that have done that.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the film was the brainchild of Deborah Oppenheimer, a
TV sitcom producer (``The Drew Carey Show'') whose mother was one
of the 10,000 saved. Though the subject was too troubling for much
family discussion, Oppenheimer was always curious and, upon her
mother's death, recruited Harris on a journey of deep historical
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   They discovered the kinder, who had taken the most incredible of
journeys themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Reich-wide Kristallnacht pogrom of November 1938,
the civilized world collectively tsk-tsk'd and did nothing, with
one exception. Outrage festered in Britain, and within a month the
government agreed to take in a large number of refugees. But the
condition for acceptance was heartbreaking: no one over the age of
17 would be admitted. Thus, parents throughout Central Europe were
faced with the agonizing decision of whether to send their children
away to strangers or keep the family together in the face of the
Nazi monster. Some found the strength to do the right, tough thing.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the kids possessed widely varying degrees of
knowledge as to why they were being transported. Some knew they
were lucky, many felt abandoned, most found themselves slung
between both emotions. In England, some were welcomed like true
sons and daughters into families they'd never met before, others
were clearly less liked by successions of foster parents, still
others were billeted in hostels that, as events churned on the
continent, mutated into orphanages.
</P>
<P>
   A few of these displaced little children actually managed to get
their relatives out of the Reich before the war commenced in
September 1939 (the invasion of Poland also put an abrupt end to
the Kindertransport). The vast majority, of course, lost all
contact with home and learned the worst years later.
</P>
<P>
   Harris has cannily chosen little-seen archival and home movie
footage from the period and goes to great lengths to give us
succinct and telling information about the overall political
situation at the time (although most nations' excuse for not
accepting Jewish refugees was some toxic mixture of endemic
anti-Semitism and late-Depression concern about job protection,
America's refusal to take in kinder was uniquely hypocritical:
congressional critics killed the bill by arguing that admitting
children without parents was contrary to the laws of God). Judi
Dench provides the tasteful, detail-rich narration.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie's glorious masterstroke is the straight-to-camera,
clear-eyed testimonies of the now elderly kinder and the even older
generation who, however imperfectly, helped them.
</P>
<P>
   The writer Lore Segal, who managed to save her mother (still
alive and also interviewed in the film), notes how she now views
her unhappy sojourns with families of different classes than the
one she'd been born into as an author's precious gift. Lory Cahn
recalls being pulled out of a Kindertransport train window by the
father who just couldn't let her go _ and the later cattle car ride
to Auschwitz he had no power to prevent. Tough old dog Alexander
Gordon describes his determination, as an especially star-crossed
teen-age orphan, to kill his emotions in order to survive -- and
acknowledges in his twilight years that his capacity for love was
the only reason fate let him live.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens more stories -- some subtler, some more dramatic, all
shot through with bittersweet irony -- makes ``Strangers'' a
knockout. It's an honestly balanced mix of triumph and tragedy, as
any true Holocaust survival story must be. But it transcends even
that, rising to some height where we can see that goodness and
difficulty and uncertainty and life are all pretty much the same
thing. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Bush brings up 1996 DNC allegation in contest of character with
Gore
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By CLAY ROBISON and PATTY REINERT
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Striving to turn the presidential race back into a contest of
character, Republican George W. Bush expressed outrage that
Democratic officials may have asked for a $100,000 campaign
contribution in 1996 from a Beaumont trial lawyer with the promise
that President Clinton would veto tort reform legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by satellite hook-up to the National Guard Association
of the United States, Bush accused his Democratic presidential
rival, Vice President Al Gore, of being involved in the
solicitation of money from attorney Walter Umphrey. While Gore had
been scheduled to make the fund-raising call, it actually was
placed by then-Democratic National Committee Chairman Don Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just today, there are new revelations about the potential
misuse of the White House for fund-raising purposes, new evidence
that my opponent may have crossed a serious line in solicitation of
campaign contributions linked to a presidential veto,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said questions about the contribution and veto are ``really
disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are tired of investigations and scandal and the best
way to get rid of them is to elect a new president who will bring a
new administration, who will restore honor and dignity to the White
House,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign has been trying to turn the election back to
Gore's character, as the vice president's surge in the polls
suggests renewed voter trust in him.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign responded that Gore was not involved in the
fund-raising incident, and that the document that raised the
questions has been available to congressional and justice
department investigators for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is old news,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane.
``Everyone agrees the vice president did not call Mr. Umphrey. What
this represents, really, is just recycled Republican attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said Bush's comment on the matter Thursday ``sounds like
a desperate candidate, with a desperate campaign using desperate
words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's reverting to the one-play Republican play book,'' Lehane
said. ``Attack, attack, attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported in Thursday editions that the DNC
had tried to use Gore in 1995 to make a fund-raising telephone call
to Umphrey at a time when tort reform legislation was pending in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would have set strict limits in both state and
federal courts on punitive damages _ the money that can be awarded
to injured parties beyond compensation for their actual losses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not talk to Umphrey, but a memo shows Fowler called
Umphrey on Dec. 15, 1995. The call sheet _ something like a script
for the caller _ suggested Fowler tell Umphrey: ``Sorry you missed
the vice president. I know (sic) will give $100K when the president
vetoes tort reform, but we really need it now. Please send ASAP if
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler told the paper he does not recall making any such
statement to Umphrey. Umphrey's lawyer, Michael Tigar, said no
contributions were made in exchange for a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation in question did not pass Congress until March
1996. It was vetoed by Clinton on May 2, 1996, almost five months
after Fowler's call.
</P>
<P>
   The Times reported that in the months after Clinton's veto,
Umphrey's firm gave $40,000 to the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before Clinton's veto, business organizations ran
television commercials in key swing states urging Clinton not to
veto the legislation. Democrats accused the business organizations
of serving as fronts for Republican Bob Dole's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The tort reform legislation, opposed by trial lawyers across the
United States, was supported by many business organizations and the
tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Umphrey's firm and four others made about $3.3 billion
representing Texas in its lawsuit against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Umphrey was controversial after the 1990 governor's race when he
put $300,000 into Democrat Ann Richards winning campaign. She later
named him to the Parks and Wildlife Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Umphrey this year has put $300,000 in to a state political
committee called the Constitutional Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   A Houston Chronicle study in 1999 found Umphrey and the other
tobacco lawyers had poured $5.7 million into Democratic political
funds since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Umphrey did not take calls from the Houston Chronicle on
Thursday. A spokesman, who asked not to be named, said Umphrey
never talked to Gore and gave no money in direct connection to
Clinton's veto.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle reporter R.G. Ratcliffe contributed to this story.

U.S. PUTS UZBEK GROUP ON ITS TERROR LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDITH MILLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has added the Islamic Movement of
Uzbekistan to its list of foreign terrorist organizations, saying
that the group has ties to the Saudi financier Osama bin Laden,
administration officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision reflects the administration's determination to
isolate groups that it believes sponsor or abet international
terrorism, especially those that American officials identify as
part of a global network sponsored by bin Laden. Last year the
United States placed bin Laden's group al Qaeda on the list,
accusing him and his organization of blowing up two American
Embassies in Africa in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Addition of the Islamic Movement to the list of 28 foreign
groups that Washington now accuses of sponsoring terrorism means
that American citizens and residents are legally barred from
contributing money or ``material support'' to the group. It also
means that Islamic Movement members can be denied visas to, or
deported from, the United States. And it enables the Treasury
Department to seize assets held by the group or its members in
American banks and financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Treasury had already asked the
nation's financial institutions to identify any assets that the
Uzbek group or its members control, though they said they doubted
that the group kept or raised money in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the designation sends a signal to other states
that the United States considers the group dangerous, hoping that
they too will try to restrict its activities.
</P>
<P>
   The agency reviews groups every two years, as required by
Congress. This is the first time, said Michael Sheehan, the State
Department's coordinator for counterterrorism, that it has not
waited for that review to add a group.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan said adding the Islamic Movement to the terrorist list
was intended to encourage it ``and all organizations to eschew
terrorism as an instrument for their political goals.'' The move,
he said, was not a signal that the United States ``is against
opposition forces to governments around the world, including
Islamic groups.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're against is their use of terrorism as an
instrument,'' he said, adding that if the group or any other stops
using terrorism, ``we will drop them from the list.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The stated goal of the Islamic Movement, a coalition of several
thousand Islamic militants from Uzbekistan and other Central Asian
states, is to overthrow the secular government in Uzbekistan and
establish a Taliban-style Islamic state there and in other former
Soviet republics of Central Asia, whose population is about 85
percent Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report on terrorism issued this summer, the State
Department called the Islamic Movement terrorist and criticized the
group for its ``anti-Western and anti-Israeli rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   One administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said there had been growing evidence in recent months that bin
Laden had been shifting his focus from the Middle East and North
Africa to Central Asia. Several of its former Soviet republics are
being de-stabilized by a resurgence of militant Islam and a
flourishing regional drug trade. The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan
has received financial support from bin Laden, American and Uzbek
officials said, as well as from groups and individuals in Pakistan,
Turkey, Saudi Arabia and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Most of its members are said to live in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan
and Afghanistan. Its recruits have been trained in bin Laden's
Afghan camps as well as in Pakistan, whose weak military government
faces its own militant Islamic pressures. Training has also taken
place in Uzbekistan's conservative Ferghana Valley, where poverty
and high unemployment have given Islamic militants considerable
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Uzbek government holds the Islamic Movement responsible for
instigating five car bombings in Tashkent in February 1999.
Uzbekistan claims that the group was trying to kill President Islam
Karimov, who has banned religious political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic Movement claimed responsibility for the fall 1999
kidnapping of four Japanese and eight Kyrgyzstanis. Last month it
also kidnapped several American hikers, but they escaped. Uzbek
officials said that in August, Islamic Movement guerrillas
operating from bases in Tajikistan staged several incursions into a
remote mountainous region on the Kyrgyz-Uzbek border. According to
unconfirmed government reports, at least 30 soldiers from both
countries were killed in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
   Sodiq Safaev, Uzbekistan's ambassador to Washington, called the
administration's decision to add the group to its list of foreign
terrorist groups ``extremely positive.'' ``It shows that these are
not freedom fighters, as they claim,'' he said, ``but skillful,
well-financed, well-trained and well-armed killers.'' Uzbekistan is
very happy, he added, that Washington ``now has a clear stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright pledged $3
million in new military assistance for Uzbekistan and a total of
nearly $10 million to help Central Asian governments fight
terrorism and narcotics trafficking. But she also called upon
governments in the region to establish greater respect for human
rights and civil liberties. The State Department's most recent
rights report calls Uzbekistan an ``authoritarian'' state whose
police officers torture prisoners.  &QL;

 &HT;    Learning to live again after Hurricane Floyd
 &HT;    By Bobby Burns
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ New brick and vinyl skins cover most of the
wooden skeletons that lined North Eastern Street after Hurricane
Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   People park their cars there every day, go inside, eat dinner
and lay down to rest.
</P>
<P>
   The muddy river that Floyd's rains swelled flows by just a
stone's throw away, oblivious to the homes it stripped and the
lives it altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stays in the back of your mind,'' said Tony Siano, an East
Carolina University student who helped dry out and refurbish the
three bedroom ranch home he owns with his parents. ``I watch the
weather in fear now. I don't want to see another hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd forever changed Siano's little neighborhood, an enclave of
15 cozy homes in Greenville's university district. The waist-high
weeds growing in front of empty shells that remain remind him and
his neighbors that recovery is far from complete. A year after the
storm hit, the people there and all over Pitt County are still
learning how to rebuild their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part was not knowing,'' said Kendall Quinn, who
rooms with Siano at 112 N. Eastern St. ``There was no planning. It
was just, 'here it is, deal with it.' I don't think anybody could
understand unless they live through it.''
</P>
<P>
   ADDING IT UP
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people in Pitt County lived through it, officials said.
The flood damaged more than 4,000 homes, offices and other
buildings here. Damage estimates countywide topped $280 million in
agricultural, public and private property losses.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,600 people, business and agencies applied for some
form of state and federal assistance for aid topping $165 million.
Church groups and nonprofit agencies pumped millions more into the
area providing clothes, food and labor. The N.C. Baptist Men
Association has mustered hundreds of volunteers to rebuild 145
houses in Grifton alone.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency shelters housed, fed or helped more than 15,000 flood
victims from Sept. 15, when Floyd hit, to Oct. 10. About 440
families have cycled through camper and mobile home sites set up by
the state to house flood victims since then. About 260 families
remain at those sites.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people who remain homeless, living with friends,
relatives, apartments or even hotels is not available. Neither is a
good accounting of how much aid has trickled into the hands of
flood victims.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of millions of dollars have, but legislative and
bureaucratic holdups on the state and federal level have stranded a
portion the aid, and only about 65 of 575 people enrolled in the
buyout process have received funds.
</P>
<P>
   If the neighborhood on North Eastern Street is a microcosm of
the county at large, flood victims have made their own recovery,
supplementing what aid they received from the government and
charity with their own cash and sweat.
</P>
<P>
   RIDING THE STORM OUT
</P>
<P>
   North Eastern Street was a place where ``you got up, you washed
your dishes, you got out, it you wanted to have lunch, you went,''
said Lillian Jenkins, who lived there 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a great place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the flood, retirees like Jenkins populated the
middle-class neighborhood along with young couples, professionals
and college students.
</P>
<P>
   Modest brick and wood homes lined both sides of the lane,
climbing south up the hill from the Tar River to Willow Street.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, whose home was closest to the river, had already left
to stay with her son when Floyd began pummeling Pitt County on
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Siano and Quinn, who lived next door to Jenkins, were enjoying
what they expected to be just another hurricane party.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, Doug Schrade, a general contractor, and his
wife cared for their newborn baby.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday afternoon, the storm had passed. Three doors up from
Schrade, newlyweds Tim and Kelley Matthews picked up sticks and
branches and raked the debris from their yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually went to bed Thursday night,'' said Matthews, a
sales representative. Neighbors pounding on their door woke them up
about midnight and the water was at their property line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got up and just started packing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Matthews and their neighbors followed similar routines.
Photos, computers, clothes, books _ anything small enough with real
or sentimental value _ went up into the attics.
</P>
<P>
   By 5 a.m. Friday the Matthews had done all they could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking it would probably flood, but I thought we'd
have more time,'' he said. ``There was no need to be in a panic,
just pack it up ... It wasn't fun by any means. What can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   One thing the neighbors could do is look out for each other.
Jenkins said Schrade helped ferry her furniture to dry land in his
fishing boat. Schrade said everyone pitched in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met a lot of people during the flood, neighbors who we
didn't normally deal with,'' he said. ``Everybody helped everybody
out. That was one of the nice things that did come out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   THE LONG ROAD HOME
</P>
<P>
   The river continued rising for five days. It crested at 29.74
feet on Sept. 21. Current rolled through nine of the 15 houses on
North Eastern Street.
</P>
<P>
   Another week passed before most of the people who lived there
could return.
</P>
<P>
   The flood drove several thousand people from their homes. Some
of them ended up in shelters, then in campers and trailers provided
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the state.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people on North Eastern had taken refuge with family
or friends.
</P>
<P>
   Siano and Quinn evacuated all the way to Raleigh. Jenkins and
her family were in a hotel because her son's home had burned the
month before.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually most of them found apartments and pondered their
options.
</P>
<P>
   All of the flooded homes were within the 100-year floodplain and
eligible for the buyout. However, the buyout takes time, and time
is money.
</P>
<P>
   Tim and Kelley Matthews had little of either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't wait,'' he said. ``We considered it (the buyout)
strongly. We couldn't just up and put a down payment on a house.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple could have tried to secure a low-interest Small
Business Administration loan and paid it off when and if the buyout
came through.
</P>
<P>
   They decided their best option was to use their flood insurance,
a small FEMA grant and rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance did not cover all the costs, he said. The policy
devalued furniture and other contents, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The grant helped make a small dent in the difference. ``Then you
just tough it out,'' Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   Schrade and the Siano family faced similar choices. They all
rebuilt. So did Frances Allen, who lives across from the Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   Three other homes sit empty, while their owners await the
buyout.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth was purchased recently by a property development
partnership that has purchased more than 20 houses in the area
since the flood.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership is repairing the homes and renting them.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins also sold to the group. She was one of the first to make
that choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw what it (the damage) was all about, I just didn't
want to have anything to do with it,'' she said. ``We just decided
to go on and get what we could get for it and get out.''
</P>
<P>
   AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   Matthews had just renovated his home prior to the flood. So they
renovated it again.
</P>
<P>
   Siano's parents wanted to keep their house so Tony's younger
brother and sister have a place to live when they attend ECU.
</P>
<P>
   Schrade moved to the top of the hill. He now rents out part of
it and uses part for an office.
</P>
<P>
   They all say the once-flooded homes are in better condition now
than they were before the Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   They hope the open green space created by the buyout will add to
the value of their homes. They are anxious for the government to
complete the process and destroy the empty homes.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of another flood concerns them, but they figure the
risk is acceptable considering the other options.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you do,'' Matthews said. ``We have flood insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins now has a brick patio home in a new development miles
away from the old neighborhood. Large windows allow sunlight to
bath her vaulted living room.
</P>
<P>
   The big, bright room contains little more than the Victorian
couch and chairs rescued by Schrade, her son and grandson.
</P>
<P>
   She had yet to spend the night there as of Tuesday. She couldn't
remember when she started moving in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you the truth, it did something to you,'' she said of
the flood. ``A lot of it I don't even remember. It feels like your
in a daze or something. I don't even know how to explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she thinks she will adjust to her new home in time,
even though she thought the one on North Eastern Street would be
her last.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be home,'' she said. ``It might be nice.
It might be new. It might be everything. But it's not going to be
home.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Amid bias, lawyers ask Clinton to give Texan on death row life
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By STEVE LASH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will review a request to spare
the life of Texas killer Juan Raul Garza in light of new Justice
Department data indicating that the federal death-penalty system is
biased against Hispanics and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But White House spokesman Joe Lockhart Thursday gave no
indication as to whether Clinton would grant Garza clemency or even
when a decision would be made, saying only that the review process
is ``now under way.''
</P>
<P>
   Garza's lawyers, in an effort to convince Clinton to spare the
killer's life, have seized on Justice Department data showing that
minorities accounted for 80.4 percent of the 682 defendants charged
with federal crimes punishable by death since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But the study, released Tuesday, also showed federal prosecutors
sought the death penalty in 38.3 percent of the cases involving a
white defendant compared to only 24.7 percent of cases involving a
black defendant and 20 percent of the cases involving a Hispanic
defendant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be fundamentally unjust, unfair and unwarranted to
carry out a death sentence that is a product of a system in which
arbitrary results are produced by long-standing racial bias and
geographic disparity,'' the defense lawyers wrote in a clemency
petition filed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the face of such profound doubts and uncertainties about
the fundamental fairness of the federal death penalty, Mr. Garza's
application for clemency should be granted.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense attorneys, Greg Wiercioch of Houston and Bruce
Gilchrist of Washington, are urging Clinton to commute Garza's
death sentence to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   If his scheduled Dec. 12 execution goes forward, Garza, 43,
would become the first federal prisoner put to death since 1963. A
Brownsville federal jury in 1993 convicted Garza, who was a major
South Texas drug dealer, of killing three associates to further his
illegal business. The Supreme Court refused to hear Garza's appeal
in November 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In the clemency petition, Garza's lawyers cited the Justice
Department's report in deriding the federal criminal process as
``plagued by systemic bias, disparity and arbitrariness.'' The
attorneys argued that the data cry out for further study to examine
the extent of racial bias at all stages of the criminal justice
system from the time a police officer decides to stop a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Garza, who moved more than 7,000 pounds of marijuana through
South Texas from 1982 to 1992, killed Erasmo de la Fuente, whom
Garza blamed for losing a marijuana shipment, and de la Fuente's
associate Gilberto Matos. The year after those 1990 slayings, Garza
killed Thomas Albert Rumbo when he agreed to assist law enforcement
after being caught shipping marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Garza was sentenced to death under the federal 1988 Anti-Drug
Abuse Act, which lets prosecutors seek the death penalty against
``drug kingpins'' who use murder as a stock in trade.
</P>
<P>
   Garza, who sits on death row in Terre Haute, Ind., is one of 19
condemned federal prisoners, including Oklahoma City bomber Timothy
McVeigh.

 &HT;    Swimmers ready to take on world
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ During training camp up the coast in Brisbane, the U.S.
swimmers enjoyed seeing their sport get the type of media coverage
that's reserved for football, baseball and basketball in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always saying that Australia is swimming heaven,''
sprinter Jenny Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian team, however, wants to make them miserable. The
Aussies will try to wrest swimming dominance away from the Yanks,
who won 26 medals in Atlanta four years ago compared to 11 for
Australia. Last year, the United States narrowly prevailed at the
Pan Pac meet in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. women's coach Richard Quick and men's coach Mark Schubert
have stressed that this isn't a dual meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to race the world,'' Schubert said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Brooke Bennett, the defending champion in the 800
meters, is the only U.S. woman to top the world rankings this year.
The U.S. men's team features three world-record holders: Lenny
Krayzelburg (100 and 200 back), Tom Dolan (400 IM) and Tom Malchow
(200 fly).
</P>
<P>
   Mark Spitz, who won seven gold medals in 1972, has predicted
that the U.S. women will not win any golds.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper it looks that way,'' said Thompson, who has five
golds and a silver yet is still seeking her first individual gold.
``But I think we're all swimming really well in our preparation,
and I think we'll have some amazing swims.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``You have to actually swim the meet, so that's why
we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team arrived in Sydney on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all kind of itching to get this meet on and
start racing, and that's the fun part,'' said Dolan, who is the
defending Olympic champion in the 400-meter individual medley.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team features veterans, including 33-year-old Dara
Torres, the first American swimmer to appear in four Olympic Games,
and rookies such as 15-year-old Michael Phelps, the youngest U.S.
male to make the team in 68 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The youth of the team has revived the team a little bit and
lightened up the atmosphere,'' said Malchow, who won a silver in
'96. ``I don't think they know to be scared of this meet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgians with the best medal chances are Kristy Kowal in
the 200-meter breaststroke and Courtney Shealy, who will swim a leg
on the 400-meter freestyle relay as well as the 100 backstroke.
</P>
<P>
   At the Olympic trials last month, the U.S. team set several
American records but shattered no world marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt from the performances we saw at the training
camp that our team is better than it was at the trials,'' Schubert
said.

   SYDNEY _ They're back, four years and nearly 10,000 miles
removed from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Summer Olympics begin anew this weekend in Australia _
bigger than ever, maybe better, with the usual mix of familiar
stars and fresh ones, plus a certain medals spike for the host
nation.
</P>
<P>
   After tonight's Opening Ceremonies, the spotlight swings
Saturday toward the athletes, and a wider one it is. Some 10,200 of
them from 199 countries partake in a 31-sport schedule so jammed
that it had to begin two days before the Games' official start.
</P>
<P>
   The first medals will be presented Saturday to women in the new
Olympic sport of triathlon, which consists here of running, cycling
and eluding sharks in the occasionally infested harbor waters; no
feedings are anticipated. Aussies are projected for gold, perhaps
silver as well, which would whoosh them to the top of the medals
tables and send their rabid mates into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   They will not wind up as the host with the most. Still, the
Aussies expect to increase a 41-medal take in Atlanta by about 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowds here will be worth 12 to 15 medals alone,'' U.S.
Olympic Committee spokesman Mike Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. knows well the Olympic home-field, -court, water bonus.
In 1996, the U.S. team won 44 gold, 18 more than runner-up Russia,
and 101 in all, 36 better than second-fiddle Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The medals gap probably will narrow but not enough for the U.S.
to relinquish global superiority. Australian officials say, not too
loudly, that fourth place would be fine behind the superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   As for the U.S., Moran said, ``Our hopes would be to do in the
neighborhood of what we did in Atlanta. Everyone would be thrilled
if we could do in the 100-medals range, but the question is, 'Can
anybody win 100 anymore?' ``
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Year of the Woman, a label informally attached to
Atlanta, has taken on a more formal ring here. It can only aid the
U.S. records show that the Americans strike quickly in first-time
female sports. The Sydney debutantes include water polo, taekwondo
and weightlifting, with strongwoman Cheryl Haworth of Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Medal threats from Georgia abound. The ripest of the Peach State
athletes are in track and field (hurdlers Gail Devers and Angelo
Taylor, shot putter Adam Nelson), basketball (Shareef Abdul-Rahim
and Teresa Edwards), shooting (Thomas Tamas and Cindy Gentry) and
canoe-kayak (Scott Shipley).
</P>
<P>
   The potentially transcendant performer is track-and-field terror
Marion Jones, who has been bumping world leaders off magazine
covers. She eyes gold in five events _ two individual sprints, two
relays and the long jump.

 &HT;    Officials vow to improve air travel
 &HT;    By Melanie Eversley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For those who have dealt with the crowds, delays
and hassles that air travel has become, relief may be on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials and airline executives told a Senate panel on
Thursday that that they are trying to ease the travel trauma at the
nation's airports.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Mullin, president of Delta Air Lines, told the Senate
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee that his company,
whose hub is in Atlanta, is trying to ease the load by adding
regional flights to smaller communities.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater told Sen. Max Cleland
(D-Ga.) and other panel members that he has directed his agency to
explore the problem and come up with answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, if the Wright brothers could put man into flight ...
we can deal with the ground-level and even the air-level challenges
that we face to insure improved services to the American people,''
Slater said.
</P>
<P>
   Slater said that among his initiatives is a task force that will
probe the nature of traffic delays and come up with plan to deal
with them within the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   The optimistic comments came amid a three-hour hearing that
overall was not so upbeat. Figures flew back and forth describing
how America's skies have become clogged with traffic, causing
passengers to arrive at family holidays exhausted and frazzled,
miss business meetings or spend whole days or nights waiting in
noisy airport terminals.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 to 1999, flight delays increased 58 percent, according
to the Federal Aviation Administration. Cancellations grew even
more, by 68 percent, in the same time period, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cleland, the air traffic glut has become critical,
and because of that, he offerred an invitation Thursday to Slater
to come to Hartsfield International Airport, the world's busiest
air terminal, after the November general election to discuss
speeding up plans to build a fifth runway by 2005. The new runway
would cut back the ever-growing average flight delay time at
Hartsfield from a projected 14 minutes in 2005 down to five
minutes, Cleland said. Slater has not yet responded to the
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need that runway tomorrow,'' Cleland said after the
hearing. ``We need the secretary to help expedite things.''
</P>
<P>
   The discussions come at a time when air travel has become
commonplace. Commuter marriages are not unusual and many
businesses, having the means to travel inexpensively, choose to
conduct business with far-off clients face-to-face rather than over
the phone. Today, a trip through the airport is for some as
everyday, and as harried, as a ride on the subway at rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin said Delta will try to help relieve the problem with
regional jet service to small- and medium-sized communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increased capacity is the only solution if we are to meet
consumer demand and at the same time return reliability,
convenience and comfort to air travel.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials were not quite on the same page. Slater said
his initiatives include:
</P>
<P>
   An Airline Quality Service Performance task force that will
draft a report over the next few months on the best way to measure
airline performance.
</P>
<P>
   A report to be completed by Assistant Transportation Secretary
Francisco Sanchez on best practices in the airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the inspector general at the Department of Transportation
said federal officials should first figure out how many arrivals
and departures the nation's top 30 airports can accommodate without
delays or risks to safety.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general, Kenneth Mead, said air carriers have
added additional flights to balance out the growing number of
delays and cancellations, but that airports increasingly cannot
handle the growing load. This is why a system of that sets out
``capacity benchmarks'' should be instituted, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without it, our ability to understand the impact on flight
volume on flight delays and cancellations and, in turn, to make
informed decisions, is severely constrained,'' Mead told the
senators.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administrator Jane Garvey, also at the hearing,
said her agency was working toward creating such benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said he strongly supports the idea, and he spent part of
the hearing trying to convince Mullin and Donald Carty, president
of American Airlines, that they should support it also.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of realistic information is what the public would
like to have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin, however, said that such benchmarks are not necessary.
Preliminary discussions are under way to build yet a sixth runway
at Hartsfield, he said. And this year, he added, the airlines and
passengers have gotten through the summer - what he called ``the
mean season.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the benchmark system, he said, ``I think it should only be
put forward on a true emergency basis.''

CLINTON SAYS HE IS `TROUBLED' BY HANDLING OF SCIENTIST'S CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for rewriting throughout and additional information; story
grows by about 700 words and is now 2 takes; note byline change)  
(See also LEE-RELEASE-ASSESS) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Thursday that he was ``quite
troubled'' by the actions by officials in the Wen Ho Lee case,
commenting one day after a federal judge in New Mexico harshly
criticized the government for tactics that the judge said were
unfair and abusive.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks, a stinging and highly unusual rebuke of the
Justice Department and the FBI, came as Attorney General Janet Reno
rejected calls for her to apologize to Lee. Lee was freed on
Wednesday after pleading guilty to a single count of what had been
a 59-count felony indictment that accused him of illegally putting
at risk vital atomic secrets.
</P>
<P>
   In comments to reporters, Clinton said he had long questioned
whether prosecutors had adequate grounds to keep Lee in jail for
nine months awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had reservations about the claims that were being
made denying him bail,'' Clinton said. ``So the whole thing was
quite troubling to me and I think it's very difficult to reconcile
the two positions that one day he's a terrible risk to the national
security and the next day they're making a plea agreement for an
offense far more modest than what had been alleged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can justify in retrospect keeping a person
in jail without bail when you're prepared to make that kind of
agreement,'' the president said, speaking with reporters outside
the White House after a speech. ``It just can't be justified and so
I too am quite troubled by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if would consider a pardon for Lee, Clinton was
noncommittal but expressed sympathy for Lee, saying the scientist
had been detained for ``a bailable offense, and it means he spent a
lot of time in prison that any ordinary American wouldn't have and
that bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said the attorney general would not
respond publicly to the president's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier, Reno expressed no regrets over the government's
tactics even though the judge in the case, James A. Parker of U.S.
District Court in Albuquerque, said the nuclear scientist deserved
an apology for harsh treatment that had ``embarrassed this entire
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said, ``I think Dr. Lee had the opportunity from the
beginning to resolve this matter and he chose not to and I think he
must look to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with reporters, Reno said she wished ``with all my
heart and soul'' that Lee had agreed earlier to provide
investigators with information, which he must do as part of the
plea agreement, about seven missing computer tapes onto which he
transferred nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Lee, Mark Holscher, said in an interview that Lee
had offered in December to cooperate as part of plea deal, a point
Parker also made in his scathing comments about the prosecution.
But, Holscher said, the government never responded.
</P>
<P>
   Neither White House or Justice Department officials would say
whether Clinton and Reno ever discussed the logistics of Lee's
confinement or other legal aspects of the case, although there was
no indication that White House officials ever complained to the
department.
</P>
<P>
   Some law enforcement officials said that they had sought to keep
Lee confined to pressure him into pleading guilty or to confess to
what a number of officials believed, but could never prove _ that
he was a spy for Beijing. The officials now acknowledge that those
tactics were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, suggested Thursday that
the president would order a review of the government's handling of
the case. ``He'll be looking for some answers to how this came
about,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Lockhart seemed to soften Clinton's words,
saying later that the president's comments were not intended ``as a
blanket criticism of anyone.'' He also said in an interview that
the president retained confidence in Reno.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The president's blunt remarks on the Lee case seemed certain to
heighten the furor over a case that, with its sudden collapse, has
turned into a major embarrassment for Reno and other officials who
favored the indictment, including FBI Director Louis J. Freeh and
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said Thursday in a statement, ``While there are some
regrettable aspects about the way the case unfolded, the bottom
line remains that Dr. Lee committed very serious security
violations involving our nuclear secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   While Reno was named to her post by President Clinton, any
direct involvement by the White House in discussions about whether
and how to prosecute Lee would have been unusual. The department is
supposed to operate independently from White House in prosecutorial
matters, and Clinton's aides stayed out of such matters, since they
had been criticized for involvement in an inquiry that followed
death of Vincent Foster Jr., a deputy White House counsel who took
his own life in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, national security officials at the White House did
know in advance about the lengthy felony indictment of Lee without
raising apparent objections.
</P>
<P>
   Several days before Lee was charged in December 1999, Reno,
Richardson and Freeh met with senior intelligence officials at the
White House to discuss the security implications of the case, among
them Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security
adviser, and George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress, some of whom once complained that the
government had moved to slowly in the case, shifted gears in
aftermath of the plea bargain to urge an inquiry into the
government's conduct. Senate hearings will begin later this month
chaired by Arlen Specter, a Republican Senator from Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The government's decision to abandon a case that prosecutors had
once compared to nuclear espionage shattered an uneasy calm that
had settled over the Justice Department and the FBI in the waning
months of the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Freeh, whose once close relationship has frayed over a
series of internal battles, many of them involving questions over
the need for independent prosecutors in cases involving the White
House, were forced once again to close ranks and defend their
actions. Freeh, in Moscow on Thursday to attend meetings with
Russian law enforcement officials, refused to discuss the Lee case
when asked about it by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI is expected to conduct a review of the case. Law
enforcement officials said Thursday that Freeh, a former federal
judge, had instituted a policy of conducting internal inquiries
when its agents are criticized by federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released after the guilty plea, Freeh said Lee
had pleaded guilty to a serious offense. Freeh said much of the
information that Lee removed from Los Alamos was highly sensitive,
disputing some weapons experts who have said the government vastly
exaggerated the sensitivity of the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``While some of the information was not classified,'' Freeh's
statement said, ``the government was prepared to prove that much of
it was highly classified nuclear weapons information.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Lee had to concede in his plea deal that the
government had been justified in investigating the downloading, he
has also decided to take legal action against the government, Brian
Sun, one of his lawyers, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, will revive a civil suit he filed against the Energy
Department, accusing the department of violating his privacy by
releasing a large amount of confidential information on his
background and its investigation of suspicions that he had spied
for China.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed last December in U.S. District Court in
Washington, but the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, decided that it
would have to wait for the end of Lee's criminal case, a common
practice. Sun said that, with the criminal prosecution concluded,
the family wants to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is trying to win monetary damages from the government , but
perhaps more important, Sun said, the family hopes to use the suit
to obtain documents from the government on why Lee was singled out
for prosecution in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers had claimed that Lee had been unfairly singled out
for prosecution largely because he is Asian American. In one of the
most important successes scored by the defense, the federal judge
handling the case, James A. Parker, ordered the government to hand
over most of the documents so he could decide whether to give to
the defense so they could try to prove their claim.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting Lee's guilty plea Wednesday, Parker suggested that
he felt it was unfortunate that he would not be able to review the
documents because the criminal case was over.
</P>
<P>
   Sun said that he was exploring whether he could seek the
documents in the civil suit, since Lee's plea said he ``waives any
right to additional disclosure from the government in connection
with the guilty plea.'' The judge in the civil case will probably
have to decided whether the documents are connected to the plea.

   Profit Doubles at Oracle and Exceeds Projections
</P>
<P>
   Oracle said its first-quarter earnings more than doubled,
beating Wall Street forecasts, driven by better-than-expected sales
of its database-management programs. Oracle reported earnings of
$501 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with $237 million, or 8
cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts had estimated
earnings of 13 cents a share. Revenue grew 14 percent, to $2.26
billion from $1.98 billion.

   Colgate Hurt by Analysts' Doubts
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Colgate-Palmolive tumbled 15 percent after analysts
expressed doubts that the company will meet sales targets, citing
the yearlong plunge in the euro. Stubbornly high petroleum prices,
meanwhile, are expected to limit Colgate's ability to cut costs.
Shares of Colgate dropped $8.81, to $47.38, and other consumer

   Blue Chips Fall, but Nasdaq Rallies
</P>
<P>
   Blue chips fell on profit taking and concerns about the drop in
the euro, but technology stocks moved higher on upbeat speculation
about earnings. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 94.71
points, or 0.9 percent, to 11,087.47. The Nasdaq composite index
rose 19.97 points, or half a percent, to 3,913.86, but the Standard

   Concerns about rising unemployment, inflation and lawlessness in
the southern islands of the Philippines badly hurt the nation's
financial markets. The benchmark stock index fell to a five-week

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dalinda Halkowitz's husband filed for divorce
the day in February that he and nearly 700 other soldiers from the
49th Armored Division of the Texas National Guard assembled to go
to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Ron De La Rosa spent the day before he left visiting
his ailing mother, Dora, in a nursing home, taking her her favorite
meal, tongue tacos, and worrying how she would be while he was
gone. It would be the last time he ever saw her.
</P>
<P>
   While Maj. Deanne Lins has spent the last seven months in
Bosnia, her husband, Anthony Lins, has had to adapt _ not always
easily _ to his new role as both father and mother to their
daughter and son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad had to go bra shopping _ twice,'' he said recently in the
dining room of the Linses' home here.
</P>
<P>
   As the Pentagon has increasingly tapped the National Guard and
Reserves for active duty, it has profoundly affected the armed
services, their budgets and military operations around the world.
It has also had consequences, in ways large and small, on the home
front.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Texas, the 49th's deployment to Bosnia _ the largest
single mobilization of Guard troops since the Persian Gulf war of
1991 _ has forced scores of wives, and a few husbands, to manage on
their own, in many cases for the first time. They have had to cope
with emotional strains, deaths of loved ones and unexpected crises,
from broken appliances to emergency surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment has disrupted family routines, family finances
and, in the worst cases, the families themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Halkowitz does not know exactly why her marriage collapsed _ if
it was the pressure that came with deploying overseas or something
else. The divorce papers cited irreconcilable differences, and her
husband, Sgt. Gary Halkowitz, has not spoken to her since he left.
She has no doubt, however, that the 49th's Bosnian duty _ and the
months of training that led up to it _ have caused strains at home
that only the strongest marriages could survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see our military pulling from the reserves for these
missions, and they're not used to it,'' Halkowitz said in the
living room of her home in Snyder, a small West Texas town
northwest of Abilene. ``And these families are getting thrown into
situations where they don't know how to react.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the strains facing the families of the 49th are the
same, of course, as those faced by families of active-duty troops
sent overseas, but for the National Guard and Reserves there is a
crucial difference. The majority of reservists joined to serve part
time, usually no more than a weekend a month and two weeks each
summer, not for nearly eight months.
</P>
<P>
   As they are called to duty more often, thousands of reservists
are having to put on hold their families, their education and,
perhaps the biggest difference with active troops, their careers.
</P>
<P>
   With the nation's armed services having shrunk by a third since
the Cold War, the 870,000 men and women in the National Guard and
Reserves have become essential to military operations. Pentagon
officials say the strategy is irreversible, but they acknowledge
that it has worrisome consequences that they have only begun to try
to assess.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Pentagon sent more than 100,000 reservists and
their spouses questionnaires in its first effort to measure what
Charles Cragin, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for
reserve affairs, called the ``unique quality-of-life concerns''
facing the Guard and Reserves.
</P>
<P>
   A study of employers, released on Sept. 1, found that while most
supported the military service of their employees, the majority
complained that call-ups were too long and disrupted the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian employers have had to make do while their employees are
away, juggling work schedules, forcing others to pick up the slack
or hiring temporary help, paying for it out of their own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like it or not, they're having to pay part of the bill of the
Guard's peacekeeping mission,'' said Dale Pyeatt, executive
director of the National Guard Association of Texas, an advocacy
group for Guard members, referring to the employers of the 49th's
troops.
</P>
<P>
   The strains on the home front, officials say, could prove to be
one of the biggest obstacles to the Pentagon's plans to rely on the
Guard and Reserves more in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never a matter of whether the soldiers of the 49th
could do this mission,'' Maj. Gen. Daniel James 3d, commander of
the Texas National Guard, said in an interview at Camp Mabry in
Austin. `The success of this mission,'' he said, ``will come in how
many jobs and how many families remain intact after they come
home.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   For the vast majority of the 49th's troops, the Bosnian mission
has been their first extended duty abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Several soldiers have become fathers while in Bosnia. Many have
missed birthdays, anniversaries and less happy occasions. For Sgt.
De La Rosa, duty meant being away when his mother died in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to decide if I would let Ron know every time she had a
relapse,'' De La Rosa's wife, Olga, said. ``I knew he wanted to
know, but he was frustrated that there was nothing he could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some families have relied on relatives. Maj. Ronald Elliott's
wife, Sandra, was a captain in the regular Army, but resigned last
year when he began working full time as the 49th's public-affairs
officer. Before he left in February, Elliott and their toddler
triplets _ Amanda, Alexandra and Joshua _ moved in with her parents
in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   Others have managed on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Maria Prusiatis has taken over the sprawling ranch outside
of Lockhart, which is south of Austin, that belongs to her fiancee,
1st Sgt. Robert Wagner. She serves as a master sergeant in the
Guard and, like Wagner, works full time as an intelligence analyst.
</P>
<P>
   After hours and on weekends, she tends 24 cattle, 30 sheep, ``a
couple goats'' and three horses, including a colt she has not
gotten around to naming. She is also planning their wedding for
Oct. 28, after he returns.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been easy. She broke a finger and badly bruised her
knee when a horse stepped on her. Then there was the time she
happened on a rattlesnake in the feed shed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you do on a ranch where you couldn't use an
extra pair of hands,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its deployment, the 49th has established a ``family
support'' network. It includes centers at Camp Mabry in Austin and
at armories in cities like San Antonio, Houston, Dallas and
Abilene, where families can get help with everything from the
electricity being cut off to finding counseling for children acting
up because their mother or father is away.
</P>
<P>
   Each center has organized video teleconferences and has soldiers
and volunteers who check in with each family at least once a month.
The division's commander, Maj. Gen. Robert Halverson, has also let
soldiers off for as much as two weeks and approved four-day passes
to Budapest, Hungary. Some used their leaves to return home to
Texas; others, like the Linses, vacationed in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized early on that keeping our soldiers and families
connected was vital to our mission success,'' Halverson said.
</P>
<P>
   For some families, that has not been enough. There have been at
least four divorces in the unit, according to division officials in
Austin, and they fear more when soldiers return home and try to
re-establish the delicate family dynamics that have changed in
their absence.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL MATERIAL
</P>
<P>
   Halkowitz, 37, met her husband in July 1999. By then he already
knew he was headed for Bosnia and, she said, wanted to get married
before he left. It was the second marriage for each, and it seemed
to go well, she said. Their children _ two each _ became close. Her
5-year-old son, Bryce, grew especially fond of his new stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   After they married a year ago and the deployment approached,
Halkowitz said she began to notice strains. Like all of the 49th's
soldiers, he was spending extra time on duty training for the
mission, including three weeks at Fort Polk, La. She attended
``family readiness'' meetings and even volunteered to serve as the
chairwoman of the support group in Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us the soldiers go through a lot of things: anger
and fear,'' she said. ``The men will pull back because they
distance themselves from what they think they're losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Four days before they deployed, he came home and told her the
marriage was over. His lawyer filed the divorce papers the day the
troops reported for active duty. She has tried to contact him
through e-mail and through the 49th's commanders and its chaplain,
but he has not responded. (He declined to be interviewed for this
article.)
</P>
<P>
   She hired a lawyer and challenged the financial terms of the
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like he went over there and erased whatever was going on
at home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has remained chairwoman of the local support group. She
became close to a woman in Lubbock whose husband in the Guard also
filed for divorce, leaving her destitute.
</P>
<P>
   Halkowitz said she believed the Army and the National Guard did
all they could to prepare the 49th's soldiers for peacekeeping in
Bosnia, but she added, ``There needs to be more training for the
families, too.''

 &HT;    Hall a bit mellower, but stays feisty
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY_ Gary Hall Jr. didn't even have to get in the water here
to find himself embroiled in a controversy. Australian star Kieren
Perkins bristled over Hall's quote about the Australia swimmers:
``We'll smash them like guitars.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the U.S. men's coach, Mark Schubert, was somewhat taken
aback.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very ambitious quote,'' Schubert said. ``Of all of
our swimmers he's certainly the showman.''
</P>
<P>
   Same old Gary? For years, Hall has been known in swim circles as
much for his antics and his rebel attitude as his still unfulfilled
talent. Yet others have noticed a change of late.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Walker edged Hall in the 100-meter freestyle in Hall's
comeback at the U.S. swimming trials in Indianapolis in August, and
Hall beat Walker and everyone else in the 50 freestyle when he
broke a 10-year-old record. Walker sees a new Hall, one who has
matured since he was diagnosed with diabetes last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's learned from that. He's bettered himself, and he's on a
roll,'' Walker said. ``He's better than the old Gary. He still has
the spirit and the confidence, but he's grown. I compare him to
Lance Armstrong. Lance had to deal with cancer. He conquered that
and then became a better rider. Gary has had to deal with diabetes.
At the trials I think he was probably one of the most scared people
out there. Now, his physique is good. His confidence level is up.
Now, I think he'll do some amazing things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, 25, is the son of three-time Olympian Gary Hall. To
understand the genetic potential the 6-foot-6-inch Hall had as a
young swimmer, you can go back to the brief time he was a Texas
Longhorn. Hall swam as a freshman at UT in 1994 and first debated
about transferring closer to his family's Phoenix home before
opting instead to turn professional and point for the 1996
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he was leaving Texas Coach Eddie Reese's program,
Reese, who is an assistant coach for the 2000 U.S. men's swim team,
had this to say about him: ``He will be a record breaker, a barrier
breaker. . . . He's the greatest freestyler we've ever had. And
`we' is the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall made it to the Atlanta Olympics as the American hope
against Russian sprint star Alexander Popov. Hall played the part
of a young gun to the hilt. He strode around in leather motorcycle
pants. He did some furious shadow boxing. Popov just stared him
down. The Russian seemed supremely confident that he would beat the
talented Hall because he trained harder.
</P>
<P>
   Popov took gold in the 50 and 100 freestyles. Hall settled for
silver. Things went downhill from there. In 1998 Hall was hit with
a three-month suspension for testing positive for marijuana. Then
came the real shocker.
</P>
<P>
   In his diary on the CNN/SI Web site Hall wrote, ``My eyesight
was becoming blurry and I experienced excessive fatigue and
dizziness. It wasn't until I collapsed one day that I was diagnosed
with diabetes.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Hall reacted the way many of us would _ badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hopeless void filled my insides and all I could do was sit
in disbelief,'' he wrote. He was ``depressed, dumbfounded,
horrified.''
</P>
<P>
   And angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to lash at the doctor with my teeth,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   He lost interest in training. He packed up and headed for Costa
Rica and the beach. According to his account, he went swimming in
shark-infested waters, hoping for the worst, and actually felt
sharks brush him on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   But he regrouped. While in Costa Rica he started reading about
diabetes. He now knows quite a bit about it and writes about it on
his Web site, much the way Austin's Armstrong has done with cancer.
Others with the condition read his Web site and are inspired, with
good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he now has to take insulin as often as eight times a
day, Hall has achieved some remarkable feats. In his ``prime,'' he
could never break 22 seconds for the 50 freestyle. At the U.S.
trials he accomplished that three times and broke Tom Jager's
decade-old record of 21.81 seconds with a time of 21.76. He entered
that meet worried whether he had enough to swim 100 meters and had
qualified only with a slow 51.13 at the Janet Evans Invitational.
Yet he gave Walker a real run and finished second in 48.84 seconds
to make the team in the 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my hope that I've been able to show the world a person
living with diabetes is capable of achieving anything they set out
to do,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Hall was even extremely kind to the rival Australians, praising
their swimming system and wishing them well before observing,
``Good humor and genuine kindness seem a predominant
characteristic. My biased opinion says that we will smash them like
guitars.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the old Gary's not gone. He also has lashed out at the
stodgy way swimming is run in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm an extremist,'' he recently explained to
reporters. ``I'm not extremely left, I'm just left of center and
most of the swimming establishment is so far right, I seem very far
away.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also criticized Speedo, which dropped him after his
marijuana problems. Without specifically naming the company, he has
taken shots at them for taking credit for records that might have
well fallen in an Olympic year no matter what the swimmers were
wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's return closed a few spots that would have been open for
other swimmers, but even those he beat seemed to be glad he's on
the U.S. team, which will need all of his talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel proud to be on an Olympic team with him,'' Walker said.

<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ What Gov. George W. Bush did on Thursday was an
extraordinary turnabout. After weeks of objections to the debate
schedule that the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates had
been proposing, he suddenly agreed to all of it: three encounters
with Vice President Al Gore, on the dates that the commission
proposed, in the locations that the commission specified.
</P>
<P>
   He even agreed to Boston, which his advisers had dismissed as a
Democratic stronghold that stacked the deck against their
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Bush's representatives sat down with the debate
commission's officials on Thursday, they really had no other
choice. They had to cut their losses and stop the regular pounding
that Bush had been taking in the news media for what looked like a
nervousness about formal debates.
</P>
<P>
   And they had to move on, because an ongoing debate over debates
threatened to be yet another distraction for a campaign bedeviled
by too many of them. They knew that for Bush to communicate his
chosen message to voters, he had to put an end to the extraneous
story lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign recognizes that it has to get back on offense,
back on its own agenda, and out of the muck,'' said one prominent
Republican strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's agreement spoke volumes about the change in the Bush
campaign's fortunes over the last several weeks. Before, Bush
enjoyed a considerable advantage over Gore in the polls, and for a
frontrunner, debates always represent more of a risk than an
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush now seems to be trailing by a few percentage points,
and for an underdog, debates hold the promise of mixing up the the
dynamic, changing the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush needs debates,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster,
``because with debates, you can shake up the political
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Debates also represent one of the rare times when a candidate
can speak directly to an enormous number of voters, without having
to rely on the conduit of journalists, and for Bush, that is more
attractive than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The last several weeks have demonstrated to him and his advisers
just how unpredictable the 24-hour news cycle is and how quickly
reporters can latch onto a mistake or a surprise that has nothing
to do with what a candidate is peddling, and yank him off course.
</P>
<P>
   That has happened to Bush again and again, and those mishaps
coupled with the realignment of the candidates in the polls,
changed the narratives associated with Bush and Gore. All at once,
it was Bush who could not gain his footing, and Gore who loped with
an unbroken stride.
</P>
<P>
   For the 90 minutes of a debate, however, there is no commentary,
no interpretation: just the candidates saying what they choose and,
if they don't stumble, what they want the voters to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Bush's chance to get his message out unfiltered,
uncensored, unedited,'' Luntz said. ``And that's exactly what he
wants. And that's exactly what will get his campaign back on
track.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had wanted debates that were less formal, and shorter. His
aides had proposed having only one 90-minute commission debate, and
two 60-minute ones on television news programs. The news program
debates would not have been carried by all the major networks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's communications director, Karen P. Hughes, insisted on
Thursday that he might still get his wish for a more spontaneous
exchange between the candidates. As the candidate played
hard-to-get, she said, the debate commission grew agreeable to
talking about creative, spontaneous formats for the debates.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign has not received any firm agreement along
those lines.
</P>
<P>
   So Bush and his advisers appear to be taking something of a
gamble, worth it to them now because the holdout had not worked to
their advantage, any further holdout may bring only them more
grief, and they need to move the focus of the campaign to ground
where they can put Gore on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of weeks have not been pleasant, and I think
there was a desire not to allow this cloud to linger any longer,''
said Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush campaign adviser said that while events had clearly been
moving toward an agreement on debates, Thursday's deal may well
have been sealed by the emergence of newly critical appraisals of
Gore's fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   At last, the Republican official said, Gore was on the hot seat.
And Bush's advisers knew that if they did not reach an agreement on
debates on Thursday, they might help Gore out of that uncomfortable
spot by keeping Bush in one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision was locked in by the fact that Bush finally got
some traction, after weeks of no traction,'' the official said.
``They don't want to take that away.''
</P>
<P>
   And with less than two months to go before Election Day, they
may not be able to afford to.

BUSH ON SPOT AS GOP PUSHES TO PULL GI'S OUT OF KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House and Senate negotiators are fighting over a
deadline for withdrawing American troops from Kosovo, renewing a
clash with President Clinton and putting Gov. George W. Bush on the
spot again, since he lobbied Senate Republicans to drop a similar
provision earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a proposal to cut off money for nearly 6,000 U.S.
ground forces in Kosovo by April 1, 2001, forcing their withdrawal
unless Congress authorizes an extension.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Senate rejected a similar measure, 53-47, with at
least two or three Republicans saying they were swayed by Bush, who
called it a ``legislative overreach'' that would tie his hands if
he became president. But House Republicans quietly attached a
comparable provision to the Pentagon's $310 billion budget bill for
fiscal year 2001.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate leaders are now meeting in a conference
committee to reconcile the two versions of the military budget
bills _ one with the provision, the other without. The contentious
language was one of the last sticking points negotiators faced in
finishing the bill before Congress adjourns for the year.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday night, there were signs that congressional
Republicans were relenting. ``I think we'll work something out,''
said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who heads the Armed Services
Committee and who sponsored the original Senate measure. The House
version was sponsored by Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute comes at an awkward time for Bush, the Republican
presidential nominee, who has accused the Clinton administration of
allowing the military's combat readiness to erode, in part by
dispatching American forces on far-flung peacekeeping missions to
places like Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush, Ray Sullivan, said Thursday that the
governor objected to the Republican-written language for the same
reasons that he balked at the Senate provision in May. ``He views
it as a legislative overreach on the powers of the president,''
said Sullivan, who added that congressional Republicans were aware
of Bush's views.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the provision would undermine the unity and morale
of NATO's peacekeeping operation, which involves forces from
Britain, France, Germany, Italy and other nations in and out of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent late Thursday to Warner, Clinton warned that
imposing an arbitrary deadline for withdrawal would also send a
dangerous signal of uncertain American resolve to President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia before that country's scheduled
elections on Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Under the provision, Clinton's successor would be required to
certify to Congress that Washington's European allies were meeting
their commitments in Kosovo for reconstruction aid, police
officers, food and medicines. Without that certification, the
measure required that money be spent in Kosovo only for an orderly
withdrawal of American troops.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would require the allies to be responsible for at
least 85 percent of the humanitarian assistance and 90 percent of
the police officers in Kosovo. The allies are now providing about
75 of the humanitarian assistance and more than 60 percent of the
police, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter last month to Warner, Defense Secretary William
Cohen criticized the provision, saying it was ``unacceptable
because it is counterproductive to peace in Kosovo and could
seriously jeopardize relations between the United States and its
NATO allies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If enacted this provision would take decision-making on the
deployment of U.S. forces out of the hands of Congress and the
President and put it into the hands of European governments _ a
dangerous precedent,'' said Cohen, who is the only Republican in
Clinton's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This provision would create uncertainty about U.S. intentions
and resoluteness, and could encourage an extremist element to take
actions that could put American forces at increased risk, in the
hope of triggering their withdrawal,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   But many congressional Republicans say the provision is
essential to relieve the burden on American ground troops in Kosovo
and pressure European countries to pay a larger share of the
reconstruction and policing costs for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel pretty strongly about it,'' said Rep. Richard Armey of
Texas, the House majority leader. ``The question is, how long will
we have people over there, and when will we have a clear definition
of what they're doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Floyd Spence of South Carolina, chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, agreed: ``We're tied down too much in different
places right now. People are scattered all over the world, our
readiness is down and our equipment is wearing out. We have to have
our allies do more.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats echoed Cohen's dire warnings. ``These arbitrary
limits are not going to be helpful,'' said Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode
Island Democrat on the Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the panel's senior Democrat and a
top negotiator in the conference committee, said: ``It undermines
the coalition and creates terrible morale for our troops to let
them know they're coming out.''

 &HT;    Swimmers ready to take on world
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ During training camp up the coast in Brisbane, the U.S.
swimmers enjoyed seeing their sport get the type of media coverage
that's reserved for football, baseball and basketball in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always saying that Australia is swimming heaven,''
sprinter Jenny Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian team, however, wants to make them.The Aussies
will try to wrest swimming dominance away from the Yanks, who won
26 medals in Atlanta four years ago compared to 11 for Australia.
Last year, the United States narrowly prevailed at the Pan Pac meet
in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. women's coach Richard Quick and men's coach Mark Schubert
have stressed that this isn't a dual meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to race the world,'' Schubert said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Brooke Bennett, the defending champion in the 800
meters, is the only U.S. woman to top the world rankings this year.
The U.S. men's team features three world-record holders: Lenny
Krayzelburg (100 and 200 back), Tom Dolan (400 IM) and Tom Malchow
(200 fly).
</P>
<P>
   Mark Spitz, who won seven gold medals in 1972, has predicted
that the U.S. women will not win any golds.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper it looks that way,'' said Thompson, who has five
golds and a silver yet is still seeking her first individual gold.
``But I think we're all swimming really well in our preparation,
and I think we'll have some amazing swims.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``You have to actually swim the meet, so that's why
we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team arrived in Sydney on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all kind of itching to get this meet on and
start racing, and that's the fun part,'' said Dolan, who is the
defending Olympic champion in the 400-meter individual medley.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team features veterans, including 33-year-old Dara
Torres, the first American swimmer to appear in four Olympic Games,
and rookies such as 15-year-old Michael Phelps, the youngest U.S.
male to make the team in 68 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The youth of the team has revived the team a little bit and
lightened up the atmosphere,'' said Malchow, who won a silver in
'96. ``I don't think they know to be scared of this meet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgians with the best medal chances are Kristy Kowal in
the 200-meter breaststroke and Courtney Shealy, who will swim a leg
on the 400-meter freestyle relay as well as the 100 backstroke.
</P>
<P>
   At the Olympic trials last month, the U.S. team set several
American records but shattered no world marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt from the performances we saw at the training
camp that our team is better than it was at the trials,'' Schubert
said.

CONTRIVED SCRIPT MAKES SOUR NOTES IN KARAOKE-FILLED `DUETS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since Gwyneth Paltrow is the hottest actress in Hollywood and
her father, Bruce, is far from an A-list director, their teaming in
the low-budget drama, ``Duets,'' has an air of nepotistic charity
about it that has generated mostly negative advance buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the movie is not all that bad. Its reach may be quite
a bit beyond it's grasp, but it's mostly a well-acted, atmospheric
little ensemble piece that says something about the soulless center
of American society and the karaoke subculture in particular.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of three pairs of characters who are all, in one
way or another, working their way toward a $5,000 karaoke contest
in Omaha, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Couple No. 1 is made up of a karaoke hustler (Huey Lewis) who
wanders from bar to bar conning unsuspecting customers into betting
against his singing ability; and his long-abandoned, now-grown
daughter (Paltrow), who decides to follow him on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The second pair is a burnt-out, pill-popping, wildly
self-destructive salesman (Paul Giamatti) who deserts his
middle-class life for the nightly thrill of karaoke; and an ex-con
hitchhiker (Andre Braugher) he meets one day in the Utah desert.
</P>
<P>
   And the third duet is played by an ambitious, cynical singer
(Maria Bello) working her way to Hollywood by performing fellatio
on strangers; and an idealistic younger man (Scott Speedman) who
refuses to accept all the evidence that ``the world is a sewer.''
</P>
<P>
   The big downside of the film is that it always feels slightly
contrived, and its script works to a melodramatic and
not-very-believable ending that doesn't really serve to pull its
characters and themes together in an emotionally satisfying way.
</P>
<P>
   But the performances are consistently enjoyable, especially
Giamatti (``Man On the Moon,'' ``Saving Private Ryan''), who gives
a riveting portrayal of a small man who discovers a big hole in the
American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   Director Paltrow and screenwriter John Byrum do a solid job of
capturing karaoke's addictive appeal, as well as convincing us it
represents a rebellion against the packaged entertainment of media
conglomerates, and thus a modest triumph of the human spirit.

COMMENTARY: WINGING IT IN BUFFALO 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Lazio, the New York Senate Republican nominee, was supposed
to be the likable candidate. Then this week, at a debate in
Buffalo, the congressman morphed into a political predator. Darth
Vader with dimples. A suburban Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Long
Island Lex Luthor. Richard Hatch with clothes on.
</P>
<P>
   We're getting carried away. As did Lazio. He called Hillary
Rodham Clinton ``shameless,'' and invaded her space, stalking
across the stage waving a campaign finance pledge. When a question
about her husband's affair with Monica Lewinsky left her looking as
if she'd had the wind knocked out of her, Lazio eagerly piled on
with a verbal kidney punch.
</P>
<P>
   Now this is a guy who's supposed to be romancing the suburban
women voters. People, how many times do we have to point out that
women do not like men who yell? This is the cardinal law of modern
American politics, not to mention modern American life. Why do you
think the Republicans nominated George W. Bush? Why is Al Gore
spending so much time hanging around Joe Lieberman? It's because
they are non-yell guys. (Dick Cheney does not generally raise his
voice, but he always looks as if he wants to.)
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has got to know all this. But perhaps he feels he's so
puppylike, no one will notice he's been gnawing away on Clinton's
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The debate began really well for the congressman, whose mission
was to show that he had some gravitas. He seemed aggressive, but
not, you know, crazed. Clinton was so much on the defense that at
one point she resorted to saying that Lazio had ``chutzpah,'' a
word that Midwestern Methodists should really try to avoid. She
kept monotonously invoking Newt Gingrich. If the Clinton campaign
were into subliminal advertising, all the footage of Lazio would be
interrupted by pictures of a small salamander.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio turns out to be one of those politicians with no
thermostat. Having started hot, he just got louder and louder. By
the end, he had charged over to Clinton's lectern and thrust a
no-soft-money pledge under her nose, demanding ``Sign it! Right
now!''
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic point in the debate came when the moderator,
Tim Russert, replayed Clinton's ``Today'' show interview in 1998,
the one where she assured the nation that her husband had not had
sex with that woman. Russert asked if she regretted ``misleading
the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   All of us have moments in our lives that we prefer not to recall
even while cowering in a darkened closet. Clinton's just happens to
be stored in the files of every news bureau on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Russert's tape, she looked as if she had been
sideswiped by a truck. This is a woman who delivers off-the-cuff
remarks in long sentences filled with perfectly conjugated
dependent clauses, none of them dangling. Her answer to Russert's
question, however, contained 23 ``um's'' along with several ``you
know's.'' The gist of it was that she had trusted her husband, who
lied to her and then let her hang herself, on camera, during
morning drive time.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was invited to respond, giving him an excellent
opportunity to say something like ``Tim, let's go back to that
great point I made about health care a few minutes ago.'' Instead
he piled right on, accusing Clinton of ``blaming others every time
you have a responsibility.'' (When it comes to finding a scapegoat
for anything relating to the Lewinsky episode, the president seems
like a really excellent choice.)
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio campaign has bought into the Clinton theory that
Hillary wins if the race becomes about issues. But the congressman
was actually doing fine when he was attacking her record on health
care and education reform in Arkansas. The truth is that Clinton
wins if the race is about her marriage, and loses if we wind up
arguing about the success of the Little Rock school system.
</P>
<P>
   But New York is a land of many great traditions, one of which is
that our big Senate races should be very, very fierce battles that
wind up focusing with laserlike intensity on something utterly
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the town meeting but, you know, we make do with what we
have.

`ALMOST FAMOUS' IS ROCK SOLID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coming as it does on the heels of the most intensely raunchy and
witless summer in Hollywood history _ a season Variety editor Peter
Bart feared might ``kill the art of movie comedy forever'' _ the
timing of Cameron Crowe's ``Almost Famous'' could hardly be better.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only the most gentle and effortlessly funny movie so
far this year, it's a film with a style and sensibility that
wonderfully harkens back to Hollywood's golden age of sophisticated
comedy, and in particular to the masterpieces of Crowe's filmmaking
idol, Billy Wilder.
</P>
<P>
   Without a major star in its cast, it may not prove to be as big
a hit as Crowe's 1996 ``Jerry Maguire,'' but it's every bit as good
a movie. If there's any justice in the world, it should earn the
Seattle-based director a third Oscar nomination, and establish him
as the industry's comedy filmmaker to beat.
</P>
<P>
   The film (which, until within weeks of its completion, was
called ``The Untitled Cameron Crowe Project'') is his
autobiographical, coming-of-age memoir, playing off his legend as a
rock journalist in the early '70s, when he was Rolling Stone's
youngest staff writer and editor.
</P>
<P>
   His surrogate character is William Miller (Patrick Fugit), an
awkward, withdrawn, 15-year-old San Diego rock fan who, in 1973, is
inspired to become a music journalist after meeting with pioneering
rock critic Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman).
</P>
<P>
   One day after school, he gets a phone call from Rolling Stone
editor Ben Fong-Torres, who's impressed by Miller's unsolicited
submissions, assumes he's an adult and hires him sight unseen to
cover rising rock band Stillwater on its ``Almost Famous'' tour of
America.
</P>
<P>
   From this setup, the movie follows Miller's inside point of view
through the circus of a '70s rock tour, with its glamour, groupies
and ego clashes, all the time with him trying to dodge the endless,
cautionary phone calls from his mother (Frances McDormand) and to
disguise the fact that he's a kid.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the movie segues into an offbeat love triangle
involving the boy journalist, a beautiful 16-year-old groupie (or
``band-aid,'' as she calls herself) named Penny Lane (Kate Hudson)
and Stillwater's charismatic, self-destructive guitarist, Russell
Hammond (Billy Crudup) _ all of whom learn a valuable lesson in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   This is essentially what the movie is ``about,'' but the
description doesn't really give any indication of the pleasure it
engenders: the ingratiating charm of the characters, the delicacy
and spice of the dialogue, or the warmth, wit and honesty that
manages to shine through in every scene.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe's study of Billy Wilder that culminated in his landmark
1999 book, ``Conversations With Wilder,'' constantly displays
itself not just in small tributes to individual Wilder films, but
in its distinctly Wilderesque staging and compositions. With its
high-polish scenes and unpretentious camera work, it looks and
feels like a classic comedy from the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Also, like the best of Wilder, there's a perfection to the
casting and subtlety in the performances that's rare in modern
comedy. Hudson, who lights up the world with her smile, and Crudup,
who took the rock-star part after Brad Pitt unwisely stepped out at
the last minute, are so magnetic they should both ride their parts
to bona fide stardom.
</P>

   As might be expected from a personal memoir by a major rock
journalist, Crowe's film is also a valentine to the music of his
formative years, and his numerous musical collaborators (including
musical supervisor Danny Bramson, and rock artists Nancy Wilson and
Peter Frampton) have done an extraordinary job of evoking the era
with a musical environment that uses pieces from 50 classic (and a
few new) songs.
</P>
<P>
   In his interviews, Crowe has strongly maintained that he did not
set out to make a genre ``nostalgia'' movie, but _ like it or not _
``Almost Famous'' is a '70s nostalgia movie par excellence. It is
the most good-natured and visually epic of all the many recent
movie bows to that more innocent and optimistic time when
mainstream rock was a coalescing force that bound a generation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DECATUR, Ill. _ In April 1990, just months before the
Bridgestone/Firestone plant here began making tires for Ford
Explorers, John J. Boettner, the plant manager, gave a speech at
the local Kiwanis club saying that the company had spent millions
of dollars to modernize the 30-year-old plant.
</P>
<P>
   The quality ``is the highest in the plant's history,'' Boettner
said. ``And we're building the most complicated product.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, the huge plant, on the northeast side of this
working-class city, has become Exhibit A in one of the biggest tire
recalls ever.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone and Ford Motor Co. say that an unusually high number
of tires produced at the plant were prone to tread separation. And
on Tuesday, a Firestone executive told a Senate committee that the
company now believes that design flaws and ``manufacturing
variances'' at the plant were chiefly to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery everyone is trying to crack, though, seems far less
of a mystery in Decatur, where about 40 percent of the recalled
tires were made, in a process that still depends largely on workers
building tires by hand. Interviews with more than two dozen current
and former employees suggest that heavy production demands and lax
quality control were basic causes. And workers maintain that
despite what Firestone says, a prolonged and bitter strike in the
mid-90's played a big part.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when four former plant employees gave depositions
criticizing the plant's operations, Firestone dismissed the
accusations as those of disgruntled former employees. But now,
other retired employees and workers still in the plant are saying
similar things.
</P>
<P>
   Though many workers insist that they followed the rules and
produced the best tires they knew how, several say that rubber was
allowed to sit too long, that solvents were used haphazardly to try
to improve the rubber's adhesive properties, and that efforts to
speed up the vulcanization process may have led to flawed tires.
</P>
<P>
   Some workers also say that poor supervision of the tire-making
process and poor training of new workers persisted after a 10-month
strike ended in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Aldridge, who has worked at the plant since 1963, said he
noticed poorly trained workers and quality-control problems when he
returned after the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there'd be some kind of problem with the tires,'' he
said last week. ``I just didn't know it would be this serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and industry experts say they are zeroing in on
design and manufacturing flaws that would weaken the bonding of
tires. And they say quality-control lapses, like those some workers
mentioned, could be a critical reason tire treads shear off.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts of workers like Aldridge, as well as interviews
with industry experts and lawyers investigating the recall, paint a
portrait of a company and a plant that have struggled to keep costs
down and production in line with soaring demand for tires for
popular vehicles. They portray a company so eager to keep pace that
it delayed, neglected or even ignored design and manufacturing
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprisingly candid admission, Yoichiro Kaizaki, president
of the parent Bridgestone of Japan, said as much in a Tokyo news
conference on Monday, when he acknowledged that Bridgestone
executives ignored signs of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a problem with a Bridgestone tire,'' he said,
``our technology staff in Tokyo would rush to the site'' overseas
to help out. ``But if a problem arose with a Firestone tire, they
wouldn't do anything.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As a result, Firestone's recall of 6.5 million tires last month
now looks strikingly similar to its troubles in 1978, when it was
forced to ask buyers to return 14.5 million tires in what remains
the largest tire recall in history.
</P>
<P>
   Then as now, the company singled out the Decatur plant. (The
initial recall involved about 400,000 tires made in Decatur.) And
then as now, the cause was thought to be faulty manufacturing,
although this time many more factors seem to be involved, such as
the tendency of sport utility vehicles to roll over when they lose
a tire. At the time, Firestone officials said the plant had allowed
moisture to seep into the vulcanized tire, resulting in corrosion
of the steel belts and eventually _ often when tires reached high
temperatures _ tread separation.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Bridgestone/Firestone has not yet determined the
exact cause. An engineering professor at the University of
California at Berkeley has been hired to examine the problem. But
again, experts say, early indications are that something was
weakening the sliver of rubber that bonds the two steel belts
together below the surface of the treads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of this is about the steel bonding to the rubber,'' said
Alan Milner, a materials scientist and consultant in some lawsuits
against Firestone. ``The failures mostly start off with belt edge
separations, and then the treads come off.''
</P>
<P>
   Firestone has not yet come to that conclusion. It says it is
re-examining the design specifications of the recalled tires and
the width of the belt. The company is also looking at ``process
controls'' at the Decatur plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very evident there was something going on in
Decatur that caused this,'' John Lampe, an executive vice president
of Bridgestone/Firestone, said in an interview Thursday. ``When we
do something in the plant we want to do it the same exact way every
time. We don't want to see a variance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Firestone say the statistics on tread separations point
clearly to Decatur. Damage claims were sharply higher for tires
produced here. Firestone, for example, released a chart to Congress
this week that showed 356 damage claims for every million ATX tires
produced here. That was more than double the figure at the Wilson,
N.C., plant and nearly 10 times the figure for a plant in Oklahoma
City.
</P>
<P>
   Decatur also produced a vast majority of the tires listed in a
consumer warning issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration. On Sept. 1, the agency asked Firestone to recall an
additional 1.4 million tires. Firestone refused, saying it
interpreted the figures differently.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tires with the highest tread separation rate, company documents
show, were produced from 1994 to 1996, during and shortly after the
strike, which affected 4,200 employees. About 1,400 workers at the
plant went on strike at a time Decatur was also burdened by strikes
at Caterpillar and A.E. Staley, two of the city's other large
employers.
</P>
<P>
   The strike began in July 1994. A month later, Firestone began
hiring replacement workers, persuading some strikers to cross the
line. Things turned ugly, with some saying that this contributed to
defective tires. ``It takes two years to become a good tire
builder,'' said William Newton, a retired tire builder. ``By the
time I got back, I saw a lot of people who didn't know how to build
tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Boettner, the former plant manager, now retired, defended the
work done during the strike. ``We had a lot of technical people at
the plant,'' he said. ``We were monitoring things.''
</P>
<P>
   But workers say the number of scrap tires _ those thrown out
because of defects _ soared during the strike. Rubber stock piled
up and often became too dry to use. And supervisors and newly hired
employees were often called on to master highly skilled jobs to
keep the plant running.
</P>
<P>
   When workers returned in May 1995, they said many problems
lingered, partly because many seasoned workers retired.
</P>
<P>
   The company also started operating seven days a week. Employees
began working 12-hour shifts, often alternating between days and
nights _ a practice that was scrapped after numerous complaints.
``It made a difference in my workmanship,'' Newton said. ``My
production went down during the last four hours.''
</P>
<P>
   The basics of manufacturing tires, though, remained the same at
Firestone's biggest and oldest American plant, which today produces
more than 25,000 largely handmade tires a day.
</P>
<P>
   In giant red-brick buildings spread across 52 acres, rubber
components are mixed in a machine invented in the 1890s; workers
build tires piece by piece, with machines sifting and distributing
rubber, nylon, steel belts and other components. The raw tire is
still cooked _ or vulcanized _ in a steamy curing machine.
</P>
<P>
   This is the process that investigators are now focusing on.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone will not say what its experts have found. But tire
consultants involved in lawsuits against Firestone say they have
evidence that throughout the 1990s, Decatur was poorly managed and
proper procedures were either not in place or not followed. ``The
problem is bad housekeeping and bad material,'' a consultant, R.J.
Grogan, said. ``It's a weak rubber, and they don't take care of it;
they use stale stuff and freshen it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say the critical bond between the steel and rubber,
aided by the use of brass and other materials, may be flawed.
Investigators are trying to determine what solvents were used to
aid the adhesive process.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at Decatur say they commonly ``gassed,'' or sprayed, a
chemical solvent on the rubber to make it tackier. Several workers
say they were told to stop using the solvent in the last year.
Others say that it is still regularly applied, and that its use has
been common for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the strike they were using it all the time,'' said
Jared Thompson, a tire builder, ``because the quality of the
material going from one department to another wasn't as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Four former Decatur plant workers said in depositions that
solvents were employed to make use of otherwise unusable rubber,
that production quotas made thorough inspections nearly impossible,
and that plant conditions made it possible for moisture to seep
into the rubber linings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, industry experts say none of these factors are likely to
be a smoking gun. They say that there may have been design flaws,
and that poor quality control made Firestone tires more vulnerable
on heavier sport utility vehicles with tires that were
underinflated and driven in hot weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's partly a design and partly a manufacturing problem,''
said Dennis Carlson, who once tested tires for Michelin and is now
advising lawyers about the recall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many suspect one of the problems may be that the Decatur
plant uses older equipment than other plants and is only beginning
to switch to more highly automated technology that will reduce the
margin of error that comes in making tires by hand. The company has
spent about $60 million over the last few years on new equipment
that highly automates the process.
</P>
<P>
   Workers here, however, insist that they followed proper
procedures and that they never witnessed defective tires being
approved for shipment.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite some lapses they saw at the plant, many of them
suspect that the problem lies not with the Decatur plant but with
the Ford Explorer. The Decatur plant is a scapegoat, they say, and
that has many worried about the future of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to see the reputation of the plant tarnished,'' said
Roger Gates, union chief at Decatur. ``And I don't think the
reputation of the workers deserves to be tarnished.''

it's every bit as good.

NEW DOUBT IS CAST ON STUDY THAT BACKS VOUCHER EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Mass., Ohio, Calif., Mich., Calif.)   By KATE ZERNIKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, prominent researchers released a study showing
significant gains by black students who had been given vouchers to
help pay for private school. The finding lent support to backers of
voucher programs at a time when they have become an election-year
issue.
</P>
<P>
   But now a company that gathered data for the research in New
York, one of three cities studied, says the gains, as measured by
scores on standardized math and reading tests, were overstated by
the lead researcher, a Harvard professor known within the academic
community for his exuberant support of vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company says, in New York there was no significant
test-score difference between students who attended private school
on vouchers and those who stayed in public school.
</P>
<P>
   Bothered by what it describes as the exaggeration of the
report's claims, the company, Mathematica Policy Research of
Princeton, N.J., has now taken the unusual step of issuing a
statement that cautions against leaping to any policy conclusions.
Mathematica calls the original finding ``premature.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, led by Paul E. Peterson, director of the
Program on Education Policy and Governance at Harvard University,
acknowledge that the gains among black students who used vouchers
were concentrated heavily in Washington, where the improvement was
twice as great as in New York and one-third greater than in the
third city studied, Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview, Peterson stood by his characterization of
the overall result as significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``An average is an average,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study measured test scores among 1,400 poor students given
vouchers worth $1,700 a year to attend private school. While there
were no significant overall gains among students of other ethnic
groups, black students in their second year of private-school
attendance improved their test scores by 6.3 percentile points _ a
striking advance at a time when schools around the country are
trying to close a persistent gap between scores of white and black
students.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the study's results was powerful: In the week
after it was released, one professor counted 35 newspaper
editorials citing it as an argument for expanding voucher programs,
as ballot initiatives in California and Michigan would do.
</P>
<P>
   But the study also quickly came under attack from several
quarters, in part a reflection of how heated the debate over
vouchers has become.
</P>
<P>
   The study was initially criticized because it had been
underwritten by several conservative pro-voucher foundations. But
the more recent criticism has focused specifically on the way the
conclusions were arrived at, with even some of the researchers
saying the larger picture is much less positive than Peterson
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the upbeat conclusions' being based largely on
success in only one of the three cities, data from the study raised
questions about whether the poorest students would even use
vouchers _ a point not made when the report was released.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask the question, `When I offered students vouchers,
did I make a difference in their test scores?' right now you come
away saying `No, there's no impact,''' said David Myers of
Mathematica, who was a principal investigator for the study.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said in the report that the gains by black students
using vouchers were statistically significant in each city after
two years. But in the study's New York portion, which involved the
largest and most diverse group of students, the gains were limited
to sixth graders; the black students in Grades 3, 4, and 5 made no
gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the gains are so concentrated in this single group,
one needs to be very cautious in setting policy based on the
overall modest impacts on test scores,'' Myers said. ``We really
need to learn why this group stands out so much. Until we
understand it, we cannot place much policy weight on it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Peterson initially said the study's results were particularly
reliable because this was the first time students had been randomly
selected to receive vouchers; family background, then, would not
influence the results.
</P>
<P>
   But critics point out that a high percentage of students offered
the vouchers _ 47 percent in Washington, 46 percent in Dayton and
24 percent in New York _ did not use them, and that those who ended
up using them had higher family incomes and higher levels of parent
education and were less likely to be on welfare. This information
was not included in the report, although Peterson acknowledged it
in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in the two groups, the critics say, suggests that
the poorest students _ those whom politicians maintain vouchers
would most help _ may not use them.
</P>
<P>
   In follow-up interviews and surveys, Myers said, the parents say
they cannot afford private schools even with the help of vouchers,
or find that private schools do not have enough space for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Conroy, a professor of education and economics at
Stanford University, said, ``I'm worried that there are all sorts
of nonmeasurable characteristics of these kids that made it
difficult for them to get into these private schools. Even if they
got vouchers, they might not have been able to pay the other costs
associated with private schools, and even if they could pay, they
might not have been able to get into a private school.''
</P>
<P>
   Conroy is among a group of academics who have called on Peterson
to release his data so they can analyze the results, which were not
peer-reviewed. They question whether he adequately adjusted the
data for differences in income and parent education level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure to get something out at election time was a much
more dominant theme than the idea of letting it go through
review,'' said Henry M. Levin, a professor at Teachers College at
Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson dismissed the criticism, saying his work ``was looked
at by lots of people lots of times.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Let's just get this deal done right now,'' Rep.
Rick Lazio told Hillary Rodham Clinton at their debate on Wednesday
night, trying unsuccessfully to persuade her to sign a pledge
barring the use of so-called soft money in their Senate race. With
a stroke of the pen, Lazio declared, the two could alter the
landscape of modern-day politicking.
</P>
<P>
   But as with other issues debated, like health care, the
thrusting and parrying over soft money obscured a more complicated
reality. To begin with, while Clinton and Lazio insist that they
favor a ban on soft money in their contest and have issued
proposals to to adopt one, they cannot even agree on what soft
money is.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides presumably realize that an informal ban with no legal
force, drawn up by the very political consultants who have mastered
the art of injecting soft money into elections, would be difficult
to police.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be enough for the two candidates to forswear
raising soft money in the New York race: They would have to
persuade dozens of other politicians to do so as well, from state
party leaders to senators in Washington. Not to mention other
political groups, some of which are secretive about their
activities.
</P>
<P>
   So the calls for a ban are seen by some experts as a tactic
meant to paint the opposition as corrupt. ``I've seen a lot of
these pledges, and they are about political advantage, not about
results,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, an
advocacy group that lobbies for tighter campaign finance
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Wertheimer said the only way to rid the campaign finance system
of soft money would be to approve legislation pending in
Washington, which both candidates favor.
</P>
<P>
   The two campaigns continued their maneuvering Thursday, with
officials holding news conferences and issuing statements to
declare that their standard-bearer was the real reformer. But there
seemed no movement toward a deal.
</P>
<P>
   To many advocacy groups unhappy with the campaign finance
system, soft money is a major culprit because it essentially allows
politicians to circumvent the donation limits for federal races:
$1,000 for a primary and $1,000 for a general election.
</P>
<P>
   Political parties can raise soft money in unlimited amounts from
anyone, including unions and corporations. The parties can legally
spend it only on so-called party-building activities, like voter
drives, not on items that help candidates' campaigns. But the
parties have sidestepped the restriction by using soft money to buy
commercials that promote or criticize candidates without directly
mentioning the elections.
</P>
<P>
   In alliance with Democratic leaders, Clinton has raised several
million dollars in soft money _ it is hard to pin down amounts
because the donations are channeled through different committees _
in addition to the nearly $22 million in so-called hard dollars she
has collected for her official campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has taken in $19.2 million for his campaign committee, and
has so far not collected soft money, but he has benefited from
spending by Republican committees and outside groups independent of
the political parties, like the Republican Leadership Council,
which backs moderate Republicans. Technically, this outside
spending is not soft money because it is not done by parties, but
it is effectively the same.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has repeatedly called on Clinton to forgo the use of soft
money. She has responded that she would if Lazio could persuade the
outside groups to stay out of the race. The Clinton campaign says
it considers outside spending in its definition of soft money. The
Lazio campaign has usually referred to soft money as that spent
only by parties.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, wrote to his
counterpart on the Clinton campaign, Bill de Blasio, that if
Clinton agreed to a ban, Lazio would send letters to these outside
groups asking that they ``immediately cease and desist from any
political activities designed in any way to influence the outcome
of this election.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many of these groups would oblige.
</P>
<P>
   De Blasio responded with a letter in which he called on the
Lazio campaign first to obtain signed pledges from 14 groups that
the Clinton campaign believes are trying to defeat Clinton,
including the American Conservative Union and the Conservative
Leadership Political Action Committee.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, the candidates also tangled repeatedly over
health care, often relying on the same technique they employ in
their commercials: taking the other side's votes or positions and
casting them in the worst possible light.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio charged that Clinton had done nothing to stop her husband
from vetoing money for New York's hospitals, and Clinton said that
Lazio had backed Newt Gingrich's plan to cut $270 billion from
Medicare, the health program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was referring to billions of dollars in financing for
Medicaid, the health program for the poor, which the president
removed from the federal budget in 1997 using his line-item veto
power. Lazio did not mention that the Clinton administration later
tried to return most of the money, and that all the money was
restored after the Supreme Court overturned the president's
line-item veto power.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in describing the Medicare proposal, repeated a
frequent Democratic contention: that the Republicans wanted to
sharply reduce financing. In fact, the Republican plan would have
reduced the projected rate of growth of Medicare by $270 billion,
not cut existing allocations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also suggested that Lazio has opposed efforts in
Congress to approve a patients' bill of rights that would give
people more authority to sue their health maintenance
organizations. She did not note that Lazio favored an HMO bill
presented by the Republican leadership.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite all the talk about prosperity in this Digital Age, tax
return data indicates that the rising tide of bits and bytes is
lifting the yachts much more than the rowboats.
</P>
<P>
   From 1986 through 1997, the latest year for which detailed
figures are available from the IRS, the average income of the
richest 1 percent of Americans soared 89 percent, to $517,713 from
$273,562.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures are after federal income taxes have been paid, and
are given in constant 1997 dollars to eliminate the effects of
inflation. To be counted among the top 1 percent in 1997 required
an after-tax income of $268,889, suggesting a pre-tax income of
about $440,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the incomes of those at the top did not rise steadily over
the 12 years. The average declined from 1989 to 1991 because of a
mild recession. And it dropped again in 1993, but that is probably
a fluke, attributable to significant numbers of wealthy people who
had cashed in deferred bonuses and the like in anticipation of an
increase in the top income tax rate to 39.6 percent, a rate paid
only by the top 1 percent of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   During those same 12 years, the bottom 90 percent of Americans,
meaning everyone who took home $79,598 or less after federal income
taxes, did not fare nearly as well.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the average income for the bottom 90 percent was
$23,815, up a scant $364, or 1.6 percent, from 1986. This average
also fluctuated during the 12 years, but the changes up or down
were smaller than 2 percent in 11 of those years. The fluctuations
were so tiny that in the chart accompanying this article they
disappear, and the line appears flat.
</P>
<P>
   These figures were computed from an IRS statistics-of-income
report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit
Washington group that advocates policies that it says will benefit
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an interesting fact that was not in the center's report:
From 1996 to 1997, the increase in average income for the top 1
percent _ a gain of $69,009 _ was nearly triple the total average
income of the bottom 90 percent. That the increase at the top alone
would dwarf the total average income for the bottom 90 percent
illustrates the sharp divergence between the fortunes of the
economic elite and the rest of America.
</P>
<P>
   Over nine years of economic expansion, the question of whether
the fruits of the boom are being distributed fairly has become a
central one in American politics. Competing policy proposals from
Democrats and Republicans on issues ranging from taxation to health
care to retirement savings are often based on fundamentally
different interpretations of the available data, and the quality
and reliability of the data itself is often hotly disputed by
advocates in each camp.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways to measure income, none of them perfect. Tax
return data like that studied by the center has the advantage of
coming from documents that all taxpayers sign under penalty of
perjury, and of being subject to comparison with W-2 and 1099-form
reports from third parties listing payments of wages, dividends,
interest and royalties. Rent and capital-gain income, which goes
mostly to the affluent, depends on self-reporting by those
receiving the income.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Wolff, a New York University economist who studies the
wealthy, said tax return data gives a reliable picture of those
with the highest incomes. But for the bottom 90, percent, he said,
``the figures are biased downward'' because a substantial amount of
Social Security and other income is not picked up on tax returns.
Another kind of income, from tax-free bonds and the like, is also
omitted from tax returns, but that type of income goes almost
entirely to the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Another widely used measure of income, the Census Bureau survey
data on median household income, also shows little change in
overall income from 1986 to 1997. Adjusted for inflation, the
median income rose just 1.5 percent during those years, to $37,005
in 1997 dollars. Unlike the tax data, the Census Bureau's survey
figures tend to understate incomes at the high end, because of the
methodology used to record large incomes. For example, the bureau
puts a cap on all income components, no matter how large, and for
example caps salaries at $999,999 as $999,999 for survey purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Those who report the greatest share of the nation's income also
pay the greatest share of income taxes. In 1997, the IRS data
shows, those with incomes of $100,000 or more, about 5.9 percent of
all taxpayers, made 34.5 percent of all the money and paid 53.7
percent of the income taxes collected that year.

 &HT;    Allied Holdings blames tire recall for downturn
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Allied Holdings' third-quarter loss will be more than
double analysts' earlier estimates because of fallout from
Firestone's tire recall, the Decatur, Ga.,-based car hauler warned
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus estimate was for a $2 million loss, or 24 cents a
share, for the quarter ending Sept. 30, according to First Call and
Nelson Information/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   But Allied Holdings said it expects to report a loss for the
quarter of 50 to 60 cents a share, or about $4 million to $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Holdings said it has transported 39,000 fewer Ford
sport-utility vehicles and light trucks than expected because of
Ford's decision to shut down three plants to make more tires
available during the recall.
</P>
<P>
   Allied transports vehicles from all three of the plants in St.
Paul, Minn., St. Louis and Edison, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The hauler gets about $95 for each vehicle it transports from
plants to dealers, said Kevin Feeney, an Allied Holdings vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   The company said revenue also will be lower than expected
because of extended plant shutdowns by other automakers. Allied
Holdings' shares closed Thursday at $5.88, up 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone recalled about 6.5 million tires on Aug. 9 after
receiving complaints of blowouts and peeling treads involving its
15-inch Firestone ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT tires. The tires
were installed on Ford's Explorer SUVs, light trucks and other
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has received
more than 1,400 complaints about Firestone tires, including reports
of 88 deaths. The agency also issued a safety warning on up to two
dozen other Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recall's impact on the third quarter, Allied
Holdings expects to meet analysts' earnings estimates of 77 cents a
share for the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Holdings Chief Executive A. Mitchell Poole Jr. said he is
``confident that our strategic initiatives and corporate
realignment have positioned the company to achieve the positive
earnings we expect in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's projections are based on Ford resuming production
at the three plants by the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Ford plans to decide this weekend whether to extend the closing
of the three plants. The closing freed up about 100,000 tires for
customers.

 &HT;    A moment with Chuck Smith
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carolina defensive end Chuck Smith called the other day to talk
about the Falcons, past and present. He spewed minimal venom.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he spent most of a 15-minute teleconference laughing,
rhapsodizing about former teammates and philosophizing about
Atlanta left tackle Bob Whitfield, his dear friend.
</P>
<P>
   The two men stood in each other's weddings earlier this year.
Sunday in Ericsson Stadium, they might stand in each other's way.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield, the only player Atlanta selected before Smith in the
1992 draft, started Thursday's odd exchange when he talked about
Smith, whose 58 1/2 sacks (1992-99) are second in franchise history
to the 62 1/2 of Claude Humphrey (1968-74, 1976-78).
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck's probably putting chicken bones in a bag, shakin' em
all up, and putting a voodoo curse on me,'' Whitfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith cackled loudly in reply. His trademark sound was heard
rarely in Atlanta last season, when he battled a sprained right big
toe and right knee, boomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That boy is sick,'' he said. ``I'm worried about Bob. He'll
take a personal foul just to rattle you. I taught him that; I got
to watch out for it. He's my dog, and we're going to go at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Smith's right knee and Carolina coach George Seifert will
decide whether the old dogs go at it Sunday when the Falcons (1-1)
play at Carolina (1-1).
</P>
<P>
   That knee played a role in the Falcons' decision not to bring
Smith back once he became an unrestricted free agent in February.
</P>
<P>
   He tore the anterior cruciate ligament in a game in 1994, and he
has had degenerative arthritis in it since. He had arthroscopic
surgery a few months ago and still is re-gaining strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are talking about signing people, everything comes
into play,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves said. ``There was no secret
he had problems with his knee.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons never called Smith's agent, Jimmy Sexton, with a
contract offer ``because they would never give us a figure,''
Reeves said last offseason. ``You had to think they were thinking
of a huge number.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to a deal came when Sexton called general
manager Harold Richardson last September after the team gave
defensive tackle Travis Hall a seven-year, $51.5 million extension.
</P>
<P>
   Sexton asked: Why extend a guy who has three years left on his
contract before Chuck?
</P>
<P>
   Richardson told Sexton that Smith could have the same deal,
complete with the $5.1 million signing bonus, that day.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Sexton held out, mindful that the Colts in 1999 gave
defensive end Chad Bratzke a $9 million signing bonus and that
Tampa gave end Chidi Ahonotu a five-year, $30 million contract with
a $6 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Smith performed, ailments and all. He led the team with 10
sacks, 27 quarterback pressures and six fumbles caused. He added 84
tackles and finished second in the point system that coaches use to
grade defensive players.
</P>
<P>
   But the free-agent market was not kind.
</P>
<P>
   He passed on a nice offer from Green Bay to sign a five-year,
$21.5 million deal in Carolina, with a $4.5 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, in the end, the fact he'll get to play against
Atlanta twice a year was important,'' Sexton said in February.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said: ``In the beginning, I guess I was more disappointed
that no one ever said, `Hey, Chuck, we're not going to be able to
mess with you, or we don't think your knee is good, or the money's
not right.' Instead, I was just kind of left to the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, I started thinking of the good times,'' he said. ``Dan
was cool. (Defensive-line coach) Bill Kollar, (offensive-line
coach) Art Shell, I attribute a lot of the stuff I learned to those
guys. I don't have (any) hard feelings. I was proud to be a
Falcon.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield was asked if Smith is angry
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' he said. ``(Smith) would have loved to have
stayed here his whole career, but _ things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith talks regularly with former teammates, including Patrick
Kerney, who helped bump Smith and former Falcons defensive end
Lester Archambeau out of work. Kerney was Smith's neighbor at Lake
Lanier, where both own homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, my house is just two minutes from the new complex,''
Smith said. ``Tell one of those cats to buy my house. I keep
telling Pat, `Keep playing hard, and then you can get a big
contract and upgrade to my house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go to (kicker) Morten Andersen's house all the time,
about five minutes on my jet ski. Those guys are my dogs. I want
`em to win every week, except this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has not seen the last of Chuck Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers visit the Georgia Dome on Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Atlanta,'' Smith said. ``I'm coming down there after
football, and I'm going to get one of those radio or TV jobs.''

 &HT;    Sydney perfect Games venue
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ A bloke pauses in mid-alfresco-mouthful. A moment is
upon him on this night as perfectly chilled as the Australian wine.
</P>
<P>
   The grilled rudderfish would wait. A mental image is begging to
be stored. Check the copper moon pasted above the skyline. Freeze
Darling Harbor as it catches the lights to jewel its surface.
Remember the surprising burst of fireworks competing with the
stars.
</P>
<P>
   And the bloke can't help thinking: Looks like it will be another
four years before Atlanta gets the chance to look any better by
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   A bloke goes to work each morning _ leaving the asylum that
required only minor renovations to house sportswriters _ and passes
an aviary stocked with squawking, garishly colored native birds.
When he gets back at night, he makes out the faint forms of
kangaroos hopping about in the next pen.
</P>
<P>
   C'mon. It's just not fair. Between the Old World beauty of
Barcelona and the emerging exotica of Sydney there sits Atlanta, a
soccer mom outflanked by divas.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this same bloke can imagine few places on the planet he
would rather live than Atlanta. At the same time, he knows there
are several cities better to visit for 16 days of sport that don't
involve Southern youth meeting at the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   The weight of new experiences is just too great. It overwhelms
even the stoutest provincial sort.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics are all about competition. How, then, is Atlanta to
compete against the terrain of Sydney, a place where it seems the
Creator has pressed a hand into the shore and the prints since have
been so gratefully adorned?
</P>
<P>
   How perfect is this: They have an opera house that you don't
have to go inside to enjoy. No need to endure a single aria. The
experience is over before the fat lady sings.
</P>
<P>
   Just above the Opera House, a bloke wanders into a bar, not an
uncommon Australian experience. His party is joined by a local
worker in a floppy hat and a ZZ Top-standard-issue beard. He is
asked to be part of a simple photo.
</P>
<P>
   Hang on a sec, the gent says. He turns away, as if to fix his
makeup. But when he swings back, he has combed his beard up over
his face, anchored the effect with a pair of sunglasses and stuck a
smoldering cigarette into the thicket, risking a major brushfire.
Australia's Cousin It. These people are just too eager to please.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you'd wish a disaster on anyone. But maybe Athens could
stage enough logistical problems _ a brownout here, a phone outage
there _ in 2004 to boost the memory of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The real work of the current Summer Olympics begins Saturday.
Before then, a chance to play. First a trip by the Rosehill Gardens
Racecourse, where the nags run clockwise on turf while Sinatra
plays overhead, more challenges to the American eye and ear. Then
on to the Star City Casino, a huge, Vegas-style place in the back
pocket of downtown. A bloke watches them gather round a small pit
and loudly wager on the toss of two coins. He gets more serious at
the blackjack tables and manages to lift a bit of yellow and purple
money from the place.

   It might just all come together for the Sydneysiders, darn them.
They get to put on their Games in their spring, when the air is
clean and fresh. The U.S. dollar is strong and the value high.
Their citizens seem in a mood to make this work.
</P>
<P>
   A cavernous Olympic Stadium awaits the real business of the
Games. Radiating outward is a couple city blocks of gleaming
facilities that promise a matchless concentration of energy and
excitement. They'd really have to make an effort to blow it from
here.
</P>
<P>
   There's a long way to go before the 2000 Games are safely in the
books. Still, upon entering, a bloke from another venue that would
be worldly, kicks himself for thinking it, but think it he does:
Just as every Super Bowl should be in New Orleans, every Olympics
should be here.

GRASS-ROOTS BUSINESS: A FINE PLACE TO WORK, BUT CAN YOU FLY
THERE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 17)

<P>
   RENO, Nevada _ Like a modern-day conquistador, Roger Norman
surveys a vast expanse of open brush and sage, and dreams of El
Dorado.
</P>
<P>
   He has plans to turn his 104,000 empty acres here into the
Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, the largest industrial park in North
America, with 120 million square feet of industrial and warehouse
space, power plants, movie studios and even a racetrack. He is sure
that he could fill it with new-economy tenants, as he has done at
South Meadow, a smaller project closer to Reno that is near
completion.
</P>
<P>
   Only one ingredient is missing, he said: A sky filled with
planes heading toward Reno's modern airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't build things fast enough here,'' said Norman, 37.
``But without the air traffic, how do we accommodate the growth
that wants to come here?''
</P>
<P>
   Before November 1998, there were plenty of flights to Reno, most
of them flown by Reno Air, an independent carrier that had grown to
serve a large chunk of the West. Then AMR, the parent of American
Airlines, acquired Reno Air for $124 million and began reducing
service. Despite complaints from business and political leaders,
the number of nonstop flights on all airlines to Reno _ 127 daily
from 28 cities in 1997 _ has fallen to just 88 daily from 12
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons lie in the economics of the hub-and-spoke route
systems operated by American and other large carriers, according to
Dale Morris, a spokesman for the airline. Most passengers are
routed through a few high-volume hub airports, like American's at
Dallas-Fort Worth, where they catch connecting flights to their
final destinations. Away from the hubs, only the most popular
routes have nonstop service, and according to Morris, ``secondary
markets'' like Reno ``don't have the lift'' to warrant many direct
flights.
</P>
<P>
   Reno is a conservatively minded, pro-business city, and people
here acknowledge the capitalist logic of American's stance. But
they had grown used to the broader service that their hometown
airline had provided, and its disappearance leaves them fearing for
Reno's long-term ability to compete with other cities in the
region, most notably Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Developers like Norman worry that demand for ambitious projects
already in the pipeline will be undercut if prospective tenants
find it a nuisance to get in and out of town by air.
Gaming-industry executives worry that making Reno less accessible
will further widen the gap between Reno's casinos and those in Las
Vegas, and perhaps make Reno more vulnerable to competition from
new Indian-owned casinos springing up in California.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns are increasingly commonplace in ``second-tier''
cities, said John Kasarda, president of the Kenan Institute for
Private Enterprise at the University of North Carolina. The
hub-and-spoke air traffic system leaves even rapidly growing cities
like Reno feeling marginalized.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a matter of tourism. For a city that wants to keep
growing, being an easily accessible air hub _ what Kasarda calls an
``aerotropolis'' _ is crucial to attracting high-technology and
Internet businesses and investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic commerce companies in particular, with their emphasis
on speed as a competitive advantage, have come to understand that
warehousing and handling goods in places where they can be rapidly
and efficiently distributed is just as vital to their success as
having plenty of bandwidth and server capacity: More than 70
percent of e-commerce sales are shipped through express delivery
services, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Businesspeople in the technology sector travel more than their
counterparts in the traditional economy, Kasarda said _ in some
studies, up to four times as much.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not surprising that even cities with everything else
going for them _ from land to tax rates to infrastructure _ can
find their growth threatened by a lack of direct air service.
Metropolitan areas like Tulsa, Okla., and Raleigh-Durham, N.C.,
have wrestled with perceived air-service shortfalls in recent
years, and have galvanized political and business leaders to find
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrations over the paucity of flights to Wisconsin in the
early 1980s even prompted Kimberly-Clark, the paper products giant
then with headquarters near Milwaukee, to lease a Boeing 737 and
begin running its own airline. The service was opened to the public
in 1984 as Midwest Express, and has since been spun off as a
separate company.
</P>
<P>
   What the Renos, Tulsas and Raleighs care most about are nonstop
flights to major business centers like New York, Chicago, Los
Angeles and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many midsized cities have become preoccupied about this,''
Kasarda said. ``They see it as key to their economic development.
Businesspeople hate to change planes and listen to the music at
O'Hare. Time is money for these people.''
</P>
<P>
   In Reno, business and political leaders are casting about for
ways to entice other airlines to expand service to Reno and replace
the flights that American has trimmed. American, Southwest Airlines
and other carriers have been visited by officials here, but to date
the lobbying has not paid off.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Randolph Townsend, who represents the city and is the
chairman of the legislature's commerce and labor committee, said
the state is considering incentives ranging from state contracts to
reductions in fuel taxes and landing fees to obliging airlines,
including start-up regional carriers like Allegiant Air, based in
Fresno, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that such proposals run counter to the free-market
ideology that dominates politics here; loss of direct air service
could ``really hurt in the long run,'' Townsend said, even though
job and income-growth statistics in the Reno area have yet to show
definite signs of weakening.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But a harbinger of losses may be visible in the recent decision
by Reno's largest manufacturer, International Game Technology, to
keep its 300-person sales and marketing operation in Las Vegas,
where executives and technicians have access to a much wider array
of flights to places around the county and, increasingly, the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the company, Tom Butler, said that operating
from Reno with its current level of air service meant adding up two
extra days to every trip to the East Coast or overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to locate today,'' he said, ``we'd put everything
in Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler became head of the company, whose plant is in Norman's
South Meadows industrial park, in 1996, before American acquired
Reno Air.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, ``it bugs customers when we have to bring them
here, and it takes away one of the things that would help bring
sophisticated employees here.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller businesses smart at the loss of service, too. Addi
Gallery has exhibition space in Reno, Maui and most recently Las
Vegas; it also has a new Internet-based art business called
GalleryRow.com. Winifred Addi, the company's chief operating
officer, said that the loss of Reno Air's former direct service to
Orange County, Calif., and San Diego kept potential customers away
from her Reno location, and that cutbacks in flights to San Jose
had hampered development of the Web site part of the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a meeting with 25 top representatives of Bay Area and
Orange County tech companies, and people just didn't want to wait
around,'' she said. ``They were all worrying about how to catch a
flight to get themselves home. If the meeting had been in a place
like L.A., we could have started earlier and gone into the evening.
It really hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest potential losers are the casinos, which remain the
bulwark of the region's economy. Glen Carano, marketing director
for the Silver Legacy Casino in downtown Reno, said the loss of
convenient service to Orange County, San Diego and other markets
threatened to depress an important category of business _ bookings
for large conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge when it's tough to get here, and I am going
to have a hard time getting them to come,'' Carano said. ``We sit
here and think we are at the center of the world, but you've got
travel planners with thousands of markets and hundreds of airports
to look at. We are just a little pimple to them.''

OUT ON THE ROAD TO BURNING MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 17) 
 By ABBY ELLIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I haven't yet seen a Burning Man sticker on a Cadillac. But when
I do, it won't surprise me. That is because Burning Man, the annual
weeklong festival of arts, music and ``radical self-expression'' in
the Nevada desert, is rapidly seeping into mainstream American
culture _ or is it the other way around?
</P>
<P>
   Like many other things countercultural and groovy, Burning Man
started in the Bay Area, when Larry Harvey built and burned an
effigy on a San Francisco beach in 1986. Publicized by word of
mouth and on the Web, the event caught the imagination of the
digerati and took on a life of its own. Sequels grew so big that
Harvey had to move the pyrotechnics to somewhere a bit less
populated _ a desolate stretch of federally owned desert 100 miles
north of Reno. This year's event culminated on Labor Day; about
28,000 people participated in the ephemeral makeshift community,
Black Rock City, that materializes for the annual torching of a
40-foot-high wood and neon figure.
</P>
<P>
   Burn Heads are loath to make the comparison, but the festival _
which draws so many people from Silicon Valley that it could easily
be called Burn Rate Man _ has much in common with a Grateful Dead
concert: Young and formerly young people camping out, enjoying
performance art (and maybe various levels of undress and altered
states of consciousness) and raging against the machine.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, Burning Man is anti-corporate, anti-consumerism,
anti-establishment; people cover over the Ryder logos on their
trucks and wear handmade outfits that reflect the Inner Them of the
Day. Hard currency will get you only coffee and ice at the
festival; you have to bring other supplies along with you, or
barter for them. Think ``Survivor'' without the lush foliage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burning Man co-opts people out of their rut and shows them a
different way of living, working, playing and communicating,'' said
Larry Smith, 32, the executive editor of Yahoo Internet Life
magazine, who has made the pilgrimage six times.
</P>
<P>
   I attended last year, and for all my skepticism, I have to say
that I had a hilarious, if slightly dehydrating, time. But what I
found there wasn't a digital-age Woodstock. It was more
fascinating: The Internet made flesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got your communities of affinity, viral marketing,
information pricing, users-provide-the-content approach, branding,
and Larry Harvey is the very essence of today's iconoclast-savant
CEO,'' said Brad Wieners, 32, editor of the book ``Burning Man''
(Hardwired, 1997). ``All that's missing is the IPO.''
</P>
<P>
   There are certainly enough dollars involved to go public.
Depending on when you buy your ticket, Burning Man can cost $95 to
$250. Multiply that by 28,000 and, well, you do the math. And how
anti-establishment can an event be when the managing editor of Time
magazine makes an appearance? Or when the Green Tortoise travel
company advertises package trips to the ``wildest experience you've
ever had''? Or when law firms send squads of employees in rented
RV's? What's next, a ``Let's Go: Black Rock City'' travel guide?
</P>
<P>
   Aly Eisenhardt, 22, a junior at Humboldt State University in
California who had attended Burning Man twice before, didn't go
this year. ``It's gotten too commercial, too big and too
hypocritical,'' Eisenhardt said. ``It's outside the value system of
what Burning Man was really about.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything underground and successful eventually becomes
commercial and overdone. Each generation has had its its own
counterculture jamboree; images of the Beats, Haight-Ashbury,
Monterey, the Dead, Nirvana, mosh pits and techno raves come to
mind. Before long, everyone else comes piling in and spoils the
fun. So, too, with the Web, some would say.
</P>
<P>
   But not with Burning Man. The dynamic is different. Most
participants are not rebellious teen-agers, but people in their 20s
and 30s with jobs and even companies of their own; more than a few
are stock-option millionaires. This generation may not openly
condone ``selling out,'' but it certainly doesn't frown on
capitalism and getting rich. By past counterculture standards,
``them'' equaled ``us'' from the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Wieners, who has seen seven Men burn, said that while the
festival has been ``legitimized by the establishment,'' that
doesn't mean that it is being destroyed. ``There are a lot of
paradoxes,'' he said. ``The guy who's the main instigator is making
his living off Burning Man, but has he sold out? It's not brought
to you by Budweiser. It's kept certain parameters. This year, some
of the art had a much higher production value, because artists are
getting grants from Burning Man. Is this bad?''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's discovering that play, folly, make-believe, the
way you spent afternoons in the early grades, is a valid thing for
an adult to do. It's what a whole lot of companies strive for.
Realizing that innovation comes from play, they want to encourage
it _ to a point.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But if play breeds innovation, and innovation breeds
productivity, and productivity breeds sales, one thing is clear:
Bumper stickers can't be far behind. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Gore spends star-studded evening on campaign trail in New York
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By PATTY REINERT
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore, who
earlier this week bashed the entertainment industry for marketing
sex and violence to children, taped a show with David Letterman
Thursday, then spent the evening at a multimillion-dollar
fund-raising extravaganza featuring such talent as Bette Midler,
Jimmy Buffett and Paul Simon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is faking his criticism of the Hollywood elite,''
Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson said at a
sidewalk news conference outside the fund-raiser at Radio City
Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore and (running mate) Joe Lieberman are cozying up with
them,'' he said, adding that criticizing Hollywood while taking its
money shows ``hypocrisy characteristic of Al Gore's career.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane fired back that unlike Republican
nominee George W. Bush, Gore is capable of accepting financial
support from his friends and still stand up to them when he
believes they are wrong. He cited Bush and running mate Dick
Cheney's ties to the oil and health insurance industries and
campaign promises Lehane said are aimed at protecting them.
</P>
<P>
   Gore tried to emphasize that point earlier in the day, telling
students, teachers and parents at a middle school in Manchester,
N.H., that he will fight companies that aggressively target minors
with advertising for adult music, movies and video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's wrong and it has to be stopped,'' Gore said. ``It's
hard enough to raise a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated the message at Thursday evening's fund-raiser,
expected to bring in $5 million to $7 million for the Democratic
National Committee. It was produced by Miramax Films' Harvey
Weinstein, Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner and VH1 president
John Sykes.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Michael Douglas was emcee.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy Granata, spokeswoman for Miramax, issued a statement
saying that even before Monday's release of a Federal Trade
Commission report critical of the entertainment industry's
advertising practices, Miramax had voluntarily developed new
guidelines to give parents more information for judging what films
are appropriate for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax films include Academy Award winners ``Life is
Beautiful,'' ``The English Patient'' and ``Shakespeare in Love,''
in addition to the ultra-violent ``Pulp Fiction'' and the
controversial ``Kids,'' which portrays a group of New York
teen-agers whose lives revolve around riding skateboards, having
sex and abusing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Among other performers Thursday night were Sheryl Crow, Lenny
Kravitz, Jon Bon Jovi, k.d. lang and Crosby, Stills and Nash. Actor
Harrison Ford was listed as a special guest.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gore and Lieberman attended a fund-raising
barbecue in Boston where singer James Taylor performed. That
dinner, along with a luncheon earlier, netted $2.5 million for the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Gore and wife Tipper attended an $800,000
fund-raising concert in suburban Philadelphia with Cher, Michael
Bolton, Luther Vandross and Sister Sledge.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday's show, Gore walked onto the set of
``Letterman'' to the Prince song, ``Kiss,'' and joked about the
now-famous big kiss he gave wife Tipper Gore on the stage of last
month's Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been surprised at the amount of commentary and reaction
to it because to me, that was just a little peck,'' Gore joked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al, how long have you been on the road?'' Letterman responded.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also shook hands with an audience member featured earlier
in the show. The cowboy hat-wearing man identified himself as
``Craig'' and said he runs the hardware store in Lampasas, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, wearing a gray suit, white shirt and blue tie, also
answered several serious questions from Letterman, commenting on
the release from jail of Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee and a Gore
aide's receipt of a package containing debate preparation materials
from the campaign of Republican opponent George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But the highlight of the show was Gore's reading of Letterman's
trademark Top 10 _ this one listing rejected Gore-Lieberman
campaign slogans. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Vote for me or I'll come to your home and explain my
191-page economic plan in excruciating detail.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Remember America: I gave you the Internet and I can take it
away.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``With Gore-Lieberman, you don't have to worry about
pork-barrel politics'' and ``With Lieberman on the ticket, you get
all kinds of fun new days off'' _ both references to Lieberman's
strict observance of the Jewish Sabbath, holidays and dietary
rules. ``Vote for us,'' Gore added to that one. ``We're gonna work
24-6.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``We know the microphone is on,'' alluding to Bush's off-color
characterization of a reporter that was picked up by a live mike.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 1: ``I'll be twice as cool as that president guy on `The
West Wing.' ''

   THE AD SEASON
</P>
<P>
   Television stations around the country are expected to benefit
from this year's bounty of political commercials to the tune of $1
billion, according to a Washington group that pushes for better
campaign coverage by the news media. The Alliance for Better
Campaigns, which is headed by Paul Taylor, a former political
reporter, released data showing that as of July 31, local
television stations in the top 75 media markets had already taken
in $211 million from the broadcast of 286,737 spots. The bulk of
the commercials appear in the final months leading up to the
November election. At a news conference, Taylor, joined by Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., called on local stations to devote five
minutes of their news programs to issues and discourse by the
candidates on each of the last 30 days of the campaign, as
recommended by a presidential commission. Thus far, the alliance
said, only 42 stations, or 3 percent of the industry, have said
they will try to meet that standard.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGNING WITH A LAUGH TRACK
</P>
<P>
   He'll keep his day job, but for a frustrated comedian like Sen.
Joseph I. Lieberman, appearances Thursday on NBC's ``Late Night
with Conan O'Brien'' and Comedy Central's ``The Daily Show with Jon
Stewart'' were a fantasy come true. To prepare for the vice
presidency, Lieberman told Stewart: ``I've been watching old Carson
reruns to learn from Ed McMahon what I should do. `Yes, sir, I
never thought of that, that was brilliant.''' Does the vice
president get a house, Stewart asked. ``A small trailer,'' the
senator said. ``No, actually, it's the Naval Observatory. Naval as
in Navy. I don't want you to think _'' ``That was the last
administration,'' Stewart shot back. Lieberman, the first Jew on a
major party's national ticket, told O'Brien that he and Vice
President Al Gore are considering new slogans, like

   By loudly criticizing Hollywood for its glorification of
violence and sex, the Republican and Democratic presidential
tickets have stolen one of the issue horses that Pat Buchanan has
ridden in his many campaigns. Not to be outdone, Buchanan, who now
appears to be the official candidate of the Reform Party, has
scheduled a speech for Monday on ``Hollywood and the Cultural
War,'' which a press release described as a ``battle cry.'' The
location of the speech is almost as telling as the subject: Bob
Jones University in Greenville, S.C., a favorite conservative
audience of Buchanan's and one that Gov. George W. Bush addressed
this year before the South Carolina primary. Bush was criticized
for that appearance because of certain university policies, but
those have never bothered Buchanan. ``It'll be a good one,''
promises Buchanan's press director, Brian Doherty.

A BACK-TO-SCHOOL OFFER FOR RETIREES: FULL SALARY AND FULL
PENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WYATT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In a stark concession to the seriousness of New
York state's shortage of qualified teachers, the Board of Regents
said Thursday that it would ask the Legislature to approve a
measure allowing retired teachers to return to the classroom and
draw a full salary while continuing to receive their pension
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers who accept the offer must agree to teach in a
low-performing school or in a subject area, like math or science,
where schools are having a difficult time attracting qualified
teachers. The program is aimed at attracting teachers to the 173
districts and up to 1,000 schools that the state classifies as
low-performing or high-need, and includes the roughly 100 schools
that are in danger of being closed for their poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   The increased costs of hiring the more experienced teachers
would be borne by the school districts, although the state has been
allocating more funds in recent years for special recruitment
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is likely to enjoy bipartisan support among
legislators and the governor's office, government officials said
Thursday. The Republicans in the Senate introduced a similar
measure last spring, but it was ultimately dropped from an
education package signed into law by Gov. George Pataki in May.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Conway, a spokesman for Pataki, said in response to
Thursday's developments that the governor ``is very pleased that
the Regents share the governor's belief that teacher recruitment is
a major issue. We welcome their support in the ongoing effort to
attract and recruit qualified teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of the state's 230,000 teachers will need to be
replaced in the next few years, according to the Regents. And there
is an immediate need for at least 16,000 certified teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Many details of the proposal remain to be worked out, but such a
program would substantially increase some retired teachers'
incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how the legislation is written, a returning teacher
could earn anywhere from the money he or she was earning upon
retirement to some lower level on a teacher's pay scale.
</P>
<P>
   Under the most generous scenario, a teacher who retired at the
age of 55 after 25 years of service from a job paying $70,000
would, by returning to the classroom, continue to earn that amount
plus $35,000 a year in pension benefits, bringing his annual income
to more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law that limits a retiree's earnings, that teacher
could only earn $17,000 beyond his pension if he went back to work
in his own district. The Regents will also ask the Legislature for
up to $39 million to support mentoring programs of beginning
teachers by older, more experienced ones and for $5 million more in
grants to colleges to increase programs that train teachers in
math, science and other key subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The Regents' proposal comes after several school districts
across the state, including New York City, struggled to fill
teaching positions in the weeks leading up to the start of school.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, state officials say that more than half of current
teachers will be eligible to retire in this decade. The situation
in New York City may be even worse, with the teachers' union
maintaining the city will need to fill 54,000 jobs in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of teacher recruitment have forced school districts
around the country to try new incentives to attract and retain
qualified teachers, including offering low-interest loans for
housing and offering signing bonuses to teachers who move from
other careers. Last year, the Texas Legislature approved a similar
pension measure to the one proposed by the Regents to entice
experienced teachers out of retirement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In May, Pataki signed into law a program, called ``Teachers for
Tomorrow,'' that included extra pay for teachers who agreed to work
in areas of shortages and tuition grants for teachers to complete
licensing requirements. However, in New York under current law,
retirees lose $1 of their pension benefits for every $1 they earn
beyond $17,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Levy, the chancellor of the New York City school system,
where current and predicted teacher shortages are the worst, said
he welcomed the Regents proposal. But, he warned, ``it doesn't help
in adequate numbers to solve the problem, and it is expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how expensive the program will be is not clear. Among the
uncertainties are whether principals and superintendents would be
free to choose which retired teachers they wanted to hire and and
whether retirees would receive priority over younger uncertified
teachers who want the jobs. By 2003, all newly hired teachers in
the state will have to be certified.
</P>
<P>
   Also unknown is whether retired teachers would have to be hired
in order of seniority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every teacher who is retired might not be appropriate to come
back,'' said Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman
of the Assembly Education committee and who said he supports the
Regents' proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In the program outlined by the Regents, teachers would have to
be retired for at least one year before enrolling, and they could
participate for up to five years. Richard Mills, the education
commissioner, said he believed the cost of the program to school
districts would be minimal because the retired teachers would be
hired for positions that otherwise could not be filled.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Hayden, chancellor of the Board of Regents, said that New
York State trains about 10,000 more teachers each year than it
hires, with many of the state's education graduates opting for
other professions or choosing to teach in other states. In
addition, large numbers of New York City teachers, including many
of the best prepared, leave teaching within a few years after
starting.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of details, the proposal was lauded by
officials of teachers' unions and by legislative leaders Wednesday.
Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers,
the New York City union, commended the Regents for their proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Regents and Commissioner Mills have realized very quickly
that in order to get standards higher, the quality of the teachers
in the classroom becomes absolutely imperative,'' Weingarten said.

MADONNA AT YOUR FRONT DOOR IN 30 MINUTES?

<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. _ Need your ``Music'' fast?
</P>
<P>
   A few retailers will stay open past midnight Monday to sell the
eagerly anticipated Madonna release the minute it is available to
the public. Similar sales of big-name albums have drawn crowds and
long lines.
</P>
<P>
   Now, fans more likely to be in their pajamas at that time don't
have to miss out.
</P>
<P>
   Camarillo-based home delivery firm PDQuick plans to test a new
service in the Los Angeles region _ delivering the disc to your
doorstep in about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is of the essence with her fans, so this fits into what
we do for our customers,'' said Dan Frederickson, president and
chief executive officer of PDQuick, a direct-to-home retailer of
food, groceries and other products. ``If customers show us they
like it, we'd like to carry other new releases.''
</P>
<P>
   The venture, called ``Skip the Trip,'' is a partnership of
PDQuick and two arms of the Virgin media empire, Virginmega.com and
Virgin Megastores, where people can buy Madonna's album beginning
at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This release is probably the biggest CD to come out in the
last three months and really signals the beginning of the Christmas
market,'' said Dave Alder, general manager and senior vice
president of Virgin Megastore Online.
</P>
<P>
   Other big releases may be delivered this way if the experiment
goes well, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customer will tell us at the end of the day whether or not
it's a service they find useful,'' Alder said.
</P>
<P>
   Virgin is supplying the CD to PDQuick for sale either through
the delivery company's toll-free number or Web site
(www.pdquick.com).
</P>
<P>
   It will be available in PDQuick's service area in Orange and Los
Angeles counties, including the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Customers will be charged the standard $2.99 delivery fee
applied to orders of any size, Frederickson said. There is no
minimum order, and the service stays open through 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The price for the CD has not yet been determined but
Frederickson said it would be competitive with other retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Frederickson said he does not expect a flood of orders to tax or
overload the company's fleet of delivery vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   PDQuick most recently started operating in San Diego and next
plans to launch in the Washington, D.C, and Baltimore areas.

most were working in factories, fields, shops and the streets. Many
of these children are needed to earn money for their families, or
to stay at home and take care of siblings while their parents work.

GOP'S ``90-10'' PROPOSAL HAS QUICK POLITICAL IMPACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas, Ariz., Mo.)   (SUBS to correct Friday to Thursday in 11th and 14th grafs.)  
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats deride it as a gimmick. Republicans
acknowledge that it is a Plan B fallback position from their
cherished tax cuts. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle give it
very little chance of being enacted by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet only two days after Republicans unveiled their proposal to
commit 90 percent of the budget surplus in the next fiscal year to
reducing the national debt, the plan is already having a political
and policy impact.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Clinton administration and congressional Democrats
have scorned it as an unneeded law, Democratic lawmakers are loath
to vote against it for fear of being tagged as not favoring
reduction of the national debt. On Thursday Democrats joined
Republicans in the House Ways and Means Committee to unanimously
pass a bill to implement the so-called 90-10 plan.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would require that the anticipated $198 billion
surplus in the Social Security and Medicare trust funds be applied
toward retiring the government's publicly held debt. The measure
also sets up a separate account and transfers $42 billion of the
non-Social Security and non-Medicare surplus into it. That money
would also be used for debt retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats warn that because the measure calls for such
action only for one year, Republicans will attempt to divert more
of next year's surplus into tax cuts if they gain control of the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   And they say that the Social Security and Medicare surpluses are
considered sacrosanct and in recent years have been used only for
debt reduction, and that President Clinton's spending proposals
still leave room to pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Democrats say, the Republicans' measure is not
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this bill is pretty meaningless,'' said Rep. Robert
T. Matsui, a California Democrat who is a member of the committee.
``But we know the political effort that will be made on the part of
Republicans, and we didn't want to put our members who are in
competitive races at a disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican proposal, the roughly $28 billion that
would remain in the budget after debt reduction would be used for
tax cuts or for federal spending above the budget ceilings adopted
by Congress last April. For the moment, Republican leaders envision
providing $14 billion for spending increases and $14 billion for
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans having committed themselves so publicly to
``90-10,'' congressional leaders may be less flexible in their
negotiations with the White House, which Democrats note with some
concern.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's vote in the Ways and Means Committee, the panel's
chairman, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, noted that in 1998,
Republicans, eager for Congress to adjourn so they could go home
and campaign for re-election, went along with Clinton's demands for
increased spending.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said he felt that the 90-10 plan would help Republicans
avoid caving in to Clinton _ an action that some political analysts
say hurt them at the polls. ``We're trying to make a priority to
pay down the debt and not be held hostage for more and more
spending,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Democrats say the Republicans' debt-reduction proposal
is having an effect on negotiations between the White House and
Congress on spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the White House and congressional Republicans were
only $30 million apart, talks over a $15.6 billion measure to
finance the Treasury Department, the IRS, construction of new
federal courthouses, and enhanced counterterrorism measures stalled
Thursday because the bill contained a repeal of the telephone
excise tax that would cost the Treasury about $5 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority leader, said:
``The administration is saying , `Look, we got this 90-10 thing. We
don't want to sign a bill with a telephone tax repeal if we have to
commit 25 percent of what's left of the surplus into this tax cut.
There may be other tax cuts that we would prefer and there may be
other initiatives that we want.'''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans scoff at the notion that their plan caused problems
with the spending bill. They asserted that the real difficulty was
the White House's tossing up road blocks to keep Congress from
completing work on the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week it was the not-enough-money-for-the-IRS, then it was
courthouses, then it was counterterrorism,'' said Rep. Jim Kolbe,
R-Ariz. ``Now that 90-10 is on the table, suddenly it's 90-10. No
matter how many hurdles you go over, there's always one more.''
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement with the White House, Republicans brought
the measure to the House floor, bundling it with a small $2.5
billion spending measure to fund the legislative branch. The
package squeaked by on a vote of 212-209.

HERTA MAKES MOST OF FORSYTHE DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM HADDOCK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Valencia's Bryan Herta got his chance to defend
his title at Sunday's Grand Prix of Monterey and nearly pulled it
off.
</P>
<P>
   In a race with few accidents and even fewer mistakes, Herta
finished where he started, in fourth, in an impressive run for a
driver and a team with only eight days to prepare for a race.
</P>
<P>
   Herta, racing for the first time this season for owner Gerald
Forsythe, who signed him at the start of the 2000 CART FedEx season
to race for Forsythe Championship Racing, had to overcome fuel pump
problems and an inexperienced pit crew at Laguna Seca Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Herta's team, which was mostly funded by Forsythe, went from not
turning a lap on the first day of practice to qualifying on the
second row to finishing in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   But Herta said while fourth place made for a productive weekend,
it wasn't where he wanted to end his day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a little disappointed we didn't win,'' said Herta, a
Hart High graduate. ``But looking at the fact that we had a group
of guys who hadn't worked together before, it was pretty amazing.
Considering the circumstances, I'm pretty happy.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Herta's future with Forsythe, things are very much up in
the air. He will definitely not race in St. Louis, for the Motorola
300 at Gateway International Raceway on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not enough spares and not enough time turn the car
into an oval car,'' Herta said.
</P>
<P>
   However, there has been talk from team sources that Herta may
race in the Grand Prix of Houston on Oct. 1 and possibly in the
season finale at California Speedway in Fontana on Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Boone hanging on to lead: In one of the most tightly contested
title chases in USAC Western Midget racing history, Bobby Boone of
Palmdale holds a three-point lead over Danny Ebberts in the series
standings with six races to go. Third-place driver Wally Pankratz
is 13 points behind Boone.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Boone's season even more amazing is that he has been
running consistently and successfully near the top of the series
without the benefit of corporate sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Boone, a 19-year-old Littlerock High graduate, has been entirely
funded by his family and friends. His mother, who also doubles as
his financial manager for the team, says about $40,000 has been
invested in Boone's season. The total championship purse for all
the series drivers is expected to be around $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I'd really like to have a big ol' points lead
right now,'' Boone said. ``I am just concentrating on finishing
races.''
</P>
<P>
   The tightest race in Western Midget history happened in 1989
when Robby Flock beat out Sleepy Tripp by 16 points. It was Flock's
second Western Midget championship. He also won in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Boone credits his family for keeping him financed throughout the
season and engine builders Dan and Dwayne Esslinger of South El
Monte for putting him atop the Western Midget standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without them, we wouldn't be where we're at,'' said Boone of
the Esslingers. ``They helped us find problems, heating problems,
and get the bugs out of the engine.''
</P>
<P>
   If Boone holds on to win the Western Midget crown, he will
become the youngest driver to do so. Ricky Shelton, who was 19
years and 11 months when he won his title in 1997, is the youngest
driver with a Western Midget crown. If Boone holds on to win the
championship, he will have done it at 19 years and nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Boone finished ninth in the Western Midget feature Saturday
night at Santa Maria Speedway. The Western Midgets head for Madera
Speedway next for a doubleheader with the USAC Sprints. The Madera
Speedway race is on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Lyon takes Madera race: Bob Lyon of Agua Dulce, driving the
Northridge Rentals/LTR Eng./Ramada Express Chevrolet, won for the
first time this season on the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series
on Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Lyon took the Food 4 Less MDA 100 by leading for the last 54
laps of the race and winning by a .2-second margin over Eric
Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   M.K. Kanke of Frazier Park was fourth; Greg Pursley of Newhall
was ninth; Frank Maronski Jr. of Quartz Hill was 13th; and Sean
Woodside of Saugus was 18th.
</P>
<P>
   The next race on the Southwest Series is Sept. 23 at Las Vegas
Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Dotter wins for third time on Winston West: Bobby Dotter of
Charlotte, N.C., won for the third time this season on the NASCAR
Winston West circuit by taking the Sept. 4 Bank One 250 at Rocky
Mountain Raceways in Salt Lake City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sedgwick of Acton, a two-time Winston West Series champion,
finished second in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Dotter, driver of the People Against Drugs Chevrolet, also won
at Laguna Seca Raceway and Irwindale Speedway this year. He is
second in points and trails series leader Brendan Gaughan of Las
Vegas by 185 points.
</P>
<P>
   The next race on the Winston West schedule is the Spears
Manufacturing 250 at Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield on Oct. 22.

CLINTON SAYS HE IS `TROUBLED' BY HANDLING OF SCIENTIST'S CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Rewrites first 2 grafs to emphasize `stinging and highly unusual
rebuke')  
(See also LEE-RELEASE-ASSESS) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a stinging and highly unusual rebuke of his
Justice Department and the FBI, President Clinton said Thursday
that he was ``quite troubled'' by the government's actions in the
Wen Ho Lee case.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came a day after a federal judge in New Mexico
harshly criticized the Justice Department for its tactics in the
case, and as Attorney General Janet Reno rejected calls for her to
apologize to Lee, a former Los Alamos scientist. He was freed on
Wednesday after pleading guilty to a single count of what had been
a 59-count felony indictment that accused him of illegally putting
at risk vital atomic secrets.
</P>
<P>
   In comments to reporters, Clinton said he had long questioned
whether prosecutors had adequate grounds to keep Lee in jail for
nine months awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had reservations about the claims that were being
made denying him bail,'' Clinton said. ``So the whole thing was
quite troubling to me and I think it's very difficult to reconcile
the two positions that one day he's a terrible risk to the national
security and the next day they're making a plea agreement for an
offense far more modest than what had been alleged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can justify in retrospect keeping a person
in jail without bail when you're prepared to make that kind of
agreement,'' the president said, speaking with reporters outside
the White House after a speech. ``It just can't be justified and so
I too am quite troubled by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if would consider a pardon for Lee, Clinton was
noncommittal but expressed sympathy for Lee, saying the scientist
had been detained for ``a bailable offense, and it means he spent a
lot of time in prison that any ordinary American wouldn't have and
that bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said the attorney general would not
respond publicly to the president's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier, Reno expressed no regrets over the government's
tactics even though the judge in the case, James A. Parker of U.S.
District Court in Albuquerque, said the nuclear scientist deserved
an apology for harsh treatment that had ``embarrassed this entire
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said, ``I think Dr. Lee had the opportunity from the
beginning to resolve this matter and he chose not to and I think he
must look to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with reporters, Reno said she wished ``with all my
heart and soul'' that Lee had agreed earlier to provide
investigators with information, which he must do as part of the
plea agreement, about seven missing computer tapes onto which he
transferred nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Lee, Mark Holscher, said in an interview that Lee
had offered in December to cooperate as part of plea deal, a point
Parker also made in his scathing comments about the prosecution.
But, Holscher said, the government never responded.
</P>
<P>
   Neither White House or Justice Department officials would say
whether Clinton and Reno ever discussed the logistics of Lee's
confinement or other legal aspects of the case, although there was
no indication that White House officials ever complained to the
department.
</P>
<P>
   Some law enforcement officials said that they had sought to keep
Lee confined to pressure him into pleading guilty or to confess to
what a number of officials believed, but could never prove _ that
he was a spy for Beijing. The officials now acknowledge that those
tactics were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, suggested Thursday that
the president would order a review of the government's handling of
the case. ``He'll be looking for some answers to how this came
about,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Lockhart seemed to soften Clinton's words,
saying later that the president's comments were not intended ``as a
blanket criticism of anyone.'' He also said in an interview that
the president retained confidence in Reno.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The president's blunt remarks on the Lee case seemed certain to
heighten the furor over a case that, with its sudden collapse, has
turned into a major embarrassment for Reno and other officials who
favored the indictment, including FBI Director Louis J. Freeh and
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said Thursday in a statement, ``While there are some
regrettable aspects about the way the case unfolded, the bottom
line remains that Dr. Lee committed very serious security
violations involving our nuclear secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   While Reno was named to her post by President Clinton, any
direct involvement by the White House in discussions about whether
and how to prosecute Lee would have been unusual. The department is
supposed to operate independently from White House in prosecutorial
matters, and Clinton's aides stayed out of such matters, since they
had been criticized for involvement in an inquiry that followed
death of Vincent Foster Jr., a deputy White House counsel who took
his own life in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, national security officials at the White House did
know in advance about the lengthy felony indictment of Lee without
raising apparent objections.
</P>
<P>
   Several days before Lee was charged in December 1999, Reno,
Richardson and Freeh met with senior intelligence officials at the
White House to discuss the security implications of the case, among
them Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security
adviser, and George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress, some of whom once complained that the
government had moved to slowly in the case, shifted gears in
aftermath of the plea bargain to urge an inquiry into the
government's conduct. Senate hearings will begin later this month
chaired by Arlen Specter, a Republican Senator from Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The government's decision to abandon a case that prosecutors had
once compared to nuclear espionage shattered an uneasy calm that
had settled over the Justice Department and the FBI in the waning
months of the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Freeh, whose once close relationship has frayed over a
series of internal battles, many of them involving questions over
the need for independent prosecutors in cases involving the White
House, were forced once again to close ranks and defend their
actions. Freeh, in Moscow on Thursday to attend meetings with
Russian law enforcement officials, refused to discuss the Lee case
when asked about it by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI is expected to conduct a review of the case. Law
enforcement officials said Thursday that Freeh, a former federal
judge, had instituted a policy of conducting internal inquiries
when its agents are criticized by federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released after the guilty plea, Freeh said Lee
had pleaded guilty to a serious offense. Freeh said much of the
information that Lee removed from Los Alamos was highly sensitive,
disputing some weapons experts who have said the government vastly
exaggerated the sensitivity of the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``While some of the information was not classified,'' Freeh's
statement said, ``the government was prepared to prove that much of
it was highly classified nuclear weapons information.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Lee had to concede in his plea deal that the
government had been justified in investigating the downloading, he
has also decided to take legal action against the government, Brian
Sun, one of his lawyers, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, will revive a civil suit he filed against the Energy
Department, accusing the department of violating his privacy by
releasing a large amount of confidential information on his
background and its investigation of suspicions that he had spied
for China.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed last December in U.S. District Court in
Washington, but the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, decided that it
would have to wait for the end of Lee's criminal case, a common
practice. Sun said that, with the criminal prosecution concluded,
the family wants to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is trying to win monetary damages from the government , but
perhaps more important, Sun said, the family hopes to use the suit
to obtain documents from the government on why Lee was singled out
for prosecution in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers had claimed that Lee had been unfairly singled out
for prosecution largely because he is Asian American. In one of the
most important successes scored by the defense, the federal judge
handling the case, James A. Parker, ordered the government to hand
over most of the documents so he could decide whether to give to
the defense so they could try to prove their claim.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting Lee's guilty plea Wednesday, Parker suggested that
he felt it was unfortunate that he would not be able to review the
documents because the criminal case was over.
</P>
<P>
   Sun said that he was exploring whether he could seek the
documents in the civil suit, since Lee's plea said he ``waives any
right to additional disclosure from the government in connection
with the guilty plea.'' The judge in the civil case will probably
have to decided whether the documents are connected to the plea.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vice President Al Gore and his running mate, Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, headlined a star-spangled musical benefit for
their party on Thursday night, highlighting a spree of copious fund
raising that Republicans said undercut this week's Democratic
crusade against the entertainment industry's marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
   The event at Radio City Music Hall, which featured some of
popular music's best-known names, raised $6.5 million for the
Democratic National Committee. But because it was organized by
three top entertainment executives, including Harvey Weinstein, the
co-chairman of Miramax Films, the Democratic bounty was not
gathered without some political cost.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours before the concert began with a song by the rock star
Sheryl Crow, the Republican national chairman, Jim Nicholson, stood
outside the concert hall and accused the Democrats of hypocrisy.
Earlier in the day, Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
presidential nominee, used strong language to make a similar point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope America gets to see all the inconsistencies of how this
man is conducting his campaign and what he's telling the people,''
Bush said in an interview with a Fox TV affiliate in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Even David Letterman got in on the act. In his monologue, before
interviewing Gore on the CBS ``Late Show,'' Letterman told audience
members that the program would double as ``a special Al Gore
fund-raiser'' and warned that Gore ``will be out here a little bit
later to collect your $1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said it was disingenuous to take the entertainment
industry's money only days after Gore and Lieberman strongly
criticized it for marketing violent films, recordings and video
games to children, a charge leveled in a Federal Trade Commission
report this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore says he stands with the people against the powerful,''
Nicholson said. ``There are few more powerful special interest
groups in this country than the entertainment industry. But with
whom does he stand tonight: The parents whose young kids are having
their minds polluted and their souls corrupted by Hollywood, or the
powerful Hollywood elite who put money in his pocket?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides and spokesmen for the entertainment executives
emphasized that Gore and Lieberman had criticized only the
industry's marketing techniques, not the content of its products.
Furthermore, said Jennifer Backus, a Democratic National Committee
spokeswoman, ``Al Gore and Joe Lieberman aren't afraid to tell
their friends that they disagree with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gore confronted the issue directly in his remarks at
the concert, where he received heavy applause as he was introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong to market inappropriate material to children,'' he
said. ``We believe in this strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   The lines drew light applause.
</P>
<P>
   The Radio City concert was the capstone of a remarkable period
of concentrated fund raising by the Democrats, who believe the
political landscape now favors their presidential ticket on every
level but one: Money. The need to collect millions in a hurry has
played a dominant role in the Gore-Lieberman campaign's scheduling
in recent weeks as the two candidates, both together and apart,
have attended major fund-raisers virtually every day.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, for instance, the two Democrats spent the
afternoon and evening in Massachusetts, a state they are heavily
favored to win, so they could attend a fund-raiser in Boston that
raised nearly $2 million. As he thanked the donors for their gifts,
Gore told them he supported campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   This week alone, Gore has attended fund-raising concerts in
Camden, N.J., Boston and New York City that are expected to bring
in more than $9 million for his party. Lieberman has attended two
of those events and others on his own that should raise more than
$4 million, Backus said.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Gore will mine California, first at a party
fund-raiser in Los Angeles on Monday that is expected to collect
close to $3 million, most of it from entertainment industry
sources. Among those organizing that event are Rob Reiner, the
actor and director; Haim Saban, a producer of children's television
shows; and Alan Horn, president and chief operating officer of
Warner Brothers. On Tuesday, Gore will head north to Silicon Valley
for an event that should garner $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner and an aide to Weinstein said there had been no problem
raising money for the events in New York and Los Angeles, despite
the Democrats' comments about the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' Reiner said. ``The people out here in Hollywood
have much broader interests than their own parochial interests.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Because of his involvement in questionable Clinton
administration fund-raising practices, most notably his 1996 visit
to a Buddhist temple in California where money was raised
illegally, Gore is viewed as vulnerable on campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll say things that the public wants to hear,'' Bush said in
the television interview, ``and then do things that don't match his
message, whether it's the Buddhist temple or saying that he's for
campaign finance reform and then accepting thousands of dollars in
soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's concert, attended by 6,000 people, was produced
by Weinstein, Jann Wenner, the publisher and editor in chief of
Rolling Stone magazine, and John Sykes, the president of VH1 and
Country Music TV. In addition to Crow, it featured performances by
Lenny Kravitz, Jon Bon Jovi, K.D. Lang, Jimmy Buffett, Bette
Midler, Paul Simon and the former Eagles Don Henley, Glenn Frey and
Timothy B. Schmit.
</P>
<P>
   Awash in the large, unregulated contributions known as soft
money, both parties have scrambled in recent weeks to raise the
``hard money'' that comes from individuals in checks of $20,000 or
less.
</P>
<P>
   By July 1, the Democratic and Republican national committees and
the parties' congressional campaign committees had raised more than
$500 million, according to Federal Election Commission records. To
spend that money, the committees need to raise a considerable
amount of hard money. Under Federal Election Commission rules, the
parties must raise $1 of hard money for each $2 of soft money they
spend.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Peter S. Knight, deputy chairman of the Democratic
National Committee and one of Gore's chief fund-raisers, assembled
the party's top financial officials at the campaign's headquarters
in Nashville and told them they had to raise $25 million in hard
money by the end of September to support Gore's candidacy. The
fund-raisers thought the task was nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But every Democratic fund-raising event since the party's August
convention has been oversubscribed, one Democratic fund-raiser
said. And Backus said Thursday night's concert could set a party
record for raising hard money.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this year, raising $1,000 of hard money for Gore was like
pulling teeth,'' the fund-raiser said. ``Now, finally, the people
who want to be there with the winner are showing up. The timing of
Gore's bounce is wonderful.''

   NEW YORK _ It is a windowless, unmarked room on the third floor
of an office building across the street from Madison Square Garden.
The shabby office, five flights down from Hillary Rodham Clinton's
campaign headquarters, is scattered with desks, computer terminals,
televisions, hanging cable wires and telephones. There is at least
one campaign official posted there 24 hours a day, monitoring the
television news, wire services, newspapers, the Internet and,
ultimately, the campaign activities of Rep. Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   At the direct request of Clinton and one of her longtime
advisers, James Carville, the signature campaign tactic that helped
President Clinton win the White House has quietly found its way to
the campaign for Senate in New York. Clinton has opened what in
1992 was called a war room by Clinton's advisers, though her aides
this time have pointedly declined to use that name, because it
might remind voters of what some consider an unseemly side of the
Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is called, the result is a political boiler room
teeming with about a dozen people who research Lazio's background
and record, write Clinton's policy pronouncements and, most
important, seek to influence the news coverage of Clinton's
campaign for Senate, mostly through an insistent barrage of e-mails
intended to advance the first lady and undercut Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked that it be created after her campaign was engulfed
for three days in July by a charge that she voiced an anti-Semitic
slur against a former colleague in 1974, and Clinton's aides
debated how to deal with publicizing her denial.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, who had been Clinton's ubiquitous spokesman and
who is an advocate of aggressive and fast-paced politicking, was
dispatched from the eighth-floor headquarters to run the operation
with Neera Tanden, the campaign's policy director.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, standing outside a diner in South Buffalo where
Clinton was greeting voters, Wolfson could be heard on his cellular
phone overseeing the production of a ``debate scorecard'' that
compiled newspaper reports on voter reactions to the Senate debate
on Wednesday, in an effort to show that some viewers thought that
Clinton had won.
</P>
<P>
   The, um, whatever room _ ``Well, it's not a peace room,''
Wolfson said archly _ had the scorecard in reporters' e-mailboxes
before lunch, when the campaign calculated that reporters were
making judgments about post-debate articles.
</P>
<P>
   For a campaign that has been criticized by Democrats for being
factionalized and as slow as an ocean liner (her decision to visit
a diner in South Buffalo Thursday morning was arranged only 12
hours earlier), the war room has emerged for many Democratic
leaders as a model of efficiency and, they hope, ruthlessness.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And it has prompted Lazio to step up his own rapid response
operation, which he put on strong display at the debate. Although
it is not as concentrated or intense as Clinton's, it took the art
of response to a whole new level Wednesday night. It fired off 10
e-mails, offering a running rebuttal of Clinton's remarks to
reporters, many of whom were online during the debate. (``False
Clinton Charge: At 7:17 p.m., Hillary Clinton claimed Rick Lazio
voted to cut 100,000 police,'' one of the e-mails announced,
proceeding to offer evidence to the contrary.)
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson, who is intensely competitive, reacted glumly upon
learning about Lazio's high-tech operation. He noted that Clinton's
campaign had managed to get a response out to Lazio's debate
performance before the candidates even walked into the studio. It
was called a pre-buttal edition.
</P>
<P>
   This is, in truth, more than a matter of games that campaign
consultants play. There are some implications that are broader than
the efficiency of both candidates in getting out their positions
and undercutting their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates tend to benefit when the public _ and, not
insignificantly, other politicians and the news media _ perceive
that they are running a strong, confident campaign. Until the
debate on Wednesday, Republicans were raising questions about the
competence of Lazio's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Lazio's aides took issue with the notion that his
campaign was not as nimble as Clinton's. ``Let's put it this way:
We have an operationally very tight campaign, and we have a big
room with desks in it,'' said Mike Murphy, Lazio's senior campaign
consultant. ``But we don't go around having to call it a war room
and trying to make ourselves feel good about ourselves.'' He mocked
the Clinton effort as ``lots of people high-fiving each other and
towel-snapping and feeling really good about themselves while Rome
burns.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Clinton's advisers were wary of drawing too
much attention to the operation, for fear that it would underline
the Clintons' reputation of being bellicose. Carville, in
particular, has written the book on the war room _ or, more
precisely, the movie, since the one he set up with George
Stephanopoulos in 1992 was the subject of a documentary. He even
set one up in Israel when he served as consultant to Ehud Barak
when Barak was elected prime minister in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The War Room has become sort of a trademark,'' Carville said
Thursday, discussing its latest incarnation in New York. ``We
needed a way to get things out quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hillary Clinton campaign, Carville said, ``was small-d
democratic. And in a democracy, autocratic campaigns work better
than a democratic campaign. You can notice the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there have been several instances when the work of the
war room has shaped the daily flow of the campaign. There is, on
one wall of the room, a blow-up of a Daily News headline that
reads, ``Lazio Tax Plan Doesn't Add Up.'' It is, in effect, a
testament to what Clinton's aides view as one of their bigger
accomplishments: within two hours of Lazio's offering up his tax
plan, Tanden prepared a detailed response that used congressional
cost estimates to argue that he was drastically understating its
cost. That assertion was backed up by a number of critical
newspaper and magazine articles.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Clinton's aides were visibly relieved on Tuesday
night when the primary returns showed that Clinton had won 82
percent of the vote over an unknown challenger, Mark McMahon, a
Manhattan surgeon. A double-digit showing by an unknown challenger
could have been seized by Lazio as evidence of Clinton's
unpopularity even among New York Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   However, the war room, as part of its daily procedure, monitored
interviews that Bill Dal Col, the Lazio campaign manager, gave to
small radio stations upstate. In one of those interviews, Dal Col
made the offhand observation that Clinton would be in trouble if
her primary opponent got 30 percent or more, a generous prediction
that would surely have been lost had Clinton's aides not made sure
to share that particularly high number with any reporter writing a
story on the race.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible edge of the effort is the use of e-mail. On any
given day, the two campaigns dispatch a dozen e-mail messages each,
spotlighting negative information about the opponent, or
highlighting some new proposals about each campaign. In a sort of
political incarnation of ``Spy vs. Spy,'' both campaigns have
managed to sneak their way onto their opponent's e-mail list _
aides to Lazio and Clinton declined to reveal how, or what address
they were using _ which guarantees an even faster and more furious
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to me how much everything has changed since 1998
because of e-mail,'' said Michael Marr, a spokesman for Lazio who
worked for Gov. George E. Pataki's re-election campaign. ``Now
 &UR; everything &LR;  is e-mail. This is a cycle where e-mail has both
defined and changed things.''

ORACLE'S RESULTS FOR QUARTER BEAT ESTIMATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Oracle Corp. posted fiscal first-quarter results
Thursday that handily surpassed Wall Street estimates. The company
also announced a 2-for-1 stock split, the 10th since Oracle's
initial public offering in March 1986.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Aug. 31, Oracle reported earnings of $501
million, or 17 cents a share, more than double the $237 million, or
8 cents a share, it posted in the period a year earlier. Revenue
grew 14 percent, to $2.26 billion. Sales of database software beat
projections, while those for applications software grew less than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Oracle to earn 13 cents a share, according
to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Before Oracle announced its results, its shares closed at
$84.94, up $3.13. In after-hours trading, shares slipped as low as
$82.75.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very strong quarter, spectacular in margins, very
strong in database and a little lighter than hoped in
applications,'' said Robert Austrian, an analyst with Banc of
America Securities. He said the best of the fiscal year was ahead
and that ``investors will be pretty pleased.'' He added that
``investors with just a little bit of memory will recall'' that
last year's first quarter ``was pretty tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The first quarter has historically been weak for Oracle, based
in Redwood City, Calif., and the company fell short of estimates
last year. Facing numerous hostile questions from securities
analysts, Larry Ellison, Oracle's chairman and chief executive,
said at the time: ``One quarter does not make a trend. Place your
bets, gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison sounded a different note Thursday after a year in which
the growth of the Internet bolstered sales of both the company's
core database products and its suite of business applications.
Oracle has also used Internet applications internally to trim $1
billion from expenses. First-quarter operating profit margin
increased 11.7 percentage points _ to 29.1 percent from 17.4
percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are off to our fastest start in six years,'' Ellison said.
``The spectacular growth in our database business demonstrates that
we are continuing to take market share from IBM and Microsoft.
We're not losing any deals to Microsoft at all, and very few to
IBM.''
</P>
<P>
   Oracle said sales of its applications software increased 42
percent, to $156 million, while database software sales grew 32
percent, to $585 million. Oracle no longer breaks out application
sales by category because it is trying to sell most customers the
complete suite, although customers pay only for the portions they
use. Total software license revenue was up 28 percent, to $807
million, while total service revenue increased 8 percent, to $1.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions about the slower-than-expected growth in
applications, Ellison said the sales cycle of the applications
suite was longer than for the database software and required
approval from a higher level of management.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not close as much of it as we thought'' in the first
quarter, ``but we have tremendous momentum'' going into second
quarter, he said, adding that the second quarter would be
``spectacular.'' &QL;

MASTER OF GOP POLITICAL ATTACK ADS IS UNDER ATTACK HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even in the spike-elbowed world of political
consulting, Alex Castellanos, the chief advertising architect for
the Republican National Committee, stands out as a uniquely bad-boy
strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Consider these highlights from his long resume:
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, at the age of 30, Castellanos produced campaign spots
for Sen. Jesse Helms, the conservative North Carolina Republican,
that political scientists still consider trend-setting in their
harsh tone and ominous sound tracks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he created for Helms what is widely viewed as one of
the most racially charged political commercials ever, with white
hands crumpling a job rejection letter while a narrator criticizes
Helms' black opponent, Harvey Gantt, for supporting ``racial
quotas.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1996, Bob Dole's presidential campaign canceled
commercials produced by Castellanos because campaign officials
considered them overly caustic in accusing President Clinton of
lying.
</P>
<P>
   Now Castellanos' work is under sharp scrutiny again. This week,
Democrats attacked the Republicans for running a commercial
produced by Castellanos that fleetingly featured the word ``rats''
in large, white letters. The image was a fragment of the word
``bureaucrats'' in a commercial criticizing Vice President Al
Gore's prescription drug plan.
</P>
<P>
   The episode created a major distraction for the party's
presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who was
repeatedly questioned by reporters about the spot over two days.
And it nearly cost Castellanos his job. (Republican Party officials
now say they believe he did not intentionally use the word, and he
will continue making hard-edged commercials for them. The
commercial is no longer running.)
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview on Thursday evening, a clearly agitated
Castellanos again asserted that the word ``rats'' was an accident
and bitterly complained that someone _ he would not say who _ was
out to get him fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone's decided I need to be brushed aside, and they've put
a bull's eye on my head,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Castellanos was little known to the broader public before
this week, he has long been viewed by political professionals as a
master of brass-knuckles campaigning. And this week, many of those
professionals said they were not surprised to hear that Castellanos
was under scrutiny again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he probably has less restraint than most people in
this business,'' said David Paletz, a professor of political
science at Duke University who has studied political
advertisements, including those produced by Castellanos. ``It's not
a profession of gentlemen. But he seems to me to be more willing to
go for the jugular than most, and to slit a few other veins along
the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Castellanos has defended the value of attack
advertising, once saying, ``The truest spots, most factual spots,
are the negative and comparative.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, he again defended advertisements that draw sharp
contrasts, saying, ``At the end of the day we have an obligation to
let voters know the differences.'' He added, ``If I can help people
understand that, it's a good day for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Castellanos came to America when he was 6 years old when his
family fled Cuba and settled in North Carolina. He often tells
people that his conservatism and dislike of government regulation
are rooted in his experiences growing up in a Communist country.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the University of North Carolina,
Castellanos came under the tutelage of Arthur Finkelstein, a
prominent New York media consultant known for hard-hitting
campaigns, who recruited Castellanos to work on campaigns for Sen.
Alfonse M. D'Amato, Helms and other conservative politicians.
Working with Michael Murphy, another young strategist, Castellanos
produced commercials for Helms in his 1984 re-election campaign
against Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina that political
scientists say pioneered attack techniques for a new generation of
consultants. Among the the techniques: Using dark colors, harsh
sounds, sinister music and strong words, particularly ``liar,'' to
paint a threatening picture of an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a leader in what I called hard-sell negative
advertising,'' said Montague Kern, a journalism professor at
Rutgers University who devoted a chapter in her 1989 book,
``30-Second Politics,'' to the Hunt-Helms race. ``There was a time
in the 1970s when people thought negative campaigning didn't work.
The 1984 Helms-Hunt race disproved that.''
</P>
<P>
   After helping on George Bush's 1988 presidential campaign,
Castellanos returned to Helms' payroll in 1990 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But early in the 1996 campaign, Helms released Castellanos and
pulled one of his spots off the air after a Democratic candidate,
Charlie Sanders, challenged its veracity. The advertisement had
accused the Democrat of supporting affirmative action and gay
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Castellanos said that he was fired because he opposed attacking
Sanders. And he defended the advertisement's accuracy. ``I fight
hard but I fight fair,'' he said. ``And sometimes I've lost because
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   That would not be the last time a Castellanos commercial would
be canceled by one of his bosses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Bob Taft's campaign for governor in Ohio pulled an
advertisement produced by Castellanos after the Ohio Elections
Commission determined it had falsely accused the Democratic
candidate of cutting crimefighting employees while serving as state
attorney general. It was the first time the commission had
reprimanded a candidate for governor for violating state election
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Bush intervened to kill a Republican Party
advertisement developed by Castellanos because he thought the spot
used misleading quotes to attack Gore's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Castellanos devised a commercial for then Sen. Lauch
Faircloth, R-N.C., that attacked the Democratic candidate, John
Edwards, for being a high-paid trial lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In a version of the commercial that was recorded off the
television by the Edwards campaign and provided to The New York
Times by Democratic officials, a woman's voice can be barely heard
in the background saying, as if on a telephone answering machine:
``Valerie? It's mom. Are you all right?''
</P>
<P>
   Edward's most famous case involved a young girl named Valerie
Lakey who was seriously injured after being trapped on a swimming
pool drain. The Edwards campaign took the tape to a television
station, only to find that its version of the commercial lacked the
background voice. So they dropped the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Castellanos suggested that the Democrats had
doctored the video, saying, ``I have never made a spot with
anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of
Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, said that
Castellanos used a technique she called ``priming'' in his 1990
``white hands'' commercial to incite racial fears.
</P>
<P>
   In the spot, the job rejection letter has a black mark in the
margin that viewers in a focus group Jamieson conducted interpreted
as a black hand, she said. Jamieson said her analysis of the 1990
advertisement has led her to conclude that Castellanos purposely
inserted the word ``rats'' into his recent spot. ``He's done it
before,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Castellanos replied, ``Kathleen Hall Jamieson, bless her sweet
heart, is overanalyzing.''

U.S. MOVES TO REVIVE MIDEAST TALKS BUT PLAYS DOWN PROSPECTS FOR
SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Clinton administration moved Thursday to
reopen peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians at an informal
working level in New York, but Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright played down prospects that progress would be substantial
enough to lead to an accord in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discussion will continue, and we will pursue the same
agenda that we have been pursuing, fully aware of the fact that
time is short,'' Albright said. She spoke at a news conference at
the United Nations, after a working lunch with representatives of
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we have learned is that the talks are moveable,''
she said, implying that they would be convened wherever there was
any prospect of success. She stopped well short of saying what the
United States would propose to narrow the gap in this new session.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the Palestinian senior negotiators, Saed Erakat
and Muhammad Dahlan, had just arrived in New York and were meeting
with Dennis B. Ross, who handles complex Middle East negotiations
for the administration. And she said she was meeting the Israeli
foreign minister, Shlomo Ben Ami, separately.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton made an all-out attempt in July to bring Prime
Minister Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, together
in the seclusion of Camp David to hammer out the framework of a
peace agreement. But for all the displays of good will, the talks
broke down when the two sides could not agree on the future of
Jerusalem and, to a lesser extent, the fate of Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Albright said Thursday: ``Camp David was a watershed. We
started to talk about issues that were never talked about before.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to salvage the momentum of the Camp David meeting,
Clinton held a new round of talks last week in New York, where
Barak and Arafat were attending a summit meeting at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The location I don't think is the issue,'' Albright said
Thursday. ``I think we're taking advantage that people are here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So far, the administration has been unable to make visible new
headway in suggesting new formulas for mutual compromise; in fact,
some officials said the positions on each side had slipped since
Camp David. But Barak and Arafat pledged separately to keep the
talks alive.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have said another Camp David meeting
would be worth convening only if the two leaders appeared close to
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after Arafat returned home, the Palestinian Central
Council agreed to postpone a declaration of a Palestinian state
that they had threatened to make if no progress was achieved with
Israel by Sept.13.
</P>
<P>
   Albright noted with some relief that that deadline had come and
gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian postponement, she said, ``provided some
breathing space for negotiations at a time that we will use very
well in a variety of venues and in a variety of combinations.''
</P>
<P>
   Her reference to time growing short referred to January, when
the Clinton administration steps down. Clinton hoped to cap his
eight years in the White House with a Middle East peace agreement,
a goal that is fast slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is also concerned about the political
survival of Barak, who, after defections from his slender majority
government, confronts the possibility of having to call a new
election when the Israeli Parliament returns at the end of October.
Progress in the peace talks would reinforce his claim to stay on as
Israel's leader.
</P>
<P>
   The talks in New York could be moved, Albright said, if ``it's
more a matter of where the critical mass of people is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will obviously be deeply involved in them at the appropriate
times,'' she said. ``And we'll be continuing to meet with one or
the other side in the course of these talks.''
</P>
<P>
   Answering a question today about the emotional deadlock over the
holy site in Jerusalem that Jews call the Temple Mount and Arabs
call Haram al Sharif, Albright said ``there is a great deal of very
imaginative work going on'' to make both Israelis and Palestinians
feel their needs have been met.
</P>
<P>
   On the broader goal of a Middle East peace accord, she
reiterated her contention that ``neither side can have 100 percent
of what it wants, and we can't come out of this where one side
feels that it has won and the other lost.''

MRS. CLINTON DENIES REWARDING DONORS WITH WHITE HOUSE STAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Rodham Clinton acknowledged Thursday that
supporters of her Senate campaign had spent the night at the White
House and at the Camp David presidential retreat, but she denied
that the visits were rewards for political contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have friends and supporters come and spend time with us and
spend the night with us that we are getting to know and who like
spending time with us,'' Clinton said Thursday morning at a
campaign stop in Buffalo, N.Y. ``I don't see what's news about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady shook her head to indicate ``no'' when asked
directly if she or her Senate campaign fund-raisers had offered a
stay in the Lincoln Bedroom or at Camp David as a reward for a
contribution or an enticement to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, the White House declined to provide a list of
overnight guests in response to a request from The New York Times.
Officials said Thursday they were preparing a list of overnight
guests, but that it was not yet ready for release.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democratic fund-raisers have told The Times in recent
days that the Clintons had used overnight stays at the White House
to reward contributors to Clinton's Senate campaign. They said that
Clinton, alarmed by the recent financial success of her Republican
opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, had ordered an acceleration of
fund-raising efforts during a meeting late last week with top
fund-raisers in New York. The meeting was also attended by
President Clinton, fund-raisers said.
</P>
<P>
   A false report by Matt Drudge, the Internet gossip columnist, on
Tuesday night that The Times was suppressing a report on the
overnight stays prompted several media inquiries at the White House
news briefing the following day. Clinton was first asked about the
matter Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio raised a stunning $10.7 million in a 45-day period this
summer, a period in which Clinton raised only $3.3 million in
direct contributions. As of Sept. 1, Lazio had $10.2 million in the
bank; Clinton had $7.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is totally freaked out about Lazio's money,'' said one
longtime Democratic fund-raiser, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``She wants to make sure there is enough to get us
through November.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold M. Ickes, an adviser to Clinton who is the former White
House deputy chief of staff, declined to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The president has stepped up his efforts on Clinton's behalf as
well, phoning donors to thank them, appearing at several recent
fund-raising events and signing a letter soliciting contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and the first lady, over the last seven and a
half years, have always welcomed their friends and supporters and
political officials from around the country, prominent members of
the arts community, to stay at the White House,'' said Joe
Lockhart, the White House press secretary. ``Within that group,
there certainly have been people who, as their friends, have
supported them financially.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said overnight stays at the White House had never been
promised or given as compensation for a political donation.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is particularly sensitive because President Clinton
was widely criticized for inviting donors to White House coffees,
overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom and rides aboard Air Force
One.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lincoln Bedroom was never sold,'' the president said in
1997.

U.S. LOOKS INTO WHETHER CONOCO VIOLATED IRAN SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Treasury Department is investigating whether a
U.S. oil company, Conoco, violated sanctions in dealing Iran,
Clinton administration officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Conoco helped analyze information collected last year by the
National Iranian Oil Co. in its exploration of the Azadegan field
on the understanding that Conoco would be given priority in
developing the field if it became legal to do so, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of the company, Archie Dunham, has met
Iranian officials on visits to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials declined to discuss the nature and
scope of the investigation, which The Financial Times reported
Thursday. Conoco has acknowledged its interest in doing business in
Iran but denied that it had violated U.S. law by advising the
Iranian company about its geological discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conoco is mindful of restrictions under U.S. sanctions law and
has at all times fully complied with the law,'' said a spokesman
for Conoco, Carlton Adams, in a statement. ``Conoco would be
delighted to one day help NIOC develop this giant field and
believes it would be in the best interest of the United States for
American companies to be involved. This is why the company has been
outspoken in its opposition to unilateral sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams confirmed that a British subsidiary of Conoco had worked
with Iran on analyzing the Azadegan field, which is estimated to
hold oil reserves of 20 billion to 25 billion barrels. Adams also
said Iran had offered to share the information with Conoco because
``they considered us to be a potential participant in the
development of the field if U.S. sanctions were lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Clinton administration responded to an announcement
that Iran had given Conoco a contract to develop an offshore gas
field in the Persian Gulf by barring the company from proceeding.
Shortly after that, Clinton announced an executive order that
imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran and prohibited U.S. companies
from doing business there.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, the administration has eased some minor
sanctions, allowing, for example, the U.S. purchase of food and
carpets and Iranian purchas of food and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential
nominee, nor Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, has
expressed any intention of lifting economic sanctions against Iran.
</P>
<P>
   When Dick Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential candidate,
was chief executive of Halliburton, the oil-services company in
Texas, he endorsed lifting sanctions against Iran to let U.S. oil
companies conduct business there.
</P>
<P>
   But after Bush had chosen him as his running mate, Cheney told
ABC News that he now agreed with Bush's saying he would leave
sanctions in place. ``If I sign on as his No. 2, so to speak,'' he
said, ``I would expect to make my views known, to express my
thoughts to him privately.''

A YEAR LATER, GIULIANI CRITICIZES CLEMENCY FOR PUERTO RICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saying that he was noting the first anniversary of
the release from prison of members of a Puerto Rican nationalist
group, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani criticized President Clinton, Vice
President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton for their positions on
the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to point out that this is the one-year anniversary
of one of the most disgraceful things that has happened in the last
100 years by a president of the United States,'' the mayor said
Thursday at a news conference arranged with the Republican National
Committee in City Hall Park.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani criticized Clinton for granting clemency to members of
the group, the FALN, who were released last September 10, and for
trying at the same time to boost Gore's standing with Puerto Rican
voters. He criticized Gore for not taking a position on the issue.
Then he criticized Clinton for changing her position. Last year, in
what the first lady later called an early campaign stumble, Clinton
broke with her husband and said his clemency offer should be
withdrawn. The resulting outcry from Puerto Rican voters went on
for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear why Giuliani felt the need to hold a news
conference more than a full year after members of the group had
been released from prison. Rep. Rick Lazio did mention the group in
his debate with Clinton on Wednesday night, in a discussion about
clemency, but did not link his opponent directly to the group.
Democrats happily speculated Thursday that the mayor was eager to
get back into the good graces of the Senate campaign of Lazio, who
replaced Giuliani in the race. On Monday, Giuliani criticized Lazio
for heartily shaking Yasser Arafat's hand during a visit to the
Middle East. Lazio's campaign was not pleased, but Clinton's was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Rudy Giuliani,'' a senior campaign adviser to Clinton
said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that the mayor's criticism of the Clintons and
Gore Thursday had nothing to do with his statements on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy Giuliani's a good Republican,'' said Bill Pascoe, a
spokesman for the Republican National Committee. Both the mayor and
Republican officials said the mayor had long ago offered to speak
out on the issue. Giuliani, a former prosecutor, has been one of
the most vocal critics of Clinton's clemency offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue I felt very strongly about when I was running
for, considering running, involved in the race for the Senate,
whatever you want to describe it, whatever I was doing,'' Giuliani
said. ``So some time ago I said to them, at an appropriate time, I
would like to speak out on this.'' Gore, the mayor noted, was
campaigning in the city Thursday. He added that Republicans ``felt
that this was an appropriate time to do it.''

INVESTIGATION OF LEE HAMPERED BY FEUD BETWEEN THE JUSTICE DEPT. AND
THE FBI
</HEADLINE>
   (With LEE-RELEASE-CLINTON, LEE-RELEASE-ASSESS) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Assailed by President Clinton and the federal judge
who presided over the nuclear secrets case of Wen Ho Lee, Attorney
General Janet Reno and the FBI director, Louis Freeh, are once
again under the hot glare of criticism for their handling of an
important criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his remarks Thursday, and Judge James Parker, in his
comments on Wednesday, focused their complaints on the government's
demands that kept Lee in pretrial detention for nine months.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism of federal authorities comes after years of
conflict and tension between the Justice Department and the FBI
about how to obtain evidence in a case that began as an
investigation into suspicions that China had obtained atomic
secrets through espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said neither Reno nor Freeh was
directly involved in the decisive early phase of the investigation,
an absence that some officials said had contributed to the problems
that led to the collapse of the case against Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints also come at a time when battles over other
issues, like campaign finance, have driven a wedge between Reno and
Freeh, who deeply embarrassed the attorney general by urging the
appointment of an independent counsel to investigate possible
violations of political fund-raising laws.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Clinton said he was ``quite troubled'' by Lee's
detention in light of the government's willingness to accept a
guilty plea to a single count of mishandling classified material.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the government's actions were a national
embarrassment. ``I feel I was led astray'' by federal prosecutors
and the FBI, he said at the hearing on Wednesday, when Lee was
freed.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said they had portrayed Lee as ``a danger to the safety
of this nation'' who should not be released.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and the Justice Department had feuded over the Lee case
for years, but it was the bureau's suspicion that Lee was a spy for
Beijing that drove the inquiry forward as an espionage case. The
bureau's hand was strengthened by Energy Department officials eager
to counteract the impression that the agency had failed to impose
strict security procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Agents focused on Lee in May 1996 after an internal review at
the Energy Department determined that he was a chief suspect among
a dozen people who might be responsible for China's presumed theft
of a design for the highly advanced W-88 thermonuclear warhead.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, Justice Department officials refused to authorize
an application for a warrant to monitor Lee electronically under
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The department refused
to seek a wiretap on grounds that FBI agents had produced only
sketchy information that the scientist had engaged in spying.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the FBI and the Justice Department said the dispute
over the wiretap was a crucial disagreement, but one in which
neither Reno nor Freeh became involved, even though serious
espionage cases involving U.S. citizens are almost always brought
to the attention of the attorney general and the FBI director.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after some law enforcement officials said that the
warrant would have enabled them to prove or disprove the
allegations against Lee, Reno complained that she was not advised
of the dispute over the wiretap and said that Freeh should have
discussed the matter with her. But FBI officials said Freeh was not
aware of it either.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to tap Lee's phones, the bureau resorted to other
tactics. An agent posing as a Chinese intelligence officer
approached Lee, but the scientist rebuffed the overture to spy for
Beijing. Suspicions lingered, however.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, FBI agents searched Lee's office computer, finding that
he had downloaded from a classified to a unclassified computer
system thousands of lines of secret computer codes _ the
information that he was finally charged with mishandling.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to charge Lee with multiple felonies in what became
a 59-count indictment was agreed upon by officials at the Justice
Department in Washington, prosecutors in New Mexico and the FBI.
Freeh supported the indictment, which was ultimately approved by
Reno.

COLGATE SHARES DROP 16 PERCENT AFTER REPORTS BY ANALYSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GREG WINTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of Colgate-Palmolive tumbled nearly 16 percent Thursday
after analysts expressed doubts that the company would meet sales
targets, citing the yearlong plunge in the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Stubbornly high petroleum prices, meanwhile, are expected to
limit Colgate's ability to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   In recent quarters, Colgate, the maker of America's best-selling
toothpaste and dishwashing liquid, has been a bastion of strength
in the consumer products industry, consistently meeting and
exceeding analysts' forecasts at a time when some of its principal
competitors _ including Procter &AMP; Gamble, Clorox, and Dial _ have
repeatedly warned of lethargic sales. As a result, investor
enthusiasm for Colgate has surged, propelling its stock price to 35
times earnings as of Wednesday, up to 60 percent higher than others
in the category, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   But after Colgate executives discussed operations with several
analysts on Wednesday, they began predicting that sales would fall
short.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Shore, an influential analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown, said that the company's third-quarter results ``will signal
a reversal of fortune.'' Shore downgraded the company's stock from
``buy'' to ``market perform,'' unleashing a sell-off that clipped
nearly $5 billion from Colgate's market value before lunch. Shares
of Colgate dropped $8.81 to $47.38, and other consumer products
stocks fell, as well, on word of the downgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Reuben Mark, Colgate's chairman and chief executive, issued a
midday statement saying the company expected to meet analysts'
earnings expectations, but that did little to reverse the stock's
slide. Though Colgate may report high earnings this quarter,
analysts fear that the company will have to tap into its reserves
and cut back on expenses like advertising to do so, moves that
would hurt its future prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts speculated that, even if temporary, the company's
dip in stock price could make it an acquisition target for overseas
companies looking to break into the American market. Both Henkel,
the giant German consumer products giant, and Kao, Asia's
powerhouse in the industry, are seeking a foothold in the United
States. Marketing their own products here would be futile, analysts
say, because Americans are fiercely loyal to the brands they
recognize, so a takeover of a momentarily rattled company might be
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Thursday's decline, Colgate's stock price is high
enough to dissuade a potential acquirer, some analysts said. Yet
the challenges facing Colgate appear to be long term, so Colgate's
stock could remain under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Like its rivals, Colgate is hurt by high fuel prices, which
increase shipping costs. Colgate also uses oil-based resins in
packaging for its products. But the company has a difficult time
passing rising expenses on to consumers, because increasingly
powerful retailers like Wal-Mart and Costco tend to compete on
price. Moreover, the big retail chains are bringing out more
products of their own, presenting yet another set of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Colgate has managed to use aggressive marketing to
withstand industry pressures, and even gain on its rivals. Colgate
toothpaste now outsells Crest, and Palmolive dishwashing soap beats
Dawn in sales, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Colgate-Palmolive has also been buffered by the dominant market
position of its Hill Science Diet pet food, a high-end product
found in specialty retail stores like Petco and Petsmart. But
analysts fear Hill Science's sales growth will reach a plateau now
that Procter &AMP; Gamble has started selling its premium Iams pet food
in supermarkets.

COWBOYS' AIKMAN REMAINS IN LIMBO FOR REDSKINS GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ A ``frustrated'' Troy Aikman practiced in pads
Thursday, looked sharp on his throws but remained in limbo about
his playing status for Monday night's Cowboys-Redskins game at
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' 33-year-old quarterback cited what he called
``still some concern'' about his medical progress, 12 days after
receiving the eighth known concussion of his NFL career. Aikman
said Monday that he planned to play and that he expected to have a
medical OK before today.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman practiced the past two days, mindful that the team had an
extra day to prepare this week. He worked for two hours with the
starters and took as many reps or more Thursday as backup Randall
Cunningham and third-stringer Clint Stoerner combined.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. J.R. Zamorano, team physician and internist, was on hand to
observe Aikman. Owner Jerry Jones, personnel director Stephen Jones
and Zamorano conversed throughout practice.
</P>
<P>
   After practice, Aikman went inside for 10 minutes, then returned
to tell local media: ``I've gotten some good work in the last two
days. We're still evaluating exactly where I am \Rmedically\S. This
evaluation process is obviously the reason why we haven't come to a
clear-cut answer yet. ``I thought I would've had an answer for you
today. It just has not been quite that clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who has had three known concussions in his past 10
starts, wouldn't say if he is still experiencing headaches or any
post-concussion symptoms. He has agreed to keep medical details
between himself and his doctors for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being honest with the doctors and trying to be honest with
myself,'' said Aikman, who admitted to being unsure what he should
do Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones said, ``We're continuing to evaluate and look at
Troy's symptoms ... not his play, but his symptoms. No decision has
been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was sacked four times and knocked down four other times
during a frenzied 15-play sequence against the Philadelphia Eagles
on Sept. 3, before leaving the game in the second quarter. On
Sunday, he dressed in street clothes and watched from the sideline
in Arizona as Cunningham made his first start in a Cowboys uniform.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that the Cowboys would be
better-served not tipping their hand as to which quarterback will
start Monday, especially with Aikman and Cunningham having such
dissimilar styles.
</P>
<P>
   Why give the heavily favored Redskins a hint on which one to
prepare for?
</P>
<P>
   At one point Thursday, Aikman said: ``I'd like to be a little
more committal. But, I don't know, it's something we're taking a
lot of time in making a decision on. It's not easy. It's not
clear-cut. It's not real black and white.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the nature of concussions.
</P>
<P>
   Since November, Aikman has visited neurologists on both coasts,
specialists in sports-related head trauma. In learning about
concussions, Aikman has been told that the human brain is the
``last frontier'' in medical research.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who turns 34 in November, pointed to back-to-back
concussions last season (Oct. 31 at Indianapolis and Nov. 8 at
Minnesota), after which he sat out the next two games, and said:
``What took place last year is why there is extra precaution now.
My age and this stage of my career probably has instigated this as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, said Aikman, ``in the past, I recovered much quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   This is only the second time in his career that Aikman has
missed a game or more after a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating not getting to play,'' said Aikman, referring
to an 0-2 start and high expectations for an offense that was
derailed in the opener and _ adding injury to insult _ lost Joey
Galloway to a season-ending knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard,'' Aikman said of his own situation. ``The fact
that there is some concern has made this week even more
frustrating. I'm trying to make as informed a decision as possible.
I appreciate that the organization is approaching it in the same
manner.''

NIKE DEAL FOR WOODS SAID TO BE THE RICHEST
</HEADLINE>
  By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tiger Woods signed a five-year endorsement contract with Nike
Thursday that is believed to be worth $85 million, making it the
richest endorsement deal in sports history.
</P>
<P>
   The exact worth of the contract is hard to estimate because some
of the value is tied to sales and incentives. But having already
won three major championships and nine tournaments this year, Woods
has continued his incredible 2000 with an unprecedented endorsement
deal that will continue his strong relationship with Nike. Woods
has his own Nike line of clothing and shoes, he switched to a Nike
golf ball in May, and he appears regularly in Nike commercials.
Woods' current five-year, $40 million deal with Nike expires in
September of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The new deal, which runs through September of 2006, will begin
when his current deal expires.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wood, the president of Nike Golf, refused to reveal
specifics of the deal, but he was elated that an agreement had been
reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final details were worked out about 90 minutes ago,'' Wood
said Thursday night from his office in Beaverton, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been negotiating for about 18 months, but IMG, Nike, and
Tiger have all been in the same ballpark for awhile now,'' Wood
continued. ``A lot of people thought we overpaid for Tiger in his
original deal, but we don't feel we overpaid for him then, and we
don't feel we overpaid for him now. We think it's a fair deal for
everybody. He's had a huge impact on Nike and on Nike golf, and we
think that will continue for the next 25 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have compared Tiger to Michael Jordan, but one
thing that makes them different is that the career of a
professional golfer is so much longer than the career of a
basketball player. The earning power of a professional golfer is
far greater over the course of a lifetime. We're looking forward to
extending our relationship with Tiger for the duration of his
career, which will extend for the next 20 to 25 years and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   At 24, Woods has won all four major championships, becoming the
youngest player to complete the career Grand Slam, and he holds the
all-time scoring record in all for majors in relation to par.
Television ratings for tournaments increased dramatically when
Woods played, and his galleries are by far the largest on tour,
attracting record-setting crowds to tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Woods signed a five-year $30 million endorsement deal with Buick
worth $30 million earlier this year, and he has endorsement
contracts with several other companies. Obviously, Woods is
financially secure for several lifetimes, but his father, Earl
Woods, said that business deals wouldn't diminish Woods' intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Tiger, it has never been about the money,'' Earl Woods
said Thursday from his home in Cypress, Calif. ``I have a kid who
is basically self-motivated, and for that, I thank the Lord. He
doesn't need someone waving dollar signs in front of his face to
get him going. His performance isn't going to drop off just because
he signs a deal, or earns a certain amount of money. Tiger has no
comfort zone when it comes to competition. People don't believe me,
but he's going to get much better. We've only seen the tip of the
iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike is considering making golf clubs as well in the future, but
Wood said the company had not made a final decision.

FORWARD COMMITS TO USC
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The player at the center of NCAA and Pacific-10
Conference investigations into allegations of wrongdoing within the
USC basketball program has given the Trojans an oral commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Dupree, a 6-foot-7 forward who played at College of
Southern Idaho last season, committed to USC after receiving a
scholarship offer provided he can academically qualify to the
university.
</P>
<P>
   Dupree - now attending San Bernardino Valley College - probably
won't know until next spring or summer whether he will be
academically accepted into USC.
</P>
<P>
   Dupree gained notoriety last month, when College of Southern
Idaho coach Derek Zeck claimed USC assistant Dave Miller offered
Zeck money to help recruit Dupree.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'll write you a check to donate to your booster
club to recruit and get Jerry,' '' Zeck said. ``I said 'I don't do
that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Dupree both denied any offer was made, and USC coach
Henry Bibby has termed the allegations ``totally false.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investigators from the NCAA and Pac-10 have
interviewed Bibby, Miller and USC assistant coach Silvey Dominguez
regarding the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ongoing at this point,'' Pac-10 assistant commissioner
Jim Muldoon said regarding the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Dupree is the fourth player to commit to the Trojans, and would
take their last available scholarship. USC has also received
commitments from twin brothers Errick and Derrick Craven of Bishop
Montgomery High in Torrance and 6-11 center Rory O'Neil of
Burroughs in Ridgecrest.

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ If Deion Sanders is involved, it's never simple.
</P>
<P>
   Five glorious and sometimes controversial years with the
league's preeminent cornerback/punt returner/self-promoter taught
the Cowboys as much.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas running back Emmitt Smith makes sense when he maintains
that Monday night's matchup pitting the Cowboys (0-2) and Sanders'
Redskins (1-1) ``ain't got nothing to do with Deion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't add anything,'' Smith said. ``He is just playing
for the team we are playing against. Period. Our focus is getting a
win against anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But this game isn't about level-headed logic.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``Prime Time'' in prime time against the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   It's Sanders against his former teammates for the first time
since Dallas dropped him in the off-season because of salary-cap
constraints and injury concerns. He promptly signed a seven-year,
$56 million contract with hated rival Washington, predicting doom
for the Cowboys and triumph for the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make comedian Dennis Miller's melodramatic
presence in the broadcast booth redundant.
</P>
<P>
   So, while many in the Cowboys organization agree with Smith's
reasoning, they also can't deny Sanders' impact on Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deion has been a big part of the Cowboys, and he's been a big
part of us winning a Super Bowl and having a good team with him
here,'' Cowboys coach Dave Campo said. ``I think he brings a little
bit of excitement to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   All week, the Cowboys have watched film of Sanders'
self-described career-worst performance in the Redskins' 15-10 loss
to the Detroit Lions on Sunday. Detroit quarterback Charlie Batch
completed seven passes for 75 yards against Sanders, including four
first downs.
</P>
<P>
   While some saw the performance as evidence of Sanders' declining
athletic ability _ and justification for the Cowboys' decision to
drop him and his exorbitant salary _ Campo said the Cowboys still
have a lot of respect for Sanders. He said they won't be naive
enough to think they can throw to his side of the field with a lot
of success.
</P>
<P>
   However, Campo said the Cowboys won't shy away from him. They
plan to spread the ball around the field.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receivers Wane McGarity and James McKnight can't wait.
</P>
<P>
   McKnight said he idolized Sanders growing up _ so much so that
he wore No. 2, Sanders' number at Florida State, in high school.
McKnight, who suffered a season-ending knee injury in training camp
in 1999, never got a chance to face Sanders in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited,'' McKnight said. ``I was a big Deion fan. It was
a disappointment last year with me not playing. It's going to be a
challenge, but I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity faced Sanders in practice and said Sanders helped him
become a better receiver by teaching him what cornerbacks look for.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got here, I looked forward to going against him
in practice,'' McGarity said. ``I knew it was going to make me
better. I'm definitely looking forward to playing against him. He
taught me a lot. You remember those things when you are out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also remember that Sanders is most dangerous when he
feels he has been slighted. Safety Darren Woodson, who considers
himself one of Sanders' closest friends, said the Cowboys' decision
not to re-sign Sanders will likely fire Deion up as much as last
week's poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably feels he got rubbed a little wrong because of the
way he left,'' Woodson said. ``He's going to give us his ``A''
game. He will put on a show if he gets a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety George Teague agreed, saying ``any dance he has he will
dance a little harder. Any words he wants to say, he will say a
little harder. He's going to be ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Cowboys want to see Sanders dance, but they would
happily trade a jig from the NFL's showboat king for a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beating him doesn't mean as much to me now,'' Teague said.
``We haven't won a game. We just want to win. Being 0-2 takes away
from beating any individual.''

SANDERS' SILENCE, AND DEPARTURE, ARE GOLDEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The football gods work in mysterious ways. From season to
season, or even week to week, the gods giveth, or taketh away. Far
be it from me to question their weird whims and strange behavior.
NFL honchos show disrespect to a higher authority by calling what
goes on in the league ``parity.'' You won't hear that here.
</P>
<P>
   Like, how in the heck did the St. Louis Rams win that last Super
Bowl? Because the gods bestowed a blessing upon one of the feeble,
that's how. Maybe they were just bored, and having a little fun.
</P>
<P>
   As you've noticed, however, Valley Ranch hasn't been a godly
destination in some time now. The gods left Irving at about the
same time as The Jimster. Mere coincidence? Don't know, and I also
don't ask.
</P>
<P>
   But this has actually been a week for all of us, and
particularly the Valley Ranch contingent, to count our football
blessings. The gods met among themselves and made the decision to
throw us a small bone. From a football standpoint, the Cowboys
couldn't be worse after two games. Then again, this could have been
a much more miserable week.
</P>
<P>
   Notice how quiet it is up there in Washington?
</P>
<P>
   No loud chirping at all from underneath the do-rag.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are coming, flying into D.C. on Monday night with
both wings on fire and a prayer on all lips. But still, nary a
told-you-so word has been uttered from the normally noisy lips of
Deioness.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what's been observed lately, Mr. Sanders and the
Cowboys have actually been reunited. Both parties have become
shadowy football caricatures of their former selves.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Deion's performance against the Detroit Lions
labeled him, at least based on that game, as the worst $8 million
upfront cash investment in the history of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions sent waves of receivers right at Nine-Toed. Detroit's
game plan was to treat the Wonderful One as if he were, well,
Phillippi Sparks. And they toasted Sanders over and over and over.
</P>
<P>
   It was so bad that Deioness was forced to take drastic postgame
measures. How's this for a first: Sanders fingered himself for an
awful game and also for the Lions upsetting the Washingtons.
</P>
<P>
   I loved this self-evaluation from Deioness:
</P>
<P>
   ``When they smell something dead, the buzzards circle.''
</P>
<P>
   In five years with the Cowboys, it was unheard of for Sanders to
even remotely share in the blame for games or seasons gone sour. It
was always the fault of others.
</P>
<P>
   Deion got by on nothing more than reputation his last two
seasons here, something which slipped right past Little Danny
Snyder, boy owner of the Redskins. Snyder just had to have Deion,
even for $8 million upfront.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it was amazing last season, even to Cowboys coaches,
to watch opposing teams purposely stay away from Sanders' side of
the field based on his what-once-was status. Those few clubs who
did attack his corner prospered, but the trend never developed.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions, however, have opened a new sack of snakes for
Sanders. That was too easy last week. Detroit simply went out and
took what they wanted from Sanders, when they wanted it. Lions
quarterback Charlie Batch said afterward that the damage should
have been worse, citing how he twice overthrew open receivers who
were behind Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   It's those mysterious ways again of the football gods. With a
pathetic Cowboys bunch coming to town, Deion could have been
enjoying a feast of words. Instead, the lips are zipped. In fact,
the once famous ``Dallas Week'' in Washington has been reduced to
no more than just another football game. The noncompetitive nature
of the Cowboys could have something to do with that, but mostly
there is sudden panic over the poor play of the Redskins in the
first two games.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, had been proclaimed a Super Bowl season in D.C.
Little Danny said so himself.
</P>
<P>
   What the Lions game did indicate was that, while every other
off-season move has exploded on owner Jerry Jones, at least his
decision to part ways with his beloved Deioness was correct and
profitable. Are the Cowboys desperate at cornerback? Yes, at least
at one corner. But their other corner, Ryan McNeil, is holding up
very well, simply because no one throws his way. Even a Ryan McNeil
is ``taking away half the field,'' which used to be what the Deion
apologists would crow about.
</P>
<P>
   Jones listened to his medical reports and his coaches _ instead
of his wayward heart _ in allowing Sanders to walk. The word,
particularly from the medical side, was that Deioness had a
wear-and-tear problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a question about us wanting to bring back
Deion,'' said Jones, ``but what we had to answer was the cost
factor. Seven and eight million dollars \Ron a signing bonus\S just
wasn't right for our salary-cap situation.''
</P>
<P>
   After his Detroit performance, Sanders has all of Washington now
wondering if Jones took the smart way out.
</P>
<P>
   For us, however, all is quiet. Thank you again, football gods.

GUTIERREZ PRIMED FOR TRIATHLON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jennifer Gutierrez is dedicated to the sport that
has sent her to the Summer Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   But she doesn't let training to be a triathlete consume her
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people give our sport a bad name,'' said Gutierrez, a
former Pepperdine swimmer among Team USA's best hopes for a
triathlon medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people who do Iron Man (triathlons) take it too
far ... I keep myself sane. It doesn't thrill me to train all day.
I really wouldn't have much of a life if I did.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gutierrez, a 33-year-old native of San Antonio, Texas, found
out she could excel in triathlon. She was the first American woman
to qualify for the Sydney Games, the first Olympics to offer
triathlon as a medal event.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez earned ``elite'' status five years ago and ranked 16th
in the world (second in the U.S.) after placing seventh at the ITU
World Cup in Sydney last April and fourth at the 1999 Pan American
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez's training habits are hardly tame preparing for a
sport that requires swimming, bicycling and running skills. She
works out all but one day a week without burning herself out
</P>
<P>
   ``I train about (4-5) hours a day. Maybe two hours swimming, two
hours biking and maybe one running,'' Gutierrez said. ``Some people
work out for six hours a day. It's whatever your body can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Before triathlon, Gutierrez's was primarily a swimmer, though
she also ran track and cross country at Oliver Wendell Holmes High
in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Her swimming prowess earned Gutierrez a full scholarship to
Pepperdine, where in the late 1980s she established school swimming
records in the 200, 500 and 1000 (the latter two still stand).
</P>
<P>
   Her late father Johnny ``Tiger'' Gutierrez was the driving force
in Jennifer's development as an athlete. Johnny, who succumbed to
prostate cancer in June, 1999 at the age of 68, was a semi-pro
baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He supported me to have an athletic background, which was so
important to me,'' Gutierrez said of her dad. ``I just wanted to do
it for himself and myself.''
</P>
<P>
   When she met her future husband, age-group triathlete Bob
Utberg, Gutierrez took up the sport she caught onto quickly when
relocating to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   In four amateur triathlons in 1994, Gutierrez finished first
twice and second twice, giving glimpse that she had a bright
future.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic version of the sport is not the unreal physical
strain of the Iron Man triathlon series that features a
two-mile-plus swim, 100-mile-plus bike ride and 26.2-mile marathon
run.
</P>
<P>
   But the Olympic triathlon distance - 1.5 kilometers in the
water, 40 kilometers on the bike and a 10K run - offers Gutierrez
challenges not just mentally but physically. Strategy, including
drafting in the bicycle portion of the course, is imperative for
winning races.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez's lack of experience in competitive cycling has been
the biggest focus in improving her triathlon times. But she's
become consistent in each facet of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of work. But it's like any other sport you train
at. Whether it's one sport or three,'' said Gutierrez, a physical
education teacher in the Denver area.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez's triathlon success hasn't gone unnoticed by her
peers. She was named Team USA's captain over the six-person (three
men, three women) in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it because I'm very fair,'' Gutierrez said of her
captaincy. ``If I want something, but everyone else wants something
different, I will go with the majority.''

FIRED-UP TCU SAFETY SET FOR NORTHWESTERN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Linebacker Shannon Brazzell said: ``Don't
know where that came from.'' Many other TCU players thought the
same.
</P>
<P>
   They had just seen the unthinkable. Normally reserved and
level-headed Curtis Fuller, the senior free safety who is the
quarterback of the Horned Frogs' defense, stepped, or more like it,
pranced out of character Saturday against Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   After charging into the Nevada backfield, Fuller chased down
quarterback David Neill and recorded the first sack of his TCU
career. Fuller then got up, walked slowly in large, exaggerated
steps toward the Wolf Pack crowd in the end zone and, like a
helmet-toting librarian, brought his extended index finger to his
face mask.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just excited,'' Fuller said, laughing. ``You never know
how you're going to react. I think we were a little down at the
time. We needed a little excitement on the defense, something to
talk about, something to get riled up about, so it really wasn't
anything special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a little pointing and a `shhhh.' It just said, `We're
here to play. Sort of like saying we're going to silence this
crowd, let's play some defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the sack set up Nevada in a third-and-32, the Wolf Pack
scored its only touchdown two plays later. Regardless, Fuller
thought the Frogs picked up their defensive intensity after his
move. Nevada would score only another field goal, and Neill would
end up being sacked a TCU-record 15 times.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller, who received his psychology degree in May and is
pursuing a master's degree, said the show of emotion was not meant
to show up Nevada. He is just trying to follow coach Dennis
Franchione's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not a vocal guy,'' said Fuller, a Fort Worth
Christian graduate. ``Coach Fran has asked me to be more vocal and
more enthusiastic and do those things on the field. So I'm trying
to take a step in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuller figures to be all over the field Saturday against
Northwestern. The Wildcats defeated TCU, 17-7, last year, and
Fuller expects a better Northwestern team for the 11 a.m. kickoff
at Amon Carter Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to try to spread us out a little bit more and
try to throw the ball a little better than they did against us last
year, which would allow them to run the ball a little bit better
against us,'' he said. ``They're going to try and be balanced with
their attack, throw the ball to keep us honest and not let us stack
the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it would seem revenge would be on his mind, in addition
to a chance to beat a Big Ten team on national television, Fuller
said: ``I don't put more emphasis on one more than another. I
really don't. It's a big game for us, but yet last week was a big
game for us, and the following week will be a big game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, however, cognizant of the spotlight of the 20th-ranked
Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will look at us on national TV and see what TCU is
about and how we play football,'' Fuller said. ``I still think
there's a lot of people out there that don't know how we play
football at TCU. It'll give us a little limelight and it will be a
good game, a four-quarter ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   And with more than 30,000 fans in the stands and viewers around
the country watching, does Fuller plan on a new move to get his
troops riled up?
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably won't do anything like that again. A one-time
wonder from Curtis Fuller.''

GENERAL MOTORS DOUBLES ITS STAKE IN SUZUKI MOTOR TO 20 PERCENT
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKI TANIKAWA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The General Motors Corp. doubled its stake in the Suzuki
Motor Corp. to 20 percent Thursday and GM's top executive joined
Suzuki's board.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, announced by the two automakers in Tokyo, expanded a
close relationship between them that goes back almost 20 years,
when Suzuki first began supplying small cars to GM, the world's
largest automotive company.
</P>
<P>
   GM is hoping that Suzuki will help increase its share of the
market in Asia, where the automotive industry is expected to grow
the fastest in the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to build on that history of relationship with
General Motors,'' said Osamu Suzuki, chairman and chief executive
of Suzuki, who appeared at a news conference with his GM
counterpart, John F. Smith Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing to name Smith as a nonexecutive director of Suzuki,
Suzuki said: ``We wanted someone who could advise us on areas of
strategic importance. We are grateful to get an excellent person.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suzuki-GM deal is the latest in a series of transactions by
foreign automakers to gain a greater presence in Japan.
DaimlerChrysler AG has arranged to take a 34 percent ownership
stake in Mitsubishi Motors.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Motor Co. has control of the Mazda Motor Corp., and
Renault of France holds a 37 percent interest in the Nissan Motor
Co.
</P>
<P>
   GM also holds stakes in Isuzu Motors Ltd. and Subaru, a unit of
Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. But the GM-Suzuki alliance is
characterized by unusually close personal relations between the two
chairmen, who have known each other since GM and Suzuki first
entered into an alliance in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Takaki Nakanishi, an automotive analyst with Merrill Lynch in
Tokyo, said the choice of Smith as a board member ``showed GM had
no intention to control'' Suzuki management.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki also differs from several of its larger Japanese
competitors in that it is financially strong, unencumbered by heavy
debts or sluggish sales. Digging deep into the small-car niche, it
has carved a firm presence in Japan and overseas markets and has
not lost money since 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki and Smith said they considered the relationship a
strategic partnership and that Suzuki would remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said a small-car manufacturer like Suzuki was now more
important to GM than ever in its strategy to build a greater
presence in Asian markets, especially after the company lost in a
bidding war with Ford over the acquisition of Daewoo Motors of
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our future depends on the success in Asia,'' said Rudolph
Schlais, president of GM's Asia-Pacific operations, who attended
the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   In an important step toward working cooperatively to expand in
Asia, Suzuki will start manufacturing YGM-1, a jointly developed
minicar between GM and Suzuki, in a plant in Kosai, a city near
Mount Fuji west of Tokyo, in September 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki, 70, has been chief executive of Suzuki Motor since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Asked which side first proposed raising the GM stake to 20
percent, Suzuki responded, ``That was done by `a un no kokyu' with
Mr. Smith,'' using a Japanese expression that roughly translates
into they ``knew each other's thoughts without using any words.''

BANK TRANSFERS INVOLVED MONEY IN RUSSIAN TAX CASES, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By BENJAMIN WEISER and LOWELL BERGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After about two years of investigating the movement
of billions of dollars through the Bank of New York, federal
law-enforcement officials now say much of the money involved tax
evasion by Russian businesses, and the investigators are prepared
to help Moscow if Russia wishes to pursue its own cases.
</P>
<P>
   In what began as one of the biggest money-laundering
investigations in U.S. history, law-enforcement officials have
determined that much of the wrongdoing _ tax fraud and kidnapping _
appears to have occurred in Russia. The inquiry has also shown that
the system for moving funds through the Bank of New York was used
to transfer money to individuals connected with organized crime in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Newly released federal court documents said the FBI found
evidence that a small amount of the money, some $300,000, moved
through the Bank of New York for the purpose of paying a kidnapping
ransom and that a leading Russian bank was involved in transferring
the payments to gain the release of a businessman. For its
services, the Russian bank received a commission, federal
prosecutors in Manhattan said in the court documents.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, which were released last week over the strenuous
objections of the Russian bank, Sobinbank, also said that federal
investigators seized $15 million last year from a Sobinbank account
in the Bank of New York and that the FBI now believed that
Sobinbank-controlled accounts at the American bank were responsible
for moving ``the vast majority'' of $7 billion channeled out of
Russia from 1996 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts of that bank and a smaller Russian bank, the
government said, ``were, in short, the pipeline for this illegal
scheme,'' the prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The documents describe in some detail how money moved out of
Russia through the Bank of New York and for what purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York has not been accused of wrongdoing. It has
said it is fully cooperating with government investigators.
Sobinbank has also not been charged. The bank said Thursday that it
``had no knowledge of any criminal activities connected with funds
passing through'' the Bank of New York account.
</P>
<P>
   Sobinbank, founded in Moscow in 1990, became one of the most
politically connected financial institutions in the country. It was
put together by a collection of larger powerful banks, some of
which had ties to President Boris Yeltsin's inner circle, including
Boris A. Berezovsky, Russia's leading financier and media mogul.
Sobinbank was raided last year, and if Russian authorities decide
to pursue a case against the bank, that could mean taking on some
of the most influential people in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the Sobinbank court documents occurs as Louis J.
Freeh, director of the FBI, is in Moscow this week for meetings
with Russian prosecutors and other officials. A senior American
law-enforcement official said Freeh might meet the Russian
president, Vladimir Putin, and discuss some findings of the
investigation, with an offer to help the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louie was briefed by the FBI in New York and the U.S. attorney
for the Southern District about the case and about what we can do
for the Russians,'' the official said. ``If Putin wants to know
where all that money went, we can help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeh, in a news conference Thursday in Moscow after meeting
Interior Minister Vladimir B. Rushailo, made no mention of the Bank
of New York inquiry. But an American official said Freeh planned to
raise ``a range of issues'' with Russian officials at later
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy chairman of Sobinbank, Andrei Serebrennikov, said in
a statement that the government's seizure of $15 million on deposit
at the Bank of New York was ``not based on any substantiated
wrongdoing by Sobinbank'' but rather on ``the unproven theory that
the seized funds'' and bank account ``were associated with illegal
money-laundering activities by persons other than Sobinbank.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bank is affirmatively saying that it hasn't done anything
wrong, and the government hasn't produced any evidence to the
contrary,'' said Michael Lesch, a lawyer in Manhattan for the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The bank made similar arguments in court when it unsuccessfully
tried to regain control of the money.
</P>
<P>
   The newly released documents show that prosecutors told a
federal judge in Manhattan, Richard C. Casey, that the evidence
supported ``an inference of the complicity'' of Sobinbank in the
illegal activity in the Bank of New York accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, in refusing to overturn the seizure order and also
unsealing the proceedings, wrote, ``The court cannot fathom how
billions of Sobinbank's dollars could have been transferred out of
its constantly replenished B.O.N.Y. account, to accounts in the
United States, without Sobinbank's knowledge or willful blindness
to the scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents show that the government obtained a court order on
Aug. 20, 1999, to seize the $15 million from the Sobinbank account
and a much smaller sum, about $11,000, from an account controlled
by a bank called DKB.
</P>
<P>
   The office of U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White in Manhattan said in
the court papers that ``the degree to which Sobinbank was a
participant in the illegal activity in its correspondent account''
would be investigated further. Her office had no additional comment
Thursday.

JULIUS SCHULMAN, 84, VIOLINIST WHO PERFORMED WORLDWIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Pa., Mass., N.Y.)   By ALLAN KOZINN  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Julius Schulman, a widely traveled violinist who played in
several major American orchestras, including the Philadelphia
Orchestra, the Boston Symphony and the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra
in New York, died Sept. 9 at Brotman Hospital in Culver City,
Calif. He was 84 and lived in Culver City.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman was born in New York and began studying the violin at
the Malkin Conservatory in Manhattan when he was 5. He continued
his studies at the Juilliard School and later at the Curtis
Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where his teacher was the
violinist Efrem Zimbalist.
</P>
<P>
   While a student at Curtis, Schulman toured South America with
the All-American Youth Orchestra, conducted by Leopold Stokowski.
After his graduation in 1937, he joined Stokowski's Philadelphia
Orchestra. In 1944 he became assistant concertmaster of the
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, under Fritz Reiner. He performed
regularly as a soloist and gave several concerts at Town Hall in
New York in the 1940s. But on several occasions he turned down
opportunities to tour as a recitalist in favor of the security of
an orchestra job.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman returned to New York in 1947 to become the
concertmaster of the WOR Mutual Network Symphony Orchestra and was
frequently heard as a soloist on the orchestra's national
broadcasts. When the orchestra was disbanded after a strike in
1954, Schulman spent a year as a freelancer in Broadway orchestras
and for Muzak, the company that provides recorded background music.
</P>
<P>
   He spent two seasons as concertmaster of the New Orleans
Symphony Orchestra before moving back to New York to become
concertmaster of the Little Orchestra Society.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, after a tour of Europe, the Middle East and the Soviet
Union with the New York Philharmonic, Schulman joined the Boston
Symphony Orchestra, where he remained until 1970, except for a
sabbatical spent with the Philadelphia Orchestra on a tour of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   When he left the Boston Symphony, Schulman joined the
Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, where he was associate concertmaster
from 1970 to 1975. From 1975 until he retired in 1990, he was
concertmaster of the San Antonio Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman is survived by his wife, Betty; a son, J. Neil Schulman
of Culver City; a daughter, Margaret Garron of Colorado Springs;
two brothers, Bernard Schulman of Del Rey Beach, Fla., and
Lanesboro, Mass., and Samuel Schulman of Scarsdale, N.Y.; and two
sisters, Geri Vladimir and Beatrice Meltzer, both of Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.

EDITORIAL: A THREAT TO JUDICIAL ETHICS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 15:
</P>
<P>
   At a moment when the federal judiciary needs to tighten its
ethical prohibitions on accepting money or gifts from private
interests bent on influencing judicial thinking, Chief Justice
William Rehnquist has been quietly collaborating with Senate
Republicans to move in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   With Rehnquist's approval, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., tucked a
provision into a spending bill in July that would lift the
11-year-old ban on judges' collecting honorariums for appearances.
The ban was imposed in 1989 to protect the integrity and
impartiality of the judicial system against outside influence.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that McConnell, the leading opponent of
reforming the nation's corrupt campaign financing system, would be
blind to the dangers of widening the opportunities for monied
interests to buy favor with judges. But Rehnquist should know
better than to endorse McConnell's scheme to weaken judicial ethics
radically. The fact that in today's boisterous economy first-year
legal associates in top law firms can make as much as a federal
judge is no excuse to return to corruptive salary supplements from
private interests. Nor is the failure of Congress to meet its
commitment to adjust judicial salaries annually for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as Abner Mikva, the former White House counsel and
federal appellate judge, noted in a recent Op-Ed piece in The New
York Times, the fairness and impartiality of the federal judiciary
is already being seriously undermined by allowing federal judges to
accept free vacations at posh resorts from private interests bent
on influencing their future decisions. A valuable new report from
the Community Rights Counsel, an environmental group, finds that
between 1992 and 1998 some 230 federal judges _ more than a quarter
of the federal judiciary _ traveled to resort locations at the
expense of private interests with a stake in federal litigation.
Once there, they attended legal seminars making the case for
curbing federal regulatory authority in favor of a free-market
approach to matters like protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
   These junkets seem to be having an impact on judicial
decision-making. Ten of the past decade's most significant rulings
cutting back on environmental protections, according to the study,
were written by judges who attended these seminars, often while the
cases were pending in court.
</P>
<P>
   The need for reform was underscored a week ago when a federal
district judge in Manhattan, Jed Rakoff, denied a motion to recuse
himself from further involvement in a lawsuit seeking damages from
Texaco for harming the rain forest in Ecuador. Lawyers for the
plaintiffs _ indigenous people who live in the rain forest _ filed
the recusal motion upon learning of Rakoff's ill-advised
participation in an expenses-paid seminar on environmental issues
that had been held at a Montana ranch by a foundation receiving
sizable donations from Texaco. One of the lecturers was Alfred
DeCrane Jr., the retired chairman and chief executive officer of
Texaco, who ran the company when it operated in Ecuador. In his
ruling, Rakoff argued that his acceptance of the travel gift was
within existing rules, a hair-splitting explanation that does not
remove qualms about his judgment or impartiality.
</P>
<P>
   Federal judges should have the ethical compass to resist these
one-sided ``educational'' seminars. But in the absence of judicial
self-restraint, Rehnquist should be leading the U.S. Judicial
Conference, the governing body for all federal judges, to crack
down on such junkets, not nudging Congress to create new avenues
for influence-peddling.
</P>
<P>
   If judicial pay is deemed too low, Congress needs to address
that problem directly, by granting judges a salary increase paid
for with public funds. Similarly, if there is a genuine need for
judges to attend educational seminars, Congress ought to provide
public funds for that purpose, too. But the effort to lift the ban
on honorariums for judges, which was brought to light Thursday by
The Washington Post, should be rejected, either by Congress or by a
presidential veto.

FREDERICK KOCH, 88, CREATOR OF NEW WAY TO STAGE THEATER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.D., N.C., Fla., Va.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frederick Henry Koch Jr., a professor of drama at the University
of Miami who is credited with creating the first fully flexible
theater building in the round in the United States, died on Aug. 26
at his home in Miami. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Koch, who was born in Grand Forks, N.D., received degrees in
drama and sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill, where his father, also a drama professor, founded and
directed the Carolina Playmakers.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1933, he began his career as a social worker
and statistician for the Tennessee Valley Authority in the Great
Smoky Mountains of western North Carolina. He left two years later
to go on the road with a puppet show that promoted dental health.
</P>
<P>
   By 1937 Koch had developed his own puppet show and toured the
country with his wife, Edna Bryant, who had worked as a director.
They wrote their own shows and made their own puppets, often
discussing their construction as part of the entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, after completing his master's degree at Chapel Hill and
a brief teaching stint at the University of Virginia, he joined the
faculty of the University of Miami, where he set out to build a
drama department and a theater. Seven years later he organized the
first Ring, a theater in the round housed in the rotund tower of a
turreted three-story hotel on the university's north campus in
Coral Gables.
</P>
<P>
   The Ring was later moved to a mammoth circular tent on the main
campus. By 1950 work had begun on the $125,000 permanent structure
in which the architects Robert M. Little and Marion I. Manley
incorporated features like a revolving stage and moveable riser
units to seat 600 people who would never be more than eight rows
from the stage. Called by some America's most flexible theater, it
permitted proscenium and horseshoe as well as central staging. The
raised seats on rollers could be rearranged in an endless variety
of ways to bring the audience and performers into a closer
relationship. The theater was inaugurated in February 1952 with a
performance of Mary Ellen Chase's play ``Harvey.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Ring, Koch developed a smaller theater with a
conventional proscenium stage, the Box, in which aspiring
playwrights would have their work produced in exchange for an
evaluation by the audience. Among the students was Jerry Herman,
who would later write ``Hello Dolly,'' ``Mame'' and ``La Cage aux
Folles.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch is survived by three sons, Frederick III and Christopher
Alan, both of Miami, and Thomas Bryant of Burnsville, N.C.; two
brothers, Robert Alan, of Princeton, N.J., and William Julian, of
Glendale, Ariz.; seven grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arena playing bursts the picture frame and flows into a third
dimension of movement, and perhaps a fourth dimension of the human
heart and mind,'' Koch said of his creation in a 1951 interview in
The New York Times. ``The audience no longer watches a play. It is
enfolded by it and vibrates with it. Through intimacy the new-old
theater restores the right of the audience to see and hear and
delight in every detail.''

FAIRPLEX MEET MEANS RETURN OF PROF. JONES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ Class, scheduled for 11 a.m., got started a few
minutes later than that because some of the students were caught in
traffic. The Professor could hardly wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome back to Fairplex Park,'' Gordon Jones told a couple of
dozen veteran horseplayers when he could wait no longer. ``I've
been counting the days.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones loves the Los Angeles County Fair, which began its 18-day
racing season Thursday afternoon. He loves it more than any other
handicapper I know.
</P>
<P>
   He has been coming here since he was a student at Whittier
College nearly half a century ago and Fairplex was known simply as
Pomona. He has been touting the little track's subtle virtues since
the one-time USC journalism professor began picking winners for a
living in the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner in 1969 under the byline
``Prof. Gordon Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 70, Jones spends much of the year peddling his selections in
Las Vegas, and spends the summer on the move, betting the short
Northern California fair meets. In September he always comes back
to Fairplex, where on Thursday he began his ninth year offering
handicapping seminars and intertrack television commentary each day
of the 18-day season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, what makes Fairplex Park one of the MVPs of the
California circuit is that more people have discovered horse racing
by coming to Fairplex than any other track,'' Jones said after his
opening-day seminar, in which he presented a confident analysis of
all 13 races and fashioned a $744 pick-six ticket for his
listeners. ``Where else are millions of people walking past the
grandstand, hearing the noise inside and wondering what all the fun
is about. This is the window to racing.''
</P>
<P>
   The quality of that racing is lengths behind Santa Anita's,
Hollywood Park and Del Mar's. But to Jones the handicapping is
right up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a greater variety here, there's greater challenge
here,'' he said. ``With horses coming from 40 different (tracks),
that magnifies my advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones claims he beat the Fairplex races for eight years in a row
before a pair of pivotal photo-finish losses in 1999 snapped his
streak. He calls 2000 ``my revenge meet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more complicated it gets, the better,'' he told his
seminar guests. ``We'll be rewarded if we're working hard and
paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   As ever, Jones leans heavily on speed figures, pace analysis and
trend statistics. In his day as a stylish turf writer for the
Herald-Examiner, he did as much to promote speed handicapping in
the West as Andy Beyer did in the East. Jones wrote a book,
modestly titled ``Gordon Jones to Win,'' and was one of the first
to conduct handicapping seminars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to read him in the Herald-Examiner, and I wondered what
happened to him,'' said Fred Henderson, a racing fan who attended
Thursday's seminar on the third floor of the Fairplex clubhouse,
marking Jones' selections in his track program. ``I came in here
today and there he was. He's a great speaker. I'll definitely be
back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very popular handicapper,'' Fairplex vice president
Neil O'Dwyer said of Jones. ``When he and (intertrack TV host) Mike
Willman talk about the races, we get a lot of positive feedback.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing is that both of them love Pomona. A lot of
players who handicap horses racing on the mile tracks all year
don't like to bet this five-eighths-mile track.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones doesn't just like it. He loves it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing with certainty,'' he told his listeners.
``I'm going to have more fun playing the races at Fairplex than
anywhere else. And I think you will too.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening day: Matt Garcia rode favored Sea Reel ($4.60) to a
victory over 50-1 My American Girl in the Bustles and Bows Stakes
for 2-year-old fillies, one of Garcia's three wins Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   This Tune Can Hum ($12.80) and jockey Iggy Puglisi led all the
way to win the Foothill Stakes for 3-year-olds. Even-money favorite
Grey Memo started badly and finished third behind Quinton's Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Defending riding champion Martin Pedroza rode two winners.
</P>
<P>
   The J.C. Gonzalez Memorial Jockey Award, named in honor of the
23- year-old killed in a racing accident on Fairplex's opening day
in 1999, will be dedicated in a winner's circle ceremony Saturday.
The award is to be presented annually to the track's leading
jockey.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: Hopefuls for the Nov. 4 Breeders' Cup races at
Churchill Downs compete in Saturday's Woodward Stakes at Belmont
Park and other major races back east.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-mile Woodward finds Pacific Classic winner Skimming
challenging top-ranked Lemon Drop Kid, Behrens and Commendable.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-mile Kentucky Cup Classic at Turfway Park on Saturday drew
another group of Breeders' Cup Classic possibilities, including
Hollywood Gold Cup winner Early Pioneer, Golden Missile, Captain
Steve and Cat Thief.
</P>
<P>
   Riboletta heads the 1 1/16-mile Ruffian Handicap for fillies and
mares at Belmont on Saturday.

TESTS BY GENENTECH AND NOVARTIS OF ASTHMA DRUG ARE SUSPENDED 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW POLLACK  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   Genentech Inc. and Novartis AG have partly suspended clinical
trials of what is considered a highly promising drug for asthma and
allergies after extremely high doses of the drug or of a related
molecule caused low blood platelet counts and some deaths in
monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Tanox Inc., a small biotechnology company that helped develop
the drug, reported the move in a regulatory filing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech and Novartis have already applied to the Food and Drug
Administration for permission to market the drug, known as Xolair,
or E25, which some analysts expect could be a blockbuster, with
sales of close to $1 billion or more. In clinical trials, E25 has
allowed some asthma patients to wean themselves from steroids,
which can have undesirable side effects.
</P>
<P>
   A Genentech spokeswoman confirmed the suspension of the trials
but said Genentech and Novartis did not think the situation would
hurt the drug's prospects for approval. The drug has been tested in
nearly 2,000 people and the problems experienced by the monkeys
were not seen in humans, except temporarily in five patients, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Tanox and Genentech dropped earlier this week when
some investors first learned of the situation, but their prices
have recovered somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a nonissue,'' said Meirav Chovav,
biotechnology analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. ``But I don't
think it's a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The monkeys that developed low platelet levels, a condition that
can lead to uncontrolled bleeding, received 3 to 27 times the
maximum clinical dose. Two out of 10 monkeys that received 15 times
the maximum clinical dose of E26, the next generation drug, died.
</P>
<P>
   Trials of E26, which had begun in Europe, were put on hold,
according to the Tanox filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Trials of E25 were partly suspended: existing patients
can continue treatments but new patients are not being accepted.  &QL;

VENTURA POWERS METS OVER EXPOS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ For the New York Mets to go deep into the postseason,
Robin Ventura knows that much of the burden will fall on him. No
matter how Mike Piazza is hitting _ and right now, he is not
hitting at all _ Ventura will have to drive in runs because he bats
behind the Mets' cleanup hitter. Teams would rather make Ventura
beat them than let Piazza do it.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal Expos proved this Thursday night. In the seventh
inning, when Edgardo Alfonzo reached second base on a wild pitch
with Piazza batting, Expos manager Felipe Alou ordered Piazza
intentionally walked.
</P>
<P>
   Alou, whose team trailed by two runs, called for a rookie
left-hander, Sean Spencer, to face Ventura. On Spencer's first
pitch, Ventura rifled a three-run homer to right-center, sending
the Mets and Glendon Rusch to a 10-4 victory that increased their
lead in the National League wild-card race to five games over the
idle Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets remain two games behind the Atlanta Braves in the NL
East. The Braves beat the Florida Marlins Thursday by 5-3, and play
at Arizona this weekend before a three-game series with the Mets in
Atlanta starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who had two days off this week, partly to work on his
swing, has hit in each of his last three games. Thursday night's
performance was his best: He scored twice and went 3 for 5, just
his third three-hit game of a trying offensive season.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch has received about 3.5 runs per start, and considering
that luck, it is remarkable he does not have a losing record. He
evened his mark at 10-10 Thursday night, and if he wins two more
times this year, he will equal his career victory total over parts
of three seasons with Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch was the dark-horse entry in a four-man derby for the fifth
starter's job in spring training, but now the Mets may have to
consider him for a start in the playoffs, should they qualify. The
fourth starter, Bobby J. Jones, has been effective, with a 9-5
record, but Rusch, a left-hander, could match up better against
certain opponents. Rusch, who worked 7 1/3 innings Thursday night,
also has been more consistent, with a 2.70 earned run average over
his last five starts.

HOME SEARCH YIELDS HUNDREDS OF GUNS AND EXPLOSIVES, POLICE SAY
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT WORTH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOBBS FERRY, N.Y. _ Police officers investigating a burglary
complaint at a home here discovered more than 160 guns, a variety
of explosives and fuses, rocket engines, and at least 150 pounds of
gunpowder, the Westchester County district attorney, Jeanine Pirro,
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   James G. Neff, a 38-year-old machinist living at 85 Myrtle
Avenue with his parents, was arrested Thursday and charged with
criminal weapons possession and intent to sell. Both charges are
felonies punishable by up to seven years in prison, and further
charges are expected, Pirro said.
</P>
<P>
   The police discovered a book on how to build an atomic bomb,
along with books on building conventional bombs, the authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was apparently a munitions factory,'' Pirro said.
</P>
<P>
   Neff pleaded not guilty at an arraignment in Village Court.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons, which were found throughout the house, included
grenades hollowed out to hold explosives, pipes of various sizes
that had been welded and drilled for use as bombs, fuses, timing
devices, magnets, commercial-grade chemicals, gunpowder and
thousands of rounds of ammunition, including armor-piercing
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Chief George Longworth of the Dobbs Ferry Police Department said
the Westchester County bomb squad was testing the explosives in
Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   The guns included more than 130 rifles and shotguns and 30
handguns. Pirro said they appeared to be unlicensed. Seven
silencers were also found, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember a cache as large as this,'' Pirro said.
``What is unusual is not just the guns but the fact that he was
making guns, silencers, pipe bombs, and hand grenades. There were
chemical explosives that you need only add sugar to that would have
blown up an area.''

LAZIO'S DEBATE TACTIC SHAPES NEXT DAY'S CAMPAIGNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MRSCLINTON-CAMPAIGN) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FULTON, N.Y. _ Fresh from their contentious first debate, the
Senate candidates on Thursday continued firing at one another _
from a distance _ as they sought to capitalize on the momentum they
both claimed from their encounter Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, who embarked on a four-city swing through
western and central New York, defended his televised challenge to
Clinton to sign a pact against the use of unregulated campaign
contributions known as soft money. Pictures of Lazio approaching
Clinton and brandishing a slip of paper emerged as one of the
debate's enduring images, featured prominently in television news
segments and on the front pages of morning newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after greeting patrons at a Buffalo diner Thursday
morning, called Lazio's actions a stunt and belittled him, saying
it reminded her of dealing with her two younger brothers. ``You
just sort of say, `Well, that's fine, but now let's talk seriously
about what we're going to do today and how we're going to get it
done.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio made no apologies for his tactics in the debate, brushing
aside complaints from debate organizers that he had violated a rule
against using props. ``The only person who violated the rules was
Mrs. Clinton by not agreeing to what she said she was going to do,
a ban on soft money,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   He also defended his aggressive manner. ``People expect plain
talk,'' Lazio told reporters in Buffalo before beginning his bus
trip, one of several planned in the coming weeks as he steps up his
campaign schedule amid talk from some party leaders that he has had
a lackadaisical pace lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you can't take the high horse and then take the low
road,'' he said. ``If you fire at me, you're going to have to
expect to get fired back at.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan McLagan, his communications director, promised more verbal
warfare. ``This isn't high tea,'' he said. ``It's the Senate race
in New York, and New Yorkers want someone who will fight for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's senior advisers said Lazio may have helped them with
particularly competitive voting blocs. They contended that people,
especially women, saw Lazio's aggressiveness as a form of bullying
that he would not have carried out against a man. ``It just
backfired,'' one adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio rejected that assertion Thursday night after speaking to
dairy farmers near Syracuse, saying that his treatment of Clinton
was meant only to demonstrate the force he would bring to debates
in the Senate. ``You have got to stand up when you are in the
Senate,'' Lazio said. ``No one is going to care if you are a man or
a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Even children, it seemed, paid notice to his style in the
debate, as Lazio discovered during one of his stops, at a new
charter school in Rochester. Lazio, in a speech on education
earlier this week, called for allowing parents more options to
choose schools for their children, including charter schools, which
are public schools given wide latitude from local board regulation.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit to the Charter School of Science and Technology
Thursday, a second-grader asked him: ``Why were you fighting
against Mrs. Clinton?''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio responded, ``Last night we were on TV and were talking
about different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Fagan, a second-grader who said she had watched the
debate with her father, asked, ``Did you expect her to sign that
paper?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really, really did,'' Lazio replied, seated on a child's
chair and leaning toward his questioner, ``and I still do.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are to meet Oct. 8 for another debate, sponsored
by WCBS-TV in New York City; they are negotiating the possibility
of a third encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Lazio began his day receiving endorsements from three
Hispanic organizations in Buffalo. He went on to the school, then
to a campaign rally here. He planned to end the day talking to
farmers in Cazenovia, near Syracuse, and to campaign on Long Island
on Friday and upstate again over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after her visit to the diner, flew to New York City to
attend a fund-raiser at Radio City Music Hall with Vice President
Al Gore. On Friday, she plans her first campaign appearance with
Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic vice
presidential nominee and someone she is counting on to shore up
support from Jewish voters.

 TEACHERS IN BUFFALO WALK OUT FOR 2nd TIME IN A WEEK  
 By KATE ZERNIKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A New York state judge ordered Buffalo's public school teachers
back to their classrooms Thursday after they announced a strike in
the hour before school started for the second time in a weeklong
and increasingly bitter dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly 4,000 teachers in the Buffalo school system, the
state's second largest, had returned to classes earlier this week
as a good-faith gesture while strike negotiations continued, and
the school district believed that the two sides were within
whispering distance of a settlement late Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But after hundreds of students had already boarded the buses to
school, the Buffalo Teachers Federation announced at 7 a.m.
Thursday that it would strike again; the same timing it used last
Sept. 7, when administrators scrambled to cancel school after the
day had effectively begun for about 47,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Bus drivers served their routes as usual to tell parents waiting
with their children that school was canceled, and to pick up
children waiting alone to deliver them to school, where officials
called parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the teachers' union to make this decision after the
children were on the buses, and without any warning, it's just,
it's just unbelievable,'' said Marion Canedo, the schools
superintendent and herself a picket-line veteran of a bitter
teachers' strike in 1976. ``The distance we were apart was so
small.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Kevin M. Dillon ordered union officials into state
Supreme Court at midday, then issued a restraining order requiring
the teachers to return to work and the union to return to court on
Monday, when he would hold a contempt hearing. The judge, who said
he grew up in a union family, blasted the union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a father,'' he said, ``I ask how would a Pepsi-Cola worker
on Walden Avenue feel dropping off a child at the bus stop at 7 in
the morning and getting out to work, only to discover the strike
had started?''
</P>
<P>
   There have been relatively few teachers' strikes in New York
state over the last two decades, largely because of the Taylor Law,
which makes it illegal for public employees to strike. But even for
Buffalo, a city with a long history of lawsuits and strikes by the
teachers' union, this dispute has become particularly fierce, with
the city's mayor Thursday accusing the union of ``unconscionable
and selfish'' behavior and the union accusing school officials of
reneging on salary offers made at the negotiating table.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``In the interests of our community and at the request of the
state mediator, Buffalo teachers have gone more than the extra mile
to keep schools open,'' the union said in a statement. ``Because of
the broken assurances of the district and their apparent lack of
authority to negotiate, we have no choice but to request that
Buffalo teachers picket in the Buffalo public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Canedo vehemently denied pulling back any proposals. ``There is
nothing, never, ever, that has been reneged on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The union has been working under an expired contract since June
1999. The primary dispute in negotiations is over salary increases.
But according to the district, the two sides were a mere half
percentage point apart Wednesday night, with the district offering
a 16.5 percent pay raise over four years, and the teachers pushing
for a 17 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the district is asking teachers to accept a
reduction in retirement benefits. Buffalo schools now provide
retiring teachers with lifetime health insurance, at an annual
expense of $10.3 million, but that cost is expected to double over
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Maddigan, a spokesman for the district, said the district
was now asking teachers to assume part of those costs, by paying
$675 a year after retirement for health insurance for the first
four years of a new contract, and $1,000 a year after that.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony Masiello, who has two children in the schools,
accused the union of striking over petty differences; the last
major strike, in 1976, was over sweeping layoffs and budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect negotiations to be bumpy and difficult, but to
take the kind of action they have is totally inappropriate and
uncalled for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers risk being cited for contempt of court, which could
involve fines or jail time. In addition, school district officials
said, the district now stands at risk of losing $2 million in state
aid for the two strike days.
</P>
<P>
   The district must hold 180 school days as a condition of
receiving state aid, but according to a contract provision that is
not subject to change, Buffalo teachers cannot work more than 42
weeks past Labor Day. With several snow days likely, school
officials said, they may not be able to squeeze in those 180 days
before the teachers' clock runs out.

WILLIAM WARREN, 91, EX-LAW DEAN, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  By SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Clements Warren, a former dean of Columbia Law School
who rebuilt it as it entered the modern era, died on Monday. He was
91.
</P>
<P>
   As first the leader of, then a major donor to, the law school
where two buildings now bear his name, Warren had an influence
there that spanned five decades and ``was probably unrivaled at
almost any law school in the latter part of the 20th century,''
said David W. Leebrun, the current dean.
</P>
<P>
   He was dean of the school from 1952 to 1970. But Warren, whose
rise to prominence has the makings of a classic tale of hard luck
and bootstraps, did not restrict his activities to academia. A
renowned tax attorney who was co-author of widely used textbooks on
the subject, he was called upon for advice by mayors, governors and
federal officials alike.
</P>
<P>
   To carry out what friends said was the equivalent of three
full-time jobs, Warren rose at 5 a.m., a habit he learned as a
child in Paris, Texas, where he milked cows and delivered
newspapers, holding paying jobs even as a small boy, one of his
sons, Robert Warren, said.
</P>
<P>
   Warren worked his way through college at the University of Texas
at Austin; there he met a judge who allowed him to bunk on his
porch. That relationship encouraged him to enter Harvard Law
School, from which he graduated in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   While in the U.S. Army in Britain during World War II, Warren
met Diana June Peel Willock, an actress, whom he married in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Warren is survived by his wife and three children: Robert Peel
Warren of Potomac, Md.; Larissa Warren Gibson of Caldwell, N.J.,
and William Liversridge Warren of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to his job at a New York law firm in 1946,
Warren joined the faculty of the Columbia Law School. In 1947, he
was one of three experts asked by the treasury secretary to help
prepare a new national tax program. In 1949, he joined the ranks of
U.S. experts helping Japan rebuild its civic systems.
</P>
<P>
   He was also personal counsel to notable clients including Robert
B. Anderson, secretary of the treasury, and James M. Landis, a
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who was
convicted of failing to file his income tax return.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Warren was made dean of Columbia Law School; he
transformed the job from shepherd of the faculty to something more
closely resembling chief executive of a large business.
</P>
<P>
   He raised $8 million for a new building to replace the one that
had housed the school since 1910. He also established the
admissions and placement offices, diversified the student body and
improved scholarship financing.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, who lived in Ridgewood, N.J., prepared for the governor
of New Jersey, Robert B. Meyner, a much-debated analysis of New
York state's tax on nonresidents working in New York state. In the
early 1960s, he was on the Moreland Act Commission, which
recommended sweeping changes to New York's liquor laws, including
an end to compulsory minimum prices.
</P>
<P>
   Described by colleagues as a no-nonsense, focused man who
commanded loyalty by his sheer competence, Warren did not seem
interested in using his position to win social prestige, Leebrun
said. He did, however, use it as a bully pulpit. He repeatedly
denounced what he called the decline of the liberal arts
curriculum, complaining that the inability of law students to write
``reasonably literate English prose'' had reached ``epidemic
proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   He also called for legal education for the general public, wider
access to legal services for the poor and revision of the state
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   His politics were not always easy to pinpoint. He both protested
the anti-Communist excesses of the McCarthy era and defended
Columbia for calling in the police during the 1968 student
uprisings on campus, later appearing in court to plead for leniency
for the 400 students who were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Until his final bout of ill health this year, Warren continued
to commute to work at the firm of Roberts &AMP; Holland almost daily
and was on the boards of several corporations, including the
Sterling National Bank and Barnwell Industries.

EDITORIAL: THE TELEVISED OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 15:
</P>
<P>
   When the Olympic Games were first broadcast live, from Cortina
D'Ampezzo, Italy, in the winter of 1956, the final torch-bearer at
the opening ceremony tripped and fell over a television cable laid
across the stadium. There is something deeply emblematic in that
moment. It captures what has been, at times, an awkward synergy
between television and the Olympics. And yet for nearly all of us,
the Olympic experience is fundamentally a television experience,
and it is television revenue that has driven the expansion of the
Games, as it has driven the expansion of all sports.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, CBS paid $50,000 for the American television rights to
the Winter Games in Squaw Valley, Calif., and offered 15 hours of
coverage. For this year's Sydney Olympics, NBC has paid $705
million _ in rights only, not production costs _ and will, with its
cable stations, televise 441{ hours of coverage. That is just
slightly less than the total of all American televised Olympics
coverage between Squaw Valley in 1960 and Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, in
1984. And then there is Internet coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Olympiad after Olympiad, we watch the Games with the mingling of
sophistication and naivete that television always elicits from us.
The intimacy and familiarity one often feels by the third or fourth
night of watching the Olympics is really a measure of the intimacy
Americans feel toward their televisions. The Games have changed in
almost every respect over the past 30 or 40 years. Far more
countries participate. New sports have been added and old ones
dropped. Technology has transformed the Games, changing the way
athletes dress to compete, how they prepare, and the manner in
which they are timed and measured and televised. Yet for many
Americans, the changes in the Olympics are best summed up in the
evolution from Jim McKay to Bob Costas.
</P>
<P>
   This year, because of the great time difference between
Australia and the United States, there will be no live coverage of
the competition. That will mean a real loss in transmitting the
natural excitement of the Games. What we will get instead from
Sydney is a seamless package of events and features, an oscillation
between tight focus on contests and tight focus on individuals and
their lives _ up close and personal, as ABC taught us to say.
</P>
<P>
   It will be easy to believe that we are learning a lot about
Australia, about team handball, about Marion Jones and her American
and international colleagues. But as always when television is at
the center of our attention, we will mostly be observing events in
a repackaged form that television executives believe caters to the
American taste for celebrity and high drama. Some games, like
baseball and soccer, contain an inherent narrative of their own.
But most Olympic events lack that kind of integral narrative. There
are heats and finals, winners and losers. There is mostly the
extraordinary effort of individuals. What television will bring us
night after night is what it believes we most crave: reality shaped
into one story after another.  &QL;

BUSH ON SPOT AS GOP PUSHES TO PULL GI'S OUT OF KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 11th graf with corrected information.)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House and Senate negotiators are fighting over a
deadline for withdrawing American troops from Kosovo, renewing a
clash with President Clinton and putting Gov. George W. Bush on the
spot again, since he lobbied Senate Republicans to drop a similar
provision earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a proposal to cut off money for nearly 6,000 U.S.
ground forces in Kosovo by April 1, 2001, forcing their withdrawal
unless Congress authorizes an extension.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Senate rejected a similar measure, 53-47, with at
least two or three Republicans saying they were swayed by Bush, who
called it a ``legislative overreach'' that would tie his hands if
he became president. But House Republicans quietly attached a
comparable provision to the Pentagon's $310 billion budget bill for
fiscal year 2001.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate leaders are now meeting in a conference
committee to reconcile the two versions of the military budget
bills _ one with the provision, the other without. The contentious
language was one of the last sticking points negotiators faced in
finishing the bill before Congress adjourns for the year.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday night, there were signs that congressional
Republicans were relenting. ``I think we'll work something out,''
said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who heads the Armed Services
Committee and who sponsored the original Senate measure. The House
version was sponsored by Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute comes at an awkward time for Bush, the Republican
presidential nominee, who has accused the Clinton administration of
allowing the military's combat readiness to erode, in part by
dispatching American forces on far-flung peacekeeping missions to
places like Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush, Ray Sullivan, said Thursday that the
governor objected to the Republican-written language for the same
reasons that he balked at the Senate provision in May. ``He views
it as a legislative overreach on the powers of the president,''
said Sullivan, who added that congressional Republicans were aware
of Bush's views.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the provision would undermine the unity and morale
of NATO's peacekeeping operation, which involves forces from
Britain, France, Germany, Italy and other nations in and out of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent late Thursday to Warner, Clinton warned that
imposing an arbitrary deadline for withdrawal would also send a
dangerous signal of uncertain American resolve to President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia before that country's scheduled
elections on Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Under the provision, Clinton's successor would be required to
certify to Congress that Washington's European allies were meeting
their commitments in Kosovo for reconstruction aid, police
officers, food and medicines. Without that certification, the
measure required that money be spent in Kosovo only for an orderly
withdrawal of American troops.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would require the allies to be responsible for at
least 50 percent of reconstruction aid, 85 percent of humanitarian
assistance and 90 percent of police officers in Kosovo. The allies
are now providing 87 percent of the reconstruction aid, 73 percent
of the humanitarian assistance and 87 percent of the police, the
White House said. Some of the contributions are from non-European
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter last month to Warner, Defense Secretary William
Cohen criticized the provision, saying it was ``unacceptable
because it is counterproductive to peace in Kosovo and could
seriously jeopardize relations between the United States and its
NATO allies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If enacted this provision would take decision-making on the
deployment of U.S. forces out of the hands of Congress and the
President and put it into the hands of European governments _ a
dangerous precedent,'' said Cohen, who is the only Republican in
Clinton's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This provision would create uncertainty about U.S. intentions
and resoluteness, and could encourage an extremist element to take
actions that could put American forces at increased risk, in the
hope of triggering their withdrawal,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   But many congressional Republicans say the provision is
essential to relieve the burden on American ground troops in Kosovo
and pressure European countries to pay a larger share of the
reconstruction and policing costs for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel pretty strongly about it,'' said Rep. Richard Armey of
Texas, the House majority leader. ``The question is, how long will
we have people over there, and when will we have a clear definition
of what they're doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Floyd Spence of South Carolina, chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, agreed: ``We're tied down too much in different
places right now. People are scattered all over the world, our
readiness is down and our equipment is wearing out. We have to have
our allies do more.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats echoed Cohen's dire warnings. ``These arbitrary
limits are not going to be helpful,'' said Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode
Island Democrat on the Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the panel's senior Democrat and a
top negotiator in the conference committee, said: ``It undermines
the coalition and creates terrible morale for our troops to let
them know they're coming out.''

EDITORIAL: AIRLINE COMPETITION OVER CHINA
</HEADLINE>
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 15:
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate takes up permanent normal trade relations with
China, the Department of Transportation is on the verge of awarding
an additional U.S. carrier the valuable right to fly to that
nation. Lamentably, the aviation deal negotiated by President
Clinton and Zhu Rongji, China's prime minister, in April 1999 does
not reflect the spirit of the trade agreement. It is so restrictive
that the Transportation Department, for the first time ever in such
a bilateral route-awarding proceeding, is being forced to pick
between cargo and passenger carriers. Chinese negotiators refused
to differentiate between the two.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting apples-or-oranges lobbying fight for the 10 new
weekly flights has been both intense and bizarre, even by
Washington standards. The Teamsters union, while opposing the trade
deal with China, has aggressively lobbied members of Congress and
the White House on behalf of the bid by United Parcel Service. The
company employs some 200,000 Teamsters, and the union is keen on
benefiting from the anticipated explosion of trade that it opposed.
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel makes a strong case, because at present FedEx is
the only all-cargo carrier that flies directly from the United
States to China. By contrast, there are six such carriers
authorized to operate between the United States and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Among passenger airlines, Delta's bid to provide daily nonstop
service from New York City to Beijing has the most merit. Delta
would join United, Northwest and three Chinese airlines in
providing service between the two countries, but would be the first
to fly nonstop from the Northeast. Such a route is long overdue.
New York, the world's financial capital and the American city with
the largest Chinese-American community, has 11 weekly direct
flights to Singapore, but none to Beijing or Shanghai. At present,
travelers to Beijing must change planes in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department has been weighing these strong
competing bids for months, and must now decide which company to
give direct access to China, a great asset to a carrier with global
aspirations. The New York Times editorial page has no view on which
bid should prevail, and finds the awarding process an unsettling
reminder of the benefits of deregulating air travel. The fewer such
routes the government awards by decree, the better.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, the restrictive bilateral treaty forces the
government to choose between a second U.S. cargo carrier and a
third airline to China. That is unfortunate. With the advent of
normalized trade relations, the Clinton administration should
revisit this issue and clamor for greater access to China for both
cargo and passengers.

YANKEES DENY WELLS BUT ALLOW CRUZ TO HOMER IN THE 11TH
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If David Wells is going to pitch one game in a
three-game series in New York, some of his old teammates reasoned
Thursday, they would prefer he pitch the last game if they were
trying to beat him. For that would give Wells two days to fully
indulge in some of Manhattan's best liquid cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   But Boomer is unpredictable, David Cone said, grinning. Wells
loves the city, loved playing for the Yankees, and no question,
he's got many friends here willing to buy a round and toast him.
</P>
<P>
   This week was not the best time for Wells to hoist a few, what
with him just one victory shy of collecting his 20th victory for
the first time and with the Toronto Blue Jays teetering on the edge
of the wild card race.
</P>
<P>
   Wells pitched splendidly Thursday night before allowing a homer
to Derek Jeter that tied the game at 1-1 in the eighth. Then, in
the 11th, Jose Cruz Jr., slammed a two-run homer off the
left-hander Randy Choate, and Toronto hung on for a 3-2 victory at
Yankee Stadium that prevented the Yankees from sweeping the
three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, leading Boston by eight games in the American
League East, open a four-game series here with Cleveland Friday
night still having not allowed three or more runs in an inning
since Aug. 29, a streak that encompasses a span of 136 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Andy Pettitte, who allowed one unearned run in 7 1/3
innings, nor Wells were involved in the decision. Pettitte
surrendered just three hits in the first seven innings, walked none
and faced just two batters over the minimum. But Craig Grebeck
banged a lead-off double in the eighth after fighting off a couple
of tough pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Dewayne Wise ran for Grebeck, and when Alberto Castillo bunted
toward the mound, Wise charged toward third base. Pettitte came off
the mound quickly and appeared to have a good chance at nailing
Wise at third, but he whipped the throw wide, so far to the second
base side of the bag that the third baseman Scott Brosius never
moved. Wise scored the game's first run and Castillo moved to
second on Pettitte's error.
</P>
<P>
   As Chuck Knoblauch stepped in to bat with one out in the eighth,
Jeter turned to a boy in the second row of the stands near the
Yankees' on-deck circle and chatted, perhaps checking with the
youngster to see whether he should swing at the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter got ahead in the count three balls and no strikes, and
with the count 3-1, he swung hard and smashed the pitch to
straightaway center. The ball disappeared beyond the 408-foot sign,
the fans exploded and Wells grimaced.
</P>
<P>
   The old school rules regarding decorum among competitors will
never apply to Wells, who rarely passes on an easy chance for
conversation. The Yankees catcher Jorge Posada jogged out to left
field to stretch before Thursday night's game and at first, he
tried to keep his distance from Wells, with whom he shared a
perfect game at the Stadium in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Lying on his back and stretching, Wells shouted something to
Posada, and Posada burst out laughing, and they continued to
banter. Wells began throwing in a part of the outfield usually
inhabited by the Yankees pitcher and catcher.
</P>
<P>
   When Pettitte marched past, he glanced at Wells before moving on
sternly to the bullpen. Pettitte would have been a perfect hall
monitor in high school, completely trustworthy. Wells assuredly was
a hall monitor's worst nightmare at San Diego's Point Loma High.
</P>
<P>
   But Wells is as serious about competing as Pettitte is. When he
embraces a challenge, Wells challenges hitters, pounding them with
fastballs, spinning his curveball for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To challenge him makes him a better pitcher,'' Torre said
before the game. ``I hope we beat his brains in, but that doesn't
diminish the respect I have for him.''
