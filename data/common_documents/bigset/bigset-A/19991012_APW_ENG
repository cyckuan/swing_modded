	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Once again, the only goal was to win the World  
Series. And for the fifth straight year, the Cleveland Indians came 
up a bit short. 
</P>
<P>
	They're running out of excuses. And now, they're running out of  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's offseason arrived prematurely late Monday night when  
too many injuries, too little pitching and too much Pedro Martinez 
and the Boston Red Sox caught up to the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't supposed to end this way for the first team since 1950  
to score 1,000 runs in a season, and one with an All-Star at every 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	As he packed away his catching gear for the winter on Tuesday at  
Jacobs Field, Sandy Alomar summed up the frustrations of a team and 
a town desperate to win it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had one goal in mind this year, to get to the World Series  
and win,'' he said. ``We've been saying that every year, and it 
seems like the same story every year. It's disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, somebody played better than we did. Somebody  
always seems to play better than we do. We're always short of 
something. I guess people here are getting tired of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wait 'til next century is now the battle cry for some Indians  
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	For others, it's ``Fire Hargrove!''  
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland enters an offseason of uncertainty as owner Dick  
Jacobs is expected to sell the five-time AL Central champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Will new ownership clean house? Will general manager John Hart  
be back? What about manager Mike Hargrove, whose pitching decisions 
will be second-guessed all winter? Can the Indians finally find 
some pitching help? 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielder David Justice thinks next year's Indians could be  
drastically different. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys aren't going to be back,'' he said. ``We already  
got that feeling. It's just the way things have gone this year. 
Mike Jackson and Doc (Gooden), I feel like they're not going to be 
back. Mike Jackson has always wanted to stay here, but I guess they 
don't want him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who had 39 saves this season, is the biggest name among  
the free agents the Indians could lose this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to stay here,'' he said. ``But it's not my  
decision. They haven't really told me anything yet. We've left the 
door open to talk. My intention is to come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice, too, said he wants to stay in Cleveland but expects to  
hear his name churned through the the rumor mill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always up in the air,'' he said. ``I'm at that trade-bait  
age. ... I love playing here. But don't ever forget, it's a 
business. You have to strengthen your team every year, and it's 
obvious what we need to strengthen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland has all its stars signed for next year, and holds an  
option on outfielder Manny Ramirez. The Indians may try to sign 
Ramirez to a long-term deal, but after he hit 44 homers and drove 
in 165 runs this year, there's no telling how much that could cost 
a new owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's improbable comeback from an 0-2 deficit to win the AL  
division series in five games over the Indians maybe wasn't as 
stunning as Cleveland winning the first two. 
</P>
<P>
	There were signs all season that the Indians might not play deep  
into October. Despite winning the Central by 21 1/2 games, Cleveland 
went just 10-22 against Boston, New York and Texas, the league's 
other playoff teams. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was the disabled list.  
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, perhaps more than any other team, was ravaged by  
injuries to key players. The team used its disabled list 22 times, 
lost 924 player days due to injury and was only able to field its 
opening day lineup four times -- the last on April 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough when guys get hurt all during the season,'' said  
reliever Steve Karsay, who went on the DL twice and could only be 
used sparingly in the postseason because of injury. ``You always 
wondered if we were ever going to get our guys back at the same 
time. We had to mix and match guys, but I think it was too much of 
a load at the end of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sure enough, it was an injury to starter Dave Burba in Game 3  
that swung the series against the Red Sox. And in Game 5, Kenny 
Lofton dislocated his left shoulder with a head-first slide into 
the bag at first, fittingly capping a season of strains and 
sprains. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Kenny got hurt, it was like the final straw,'' said  
Roberto Alomar, who put up MVP-type numbers in his first season in 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there was a bright side to the injuries as the Indians  
got contributions from youngsters Richie Sexson, Einar Diaz, Jacob 
Cruz, Dave Roberts, Alex Ramirez and Sean DePaula. 
</P>
<P>
	Burba's injury exposed the Indians' biggest flaw -- pitching  
depth. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's decision not to go after a frontline No. 1 starter at the  
trading deadline now looks like the wrong one. But it's easy to 
second guess and the Indians did find out this year that Bartolo 
Colon isn't far from being an ace. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old right-hander went 18-5, going 11-2 in the second  
half. But he buckled under the pressure of having to pitch on three 
days' rest in Game 4 of the division series. 
</P>
<P>
	As Colon matures, the Indians are wondering what to do with  
Jaret Wright, a postseason hero as a rookie in '97 who was just 
8-10 in the regular season and couldn't throw the ball over the 
plate in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Whoever buys the Indians is assured of getting a contender. But  
contending isn't good enough for Cleveland or the Indians anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to go home and think about what will make us better  
next year,'' Jim Thome said. ``And then come back and try again.''

<HEADLINE> Nine Planet Hollywoods To Close U.S. locations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Planet Hollywood has closed nine of its 32  
U.S. restaurants ahead of a planned Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando-based company plans to file bankruptcy petitions  
today in Delaware, and will soon file its reorganization plan, the 
company said in a news release Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is the first step in our plan to position Planet  
Hollywood for a return to long-term profitability and healthy 
growth,'' said Robert Earl, chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's restructuring plan also calls for upgrading  
several of its movie-themed restaurants and menus, Earl said. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurants closed Monday were in Chicago, Costa Mesa,  
Calif.; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Gurnee, Ill.; Houston; Indianapolis; 
Maui, Hawaii; Miami and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	There may still be a couple of additional closings or franchise  
conversions, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the reorganization, Planet Hollywood International  
Inc.'s two largest shareholders and a trust for Earl's children 
have agreed to provide a $30 million cash infusion to help keep the 
international chain of glitzy restaurants going. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned bankruptcy filing is the latest setback for the  
operator of nearly 80 Planet Hollywood restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Former president William Baumhauer resigned in June, just three  
months after the company's co-founder resigned his board position. 
Keith Barish, who started the venture with Earl and actors 
Sylvester Stallone, Demi Moore, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce 
Willis, left the company in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been trying to cut operating costs by reducing  
corporate overhead, putting in cost-control systems, streamlining 
store-level operations and disposing of nonessential corporate 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite those moves, analysts have said aggressive expansion and  
increased competition have hurt the company.

<HEADLINE> Teddy Bears Adorn Gay Attack Fence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- On the one-year anniversary of Matthew  
Shepard's death, two men completed a four-day, 72-mile hike and 
left 150 homemade teddy bears at the fence where the gay college 
student was tied up and beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Switzer and Jeremy Atencio say their Hike For Hope was  
done to raise awareness of hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot to do to make it so no one ever has to visit a  
site like this again,'' said Switzer, a friend of Shepard's. 
</P>
<P>
	In a closed courtroom, jury selection continued for a second day  
Tuesday in the trial of Aaron McKinney, 22. McKinney is charged 
with murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in Shepard's death 
and could face the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	A second man, Russell Henderson, 22, pleaded guilty in April to  
felony murder and kidnapping and received two life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say Shepard may have been targeted because he was gay.  
</P>
<P>
	Switzer and Atencio, both of Denver, began their journey in Fort  
Collins, Colo., where Shepard died on Oct. 12, 1998. Each bear 
represents a different victim of hate or violence and were sent 
from as far away as England and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the end of their hike, the men were joined by Erin Uritus,  
who helped them found the Bringing Equality and Respect, or BEAR 
Project, and gay activists Cathy Renna, of Washington, D.C., and 
Jeff Montgomery of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Uritus first visited the fence in May.  
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't hit me until I got here that he was here for 18  
hours before someone found him,'' she said through tears. ``That's 
so long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew, a 2-foot-tall gray bear designated the ``official Hike  
bear,'' was placed on a cross of stones that had earlier been 
placed beneath the fence, and the group took photographs. Another 
bear, James, symbolizing black dragging death victim James Byrd 
Jr., and one named Columbine also made the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday evening, about 150 people attended a ceremony on  
campus to commemorate the anniversary of the death. 
</P>
<P>
	``Attitudes have been changed,'' said the Rev. Roger Schmit of  
St. Paul's Newman Center in Laramie. ``The quality of life has 
improved and people are able to be public and be open with their 
potential.''

<HEADLINE> Raytheon Cuts Earnings Projections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- Defense giant Raytheon Co. is slashing  
its earnings projections for 1999 and 2000, blaming 
lower-than-expected revenue. The contractor said today it also 
plans to take a $638 million pretax charge for restructuring and 
project problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lexington company estimates its 1999 earnings per share will  
be between $1.40 and $1.50 per share, including the charges, or 
$2.70 to $2.80 per share excluding charges -- well below the Wall 
Street expectations of $3.56 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year 2000, the company estimates earnings per share will  
be in the range of $2.10 to $2.25, compared to estimates of $3.91 
per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Raytheon had not traded today on the New York Stock  
Exchange. On Monday, Class B shares fell 50 cents to $43. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing himself as ``frustrated'' and the news as  
``disappointing,'' Raytheon chairman and CEO Daniel Burnham said in 
a statement that the company lowered its estimates due to increased 
competition and because it took longer for buyers to decide to buy 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	``Military actions in Kosovo diverted attention,'' said  
spokeswoman Toni Simonetti. A shortage of software engineers also 
led to lower revenue projections by $600 million less than 
originally expected, or $200 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition is lowering profit margins at Raytheon Systems  
Company, its defense and electronics unit, from 15 percent to 12 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon also predicts annual revenue growth for 1999 and 2000  
will be 3 percent, at least half of its earlier projections of 6 
percent to 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reported today that Raytheon is behind  
schedule or over budget on at least a dozen fixed-price Pentagon 
orders, including orders for Tomahawk cruise missiles and 
reconnaissance aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon is responsible for any differences above the preset  
contract amounts unless the Pentagon agrees to amend the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon said, however, that only eight projects are over budget  
or behind schedule, though that is resulting in $320 million in 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a small number, but the dollar amount is large,'' said  
Simonetti. ``It's not (due) to pervasive problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Restructuring charges account for another $274 million and $74  
million in special charges will be taken, primarily to write down 
to fair market value company assets such as the company's wireless 
networking inventory and its investment in troubled satellite 
mobile phone company Iridium. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon disclosed last month it was having difficulties in its  
defense electronics and construction units that would result in a 
third-quarter pretax charge of between $350 million and $450 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the company's 108,000 employees worldwide will probably  
be laid off, said Simonetti. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't anticipate another significant round of layoffs,'' she  
said. ``I think companywide there may be a couple thousand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simonetti said most of reductions would be in staff functions  
such as finance, public relations, human resources and finance.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Denies Sun Country Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGAN, Minn. (AP) -- Northwest Airlines has decided to stop  
letting Sun Country Airlines use its emergency training facilities, 
forcing the smaller Minnesota-based rival to scramble for 
alternative ways to provide federally mandated training for flight 
attendants and pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Country had paid Northwest $250,000 a year during the past  
five years for the training, which teaches pilots and flight 
attendants how to exit aircraft in emergency situations. 
</P>
<P>
	The training for more than 600 Sun Country employees requires  
special equipment, which Sun Country doesn't own and would cost 
$200,000, said Doug Matalucci, a Sun Country vice president. That 
total doesn't include additional funds that would be needed to pay 
for trainers, classroom space and other items, the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest also recently stopped sharing parts with Sun Country,  
breaking a long-held tradition among airlines and a 16-year pact 
with Sun Country, which is based in Mendota Heights, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	The two airlines are competing for passengers flying in and out  
of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Northwest, which controls about 80 
percent of the Twin Cities air market, makes no apologies for its 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to make these decisions based on what's best for our  
employees, our stockholders and our customers,'' said spokeswoman 
Marta Laughlin. ``We have to be the best competitor that we can, 
and if our decisions don't happen to please one particular airline 
-- one that happens to be trying to steal our customers -- then so be 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other airlines that contract for emergency training  
through Northwest are Ryan Air and Champion Air, which is partly 
owned by Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest's moves come as Congress prepares to open hearings  
next week on proposed Department of Transportation airline 
competition guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Country officials expect to testify at the hearings,  
describing the airline's experiences in the Twin Cities since 
switching from chartered service to scheduled flights last June.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Killer Gets Stay of Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court has issued a  
stay of execution for a child rapist and murderer who was scheduled 
to become the first person executed by Tennessee in 39 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Glen Coe was scheduled to receive a lethal injection next  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Martin, one of Coe's public defenders, said he was  
relieved but not surprised by the stay, issued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The surprise would have been if they denied it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled Coe should have more time to ask the U.S.  
Supreme Court to reconsider a request to hear an appeal of his 1981 
conviction for killing an 8-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Coe, 43, said that in 1979, he kidnapped Cary Ann Medlin near  
her home, raped and sodomized her, then choked her and stabbed her 
in the throat with a pocket knife. The former auto mechanic told an 
FBI agent that he became enraged when the girl kept saying, ``Jesus 
loves you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coe recanted before his 1981 trial and his lawyers used an  
insanity defense. The jury took an hour to convict him. 
</P>
<P>
	Coe's lawyers have argued that there was no scientific evidence  
linking him to the crime, that the confession was unreliable and 
that evidence pointing to another man had been hidden or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Coe's conviction was set aside by a federal judge who  
said the jury was not given proper guidance. But a federal appeals 
court reinstated the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee is the only Southern state that hasn't executed anyone  
since the high court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The 
state has 99 men and two women on death row.

<HEADLINE> Gore Welcomes Labor Endorsement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As polls show Bill Bradley closing in on Al  
Gore, the vice president's camp welcomed a certain endorsement by 
the AFL-CIO as more than just a symbolic nod. ``It means 
volunteers, organizers, committed supporters'' and a hefty 
on-the-ground advantage, said campaign chairman Tony Coelho. 
</P>
<P>
	Nudged along by President Clinton, the AFL-CIO's political  
committee was preparing for a late afternoon vote that would send 
Gore's endorsement to the labor federation's executive council and, 
finally, to ratification by the more than 700 union delegates 
convened here. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO is committed to spending at least $40 million to get  
union members to vote Democratic next year. In crucial 
early-primary states like New Hampshire and New York, where Bradley 
has edged ahead of or tied Gore in the polls, that mass union 
mobilization could tip the scales to the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	A CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll released Monday showed Gore leading  
Bradley, 51 percent to 39 percent, among likely Democratic primary 
voters nationwide. A similar poll a few weeks ago put Gore further 
ahead, with 63 percent support to Bradley's 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO counts nearly 580,000 union members among New York's  
registered Democrats -- about a third of all New Yorkers who voted 
in 1998. And in Iowa, whose caucuses in January will begin the 
nomination chase, AFL-CIO organizers were credited with the 69 
percent turnout of registered union voters that lifted Democrat Tom 
Vilsack from fourth place to winner of last year's gubernatorial 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the kind of program we're talking about, we're able to  
not just do voter and issue education, but drive up a much bigger 
turnout,'' said AFL-CIO political director Steve Rosenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a machine, though we don't like to use that word,'' said  
Kathy Bowler, director of Gore's campaign in California. 
</P>
<P>
	National campaign manager Donna Brazile showed off the  
collection of business cards pushed on her Monday by union leaders 
eager to help Gore. ``I'm delighted by all the strong support we're 
going to receive,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	An endorsement, said Coelho, will bring Gore immediate  
``volunteers, organizers and not just supporters, but committed 
supporters -- people who have a stake and want to go out and help 
you win because they know what it means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley adviser Anita Dunn said Gore's institutional advantage  
is nothing new and her candidate will continue to campaign among 
workers for grassroots labor support. 
</P>
<P>
	On the campaign trail, Gore mingled with hardhats at a Phoenix  
construction site to try to cast the apparently imminent 
endorsement as a rank-and-file nod. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very grateful for all the working men and women who have  
helped me in this campaign,'' Gore told workers who greeted him 
with applause and handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement stakes grew so high in the days leading up to  
this biennial convention that Clinton reached out to several labor 
leaders. He telephoned International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers chief J.J. Barry, and reached out to United Food and 
Commercial Workers President Doug Dority through a mutual friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's message, Dority said, was that the stakes had been  
``so ginned up that we didn't want (a delay in the endorsement) to 
appear that we were doing something that would hurt'' Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony to some feeling here that Gore had taken labor for  
granted and not paid attention to where union presidents stood, 
IBEW political director Rick Diegel said Clinton called Barry over 
the weekend to say thanks, apparently unaware that Barry remained 
undecided until Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	A disgruntled undercurrent among some delegates and union  
officials feeling bullied by the accelerated endorsement was 
palpable on the convention floor Monday. More than one union 
officer privately griped that the rush to endorse was being 
dictated from the top down by AFL-CIO President John Sweeney. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Hunt, an airline grounds crewman with the Transportation  
Workers, said the point should be ``to listen to all the issues 
first.'' And, he added, ``This could be a mistake in the long 
run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Electrical worker Joe Lubitz, from St. Paul, Minn., said, ``I  
want to put my efforts behind someone who can win and I don't know 
enough about Bradley yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO officials countered that GOP front-runner George W.  
Bush's runaway popularity in polls and ever-mounting bankroll lent 
urgency to the endorsement, which frees the labor group to begin 
attacking the Texas governor's record.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Gingrich Requests in Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- A judge granted former House Speaker Newt  
Gingrich permission Tuesday to question his sister-in-law and one 
of his wife's friends in the couple's divorce case. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich asked to question Marilyn Heddleston of Leetonia, Ohio,  
his wife Marianne's sister. The request was filed a day after 
Gingrich sought permission to depose Carol Villio, another Ohio 
woman Mrs. Gingrich has known for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Dorothy Robinson signed orders Tuesday  
authorizing both depositions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, has said he intends to prove  
that his wife shares the blame for the breakup of their marriage. 
Gingrich filed for divorce July 29, about seven months after 
resigning from Congress. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Search for Lunar Water Comes up Dry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An attempt to find water on the moon by  
crashing a used spacecraft into the lunar surface has come up dry, 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report prepared for presentation Wednesday at a meeting of  
astronomers in Padua, Italy, a researcher from the University of 
Texas said no water was detected from the crash of the Lunar 
Prospector spacecraft into a moon crater. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lunar Prospector, which had completed its mission of mapping  
the moon from lunar orbit, was sent smashing into a crater near the 
moon's south pole on July 31. Instruments on the spacecraft earlier 
had detected the presence of hydrogen, suggesting the crater could 
contain ice. Scientists hoped the violence of the crash would 
splash up a plume of water-bearing dust. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen Earth and space-based telescopes observed the  
crash site. Researchers hoped that ultraviolet radiation, shining 
through the dust plume from the crash, would bear the spectral 
signature of water. No evidence of water was found, said David 
Goldstein, the University of Texas researcher who headed the 
experiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``As expected, we didn't make a big splash, or we all would have  
seen a water signal quickly,'' Goldstein said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible reasons for finding no evidence of water, he said in  
the statement, include: 
</P>
<P>
	--The spacecraft missed the target, hitting only dry soil and  
rock; 
</P>
<P>
	--No water exists in the crater, and the hydrogen detected  
earlier by Lunar Prospector was pure hydrogen and not a component 
of water. 
</P>
<P>
	--The plume created by the crash may not have risen into  
telescope view above the lip of the crater; or 
</P>
<P>
	--The more than a dozen professional telescopes used in the  
experiment were not aimed properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding water on the moon, experts say, could make it easier to  
establish a colony there or to build a fueling station for 
spacecraft. Water could be chemically split into oxygen and 
hydrogen, which can be used as a rocket fuel. Oxygen extracted from 
water also could be used as a breathable atmosphere.

<HEADLINE> Umpires Seek To Decertify Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Umpires disenchanted with union head Richie  
Phillips petitioned the federal government on Tuesday to decertify 
their current union and form a new one. 
</P>
<P>
	The dissidents, headed by three AL umpires, met the National  
Labor Relations Board's requirement of having signatures from at 
least 30 percent of the bargaining unit, which in this case is the 
93 major league umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Silverman, the NLRB's New York regional director, called for  
an Oct. 22 hearing on the election request and said that if there 
are not objections, he anticipated balloting would take place in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	The dissidents would not say if they had the support of a  
majority of the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board keeps confidential the names of the persons who  
signed cards and submit them,'' said Joel Smith, a lawyer for the 
dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the dissidents plan to invite all umpires to a Nov.  
2 meeting in Baltimore, a lawyer familiar with their organizing 
said, speaking on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The dissident umpires, most in the American League, blame  
Phillips and union president Jerry Crawford for the union's 
strategy of mass resignations, which backfired in July and cost 22 
umpires their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Major League Umpires Association, which Phillips  
heads, has filed a grievance to regain the jobs of the 22, the 
union has not agreed to any of the proposed dates for the hearing 
before arbitrator Alan Symonette, a lawyer involved in the case 
said Tuesday. Union lawyer Pat Campbell declined comment on the 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	The dissidents call themselves the Major League Umpires  
Independent Organizing Committee and have been organized by three 
AL umpires -- Dave Phillips (who is not related to the union head), 
Joe Brinkman and John Hirschbeck. They have been working with 
lawyer Ron Shapiro, who is Cal Ripken's agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Phillips referred questions about the petition to  
Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is certainly not a surprise. They've been broadcasting  
this for months,'' Campbell said. ``I think that Jerry and Richie 
Garcia believe there is a solid majority that supports the Major 
League Umpires Association.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, an AL ump who is among the 22 who lost their jobs, is a  
strong supporter of the current union. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman said NLRB staff lawyer Stephen Appell will take  
testimony during the hearing, which will be held in New York.. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I will issue a decision on whether there will be an  
election,'' Silverman said. ``That decision is subject to appeal to 
the National Labor Relations Board in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires embarked on their mass resignation strategy in an effort  
to spark early negotiations to the collective bargaining agreement 
that expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners, concluding umpires were getting out of control, then  
hired 25 new umps from the minors and accepted the resignations of 
the 22 -- who tried to withdraw the resignations but were told it 
was too late.

<HEADLINE> Army Leader: Tanks Undergoing Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Army without tanks?  
</P>
<P>
	If Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki's vision of a 21st  
century land force becomes reality, the tank as we know it today -- 
the 60-ton M-1 Abrams -- may be replaced by a smaller, lighter, 
wheeled vehicle that can be transported more quickly to remote 
battlefields. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech Tuesday, Shinseki unveiled his plan for transforming  
the Army to make it more responsive to short-notice crises and 
smaller-scale conflicts -- like the war over Kosovo -- that have 
increasingly occupied and stretched the American military since the 
end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	``This commitment to change will require a comprehensive  
transformation of the Army,'' Shinseki told the annual convention 
of the Association of the U.S. Army, a booster group. 
</P>
<P>
	Remaking the nation's largest military service will take years,  
but Shinseki is wasting no time. For starters, two combat brigades 
at Fort Lewis, Wash., will be converted into more flexible and 
faster moving units during the coming year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect that moving this quickly will be unnerving to  
some,'' he said. ``But I've spent a little time in central Texas 
where they have a saying: `You can't wring your hands and roll up 
your sleeves at the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually the entire Army will be transformed, but he gave no  
timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinseki spelled out ambitious goals, including achieving a  
capability to move a brigade-size force of about 5,000 soldiers 
from the United States to any place in the world within four days; 
a division of about 15,000 soldiers within five days and five 
divisions within 30 days. ``That is a stretch from our current 
capability,'' he said without giving specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinseki, who took over as the Army's top uniformed leader in  
June, raised the possibility of doing away with the tank, which the 
Army has used in combat since World War II, by developing a family 
of wheeled vehicles less encumbered by weight yet lethal and 
capable of providing troop protection against armored attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we, in time, go to an all-wheel vehicle fleet where even  
the follow-on to today's armored vehicles can come in at 50 percent 
to 70 percent less tonnage?'' he asked in his remarks. ``I think 
the answer is yes, and we're going to ask the questions and then go 
where the answers are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference later with Army Secretary Louis Caldera,  
the service's top civilian official, Shinseki said it was too early 
to spell out what equipment, including armor, will be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's on the table,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Army, like the other military services, has been struggling  
since the end of the Cold War to adjust to the increasing demand 
for mobile forces capable of responding to regional crises in 
remote areas like the Balkans-- while maintaining the ability to 
fight an all-out land war. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinseki said the Army would not change its basic mission:  
``Warfighting remains Job One.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo conflict, almost entirely an air war, revealed the  
Army was unable to move sizable combat forces quickly enough. It 
took far longer than expected to deploy Apache attack helicopters 
to Albania, and they never saw combat, although the Army is heavily 
involved now as Kosovo peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	While Shinseki did not mention them specifically, other Army  
officials said the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division as well 
as the 1st Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division, both at Fort 
Lewis, would begin switching to new equipment and vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinseki said he could not estimate when the two brigades would  
be fully operational. He said Fort Lewis, whose units are 
designated for operations in Asia, including on the Korean 
Peninsula, was chosen to begin the transformation because of its 
``maneuver space and gunnery ranges.'' He also mentioned the 
proximity of McChord Air Force Base, Wash., with its strategic 
airlift capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinseki said it was too early to estimate how much it will cost  
to make these changes and whether it will require more than the 
480,000 soldiers the Army is legally authorized to have on active 
duty.

<HEADLINE> Maine Gets Taste of Y2K Glitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- State government got its first Y2K  
surprise months early when owners of 2000 model cars and trucks 
received titles identifying their new vehicles as ``horseless 
carriages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite millions of dollars spent to ensure state computers are  
ready for the year 2000, computers in the secretary of state's 
office got confused over the 2000 model year designation. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, some new vehicle owners or lien holders got titles  
to ``horseless carriages'' instead of cars or trucks in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The case demonstrates the problems that can occur when computers  
misread the year 2000 as the year 1900, which is what happened in 
the secretary of state's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the computer thought the model year was 1900, the titles  
were printed with the ``horseless carriage'' designation used for 
vintage vehicles produced before 1916, said Secretary of State Dan 
Gwadosky, whose office oversees licensing and registration of 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	About 800 passenger car titles and about 1,200 tractor-trailer  
titles were issued with the error, Gwadosky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since few people pay cash for cars, most of the titles went  
directly to banks and financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of them chuckled and said we need a clean title as soon  
as possible,'' Gwadosky said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Angus King did not know of the problem until reporters  
asked him about it Tuesday. He said there is no guarantee computers 
will work properly but he said the state doesn't envision 
widespread problems with state computers on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``The major systems that effect health and safety are in pretty  
good shape,'' King spokesman Dennis Bailey said. ``We're pretty 
sure if there is a problem, it will be this kind and not something 
serious.''

<HEADLINE> Jaguars Beat Jets 16-6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- If the Jacksonville offense doesn't  
come around until January, that might not be so bad for the 
Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, they might be at the top of the AFC and own home-field  
advantage for the playoffs, thanks to a stingy defense. 
</P>
<P>
	While the supposedly potent offense stumbled once more Monday  
night, the defense once again was staunch in a 16-6 victory over 
the New York Jets. That lifted the AFC Central's first-place team 
to 4-1, and only one team on the remaining schedule has a winning 
record. That's Tennessee, which doesn't face Jacksonville until 
Dec. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing great,'' quarterback Mark Brunell said after  
the Jaguars allowed the Jets (1-4) just 230 yards, much of it on a 
final desperation drive to nowhere. ``It's the kind of defense that 
can carry a team when the offense is struggling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The offense is struggling, managing only a 3-yard touchdown run  
by James Stewart and three field goals by Mike Hollis. Still, that 
was plenty against the sputtering Jets, who are hurting physically 
and emotionally these days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely frustrating after last year,'' receiver Dedric  
Ward said, noting how the Jets went to the AFC title game for the 
1998 season, but are a long shot to get to .500 this year. ``Right 
now, we're not finding what we need on offense. Obviously, when you 
score only six points, you have some problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those problems -- backup Rick Mirer at quarterback instead of Pro  
Bowler Vinny Testaverde (season-ending torn Achilles' tendon 
suffered in the opener); no Wayne Chrebet (broken foot) at receiver 
or Leon Johnson as a third-down back -- were exacerbated by 
Jacksonville's defensive brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
	New York couldn't handle linebacker Kevin Hardy (10 tackles, one  
sack), defensive tackle Gary Walker (nine tackles, one sack), or DE 
Tony Brackens (seven tackles, 1.5 sacks). 
</P>
<P>
	``We can be as good as we want to be,'' said safety Carnell  
Lake, whose signing as a free agent was a major step in rebuilding 
the defense, ``and we want to be the No. 1 defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They've yielded no touchdowns in three of their victories and 52  
points overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got good young guys, we got good older guys. If we do a few  
things, we can get there,'' added linebacker Lonnie Marts, another 
free-agent addition. 
</P>
<P>
	They got another victory without getting much when they had the  
ball. Stewart did rush for 96 yards, but it took 26 carries and he 
was late hitting some gaping holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunell, reportedly feuding with coach Tom Coughlin, was  
21-for-35 for 215 yards, but often rolled out and threw the ball 
away rather than search for secondary receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't what we had in mind offensively,'' Brunell said.  
``But it was enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a lot more than New York managed -- only John Hall's two  
field goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am extremely disappointed in our performance,'' said coach  
Bill Parcells, who lost for the first time in four meetings (two in 
the playoffs) with Coughlin, his former receivers coach with the 
Giants. ``Particularly the offense. Our execution was very poor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets already have lost as many games as they did in their  
run to the AFC title game last season. While their prospects are 
bleak, Jacksonville's are soaring -- even with a struggling attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have as many wins in our conference as anyone,'' Coughlin  
said, ``and we're 3-0 on the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But they haven't played particularly well since routing San  
Francisco in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will come,'' Hardy said. ``And that will be exciting.''

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S. Runs $1B Budget Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government ran a $1 billion  
surplus excluding Social Security in the last fiscal year, the 
Congressional Budget Office estimated Monday, which would be the 
first such surplus since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans immediately used the projection as political  
ammunition for their battle with President Clinton over spending 
bills for fiscal 2000, which began Oct. 1. Having insisted for 
weeks that Social Security surpluses should not be used to help pay 
for federal spending, they said that since the program's surplus 
was not tapped in fiscal 1999, there should be no backtracking this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard work, but we're not going to return to the days when  
Democrats raided Social Security to pay for government spending,'' 
said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``I hope the president 
will join with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the 1999 surplus would have been even larger had  
congressional Republicans and Clinton not agreed to $21 billion in 
``emergency'' spending for dozens of domestic and defense programs 
last autumn, and $15 billion for Kosovo, aid to U.S. farmers and 
other items last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans said little about the projections, reflecting  
a belief by some that a year-end compromise with Clinton might 
involve using some Social Security money. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate White House reaction.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has joined Republicans in saying Social Security  
surpluses should be left alone, arguing that extra spending for 
education and other administration priorities should be paid for by 
raising tobacco taxes and other tax and fee increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to spend the money, raise it. Do whatever's  
necessary, but get America out of debt over the next 15 years so we 
can continue to grow for the next 50 years,'' Clinton said Tuesday 
at a gathering of the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal surpluses not used to pay for extra spending or to  
finance tax cuts are automatically used to reduce the $5.6 trillion 
national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The distinction between cash the government raises from Social  
Security's payroll tax and from income and other taxes is little 
more than an accounting device. Funds the government collects from 
almost all sources is used to pay for the full range of federal 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending some of Social Security's surpluses has no effect on  
the program's benefits. That is because the pension system converts 
its cash surpluses into Treasury bills before the Treasury 
Department uses the cash for spending, reducing the national debt 
or other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, in a bid to cast themselves as protecting Social  
Security, politicians have promised to not touch its surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget office did not change its projection for a $161  
billion overall surplus for fiscal 2000, including a $14 billion 
non-Social Security surplus. As they struggle to find ways to pay 
for spending bills, many Republicans hope the strong economy will 
provide money for them to use by producing a bigger 2000 non-Social 
Security surplus than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressional Budget Office, Congress' nonpartisan, official  
fiscal analyst, warned that when the final figures are in, the 
actual non-Social Security surplus could differ from the $1 billion 
estimate by up to $3 billion. Those final figures should be 
available later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	But if there was a non-Social Security surplus last year, it  
would be the first since fiscal 1960, when that portion of the 
budget ran a $510 million surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Including Social Security, the budget office projected a $125  
billion overall federal surplus for fiscal 1999. The 1998 overall 
surplus was $69 billion, the first since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The new figures assure that 1998 and 1999 are the first time  
since 1956 and 1957 that the government ran two consecutive overall 
federal surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the White House Office of Management and Budget  
estimated that the overall 1999 surplus would be at least $115 
billion. But it would not say what it believed the non-Social 
Security surplus would be. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the Congressional Budget Office projected an overall  
1999 surplus of $120 billion. The new forecast, based on data from 
Treasury, was higher largely because of bigger than expected 
corporate tax payments.

<HEADLINE> Court Gets States' Rights Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, having ignited a states'  
rights revolution in recent years, is considering whether state 
employees who say they are victims of age bias can make a federal 
case of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chance to reshape state-federal government power appears  
in related cases from Florida and Alabama. After hearing arguments 
today, the justices must decide whether a federal anti-bias law, 
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, wiped out the 11th 
Amendment immunity states enjoy against being sued in federal 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Also to be decided before the court's just-begun 1999-2000 term  
ends next summer is whether Congress exceeded its authority in 1994 
when it enacted a law allowing women to sue men who raped them and 
whether Congress can order states to stop selling personal 
information from driver's license records. Those cases will be 
argued later. 
</P>
<P>
	In the cases being heard today, a federal appeals court ruled  
that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act cannot be invoked in 
federal lawsuits against states and state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court relied in part on a 1996 ruling in which the  
Supreme Court breathed new life into the 11th Amendment, a 
longstanding, albeit somewhat obscure, rallying point for advocates 
of states' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In its decision three years ago, the court said Congress may  
wipe out a state's 11th Amendment immunity only when it is going 
after some specific discriminatory harm and when it unequivocally 
says it is targeting that immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	In one dispute, 36 current and former faculty members and  
librarians at Florida State University and Florida International 
University sued the state board of regents in federal court, 
contending that age bias was why they lost out on certain salary 
increases given to young faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
	In another, two associate professors at the state-run University  
of Montevallo in Alabama alleged that they had been wronged because 
younger faculty members were treated more favorably when it came to 
salaries and promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a third, Florida prison guard Wellington Dickson said he  
lost out on a promotion because of discrimination based on, among 
other factors, his age. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who have submitted friend-of-the-court briefs  
supporting federal court access for such claims are the AARP, the 
American Association of University Professors and the American 
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those urging the justices to rule out such federal court  
access are 23 states -- Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, 
Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, 
Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, 
Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Alabama Rejecting Lottery Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- The governor's proposal for a lottery  
was failing Tuesday, a signal that voters were heeding the warnings 
of ministers and other anti-gambling forces over arguments that the 
revenue was vital to improve the state's lagging schools. 
</P>
<P>
	With 60 percent of precincts reporting, 361,179 people, or 55  
percent, had voted no on the lottery plan. There were 294,272 yes 
votes, or 45 percent. Several urban precincts, where the lottery 
tended to be doing well, remained to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
	The lottery was once almost a sure bet to be approved, but it  
came under fire from religious groups who said it would exploit the 
poor. Some opponents also claimed that a recent traffic 
ticket-fixing scandal showed that Gov. Don Siegelman's 
administration could not be trusted to oversee gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman promised that a lottery would generate at least $150  
million a year for college scholarships, a pre-kindergarten program 
and computers in schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In a state where spending on public education has traditionally  
lagged near the bottom in national rankings, lottery supporters 
said it would be the only way to improve funding, particularly with 
voters opposed to any new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic governor called it a ``once-in-a-lifetime  
opportunity to change education in Alabama forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-seven states and the District of Columbia run lotteries.  
Few states, including Arkansas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, have 
rejected a lottery at the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Jim Bennett predicted that possibly 60  
percent of Alabama's 2.4 million registered voters would go to the 
polls, even though no state or national offices were on the ballot 
Tuesday. That would surpass the 57 percent turnout in last year's 
race for governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnout was helped in Birmingham and Montgomery by nonpartisan  
mayoral elections. 
</P>
<P>
	In Birmingham, Alabama's largest city, 14 candidates were trying  
to succeed Richard Arrington, the city's first black mayor and 
dominant political figure for 20 years. William Bell, who is black 
and Arrington's hand-picked successor, was considered the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	In Montgomery, the capital, conservative Mayor Emory Folmar  
faced six opponents in his bid for a seventh term. It was the 
biggest field of challengers since Folmar whipped more than 40 
candidates to be elected the first time in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	After Siegelman used the lottery plan in 1998 to defeat  
Republican Gov. Fob James, it moved through the Legislature quickly 
and with little opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll in late August showed 61 percent were ready to vote for  
the lottery, but later surveys showed that number shrinking after 
ministers began organizing against it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Joe Bob Mizzell, director of Christian ethics for the  
Alabama Baptist Convention, said no issue had united so many 
ministers from differing denominations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even the abortion issue -- the sanctity of human life -- has not  
come as close to bringing denominations together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman pointed out that Alabamians already can play the  
lottery in neighboring Georgia and Florida. Georgia's lottery 
director estimated that Alabamians have spent $446 million on the 
Georgia lottery since it began in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii and Utah are the only states that bar gambling entirely --  
Alabama does have four dog tracks and high-stakes bingo. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina, where Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges ousted a GOP  
incumbent last year with a boost from the lottery issue, will vote 
in November 2000 on whether to have a lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	That state is also embroiled in a debate over video gambling,  
which became legal in 1986 and has become a $2.8 billion industry. 
Voters will decide on Nov. 2 whether to ban video gambling, as 
religious groups want, or secure its legal standing. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Supreme Court heard arguments about the legality of  
the referendum Tuesday. The justices said they would issue a ruling 
Thursday morning.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Halts Inmate Work Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Prisoners who held jobs at Arkansas'  
state police headquarters and the Governor's Mansion have been 
returned to prison after the escape of a convicted killer in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	The inmates, who worked under minimum security, were led  
handcuffed into vans early Monday evening after state police 
director Tom Mars ended a 30-year arrangement in which 50 inmates 
worked in an honor system-based jobs program. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Stone, 39, remained at large after escaping Friday night  
from barracks at the state police headquarters where he and 35 
other inmates had lived. 
</P>
<P>
	Mars, who assumed command last winter, said he had long been  
uncomfortable with prisoners working at his headquarters. Some had 
access to places off-limits to troopers; others worked on police 
vehicles or maintained the state police radio system. 
</P>
<P>
	The inmates saved the department $500,000 a year, and Mars said  
he could not afford to give up the free work -- until Stone escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to do this months ago,'' said Mars, who previously  
moved to restrict inmate access to guns stored in the troopers' 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, convicted in the 1984 beating death of his girlfriend,  
escaped by walking out of a dayroom off the barracks. He was being 
held there while officers investigated reports of inmate beer 
drinking. Mars said previously that Stone should not have been left 
unattended. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone's escape was the third by an Arkansas inmate in the  
program since 1983, police Maj. Jim Tyler said. That year, one 
stole a state police car and led officers on a chase into Oklahoma. 
And in 1992, an inmate left the barracks to settle an argument with 
his girlfriend. He returned a day later.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays Rehire Gaston As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Blue Jays have hired former manager  
Cito Gaston as part of the team's coaching staff for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaston, who led the Blue Jays to World Series championships in  
1992 and 1993 and was the team's longest-serving manager from 1989 
to 1997, will re-join the team as a batting coach under manager Jim 
Fregosi. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaston is the winningest manager in franchise history, going  
681-635 in his nine seasons. He was fired in the final week of the 
1997 season when the Blue Jays finished last in the AL East. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaston replaces hitting coach Gary Matthews, who was fired along  
with four other coaches in the last week of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays have also hired Lee Elia as bench coach and Bobby  
Knoop as first base coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Elia replaced Jim Lett and Knoop replaced Lloyd Moseby.  
</P>
<P>
	Elia, 62, had been the Philadelphia Phillies' director of minor  
league instruction since 1988. Knoop, 60, was first base coach for 
the Anaheim Angels from 1979 to 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In other moves, the Blue Jays announced that Bob Engle,  
Toronto's senior advisor, baseball operations, is retiring after 23 
years with the team and Tommy Craig, who has spent the last 13 
years as the club's head trainer and joined the organization in 
1980, won't be returning in that capacity next season. In a 
statement, the club said Craig, 43, has been offered another 
position within the organization.

<HEADLINE> Start of Clinton As Lame Duck? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The battle over the nuclear test ban treaty  
turned into a political minefield of brinksmanship and 
miscalculation, ending with President Clinton in full retreat and 
trying to stave off a humiliating defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacking enough support to win after demanding that Republicans  
hold a vote, Clinton was forced into an eleventh-hour about-face, 
pleading with the Senate to delay the treaty rather than defeat it. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts began talking about a lame-duck president.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, seething from failed battles on everything from tax  
cuts to Clinton's impeachment, refused to let the president off the 
hook easily. They toyed with him over whether to defeat the treaty 
outright or postpone it until after he leaves office in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	All that aside, some Republicans -- led John Warner of Virginia --  
felt that a vote now to reject the treaty would be a mistake for 
both sides and contrary to America's national interests. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an embarrassing outcome for an agreement that Clinton  
once had hailed as ``the longest sought, hardest fought prize in 
arms control history,'' with roots in the Eisenhower 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Arms control experts faulted the president for failing to wage  
an effective campaign for the treaty after signing it with great 
fanfare at the U.N. General Assembly in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration got caught flat-footed,'' said Michael  
Mandelbaum of the Council on Foreign Relations. ``They thought they 
were going to be in a position to beat (Senate Majority Leader 
Trent) Lott over the head with this because he would never bring it 
up. But suddenly he turned around and decided to bring it up, which 
put them in an awkward position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is as important as the administration says it is, you  
wonder why is this the first time we've heard about it,'' said 
Mandelbaum, a onetime foreign policy adviser to Clinton. ``For most 
people ... it's seen as a partisan issue and not a national 
security issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has mentioned the treaty from time to time but did not  
make a sustained effort until Republicans suddenly accepted his 
challenge to hold a vote. They scheduled it in less than two weeks, 
even before the Foreign Relations Committee had devoted a single 
hearing to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Essentially, it became ``this game of political chicken. And  
this could be the moment that signals the start of the lame-duck 
period of Clinton's presidency,'' said John Parachini, a national 
security expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. 
``It's a mistake that's unfortunate not only for foreign and 
defense policy reasons. It's also unfortunate for the power of this 
presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration appeared lulled by signs that pointed to  
victory. Clinton collected testimonials for the treaty from 
military leaders, Nobel laureates and the directors of the nation's 
nuclear labs. A poll said that 82 percent of Americans supported a 
nuclear test ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a president that when he gets up in the morning, he  
focuses on domestic issues,'' Parachini said. ``And what 
principally drives him is sort of the political edge. He has 
focused more and more on foreign issues, and when he really puts 
his shoulder to the stone he's proven to be very effective. But he 
didn't in this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats thought it was a smart political strategy to make  
Republicans walk the plank on the treaty and vote, regardless of 
the outcome, because it might be useful in next year's elections. 
Of course, that assumes Americans are paying attention to foreign 
affairs, which increasingly is unlikely after the Cold War except 
on issues of war and peace. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton belatedly tried to mobilize support, opponents  
drew on the political muscle of chairmen of three powerful Senate 
committees: Armed Services, Foreign Affairs and intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	The critics also had their own allies: six former secretaries of  
defense, four former national security advisers and two former CIA 
directors from the Clinton administration, John Deutch and Jim 
Woolsey. George W. Bush, the front-runner for the Republican 
presidential nomination, also opposed the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	While asking that the treaty be withdrawn, Clinton refused to  
meet an additional Republican demand -- that he agree not to try to 
resurrect the treaty for a vote during the remainder of his 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	But that seems certain, whether or not Clinton acknowledges it,  
since Republicans will rule the Senate through the 2000 elections. 
That gives them the power to control the floor votes until Clinton 
leaves Washington. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> High-Speed Amtrak Train Stuck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak says its new high-speed Acela train has  
already set a national speed record of 168 mph, but a nagging 
question remains: When will passengers be able to come aboard? 
</P>
<P>
	There's still no clear resolution to wheel problems that have  
plagued the train in tests, and the precise start-up date is 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal-based Bombardier Inc., which is building the train with  
Alstom of Paris, says it will announce a timetable by the end of 
the month, as promised when it divulged on Sept. 1 that the train's 
wheels were wearing prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're aiming at spring of 2000,'' Bombardier spokesman Gilles  
Paget said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the second production silver-and-turqoise Acela train  
hit 168 mph between the Rhode Island cities of Warwick and Kingston 
during a test of new lines that will provide electricity to the 
train. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak said that was a U.S. record for a passenger train  
operating on a regular track. The previous record was nearly 160 
mph, set decades ago when Penn Central was testing Amtrak's 
then-new Metroliner trains. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a milestone,'' said Amtrak spokesman Russ Hall. ``There  
was a lot of shaking of hands and pats on the back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the first production Acela model has also hit 168 mph  
since March on closed loop of test track in Pueblo, Colo., this 
week's record represented another step toward high-speed rail in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The trains are slated to carry passengers at up to 160 mph, and  
when they do, it will lead to three-hour service between Boston and 
New York and 2 hour, 45 minute service between New York and 
Washington -- a savings of up to 90 minutes and more competitive 
with airline shuttle service. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak is hoping that Acela will not only generate $180 million  
in new profits annually, but that the cash infusion will allow the 
national railroad to fulfill its promise to Congress of 
self-sufficiency by 2002. Since 1971, it has required federal 
subsidies of $23 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak is also hoping that success in the Northeast Corridor  
will spur creation of similar service in the South, Midwest, Gulf 
Coast, California and Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak had planned to run its first high-speed train in November  
or December, but in September it said the date had been pushed back 
to next spring. It promised a clearer timetable within 60 days, and 
Paget said the train makers will meet that deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the problems had been resolved, he said: ``We're  
testing components and we're quite optimistic that we'll be able to 
set the new delivery schedule.''

<HEADLINE> Drug Said Effective Vs. Fractures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A new osteoporosis drug has been found to reduce  
hip, leg and some other fractures in postmenopausal women that some 
treatments fail to prevent, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Some existing drugs effective in preventing spinal fractures  
have not been as effective in curbing other bone fractures caused 
by osteoporosis, the bone-weakening condition that afflicts an 
estimated 10 million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The new drug, risedronate, reduced other fractures as well as  
spinal fractures and increased bone density, according to the study 
in today's Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's lead author says the findings should be particularly  
heartening for older women who can't tolerate or aren't given 
estrogen treatments after menopause -- still considered key to 
preventing or slowing the effects of osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prevailing feeling is that once you're old and starting to  
have problems, there's not much you can do ... but I think this 
gives a lot of encouragement,'' said Dr. Steven Harris, chief of 
the Osteoporosis Clinic at the University of California, San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was funded by Proctor &AMP; Gamble Pharmaceuticals and  
Hoechst Marion Rousell, which are seeking approval from the Food 
and Drug Administration to sell risedronate under the trade name 
Actonel. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year study of 939 postmenopausal women found that the  
number of non-spinal fractures dropped 39 percent for women who 
took the drug while spinal fractures decreased 41 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug also was found to boost bone density by as much as 5  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Another osteoporosis drug -- alendronate, marketed under the  
trade name Fosamax -- has had similar results in terms of fractures 
and bone density increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other drugs have shown comparable results for spinal but not  
non-spinal fractures, Harris said. Those include calcitonin, 
marketed as Calcimar, and raloxifene, marketed as Evista, which the 
FDA recently approved as an osteoporosis treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Another osteoporosis expert, Dr. Lawrence Raisz, head of the  
general clinical research center at the University of Connecticut, 
said he was not surprised by the study's finding but said it is 
still unclear whether women experience less stomach upset with 
risedronate than they do with alendronate.

<HEADLINE>  Zewail Wins Nobel for Chemistry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- An Egyptian-American scientist won the  
Nobel Prize for chemistry today for demonstrating that a rapid 
laser technique can observe the motion of atoms in a molecule as 
they occur during a chemical reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said Ahmed H. Zewail of  
the California Institute of Technology was being honored for a 
revolution in chemistry through ``his pioneering investigation of 
fundamental chemical reactions, using ultra-short laser flashes, on 
the time scale on which the reactions actually occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours earlier, Dutch scientists Gerardus 't Hooft and Martinus  
J.G. Veltman won the 1999 Nobel Prize for physics for their 
theoretical work on the structure and motion of subatomic 
particles. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy said Zewail's work in the late 1980s led to the  
birth of femtochemistry, the use of high-speed cameras to monitor 
chemical reactions at a scale of femtoseconds, or 0.000000000000001 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have reached the end of the road. No chemical reactions  
take place faster than this,'' the academy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can now see the movements of individual atoms as we imagine  
them. They are no longer invisible,'' the academy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zewail, who holds both U.S. and Egyptian citizenship, has held  
the Linus Pauling chair of chemical physics at Caltech since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The literature prize was awarded Thursday to German novelist  
Guenter Grass. The medicine prize was awarded Monday to Dr. Guenter 
Blobel, 63, a German native and U.S. citizen, who discovered how 
proteins find their rightful places in cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The economics prize winner is to be announced Wednesday in  
Stockholm and the peace prize on Friday in Oslo, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	The prizes, worth $960,000, are presented on Dec. 10, the  
anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist 
and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes.

<HEADLINE> Posh Car Brand Jensen Returning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Actor Tony Curtis drove one. So did 1960s pop star  
Cliff Richard. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Jensen, one of the best-known brands in luxury British  
motoring, is set for a rebirth 23 years after Jensen Motors Ltd. 
stopped producing cars because of labor-management strife. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike its sleek forbear -- the four-seat Interceptor -- the  
newest Jensen will be a sporty two-seater with an aluminum body 
wrapped around a Ford Cobra V-8 engine. 
</P>
<P>
	And by pricing their new S-V8 convertible at about $65,400, the  
owners of the revived Jensen Motors Ltd. hope to attract young 
professionals who need not earn a Hollywood-league salary to afford 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Jensen executives said Tuesday that they have secured $16.5  
million from investors in order to begin production next June. They 
aim to manufacture 200 cars next year and triple their output the 
following year from a plant at a site still to be selected near 
Liverpool in north England. 
</P>
<P>
	The company foresees its S-V8 model competing against such  
worthy rivals as the Porsche Boxster. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we're opening up a niche in the market,'' said  
company spokesman Norman Childs. ``It looks a timeless British 
classic, but it's brand new.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new Jensen draws heavily on the United States for  
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	The engine, a U.S. import, is the same high-performance unit  
that powers the Ford Mustang Cobra. The Creative Group, a 
consulting firm that bought the Jensen name in 1997, claims credit 
for helping design the Plymouth Prowler, a retro-look roadster. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jensen's small size and limited output mean that S-V8s  
aren't likely to constitute a British invasion of American streets 
anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The first 100 cars are already pre-sold, mostly within Britain,  
where Jensen plans to focus its initial marketing efforts. Later, 
it plans to target continental Europe, Japan and eventually the 
United States, Childs said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem for us is that we are a very small manufacturer  
starting from scratch today. We have to build a dealer network,'' 
he said. ``But there's a lot of interest in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Meyer, president of the Jensen Interceptor Owners Club,  
agrees.

	Meyer restores Interceptors, a hand-built sedan that he fondly  
describes as ``a rich man's road car,'' and sells spare parts for 
them at his business in Snohomish, Wash. Interceptors were last 
built in 1976. They sold for the equivalent price today of 
$100,000-$115,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans want a nice two-seater sports car, and quite  
honestly European manufacturers gave up on them when the American 
government got nasty about emission controls and convertible 
safety,'' Meyer said by phone from his garage. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Meyer said the S-V8 has nothing in common with the  
vintage Interceptor except for the Jensen name. ``It's nothing but 
an overgrown Mazda Miata with a V-8.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the interest, perhaps, of bridging differences with clannish  
enthusiasts of the Interceptor, Childs holds out the prospect that 
Jensen might one day build an updated version of that model. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer estimates that only 2,000 still exist in the United  
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The original Jensen Motors Ltd., founded by two brothers, Alan  
and Richard Jensen, made its name in the 1930s by combining stylish 
bodies with chassis built by Austin, Ford and other manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers introduced their own range of cars beginning with  
the White Lady tourer. Jensen began making the Interceptor in 1966 
and took over the defunct Austin-Healey brand of sports cars, 
renaming it Jensen-Healey. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Jensen brothers retired, a San Francisco-based car  
dealer, Kjell Qvale, became the company's largest shareholder. But 
Qvale's relations with Jensen's largely British work force soured, 
and in 1976, he closed the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Jensen's new owners include 20 private investors, Britain's  
Department of Trade and Industry and the Liverpool City Council. 
However, the reborn company's prospects hinge on more than a 
distinguished pedigree and government support. 
</P>
<P>
	``There certainly are no lack of attempts to revive former brand  
names,'' said John Lawson, European auto analyst with U.S. 
investment bank Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jensen is one of the more lustrous, but it clearly doesn't  
guarantee success.''

<HEADLINE> Golfer Leonard Still Has Goals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Justin Leonard still has some goals for the  
year, even if they aren't as dramatic as the 45-putt that clinched 
the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	That's one reason he's in this gambling town this week to play  
in the five-day Las Vegas Invitational that begins Wednesday on 
three courses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to cap the year off,'' Leonard said. ``I look at  
the goals I set at the beginning of the year and I still have some 
to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard stood on the edge of the practice green at the TPC  
Summerlin course Tuesday with evidence that one of those goals has 
already been reached. 
</P>
<P>
	That was in the form of a gold Ryder Cup ring with a blue stone  
on his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Leonard's charge down the stretch at The Country Club in  
Brookline, Mass., this might have been a year to forget. 
</P>
<P>
	He had lost a playoff for the British Open and played poorly in  
a Ryder Cup that it seemed the Americans were destined to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he came from 4-down with seven holes to play to tie Jose  
Maria Olazabal and give the United States the half-point needed to 
cap the biggest Ryder Cup comeback in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning the Ryder Cup made it all worthwhile,'' Leonard said.  
</P>
<P>
	With just a few fans milling about Tuesday for practice rounds,  
it was a far cry from the hysteria that surrounded the final day in 
Brookline. Leonard was able to joke with fellow pros and relax 
without any of the hoopla that surrounded the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Las Vegas Invitational is a pro-am format that most  
pros don't like, they do like to come here for the nightlife and a 
chance to have some fun while also making some money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say I'm here for a fun week, but it is a bit  
different,'' Leonard said. ``I still want to do well and try to win 
this tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryder Cup teammate Jim Furyk is the defending champion in the  
tournament, which takes place on the TPC, Desert Inn and Las Vegas 
Country Club courses for three days before shifting to the TPC for 
the weekend play. 
</P>
<P>
	Players are grouped with three amateurs for the first three  
days, and then the field is narrowed for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	With user-friendly courses and usually calm wind, scores can go  
very low. Tiger Woods shot 28-under when he won for the first time 
as a pro here in 1996 and Furyk was 25-under last year when he won 
the tournament for a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods is absent this year, as is David Duval.

<HEADLINE> Report: Feeding Tubes Harm Demented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- In a study that could have broad implications for  
millions of Americans, researchers reported today that feeding 
tubes for mentally incapacitated patients may instead cause 
problems they are meant to prevent, including lung infections and 
early death. 
</P>
<P>
	The study may prove important for the more than 4 million  
Americans who have Alzheimer's disease and those who care for them. 
The illness, the leading cause of dementia, is expected to become 
more widespread as the U.S. population ages. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike feeding tubes, careful hand-feeding lets demented  
patients live as long as other nursing home patients, the authors 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	That runs contrary to some nursing home practices and Medicare  
reimbursement guidelines for demented patients, Alzheimer's 
advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The widespread practice of tube feeding should be carefully  
reconsidered, and we believe that for severely demented patients, 
the practice should be discouraged,'' wrote the study's lead 
author, Dr. Thomas Finucane, an associate professor of medicine at 
Johns Hopkins University. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors reviewed more than six dozen medical studies about  
feeding tubes published over the past 33 years. Their findings 
appear in today's Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Feeding tubes, typically inserted through the nose or abdomen,  
are used in roughly 10 percent of dementia patients in nursing 
homes nationwide, though the practice varies widely, said Dr. 
Colleen Christmas, a co-author. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors found no evidence to support the reasons usually  
given for using the tubes: preventing early death from 
malnutrition, averting lung infections caused by inhaling food, and 
relieving suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	On the contrary, tube-fed patients typically died within a year,  
got higher rates of lung infections and became so agitated that 
they required restraint or sedation, studies showed. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers, however, found little data that directly compared  
tube-feeding to hand-feeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts on dementia who were not involved in the review praised  
it as an important contribution toward overturning misconceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The benefit of this article is that it's starting to really  
question this almost knee-jerk response: `The person's not eating, 
therefore we must institute tube-feeding,''' said Dr. Robert 
McCann, chief of medicine at Highland Hospital, an affiliate of the 
University of Rochester in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	He supported the conclusion that hand-feeding is a better  
alternative than feeding tubes, even if it is more time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
	Advanced dementia is a terminal illness that robs people of  
mental abilities such as the memory of how to chew and swallow, and 
some suggest it is better to let such a patient go without food or 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our position is that it is ethically permissible at any point,  
but particularly in the advanced stages of dementia, to withdraw or 
withhold artificial food and hydration,'' said Stephen McConnell of 
the Alzheimer's Association. He said the policy dates back eight or 
nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	A nursing home industry spokesman said doctors, not  
administrators, decide who gets a feeding tube. Also, it is often 
requested by a patient's family, said Tom Burke, a spokesman for 
the American Health Care Association, which represents 11,000 
nursing homes nationwide.

first Women's Economic Equity Act as a Senate staff member. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ralph Neas has led the way in many decisive fights to protect  
Americans' rights and liberties -- helping win key battles that many

<HEADLINE> Phelps Dodge Earnings Fall 20 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Phelps Dodge Corp. reported its third-quarter  
earnings fell 20.7 percent due to the continuing slump in copper 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The big copper and wire producer said Tuesday it earned $16.1  
million, or 28 cents per share, down from $20.3 million, or 35 
cents per share, reported for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge surpassed analyst expectations of 21 cents per  
share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. The results 
pleased investors, who bid Phelps Dodge stock up $2.69 to $57.44 a 
share in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The results do not reflect a restructuring charge of $700,000,  
or 1 cent per share, for the latest quarter, and a 1998 gain of 
$8.3 million, or 14 cents per share, from the completion of the 
sale of Accuride Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales came to $742.7 million, down from $764 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The company was hurt by the lingering depression in copper  
prices and by a difficult market for wire and cable. Copper, which 
traded over $1 a pound two years ago, is now in the 80-cent range. 
</P>
<P>
	However, because of a recent uptick in prices, the Phelps Dodge  
Mining subsidiary had $36 million in operating income, its best 
quarterly performance since the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge's specialty chemicals division also continued to do  
well, thanks in part to strong business at its recently acquired 
carbon black facilities overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last several months, Phelps Dodge has been in the midst  
of trying to acquire two rivals, New York-based Asarco Inc. and 
Englewood, Colo.-based Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Asarco last week to be acquired by Phelps Dodge for about $1.1  
billion in cash and stock, but Grupo Mexico has since made a higher 
all-cash offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge has agreed to acquire Cyprus Amax for $1.8 billion  
in cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings for the first nine months of 1999 came to $17.8  
million, or 31 cents per share, down from $101.6 million, or $1.73 
per share, in the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The results do not reflect restructuring charges of $59.4  
million, or $1.03 a share, or a charge of $3.5 million, or 6 cents 
a shre, for an accounting change. They also do not include a gain 
of $131.1 million, or $2.24 per share, from the Accuride sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales came to $2,1 billion in the first nine months, compared  
with $2.36 million in the same period of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Success Rates of Liver Transplants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        A list of the nation's liver transplant centers and their survival  
and death rates. 
</P>
<P>
        The first number is the number of patients put on the waiting  
list for a liver transplant between April 1994 and December 1996. The 
second number is the percent who were alive one year later, adjusted 
for the severity of a center's patients' illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
        The third number is the number of patients on the waiting list  
between April 1994 and December 1997. The fourth number is the percent 
who received transplants within one year. The fifth is the percent 
who died while waiting for a transplant. Both numbers are adjusted 
for severity of illness. 
</P>
<P>
        Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, which  
produced this report, caution that individual numbers may be misleading; 
in a few cases, transplant centers failed to provide all appropriate 
data, for instance. Generally, the more patients, the more reliable 
the data.

<HEADLINE> Author in Tiff With Boat Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Author William Least Heat-Moon, a k a Will  
Trogdon, is in a tiff with a boat operator after he crashed while 
being filmed by ``CBS Sunday Morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trogdon lost control of one boat on the Missouri River and  
rammed a second boat with the camera crew aboard last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``His boat starts swinging back and forth, he hits the throttle  
and lurches the boat forward into the back end of my boat, running 
up alongside and scraping the side,'' said Mike Ruh, who rented 
both boats to CBS for the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Trogdon says the crash wasn't his fault. He says the other  
boat's wake broke the throttle and caused the boat to speed up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am just an actor in this scene,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Trogdon, who wrote ``Blue Highways'' has a new book due out Oct.  
19 about exploring America's waterways. He says he was 
accident-free throughout the 5,300-mile voyage chronicled in 
``River Horse.''

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Troops Taunted in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- As their trucks cleared the checkpoint  
at Dili's port, Indonesian soldiers cringed and raised their riot 
shields. A barrage of rocks, bottles and sticks came flying at them 
as hundreds of people waiting outside screamed obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Get out of our country, you bandits, you scum,'' shouted East  
Timorese residents who chased after the fleeing trucks, trying for 
a last shot at the terrified troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of Indonesian soldiers have withdrawn from East Timor  
since international peacekeepers arrived last month to restore 
order in the shattered territory. A garrison of several thousand is 
dwindling every day as troops depart. 
</P>
<P>
	The daily gantlet at the capital's docks illustrates the scorn  
with which the Indonesians, who brooked no opposition during their 
24-year rule over East Timor, are now treated. Even those getting 
away with it are amazed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could do whatever they wanted before. They could kill you  
whenever they wanted,'' said Amando Cruz, one of those waiting for 
the Indonesians to show up at the port. ``Look at them run now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 100,000 East Timorese died in the aftermath of  
Indonesia's 1975 invasion of the former Portuguese colony. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indonesians cracked down on any sign of defiance, and as  
late as 1992 soldiers massacred about 200 unarmed residents at 
Dili's Santa Cruz cemetery for the funeral of a pro-independence 
activist. 
</P>
<P>
	When East Timor chose independence in an Aug. 30 referendum, the  
Indonesian army and its anti-independence militia proxies responded 
by killing, burning, and looting their way though the province. 
Dili and its main port were left in ruins. 
</P>
<P>
	But the situation has changed dramatically since the  
Australian-led multinational force arrived three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Peacekeepers cleaned away ashes and rubble and reopened the main  
Portuguese-built market in Dili, which until the rampage had been 
the commercial heart of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Only of a few vendors sold small amounts of fruit, vegetables  
and fish on Tuesday, but peacekeepers said it was the first step in 
East Timor's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been friction over the border separating East Timor  
and Indonesian-controlled West Timor, where hundreds of 
anti-independence militiamen are massed -- some of whom say they are 
preparing to launch guerrilla war against the U.N.-mandated forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Tuesday he would protest to the  
United Nations about a firefight between Australian and Indonesian 
forces over the weekend. Indonesia says one of its policemen was 
killed in West Timor, but Australia denies that it violated the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has reinforced its position on the western side of the  
border. Military chief Gen. Wiranto said Tuesday said his forces 
and the peacekeepers should jointly patrol the area to prevent 
further clashes. 
</P>
<P>
	About 16,000 Indonesian troops have now withdrawn from East  
Timor, leaving behind two battalions that are to depart by next 
month. The 1,400 troops are hunkered down inside government 
buildings, barricaded behind barbed wire, sandbags and machine-gun 
emplacements. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining troops in Dili are busy loading furniture,  
weapons, and tires onto trucks that are driven each morning to 
waiting cargo ships in the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian soldiers stand guard around the Indonesian troops as  
they transfer the loads to the ships. 
</P>
<P>
	But along the main seafront avenue, citizens gather in a daily  
ritual with stones and bottles in their hands, eagerly awaiting the 
trucks to emerge for their return trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Mark Kelly, chief of staff of the peacekeeping force, said  
Tuesday the local Indonesian commander had asked for help, and 
peacekeepers would now also escort Indonesian convoys to the port.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Chided for Spurring Yalies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Those old school ties are powerful. But  
President Clinton, a Yale Law School graduate, agreed Tuesday when 
a fellow Yalie predicted that in a certain upcoming endorsement 
Clinton will spurn his alma mater in favor of a rival Ivy League 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Joel Alpert, president of the American Academy of  
Pediatrics, jokingly likened himself to Clinton as he introduced 
the president before a speech to the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``We both hold the title 'president,''' Alpert said. ``We are  
both Yalies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When asked whom you would support for the title next, I  
suspect it would be a Harvardian, maybe a Princetonian,'' Alpert 
continued. ``But for the time being, no more Yalies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore graduated from Harvard in 1969. Clinton  
is already backing Gore as his successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's Democratic challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley,  
graduated from Princeton in 1965. Clinton would presumably back 
Bradley in the general election if Bradley defeated Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	George W. Bush, Texas governor and front-runner for the  
Republican presidential nomination, graduated from Yale in 1968. 
(Alpert apparently forgot that Bush also holds a master's degree 
from Harvard.) 
</P>
<P>
	Alpert did not explain any of this to the audience, but Clinton  
got the inside joke. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's good,'' Clinton said, laughing. Gesturing toward the  
crowd, Clinton added: ``They don't know, but I do.'' Clinton was 
not speaking into a microphone, and his voice could not be heard on 
the loudspeaker system.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Ole Miss Coach Wins Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXFORD, Miss. (AP) -- Former Mississippi football coach Billy  
Brewer won his lawsuit against the university Tuesday, five years 
after being fired in the wake of an NCAA investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury deliberated most of the day in Lafayette County Circuit  
Court before deciding Brewer was owed more than $200,000 in salary. 
The jury, however, did not award the former coach $2 million in 
damages he sought from the school. 
</P>
<P>
	The university fired Brewer in 1994 for deliberate and serious  
NCAA violations. Brewer said he committed none. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer filed suit in 1995, claiming his firing ``stigmatized''  
him in college coaching circles. 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving his alma mater after 11 seasons, the 64-year-old  
Brewer has not coached. He still lives in Oxford. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Lago, director of public information at the University  
of Mississippi, said school officials were disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always felt we acted prudently and justly in relieving  
Coach Brewer of his duties as head football coach in 1994,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	During almost two weeks of testimony, College Board attorneys  
tried to link Brewer to the unsuccessful coverup of the NCAA 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's attorney, Jim Waide of Tupelo, suggested that the  
university pressured former athletics director Warner Alford to 
resign and fire Brewer in an attempt to make the NCAA look more 
favorably on the school when levying sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Waide also had said the $100,000 in severance pay that Warner  
received after his resignation was a ``payoff'' to fire Brewer. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner testified, under questioning by the State College Board  
attorney Cal Mayo that the $100,000 severance package was 
legitimate. He also said he thought the university was correct in 
firing Brewer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Rayburn, who represented one of the assistant coaches  
during an interview with the NCAA, testified Monday that the 
majority of the NCAA's questions revolved around Brewer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was obvious (the assistant coach) was OK, but they were  
after Billy Brewer's ... and I used a descriptive part of the 
anatomy that begins with `a,''' Rayburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA faulted Brewer for failure to control his football  
program and for unethical conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi, which had served NCAA probation during the 1987 and  
1988 seasons while Brewer was coach, received two more years of 
sanctions in November 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer was fired about four months before the NCAA handed down  
its ruling in the case. At the time, he was dean of Southeastern 
Conference football coaches and had a 67-56-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 sanctions against Mississippi resulted in drastic  
scholarship reductions, a two-year postseason ban and a year with 
no televised games. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the probation ended, Mississippi has been to consecutive  
bowl games, the 1997 Motor City Bowl and 1998 Independence Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Weyerhaeuser Earnings Up 115 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) -- Forest products maker Weyerhaeuser Co.  
said its third-quarter earnings more than doubled thanks to strong 
U.S. demand and the economic recovery in Japan. The company also 
said it planned a reorganization aimed at cutting costs and that 
would affect an undetermined number of employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The forest products company reported today it had net earnings  
of $237 million, or $1.18 per common share, compared to $110 
million, or 56 cents per common share, for the same three-month 
period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Weyerhaeuser's results easily surpassed analysts' expectations  
of 95 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
Wall Street was pleased with the results, and bid Weyerhaeuser's 
stock up $1.88 a share to $61.31 in midday New York Stock Exchange 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Net sales for the quarter were $3.12 billion, up nearly 15  
percent from $2.74 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Weyerhaeuser also said it planned what it called a streamlining  
of internal services expected to result in $150 million to $200 
million in annual savings. The company did not say whether jobs 
would be cut or whether there would be layoffs, but it did say the 
process, expected to take up to three years to complete, would 
affect an as-yet unknown number of employees. 
</P>
<P>
	During the third quarter, Weyerhaeuser's timberlands segment had  
operating earnings of $130 million, up 25 percent from $104 million 
a year ago. The company credited the rise to stable export log 
volumes, reflecting recovery in the Japanese housing market. 
</P>
<P>
	The wood products segment had operating earnings of $202  
million, up 132 percent from $87 million last year, due mainly to 
strong demand in the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	The pulp, paper and packaging unit posted operating earnings of  
$105 million, up 57 percent from last year's $67 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Real estate and related assets had earnings of $56 million, up  
47 percent from the $38 million of third-quarter 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Weyerhaeuser reported net  
earnings, before nonrecurring charges, of $503 million, or $2.51 
per common share, compared with $264 million, or $1.33 per common 
share, last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the nonrecurring charges, primarily associated with  
the sale of the company's composite products business, Weyerhaeuser 
reported net earnings of $353 million, or $1.76 per common share. 
</P>
<P>
	Net sales during the first nine months were $8.8 billion,  
compared to $8 billion during the same period of 1998. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Convicted Killer Executed in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A former oilfield worker was executed  
by injection Tuesday for fatally shooting a sheriff's deputy who 
had been summoned to quell a family argument 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvin Wayne Crane, 41, gave a lengthy statement in which he  
expressed love for his family and apologized profusely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have caused you a lot of pain and suffering,'' he said. ``I  
hope you find some peace and comfort in this. If you have any 
anger, I hope you let it go. I'm sorry for causing everybody so 
much trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While on probation for assaulting a school bus driver in  
Oklahoma, Crane was convicted of killing Ochiltree County Chief 
Deputy Melvin Drum with a single shotgun blast to the face on March 
28, 1987, in Perryton, in the northernmost reaches of the Texas 
Panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
	When Drum responded to the call of a domestic dispute, it was at  
least the third time that day authorities were summoned to deal 
with Crane and his wife. Earlier in the day, Crane had used a 
shovel to break out the windows of his wife's car after they 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
	The deputy was still in the car when Crane shot him.

<HEADLINE> Chamberlain Had Poor Health History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Wilt Chamberlain's medical problems included  
an irregular heartbeat that left him hospitalized for three days in 
1992 and a recent 50-pound weight loss following dental surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	It's too early to determine what caused the former basketball  
star's death Tuesday, but heart problems compounded by stress can 
be fatal, said Jaime Moriguchi, co-director of the clinical heart 
failure program at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain recently underwent dental surgery to remove teeth  
knocked aside during his basketball career, said his sister, 
Barbara Lewis. He had dropped about 50 pounds in the last month, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said it was the worst pain. I never heard him complain  
about pain ever,'' she said during a news conference. ``He said he 
felt worse than he ever did Saturday. He looked worse than I have 
ever seen him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He did have some problems and we think at this point it may  
have been a heart attack that did him in,'' Sy Goldberg, 
Chamberlain's lawyer, said. 
</P>
<P>
	If that is the case, it is possible he suffered from ventricular  
arrhythmia, an irregular beat in the heart's lower chamber, the 
body's main blood pump. 
</P>
<P>
	``It causes very chaotic electrical activity. The heart cannot  
pump effectively at all,'' Moriguchi said. ``At that point, you 
pass out and you die unless something is quickly done about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without medical attention, patients die within six minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain's health became an issue in the 1960s, when his  
former coach with the then-San Francisco Warriors was quoted as 
saying Chamberlain might have had a heart attack before the 1964 
season. Chamberlain denied it. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Chamberlain was hospitalized for three days after  
complaining of a ``slightly'' irregular heartbeat. Doctors said it 
was difficult to keep him in the hospital after the problem was 
stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
	His course of treatment was not made public.  
</P>
<P>
	Causes of arrhythmia include coronary heart disease in which the  
vessels supplying blood to the heart are narrowed and the muscle 
becomes damaged by the lack of nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
	Viruses and long-standing hypertension also can damage the heart  
and cause irregular beating, Moriguchi said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 350,000 sudden cardiac deaths occur in the United States  
every year. The condition can be treated with drugs, electrical 
shock and even burning of part of the heart tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most players, Chamberlain had several injuries during his  
14 NBA seasons, including a torn tendon in his right knee in 1969. 
Three years later, he led the Los Angeles Lakers to their first NBA 
championship despite a chipped bone in his right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-1 center, whose weight was listed by the NBA at 275  
pounds during his playing years, retired in 1973.

<HEADLINE> BMI May Predict C-Section Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Though doctors have long known that obese women  
have difficult pregnancies, a pregnant woman's risk for a Caesarean 
section can now be predicted by determining her body mass index, a 
ratio of weight to height. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowing a patient's BMI would allow an anesthesiologist to  
prepare early and more safely for the possibility of an emergency 
Caesarean, according to researchers who presented the study Tuesday 
at the annual meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. 
</P>
<P>
	In the general population, a BMI of 30 or more is considered  
obese -- roughly a person who is 5-feet-1 and weighs 158 pounds. No 
BMI standards have been set for pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of 2,500 women who delivered babies at Duke Medical  
Center found that mothers who had C-sections had an average BMI of 
53 at the time of delivery, compared to a BMI of 31 for those who 
had vaginal deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	While the BMI varied greatly, the average weight of patients  
ranged only from 191 pounds for patients that had C-sections to 182 
for those with normal deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Weight is not the best description of obesity. Tall people can  
weigh more than short people without being obese,'' said lead 
researcher Dr. Elizabeth Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Those with a BMI of 40 or more at the time of delivery are  
considered at greatest risk for Caesareans, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowing there was a greater risk would allow an anesthesiologist  
to prepare for an emergency C-section by inserting an epidural 
catheter into the patient's back so regional anesthesia could be 
administered quickly. Regional anesthesia generally is considered 
safer than general anesthesia for obese women, whose airways can 
become obstructed by excess fat tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	Overweight pregnant women are at greater risk of gestational  
diabetes and tend to have larger babies. Fat tissue also can hinder 
the baby's ability to pass through the birth canal, Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that 98 percent of women with a BMI of 60 or  
greater had a C-section, while none of the women with a BMI of 20 
or less had a C-section. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate was 0.3 percent for women with a BMI of 21 to 30, 32  
percent with a BMI of 31 to 40, 78 percent with a BMI of 41 to 50, 
and 94 percent with a BMI of 51 to 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 2,500 deliveries studied, about one-third, or 833, were  
C-sections. 
</P>
<P>
	Body mass index gives obstetricians another tool, though doctors  
already knew that overweight women have more difficult deliveries, 
said Dr. Ron Ramus, who was not involved in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 to 25 percent of U.S. pregnancies end up in Caesarean  
sections, said Ramus, the assistant professor of obstetrics and 
gynecology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramus said that doctors don't recommend dieting for pregnant  
women but those already overweight should be careful not to gain 
even more weight during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	In another study released Tuesday, researchers found that the  
percentage of women getting regional anesthesia during childbirth 
has tripled since 1981 at the nation's busiest hospitals, and 
quadrupled at small and midsize hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Epidurals and spinal analgesia were received by 66 percent of  
women who delivered in 1997 at hospitals with at least 1,500 
deliveries a year, up from 55 percent in 1992 and 22 percent in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers from the University of Colorado School of Medicine  
in Denver studied 750 U.S. hospitals. They attributed the increase 
to better drugs and new technology.

<HEADLINE> Trial Begins in Wyo. Gay Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Whether or not Aaron McKinney helped  
pistol-whip a gay student, leaving him to die in the freezing 
prairie, is not in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	At the opening of McKinney's murder trial on Monday, his lawyer  
said he would not contest that McKinney played a role in the fatal 
beating of Matthew Shepard last October. 
</P>
<P>
	However, attorney Dion Custis told prospective jurors that drugs  
and alcohol spurred McKinley's actions, and his client's use of 
those substances would be a core part of his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you have to decide in this case is basically a question  
of why,'' Custis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection is to resume today in Albany County District  
Court behind closed doors, with attorneys questioning potential 
jurors individually. It is expected to take about two weeks to seat 
the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Henderson, 22, is already serving a life sentence after  
pleading guilty to felony murder and kidnapping in the beating of 
Shepard. The 21-year-old University of Wyoming freshman died a year 
ago today, five days after being lured out of a bar, driven to a 
remote spot on the freezing prairie, lashed to a wooden fence and 
pistol-whipped into a coma. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney, 22, could face the death penalty if convicted of  
Shepard's murder. Henderson has been subpoenaed by McKinney's 
lawyers to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say McKinney, accompanied by Henderson, instigated a  
plan to rob the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard of $20, but that 
Shepard may have been targeted because he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney has said he did not know Shepard was gay and does not  
hate homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	In unveiling his defense strategy, Custis said he would not  
contend that McKinney was insane, but told them ``his mental state 
will certainly be a crucial question for you to answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Alcohol will be an issue,'' he said. ``Methamphetamine ... is  
a big issue and had a big part in this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard's brutal death provoked a national debate over hate  
crimes and led to measures across the country adding sexual 
orientation to anti-discrimination laws. However, hate-crime 
legislation failed in Wyoming last winter after lawmakers argued 
that gays and other groups would receive special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Custis told prospective jurors he was concerned about the  
widespread attention stemming from the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone here is going to suggest this is a hate  
crime,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the trial began, a few anti-gay protesters demonstrated  
outside the courthouse, along with people who came to honor 
Shepard's memory, wearing angel costumes to spread what they said 
was a message of love. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the day, 21 prospective jurors had been dismissed,  
including a man reporters saw pass a note to Shepard's mother 
during the lunch break. The man indicated the note expressed his 
condolences.

<HEADLINE> Gannett Earnings Jump 19 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Stronger newspaper revenues boosted Gannett Co.'s third-quarter  
earnings by nearly 20 percent, beating analysts' estimates. E.W. 
Scripps Co. recorded flat third-quarter earnings yesterday because 
of several expenses related to its television operations. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Gannett Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Gannett recorded a 19 percent gain in profits for the third  
quarter as revenues rose from its newspapers, which include USA 
Today. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannett earned $207.5 million, or 74 cents per share, in the  
quarter ended Sept. 26, up from 62 cents per share, or $176.5 
million, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had projected earnings of  
71 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues increased 11 percent to $1.36 billion, from $1.23  
billion in the same quarter in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong sales of classified and national advertising, along with  
a decline in the cost of newsprint, powered the company's newspaper 
earnings. Operating income from newspapers grew 23 percent in the 
third quarter to $304.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At USA Today, the company's flagship newspaper, paid advertising  
pages jumped 16 percent to 1,443 compared to 1,242 in the third 
quarter of 1998, while ad revenues grew 21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable revenues increased 11 percent in the third quarter to  
$64.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannett, which is based in Arlington, Va., publishes 74 daily  
newspapers and operates 21 television stations and cable TV systems 
in three states. In addition, the company owns a variety of 
non-daily publications, including the USA Weekend newspaper insert. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Gannett's net earnings  
fell 11 percent to $663 million, or $2.35 per share, from $742 
million, or $2.59 per share, in the same period a year ago. 
Revenues for the period rose 6 percent to $3.95 billion from $3.73 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Not counting one-time gains this year and last from such things  
as the disposal of properties, operating earnings for the first 
nine months rose nearly 13 percent to $630.6 million, or $2.26 a 
share, from $558.6 million, or $1.96 a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Gannett rose 68 3/4 cents to $72.68 3/4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange Monday.

</P>
<P>
	Scripps, a newspaper and television company based in Cincinnati,  
had flat earnings in the third quarter because of several one-time 
expenses related to its TV business. 
</P>
<P>
	Scripps earned $24.9 million in the three months ended Sept. 30,  
down slightly from $26.1 million in the same period a year ago.

	Scripps earmarked $2.5 million to compensate advertisers for  
possibly not having delivered the expected audiences for past 
broadcasts of the company's Home &AMP; Garden Television cable network. 
</P>
<P>
	Expenses also included $800,000 for relocating the Food  
Network's operations within New York City, $1.2 million in 
severance costs for television station employees, and $1 million 
for costs of the Scripps Ventures fund, including compensating its 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Scripps' revenues from newspaper advertising remained strong,  
but television stations were hurt by weak advertising revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Scripps operates 19 daily newspapers; nine network-affiliated  
television stations; three cable television networks, Home &AMP; Garden 
Television, Food Network and Do it Yourself, and a TV programmer, 
Scripps Productions.

<HEADLINE> Kevin Johnson Retires From NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Kevin Johnson, one of the NBA's most prolific  
point guards, retired Tuesday after an 11-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who sat out last season, revealed his decision in a  
news release from the Phoenix Suns, the team he led for 10 1/2 seasons 
before leaving as a free agent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank the Phoenix Suns for making my playing experience  
memorable and for helping me accomplish everything I could have 
dreamed of, with the exception of an NBA championship,'' said the 
33-year-old Johnson, who had struggled with injuries late in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Last April, when he came back to Phoenix for the ceremony  
honoring former teammate Tom Chambers, Johnson said he probably was 
through with basketball. He said he had turned down several offers 
from other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had spent more time on the bench and as shooting guard  
after the Suns brought in Jason Kidd as the floor leader in 
December 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In Flagstaff, where the Suns wrapped up their training camp  
Tuesday, coach Danny Ainge said he was ``a little surprised, but 
not shocked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``KJ had an unbelievable career,'' Ainge said. ``Had he not been  
hurt, I think he would have been up there with some of the best 
point guards who ever played the game, in everybody's eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was traded to the Suns from Cleveland midway through his  
rookie season. He is the team's career assist leader with 6,494 and 
No. 3 in scoring with 12,707 points. 
</P>
<P>
	His career assist average of 9.2 trails only John Stockton,  
Magic Johnson, Oscar Robertson and Isiah Thomas. His 6,687 assists 
rank 10th on the NBA career list. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who averaged 18 points a game, was a three-time  
all-star and only the sixth player with 11,500 points, 6,000 
assists, 2,000 rebounds and 1,000 steals. He averaged at least 20 
points and 10 assists for three straight seasons from 1988-91. Only 
four other players accomplished that feat -- Nate Archibald, 
Johnson, Robertson and Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	In 96 playoff games, Johnson averaged 20.8 points and 9.5  
assists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns are expected to honor him at a game sometime this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I think of Kevin Johnson, I think of a young man who  
represented this franchise as well as anyone who has worn a Suns 
uniform,'' said Jerry Colangelo, the team's chief executive 
officer. ``Kevin will go down as one of the most popular players to 
play for the Suns, but also had as big an impact as anyone who has 
ever played for us.''

<HEADLINE> Remembering Chamberlain's 100 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDITOR'S NOTE -- In 1987, on the 25th anniversary of Wilt  
Chamberlain's 100-point game, Bill Barnard of The Associated Press	
wrote the following story on his milestone.	
</P>
<P>
	Wilt Chamberlain was humble.  
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't have come close without my teammates' help because  
the Knicks didn't want me to make 100.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was contemptuous.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were willing to do anything to stop me.''  
</P>
<P>
	And he was supremely arrogant.  
</P>
<P>
	``Scoring 100 points is a lot, but ... I maybe could have scored  
140 if they had played straight-up basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the Goliath of basketball, Chamberlain may be an enigma as  
a man, but, as a player, he was one of the greatest ever to wear an 
NBA uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	His record of 100 points in one game for the Philadelphia  
Warriors on March 2, 1962, in Hershey, Pa., against the New York 
Knicks may stand forever. 
</P>
<P>
	When discussing the subject, the 7-foot-1 Chamberlain gives much  
of the credit to his teammates, who rallied to his support as the 
Knicks held the ball, swarmed around him defensively and committed 
repeated fouls to try to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warriors won the game 169-147.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a challenge to my teammates to help me,'' Chamberlain  
said in a telphone interview on the 25th anniversary of his 
remarkable game. ``Once we were far ahead, the Knicks disregarded 
trying to win the game and concentrated on stopping me. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they hadn't just tried to stop me without regard to whether  
they would win or not, I could have scored a lot more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain said two or three Knicks told him later that they  
were ordered to play defense that way by their coach, Eddie 
Donovan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just wasn't right the way they were behind by 25 points and  
then they're told to hold the ball,'' Chamberlain said. ``They must 
have considered it a stigma to let me score 100.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Donovan, however, the fouling worked both ways.  
</P>
<P>
	``They would foul us and we would foul them,'' Donovan said.  
``The game became a farce, but you try to keep anyone from scoring 
the best you can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain said that what his teammates did for him during the  
game ``was way beyond the call of duty. They were so clever finding 
ways to get me the ball. They had to do more than just give up open 
shots. They had to avoid fouls and pass me the ball in traffic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he was disgusted with the Knicks' play in general,  
Chamberlain said 6-foot-10 New York center Darrall Imhoff should 
not be labeled as ``the man who let me score 100 points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He played me as well as anyone,'' Chamberlain said. ``He  
fouled out in the fourth quarter, and that's when I really started 
getting points. He was no more at fault than anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While unflagging in praise of his teammates, there is a side of  
Chamberlain that shrugs off the feat as not particularly 
significant for someone like him. 
</P>
<P>
	``As outstanding as it may seem, it's really a normal thing that  
I did it,'' he said. ``You have to remember that I averaged 50 
points a game that year. Players that average 16 or 17 points 
usually have at least one game during a season when they score 35. 
That's just what I did; I doubled my average.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He bristles at suggestions that scoring 100 points in a game  
might be called the ultimate selfish act by a basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lots of people look at scoring as selfish,'' Chamberlain said.  
``When you go out there and do the things you're supposed to do, 
people view you as selfish. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't look at you that way if you're O.J. Simpson or Eric  
Dickerson or Walter Payton and you're trying to get as many yards 
as you can every time you touch the football. But when you're a 
scorer in basketball, you can get labeled a gunner or a selfish 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain realizes that although he is more proud of averaging  
50 points for an entire season, he is more remembered for 100

<HEADLINE> Man Guilty of Setting Mass. Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A man was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in jail  
Tuesday for burning down a historic building that housed a 
newspaper and a dozen other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	George Aldrich pleaded guilty to charges of burning a building  
and breaking and entering a building at night. 
</P>
<P>
	Aldrich, a former resident of the J.W. Parementer Building in  
Waltham, admitted to setting the Feb. 19 blaze that consumed the 
three-story brick building that housed The News Tribune, a 
7,500-circulation community newspaper serving readers in Newton and 
Waltham. 
</P>
<P>
	Also destroyed were a military recruiting office, offices of the  
Massachusetts Parent-Teacher Association Inc., a violin repair shop 
and several other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody was injured, but damage to the 19th century building and  
its occupants was estimated at between $4 million and $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	About a week before the fire was set, Aldrich was evicted from  
the basement apartment where he and another person were living 
illegally. The building was not zoned for residential use.

<HEADLINE> Braves Lead Mets After 3 in NLCS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Bret Boone had a run-scoring single in the first  
and the Atlanta Braves grabbed a 1-0 lead over the New York Mets 
after three innings in Game 1 of the NL Championship Series on 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, making their first appearance in the NLCS since 1988,  
squandered a prime scoring chance by failing to convert a squeeze 
bunt in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves, who have played in eight straight championship  
series, jumped on New York starter Masato Yoshii right away. Gerald 
Williams hit the first pitch for a single, stole second and scored 
when Boone lined a single to center. 
</P>
<P>
	Chipper Jones followed with a walk, prompting Orel Hershiser to  
begin throwing in the Mets bullpen. But Yoshii settled down to 
retire the next three hitters, and he also escaped in the second 
after Eddie Perez led off with a double. 
</P>
<P>
	Nineteen-game winner Greg Maddux retired the first six New York  
hitters before Roger Cedeno led off the third with a double. Cedeno 
moved to third on Williams' errant throw back to the infield, but 
the Mets couldn't convert. 
</P>
<P>
	After Rey Ordonez was retired on a dribbler in front of the  
plate, the Mets tried to squeeze with Yoshii on a 2-0 count. He 
failed to make contact on a pitch low and away and Cedeno was 
tagged out easily. 
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-7 series between division rivals -- Atlanta finished  
seven games ahead of the Mets in the NL East, but New York claimed 
the wild card -- took on somewhat of a nasty tone as the teams 
exchanged pre-game barbs. 
</P>
<P>
	New York manager Bobby Valentine claimed the Braves had no  
respect for his team, especially after beating New York five of six 
times in the final two weeks of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, who lost nine of 12 to the Braves overall, recovered  
to earn a tie with Cincinnati for the wild card and beat the Reds 
5-0 in a playoff. New York then upset Arizona in the opening round 
of the postseason to advance to the NLCS for the first time since 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves defeated Houston in the other division series.  
</P>
<P>
	After Valentine's comments, Atlanta outfielder Brian Jordan  
admitted that he disliked New York and teammate John Rocker claimed 
it was the Mets who didn't respect the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets slugger Mike Piazza returned to the lineup after missing  
the final two games of the division series because of an injured 
thumb. He grounded out leading off the second. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves made a lineup change, inserting opening-round hero  
Walt Weiss at shortstop in place of Jose Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	Batting practice for the Mets was cut short by pregame showers,  
forcing the ground crew to put the tarp back on the field. But the 
rain stopped and the game started only four minutes behind 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Andres Galarraga, who missed the season for the Braves while  
recovering from cancer, threw out the ceremonial first pitch.

<HEADLINE> Taco Bell Dog's Role Shrinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The little dog's days as the central character  
in Taco Bell commercials are dwindling but its feisty Chihuahua is 
staying on in a supporting role. 
</P>
<P>
	The fast-food restaurant chain plans to introduce a new  
advertising tagline later this year and emphasize the food and its 
price, spokeswoman Laurie Gannon said Monday. But she said ``the 
dog is staying in the advertising'' although its role will change. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll use the dog in a different sense to draw attention to  
the food,'' she said, declining to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	The tagline debuting in commercials airing in late December will  
be ``Grande Taste. Loco Price. Only at Taco Bell.'' Taco Bell ads 
have not been using any single theme in recent years, Ms. Gannon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taco Bell owns or franchises about 7,000 Mexican-style  
restaurants worldwide from its base in Irvine, Calif. It has 
featured a Chihuahua that appears to talk in more than two dozen 
ads over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Ms. Gannon said it has sold over 20 million  
miniature plush toys of the dog that recite some of the phrases it 
has uttered in ads like ``Yo Quiero Taco Bell,'' which means ``I 
Want Taco Bell.'' The toys sell the restaurants for $3 to $4. 
</P>
<P>
	She said four more versions of the toys uttering phrases heard  
in commercials this year will go on sale in mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
	Taco Bell sales per store grew at a slower pace in the second  
quarter. Sales per store open at least a year were up a slim 1 
percent on the April-June period after rising 4 percent in the 
first quarter and 3 percent for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the year before the Chihuahua debuted nationally in  
advertising, sales per store grew 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gannon said the change in ad plans didn't reflect concerns  
over sales growth, however. ``We are just making a change in 
direction. Food, taste and value are what they want to draw 
attention to,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> John Hancock Names New CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- John Hancock president David D'Alessandro has been  
named chief executive officer of the financial services company 
starting June 1, the board of directors announced. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro will replace current CEO and Chairman Steven Brown.  
In a company news release Tuesday, Brown, 62, said he's stepping 
down because he's nearing the mandatory retirement age of 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown will stay on as chairman, and also become chairman of John  
Hancock Funds, part of the company's mutual fund operation. During 
Brown's seven-year tenure as CEO, the company's assets under 
management have doubled to $124.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The change in leadership comes as John Hancock Mutual Life  
Insurance Co. moves toward an initial public offering on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Boston-based company's board of directors  
adopted a plan to distribute the company's value to policy holders 
in the form of stock, cash or policy credits as it goes through a 
process known as demutualization. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will be called John Hancock Financial Services.  
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro, 48, is credited with increasing the net income of  
John Hancock's retail business 188 percent between 1991 and 1998 to 
$337.8 million. During the same period, he also increased the sale 
of Hancock's life insurance products by 77 percent while the 
industry averaged 4 percent, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock had 1998 earnings of $448.5 million on sales of  
$6.9 billion.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Lower; Dow Down 92.13 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mostly lower in early trading on  
Wall Street today as rising bond yields, presenting a more 
attractive alternative to stocks, drew investors away from 
equities. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 92.13 at 10,556.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down 9.55 at 1,325.66, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
down 0.16 to 2,915.79. The Nasdaq was struggling to build on its 
new record close of 2,915.95, set Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks followed bond prices lower. Bond investors, nagged by  
persisting worries about interest rates, were selling ahead of this 
week's government reports on wholesale prices and industrial 
production. The reports are expected to bring the latest signs of 
whether inflation is escalating in the U.S. economy, and whether 
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a third time this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in bond prices pushed the yield on the 30-year Treasury  
bond up to 6.24 percent today from 6.20 percent late Friday. The 
bond market was closed Monday for the Columbus Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising bond yields can present an attractive alternative to  
stocks by offering a fixed, guaranteed return. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings reports were expected to provide a spark to trading  
today. Several Wall Street brokerages reported strong profits, but 
few were rewarded by sharp gains in their share prices. Merrill 
Lynch rose 1/8 to 67 7/8 after reporting its third-quarter earnings beat 
revised analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 102.5 million shares, 
well ahead of Monday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.65 to 429.54.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.2 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.4 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 0.8 percent.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Rescue Planes Head to S.Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) -- After a 24-hour delay caused by  
bad weather, two U.S. military cargo planes departed for Antarctica 
Wednesday to prepare to rescue a doctor at the South Pole who has a 
lump in her breast. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Air National Guard Hercules LC-130 cargo planes set out for  
McMurdo base on the northern coast of Antarctica after high winds 
and swirling snow eased on the frigid continent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,975-mile flight was expected to take about eight hours,  
putting the planes into McMurdo late Wednesday afternoon New 
Zealand time (1 a.m. Wednesday EDT). 
</P>
<P>
	``Weather conditions both at and above McMurdo station are  
favorable, with yesterday's high winds and whiteout conditions 
having cleared away during the night,'' said National Science 
Foundation spokesman Peter West. 
</P>
<P>
	Once in McMurdo, the planes must wait until the temperature at  
the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station rises above minus 58 degrees 
before flying there to pick up Dr. Jerri Nielsen. The temperature 
is expected to rise above that mark within the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will decide on a day-by-day basis on whether to undertake  
the pole mercy dash to pick up Dr. Jerri Nielsen,'' West said. The 
decision will depend on the weather conditions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, 47, is the only physician among 41 researchers at the  
Amundsen-Scott base, which is run by the U.S.-based National 
Science Foundation. She discovered a lump in her breast earlier 
this year but could not be evacuated because of the harsh polar 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	It is feared Nielsen has breast cancer, but the NSF has refused  
to discuss her condition. 
</P>
<P>
	A replacement doctor for the station and a team of medics to  
treat Nielsen are on one of the planes, which are fitted with skis 
to allow them to land on the ice at Amundsen-Scott base. 
</P>
<P>
	A daring July flight airdropped medical supplies to Nielsen, and  
she is believed to have been treating herself with chemotherapy 
since then.

<HEADLINE> United Phasing Out Ad Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines is ditching its ``Rising''  
advertising campaign, which never really got far off the ground as 
a successor to the legendary ``Friendly Skies'' pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Introduced in 1997, the print and television ads portrayed the  
company as rising -- largely targeting business travelers 
disgruntled with the industry's reputation for delays and mediocre 
food. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Matthew Triaca said Tuesday that the ads will  
be replaced in early 2000 by an as yet-undisclosed new campaign. 
Triaca said the ads in 1997 were ``appropriate at that time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, United has been phasing out ``Rising'' and  
relying more on the ``Rhapsody in Blue'' theme music that was 
developed earlier as part of the ``Friendly Skies'' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	While Triaca wouldn't comment on the ads' failure to catch on,  
the short run for ``Rising'' clearly signals United's 
dissatisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come Fly the Friendly Skies,'' concocted by the Chicago ad  
agency Leo Burnett, endured for 31 years until it was retired in 
1996. That same year, United severed ties with Burnett, its 
longtime ad partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry watchers say the ``Rising'' campaign's message was  
never very clear, and even United pilots and other employees 
couldn't relate to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone felt that it connected anything,'' said  
James Higgins, a securities analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; 
Jenrette in New York who called the ads odd. ``It didn't resonate 
with anyone.'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads' demise, he said, ``suggests that United perhaps isn't  
making as much progress with business travelers as they hoped they 
would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Higgins said, the move has little market significance for  
an airline where revenue and earnings have both been on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Rising'' ads were developed by Fallon McElligott of  
Minneapolis, one of two major agencies used by United, based in 
suburban Elk Grove Township. The airline said both Fallon 
McElligott and Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising in New York are 
developing new campaigns for the domestic market. Y&AMP;R handles 
international ads.

<HEADLINE> Eagle Fans Sink To New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Booing is a way of life for Philadelphia  
sports fans, some of the most raucous, passionate and surly in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble this time was the cheering.  
</P>
<P>
	Philly's fans may have sunk to a new low by cheering Dallas  
Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin's potentially serious neck injury. 
It disgusted even those who thought they had seen it all in the 
``City of Brotherly Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This, in terms of bad taste, was as bad as it gets,'' said  
Mayor Edward Rendell, an avid sports fan. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Irvin landed awkwardly on his head after  
catching a pass from Troy Aikman in the first quarter of the 
Philadelphia Eagles' 13-10 victory over the Cowboys on Sunday. He 
lay motionless on the artificial turf for nearly 20 minutes while 
medical staff attended to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans in the crowd of 66,669 cheered when they realized  
Irvin was hurt, and again when paramedics wheeled a stretcher onto 
the field. Many also cheered respectfully when he was placed in an 
ambulance, but the damage was done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe they cheered,'' said Donovan McNabb, the  
team's No. 1 pick who was nearly booed off the stage by Eagles fans 
attending the draft. ``You don't know what to expect from them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What makes Philly fans so foul? One theory is the longtime  
failure of their teams. If they can't be first in the standings, 
some figure they might as well be No. 1 in nastiness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles haven't won an NFL championship since 1960. The 76ers  
had the worst record in NBA history when they were 9-73 in 1972-73. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies have lost more games than any team in baseball  
history. They also blew the pennant in 1964, squandering a 6 1/2-game 
lead with 12 to play with 10 straight losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Zellman, an 18-year-old fan from Philadelphia, said he  
won't attend Eagles games anymore. Fans are so rowdy that a 
municipal judge holds court at the stadium to charge offenders 
during the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not wearing the right jersey, you're guaranteed to  
get beat up,'' Zellman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cities have rowdy fans. Arrests are routine at Yankee  
Stadium, and Cleveland is still scarred by the bloody 10-cent beer 
night riot in 1974. It doesn't get much nastier than shooting a 
coach's dog, but that's what Green Bay Packers fans did to Dan 
Devine in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
	But Philadelphia's list of embarrassing moments is getting  
lengthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think too many of our fans have gotten caught up in our  
image of bombarding people and booing,'' Rendell said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 10, 1997, a fan shot a flare gun across the field into  
the stands during a nationally televised Monday night game against 
the San Francisco 49ers. Fans pelted national TV broadcasters with 
snowballs during a Cowboys-Eagles game in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, fans threw batteries at St. Louis Cardinals  
outfielder J.D. Drew, expressing their anger that he didn't sign 
with the Phillies after they drafted him in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In the most infamous case, Santa Claus was booed and pelted with  
snowballs during a game between the Eagles and Minnesota in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	The fan reaction to Irvin's injury was criticized in the city's  
newspapers and on talk radio Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unspeakable, even for us,'' proclaimed a headline in the  
Philadelphia Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	No one is safe from the boo birds. Mike Schmidt, one of the best  
third basemen in baseball history, was booed for much of his career 
with the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron Jaworski told me one time that he had completed like 14  
passes in a row, and on the 15th one he had an incompletion and 
they booed him,'' said Randall Cunningham, the Eagles' star 
quarterback from 1985-95. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, who stayed overnight in the spinal trauma unit of a  
Philadelphia hospital with swelling in his spine near the base of 
his skull, was released Monday and flew home. The Cowboys are 
optimistic he'll play again this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people need to grow up and find some inner peace, because  
there is no peace in watching somebody suffer,'' said Irvin's 
teammate, Emmitt Smith.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Awarded Euro 2004 Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AACHEN, Germany (AP) -- Portugal on Tuesday was awarded the 2004  
European soccer championships, beating out Spain and a joint bid 
from Austria and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the first time the quadrennial championships are  
held in Portugal. The 2000 tournament will be played in Belgium and 
The Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, following a secret vote, was announced by Lennart  
Johansson, president of Europe's governing soccer body. The 
Portuguese delegation, including soccer great Eusebio, cheered 
wildly.

<HEADLINE> Court To Decide Overtime Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide  
whether public employees who agree to take extra time off instead 
of overtime pay can be forced to use the time off at the employer's 
convenience. 
</P>
<P>
	The court voted to hear arguments by more than 120 Harris  
County, Texas, sheriff's deputies that they -- not their government 
employer -- have the right to control when such time-off credits are 
used. 
</P>
<P>
	The deputies filed a class-action lawsuit in 1994 against the  
county, which includes Houston. The lawsuit said the sheriff's 
department violated federal labor law by forcing them to use 
accumulated time-off credits when they did not want to use them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fair Labor Standards Act generally requires public and  
private employees to be paid time-and-one-half if they work more 
than 40 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1985, the law has let public employees agree to take  
compensatory time off instead of overtime pay. Public safety 
workers can accumulate up to 480 hours of time off, and after that 
must be paid for any additional overtime work. 
</P>
<P>
	In Harris County, sheriff's employees nearing the maximum amount  
of accumulated hours are asked to take time off. If they do not, 
they are ordered to do so. The department can require the employee 
to use the hours at a time that serves its personnel needs if the 
two sides cannot agree. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled for the deputies, saying compensatory time  
off must be used ``on the worker's terms,'' except when doing so 
would disrupt the employer's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling.  
Employers can set workplace rules as long as they do not conflict 
with a negotiated agreement, the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	In seeking the Supreme Court's help, the deputies' lawyers noted  
that another federal appeals court has issued a conflicting ruling. 
Employees' time-off credits ``may not be controlled by the 
scheduling convenience or inconvenience of the employer,'' the 
lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, asked for its views by the court,  
supported the deputies' appeal. Such accumulated time off belongs 
to employees and should be under their control, Justice Department 
lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The county's lawyers said the 5th Circuit court ruled correctly  
because the law allowing public employees to take time off instead 
of overtime pay was intended to help governments avoid budgetary 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Christensen vs. Harris County, 98-1167.

<HEADLINE> Chamberlain More Than 100-Point Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Wilt Chamberlain was scary, flat-out frightening. That's because  
before he came along, most basketball players were mortal-sized 
men. Chamberlain changed that. 
</P>
<P>
	He was more than a big man. He was a giant.  
</P>
<P>
	In the days before cable television, it was tough to get a  
handle on every player, every prospect in the country. Chamberlain 
changed that, too. That's how special a player he was. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a buzz in basketball circles in the early 1950s about  
this spindly 6-foot-11 kid at Overbrook High School in 
Philadelphia, who seemed to score points almost at will. That's 
because he towered over the other players. 
</P>
<P>
	He grew to be 7-foot-1, so big that he could dominate games with  
very little effort. But that wasn't Wilt's way. He worked at 
basketball, used his great height and raw strength to take over 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain's impact began in warmups. He would trot out  
regally, wearing a headband and a glare, and lope around the court. 
Opposing players would shoot glances at him and their expressions 
spoke volumes. 
</P>
<P>
	How do you deal with Goliath, a guy who's a foot taller than  
most of the other players on the court? 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina, coached by the brilliant Frank McGuire, came up  
with a unique solution. In the 1957 NCAA championship game against 
Chamberlain and Kansas, McGuire sent out his shortest player, Tommy 
Kearns, for the opening tap, trying to rattle the big man. 
</P>
<P>
	It was as if Carolina was thumbing its nose at Chamberlain,  
saying it was unconcerned with his presence. After that, though, 
the Tar Heels stopped playing coy, spending the rest of night 
triple-teaming him -- one defender in front, one behind and a third 
arriving as soon as he got the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The game went three overtimes and Carolina won. For years  
afterward, Chamberlain considered it his most devastating loss. 
</P>
<P>
	After two years at Kansas, where he averaged 29.9 points and  
18.3 rebounds, Chamberlain turned pro, first with the Harlem 
Globetrotters and then in the NBA. It was there that he found a 
fitting rival, Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell wasn't quite as tall as Chamberlain, but he was a  
defensive genius, the moving force behind the Celtics' dynasty. 
Their battles were monumental, a study in big man basketball. 
Often, Chamberlain wound up as frustrated by Russell as he had been 
by the triple overtime loss to North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain assembled some remarkable statistics.  
</P>
<P>
	He scored 31,419 points during his career, a record until Kareem  
Abdul-Jabbar broke it in 1984, and holds the record for career 
rebounding with 23,924. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the NBA in scoring seven straight seasons, 1960-66, and  
led the league in rebounding 11 of his 14 seasons. He averaged 30.1 
points a game in his career, and pushed that to a record 50.4 in 
1961-62. He even led the league in assists with 702 in 1967-68. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wilt Chamberlain had a great deal to do with the success of  
the NBA,'' said longtime Boston coach and GM Red Auerbach. ``His 
dominance, power, demeanor and the rivalry with Bill Russell says 
it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there were the free throws.  
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain was the dominant scorer and dominant rebounder of  
his time. His trouble came when he had to shoot foul shots. They 
mystified him. He tried different regimens -- underhanded, 
two-handed -- but nothing ever worked very well for him. It was the 
one chink in Goliath's armor. 
</P>
<P>
	But in his greatest game, Chamberlain solved the free throw  
mystery, too. On March 2, 1962, in an NBA game hidden away in 
Hershey, Pa., he scored 100 points against the New York Knicks. 
That night, he converted 28 of 32 foul shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get constant reminders from fans who equate that game and my  
career as one and the same,'' Chamberlain said years later. 
``People don't talk about the 50-point average, the 69-13 Lakers 
championship team I played for. They talk about the night I scored 
100. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my tag whether I like it or not.''  
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain was a versatile athlete, a track standout, who also  
was fascinated by tennis and volleyball. He ran marathons and was 
an awesome physical specimen. A few years ago, there was even some 
talk -- some believed it was whimsical but others took it seriously 
-- of Wilt signing a 10-day contract to help a big man-depleted NBA 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilt was always open to all offers. The message on his answering  
machine made that clear. 
</P>
<P>
	It said: ``When and where and I'll take it from there.''

<HEADLINE> AlliedSignal To Lay Off 400 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- AlliedSignal Aerospace will lay off about 400  
workers in Phoenix by the end of the month because of declining 
demand for commercial aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers in Phoenix and Tempe, Ariz., had been told last month  
that layoffs were coming and that they would know by Oct. 31 
whether their jobs were being eliminated, spokesman Bill Reavis 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reavis noted that Seattle-based Boeing plans to build 125 fewer  
aircraft next year than this year. Another factor, he said, is the 
need to streamline the Engines and Systems division. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Loranger, president of the two divisions, told employees  
by memo the layoffs were necessary ``to lower our cost structure 
and prepare for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reavis said they had nothing to do with AlliedSignal's merger  
with Honeywell Inc., which is expected to be completed this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aerospace section of AlliedSignal Inc. employs nearly 9,000  
people in the Phoenix area and about 1,000 in Tucson. The unit cut 
about 150 jobs about five months ago.

<HEADLINE> Intel's 3Q Profits Up 21 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Intel Corp.'s third-quarter operating  
profit rose 21 percent, but the chipmaker's results were shy of 
forecasts and may heighten earnings fears that helped send the 
stock market plunging on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest manufacturer of semiconductors earned $1.9  
billion, or 55 cents a share, in the three months ended Sept. 26, 
excluding one-time expenses related to acquisitions of other 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a strong improvement from last year's third-quarter  
operating profit of $1.58 billion, or 45 cents a share, but 2 cents 
per share below expectations, according to a survey of industry 
analysts by First Call/Thompson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter revenues rose 9 percent to $7.3 billion from $6.7  
billion a year earlier. While sales were particularly strong for 
Intel's Pentium III chip used in many personal computers, the 
product line drew lower profits than in previous quarters amid 
aggressive pricing by rivals intent on grabbing market share. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, released after the close of regular stock trading,  
were a surprise for many Wall Street investors who've come to 
expect Intel to meet or beat analyst forecasts. Hopes were also 
high because sales of personal computers, the overwhelming majority 
of which run on Intel microprocessors, typically rise in the third 
quarter amid back-to-school and early holiday shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, Intel's stock rose 18 3/4 cents a share to $76.68 3/4 in  
Nasdaq trading before the report, despite a steep decline on the 
overall stock market that sliced 231 points off the Dow Jones 
industrial average. In after hours trading on other markets, Intel 
fell as low as $70 a share, a drop that could spark another market 
decline at the start of Wednesday's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., took a charge during the  
just-ended quarter for expenses related to the purchase of Level 
One Communications. Including the charges, Intel posted a net 
profit of $1.5 billion, or 42 cents a share. That was down from a 
net profit of $1.6 billion, or 45 cents a share, in the same period 
last year, also including one-time charges for acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, operating income totaled $5.7  
billion, or $1.65 a share, up from $4.2 billion, or $1.19 a share, 
in the same period last year. Net revenue rose to $21.2 billion 
from $18.7 billion in the first nine months of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Ex Deputy Solicitor General Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ESSEX, England (AP) -- Louis F. Claiborne, who as a deputy  
solicitor general argued more than 60 cases before the U.S. Supreme 
Court on behalf of the federal government, died at his home in 
Wivenhoe on Oct. 6. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Claiborne served in the solicitor general's office in Washington  
from 1962 to 1970 before moving to England to teach at the 
University of Sussex. He returned to the office in 1978, where he 
remained until 1985, when he left to join the San Francisco law 
firm of Washburn, Briscoe &AMP; McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidentally, the Supreme Court was hearing arguments today on  
an environmental issue on which Claiborne wrote his last brief. 
Claiborne argued that private citizens should not be allowed to sue 
under the Clean Water Act because any penalties would go to the 
government, not to the plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the survivors are a son and daughter, Andrew and Michele,  
both of Wivenhoe; a brother, Omer, of Santa Fe, N.M.; and a sister, 
designer Liz Claiborne, of New York.

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Moss Has NBA Aspirations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Vikings general manager Tim  
Connolly says he would be the first in line to watch Randy Moss try 
his hand at the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard he's a better basketball player than a football  
player,'' Connolly said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings don't have a position on Moss' NBA aspirations,  
``but he's a tremendous athlete and we'd all be curious and 
interested to see him play pro basketball,'' Connolly said in his 
first comments on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, Minnesota Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders said  
one of Moss' representatives had contacted him to float the idea of 
Moss playing alongside fellow superstar Kevin Garnett at some 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss refused to discuss the issue this week, and his agent,  
Dante DiTrapano, didn't return phone calls from The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	But in August, the Vikings' star receiver said he would love to  
try playing professional basketball. He was twice named West 
Virginia's Mr. Basketball when he was in high school, when his 
teammate was Sacramento Kings guard Jason Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders said the arrangements of a two-sport career could be  
complicated but not impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd probably have to see him play in the summer time,''  
Saunders said. ``I'd never say never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Vikings coach Dennis Green has said that Moss' electrifying  
athletic skills would suit him in the NBA, where he'd miss about 
half the season providing the Vikings go deep into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Connolly said he's not sure if Moss is serious about playing in  
the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never spoken to Randy about it, I've not spoken to his  
agent about it and I've not spoken to the Timberwolves about it,'' 
Connolly said. ``But I think Randy Moss is one of those rare people 
who could play two sports. With the Minnesota Vikings, he's got a 
home as long as he wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moss sprained his ankle playing hoops two days before the team's  
May minicamp after he was drafted last year. He sat out the camp 
with a cast and, according to Green, the injury hampered Moss's 
play his entire rookie season, which was nonetheless spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Moss signed a four-year, $4.4 million contract that's  
widely expected to be torn up after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Connolly said that despite the increased chance of injury, any  
new deal for Moss, the 1998 Offensive Rookie of the Year, wouldn't 
include language discouraging Moss from pursuing a pro basketball 
career on the side. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a standard NFL contract, 20 games and hopefully  
playoffs,'' Connolly said. ``What he does in his spare time is his 
business. Some guys like to hunt, some guys like to fish, some guys 
like to golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he want to play basketball, then more power to him. I'd  
love to see it.''

<HEADLINE> Kevin Johnson Retires From NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Kevin Johnson, one of the NBA's most prolific  
point guards, retired Tuesday after an 11-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who sat out last season, revealed his decision in a  
news release from the Phoenix Suns, the team he led for 10 1/2 seasons 
before leaving as a free agent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank the Phoenix Suns for making my playing experience  
memorable and for helping me accomplish everything I could have 
dreamed of, with the exception of an NBA championship,'' said the 
33-year-old Johnson, who had struggled with injuries late in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Last April, when he came back to Phoenix for the ceremony  
honoring former teammate Tom Chambers, Johnson said he probably was 
through with basketball. He said he had turned down several offers 
from other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had spent more time on the bench and as shooting guard  
after the Suns brought in Jason Kidd as the floor leader in 
December 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In Flagstaff, where the Suns wrapped up their training camp  
Tuesday, coach Danny Ainge said he was ``a little surprised, but 
not shocked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``KJ had an unbelievable career,'' Ainge said. ``Had he not been  
hurt, I think he would have been up there with some of the best 
point guards who ever played the game, in everybody's eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was traded to the Suns from Cleveland midway through his  
rookie season. He is the team's career assist leader with 6,494 and 
No. 3 in scoring with 12,707 points. 
</P>
<P>
	His career assist average of 9.2 trails only John Stockton,  
Magic Johnson, Oscar Robertson and Isiah Thomas. His 6,687 assists 
rank 10th on the NBA career list. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who averaged 18 points a game, was a three-time  
all-star and only the sixth player with 11,500 points, 6,000 
assists, 2,000 rebounds and 1,000 steals. He averaged at least 20 
points and 10 assists for three straight seasons from 1988-91. Only 
four other players accomplished that feat -- Nate Archibald, 
Johnson, Robertson and Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	In 96 playoff games, Johnson averaged 20.8 points and 9.5  
assists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns are expected to honor him at a game sometime this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I think of Kevin Johnson, I think of a young man who  
represented this franchise as well as anyone who has worn a Suns 
uniform,'' said Jerry Colangelo, the team's chief executive 
officer. ``Kevin will go down as one of the most popular players to 
play for the Suns, but also had as big an impact as anyone who has 
ever played for us.''

	Raytheon Cuts Earnings Projections  
</P>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- Defense giant Raytheon Co. is slashing  
its earnings projections for 1999 and 2000, blaming 
lower-than-expected revenue. The contractor said today it also 
plans to take a $638 million pretax charge for restructuring and 
project problems. The Lexington company estimates its 1999 earnings 
per share will be between $1.40 and $1.50 per share, including the 
charges, or $2.70 to $2.80 per share excluding charges -- well below 
the Wall Street expectations of $3.56 per share. For the year 2000, 
the company estimates earnings per share will be in the range of 
$2.10 to $2.25, compared to estimates of $3.91 per share. While 
stock market officials maintained a trading halt on Raytheon 
shares, most of its rival contractors tumbled.

losses, International Paper earned $192 million, or 46 cents a 
share, compared to $81 million, or 20 cents per share, in the same 
quarter a year ago. The figures beat analysts' expectations. 
International Paper shares were at 48 11/16, up 3/16.

	Weyerhaeuser Earnings Up 115 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) -- Forest products maker Weyerhaeuser Co.  
said its third-quarter earnings more than doubled thanks to strong 
U.S. demand and the economic recovery in Japan. Weyerhaeuser 
reported today net earnings of $237 million, or $1.18 per common 
share, compared to $110 million, or 56 cents per common share, for 
the same three-month period of 1998. The results easily surpassed 
analysts' expectations. Net sales for the quarter were $3.12 
billion, up nearly 15 percent from $2.74 billion last year. 
Weyerhaeuser shares were at 60 1/2, up 1 1/16.

<P>
	Phelps Dodge Earnings Fall 20 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Phelps Dodge Corp. reported its third-quarter  
earnings fell 20.7 percent as a result of the continuing slump in 
copper prices. The big copper and wire producer said it earned 
$16.1 million, or 28 cents per share, down from $20.3 million, or 
35 cents per share, reported for the same period last year. Phelps 
Dodge surpassed analyst expectations of 21 cents per share. The 
results do not reflect a restructuring charge of $700,000, or 1 
cent per share, for the latest quarter, and a 1998 gain of $8.3 
million, or 14 cents per share, from the completion of the sale of 
Accuride Corp.

	MGM Posts First Profit in 3 Years  
</P>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. reported  
its first profitable quarter in almost three years today, earning 
$10.3 million on the strength of recent films, TV programming and 
cost-cutting. The third-quarter results came in well above 
forecasts of Wall Street analysts, who had predicted a loss. 
Earnings for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 were 7 cents a share, 
compared with a $40.3 million, or 61 cents a share, loss for the 
same period in 1998. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson 
Financial had expected MGM to lose 19 cents a share in this year's 
third quarter. MGM shares were unchanged at 22 3/16.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- TD Waterhouse Group has decided to join the  
REDIBook ECN consortium of discount brokers after a deal to offer 
extended-hours trading through Island ECN fell through. As part of 
today's announcement, TD Waterhouse said it expects to offer 
after-hours trading from 4:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. Eastern time, Monday 
through Friday, beginning in November. TD Waterhouse had originally 
agreed to buy a 12.5 percent interest in Island ECN, a rival 
electronic trading system owned by the discount broker Datek Online 
Holdings. Members of the REDIBook consortium include the investment 
firms Charles Schwab, Fidelity Investments, Donaldson Lufkin &AMP;

	Bank Failures Tapping FDIC Fund  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. says bank  
failures this year are expected to generate the insurance fund's 
biggest losses since the regional banking crises of the early 
1990s. Much of the loss was caused by the failure of a big West 
Virginia bank. While the FDIC still has plenty of money to cover 
losses to depositors, the failures bolster recent warnings by 
regulators that some banks may need to tighten their lending 
standards. U.S. Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke, told a 
bankers' group yesterday that regulators see some signs of risk 
spreading in the banking industry despite high earnings and hefty 
assets.

	Sonicbox To 'Unchain' PC Listeners  
</P>
<P>
	MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) -- Sonicbox Inc. announced it will  
begin a trial deployment of its Internet radio tuner, which 
transmits Internet-based audio to standard FM radios. The Sonicbox 
Tuner lets consumers with a high-speed Internet connection listen 
to Internet radio programming anywhere in their home, the company 
said today. The device consists of a small base-unit that connects 
to a PC and a hand-held remote tuner. The base-unit relays Internet 
radio broadcasts to an unused frequency of any FM radio receiver 
within 100 feet. The hand-held remote allows listeners to change 
stations, request more information about a song or make an online 
purchase of a CD.

	Merrill Lynch Profit Beats Forecast  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the largest brokerage firm  
in the United States, reported strong third-quarter earnings of 
$572 million, easily beating analysts' expectations. The company's 
profits represent earnings of $1.34 a share, a nickel more than the 
$1.29 a share analysts had predicted, according to First Call Corp. 
In the third quarter of 1998, Merrill Lynch reported a loss of $173 
million, or 48 cents a share, due to a $430 million pretax 
write-off of costs related to staff reductions. Merrill Lynch 
shares were unchanged at 22 3/16.

	LONDON (AP) -- Jensen, one of the best-known brands in luxury  
British motoring, is set for a rebirth 23 years after Jensen Motors 
Ltd. stopped producing cars because of labor-management strife. But 
unlike its sleek forbear -- the four-seat Interceptor -- the newest 
Jensen will be a sporty two-seater with an aluminum body wrapped 
around a Ford Cobra V-8 engine. 
</P>
<P>
	And by pricing their new S-V8 convertible at about $65,400, the

<HEADLINE> Pets Targeted By Equipment Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- If a dog's gotta work, Murado has it  
about as good as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
	Murado, a Rottweiler-shepherd, is chief tester for Sun Pet Toys,  
the Minnesota company that makes pet toys that flash when they hit 
a hard object and dog toys that glow in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
	Murado knows how to put flash in his work. He opens his mouth  
and picks up the company's hard red Fetch &AMP; Glow ball drops it to 
the floor, setting off the pulsing light inside to bring the toy 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Murado and his Siberian husky partner, Tasha, are employee pets  
that wander the offices of Sun Products Inc. -- parent of Sun Pet 
Toys and Sun Hockey -- ready to test whatever product comes their 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	``These product testers sneak into the sample room and steal the  
Fetch &AMP; Glows,'' said John Gill, founder and president of the 
private company. ``We have a hard time getting them out of there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gill isn't complaining. Since his company expanded from  
street hockey products into the pet toy business in 1996, annual 
revenues have grown to $4 million and pet products last year made 
up 70 percent of gross sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eighteen months ago it was 80 percent hockey. My business has  
gone to the dogs,'' Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was laughing, but it wasn't a joke. Gill's pet toys are sold  
in most major pet store chains throughout the United States, 
including Petco and PetsMart, at Target and on Internet Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which has large ads in several major nationwide pet  
magazines, expects sales to grow between 30 percent and 50 percent 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gill, now 52, was selling commercial real estate in 1989 when he  
began to notice kids inline skating around the lakes in 
Minneapolis. The next step, he thought, should be inline hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a year, Gill was in the street hockey business. He  
developed a puck that floated on three balls for playing on 
pavement and sold 6 million worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in late 1993, Gill introduced the Fire Ball, a street  
hockey ball made of durable plastic surrounding a battery-operated 
light that starts blinking on impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were telling me how much fun they were having with the  
street hockey toy with their dogs,'' Gill said. ``I thought, maybe 
I have something here. Let's submit it to PetsMart and see what 
they say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The giant Phoenix-based chain placed an initial order for 20,000  
of the renamed Fetch &AMP; Glow balls, Gill said. They were introduced 
in PetsMart stores in September 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In a flash, so to speak, Gill's market expanded from the 4  
million people who play inline street hockey to the 58 million U.S. 
households with pets. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 60 million dogs and cats in the United States and  
it's growing at 15 percent a year. The pet market is a $28 
billion-a-year business just in the United States,'' Gill said. The 
toys also are sold in Canada, Japan, Europe and South America. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fetch &AMP; Glow, which comes in two sizes, is the best seller  
among the company's pet toys, with nearly 700,000 sold, Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Pet Toys also makes a version for cats with a yarn tail  
called Pounce &AMP; Glow, a bone that lights up on impact, durable 
glow-in-the-dark balls for dogs that like softer toys and two tough 
rubber toys that hold treats. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices range from around $5 for the small glow-in-the-dark ball  
to $19 for the flashing bone. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the products grew out of the street hockey business,  
durability was never in question, Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew how to build durable hockey pucks so it's obvious I  
knew how to build durable dog toys,'' Gill said. ``When a kid hits 
a hockey puck, it can go 100 miles an hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just to make sure, though, Murado -- a chewer -- stepped in.  
</P>
<P>
	``We found out that he couldn't damage the ball,'' said John  
Kellogg, who lives with the Rottweiler at home and works with him 
at Sun Pet Toys. 
</P>
<P>
	There's just one wrinkle in this success story. The man who  
never played hockey and spends his days dreaming up new ways to 
make dogs happy doesn't own a dog himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to have a dog but my wife won't let me have one,''  
Gill said. ``We have a 4 1/2-year-old daughter and my wife says no dog 
until she's at least 8.''

<HEADLINE> Network Accused of False Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A television network accused of falsely using the  
Texas Department of Public Safety's name to get information from 
registered sex offenders around the state could face federal mail 
fraud and other charges, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Antonio Express-News reported Tuesday that the News of  
Texas, a San Antonio-based TV network with 26 affiliates around the 
state, sent out thousands of postcards last week asking offenders 
to confirm their addresses. The network hoped to reveal that many 
of the state's 18,000 registered sex offenders have given 
authorities fake or outdated addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	DPS spokeswoman Tela Mange said the postcards were deceptive  
because they bore no mark showing they were from a news 
organization and used the agency's name in the return address. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said the postcards exposed offenders to potential  
embarrassment and harassment and eroded the agency's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The network's president, Bob Rogers, said reporter Brian  
Collister, who used ``Texas Department of Public Safety'' in the 
postcards' return address without his editors' permission, was put 
on probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a complete surprise,'' Rogers said. ``He made an error  
in judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, he defended the project, saying it ``was for the  
greater good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The public is better informed than before the story, and we  
are going to stick to that story,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, sex offenders have swamped the DPS with calls  
complaining that the cards, easily read by mail carriers and 
household members, have caused them distress. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mange said the state would have used sealed envelopes if it  
wanted to check on the sex offenders' addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're quite concerned,'' she said. ``We don't want people  
claiming they're us when they are not. It's going to make it much 
more difficult for us when we have to do sex offender 
verification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The news agency faces possible federal charges, including mail  
fraud, impersonating a government official and tampering with 
government records, Ms. Mange said. FBI agents directed calls to 
the U.S. postal inspector for San Antonio, who did not return calls 
to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	But a spokesman for San Antonio's federal prosecutor said the  
case would be considered if the postal inspector found any 
wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Mets Lose Again in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Once again, the Atlanta Braves dealt the New York  
Mets a dose of reality. 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as the Mets fully regained their confidence following a  
seven-game slide started three weeks ago in Atlanta, the Braves 
again left the Mets wondering if they'd ever catch up to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Maddux neutralized New York's offense and Atlanta got  
timely enough hitting to beat the Mets 4-2 Tuesday night in the 
first game of the NL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a pattern that keeps repeating itself for the Mets. They  
came to Turner Field on Sept. 21 one game behind Atlanta and full 
of confidence that they could finally dethrone the Braves in the NL 
East. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, New York was swept in the three-game series and had to  
scramble to even make the postseason by winning a one-game playoff 
with Cincinnati for the wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	After beating Arizona 3-1 in the first round, the Mets once  
again felt like the team that had the best record in the majors for 
2 1/2 months this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels so much different,'' general manager Steve Phillips  
said before the game about the team's attitude. ``It's my sense 
that the guys are much more loose and much more relaxed this 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They might be relaxed, but they still can't hit Braves pitching  
and can't beat Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	New York has been held to three or fewer runs 10 times in 13  
games with Atlanta this year and lost 19 of 25 over the last two 
seasons. Atlanta has won 14 of 15 against the Mets at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the proverbial kid on the block who is maybe trying to  
work out and get stronger and do something different to finally 
beat up the bully,'' Mike Piazza said before the series. 
``Hopefully, this will be that time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza, like the rest of the Mets, couldn't do anything to make  
it any different. Playing with a slightly swollen left thumb that 
kept him out of the final two games against the Diamondbacks, 
Piazza went 0-for-4 and drove in New York's only run with an RBI 
groundout in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Starter Masato Yoshii put New York in a 1-0 hole in the first  
inning, allowing the first three runners to reach. Yoshii settled 
down and kept the Mets in the game after that, but New York could 
never take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshii's failure to get down a squeeze bunt cost the Mets in the  
third inning. With Roger Cedeno on third and one out, manager Bobby 
Valentine called for the squeeze on a 2-0 count. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux's pitch was off the plate outside, and Yoshii bunted  
through it. Cedeno was caught between third and home and the Mets' 
rally was thwarted. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshii eventually grounded out and slammed his bat down as he  
returned to the dugout.

<HEADLINE> Pfizer Must Pay in Trademark Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Pfizer Inc. was ordered Tuesday to pay $143  
million to a British medical electronics company that accused the 
U.S. pharmaceutical company of stealing its name. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. District Court jury awarded the damages to Trovan Ltd.,  
and said Pfizer must change the drug's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Trovan Ltd. sued Pfizer for using the name Trovan for an  
antibiotic introduced in 1998. The drug later was linked to several 
cases of liver failure, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
has restricted its use. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer plans to appeal the original verdict and the damage  
award. ``These jury verdicts are not supported by either the law or 
the facts, and we are confident this decision will not be upheld,'' 
said Paul S. Miller, Pfizer's general counsel and executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Trovan Ltd. and its U.S. distributor, Electronic Identification  
Devices of Santa Barbara, Calif., contended that their reputations 
were damaged by being linked to the antibiotic. 
</P>
<P>
	``A company's reputation is everything,'' said Joseph Masin,  
president of Electronic Identification Devices. ``... With this 
victory, we can continue to grow our company knowing once and for 
all that Trovan is indisputably ours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Privately held Trovan Ltd. manufactures identification tags that  
are implanted with computer chips containing information about 
patients' medical conditions. The tags also are used by researchers 
and hospitals to track blood supplies and by pet owners to track 
their animals in case they become lost or stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	Trovan attorneys said Pfizer introduced its Trovan antibiotic  
last year despite objections from the British company. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict is the second setback for New York-based Pfizer in  
recent weeks. In August, the company announced it was halting 
development of Alond, a potentially lucrative drug designed to 
reduce diabetic nerve damage. Pfizer had similarly high 
expectations for Trovan when it was introduced in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had projected the Trovan antibiotic to generate $370  
million in worldwide sales this year and about $1.3 billion in 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer has said that Trovan has therapeutic advantages and the  
degree of risk associated with the product is not markedly 
different from other antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer shares fell 43 3/4 cents to $39.37 1/2 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- An Egyptian-American scientist won the  
Nobel Prize for chemistry today for demonstrating that a rapid 
laser technique can observe the motion of atoms in a molecule as 
they occur during a chemical reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said Ahmed H. Zewail of  
the California Institute of Technology was being honored for a 
revolution in chemistry through ``his pioneering investigation of 
fundamental chemical reactions, using ultra-short laser flashes, on 
the time scale on which the reactions actually occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours earlier, Dutch scientists Gerardus 't Hooft and Martinus  
J.G. Veltman won the 1999 Nobel Prize for physics for their 
theoretical work on the structure and motion of subatomic 
particles. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy said Zewail's work in the late 1980s led to the  
birth of femtochemistry, the use of high-speed cameras to monitor 
chemical reactions at a scale of femtoseconds, or 0.000000000000001 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have reached the end of the road. No chemical reactions  
take place faster than this,'' the academy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can now see the movements of individual atoms as we imagine  
them. They are no longer invisible,'' the academy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zewail, who holds both U.S. and Egyptian citizenship, has held  
the Linus Pauling chair of chemical physics at Caltech since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The literature prize was awarded Thursday to German novelist  
Guenter Grass. The medicine prize was awarded Monday to Dr. Guenter 
Blobel, 63, a German native and U.S. citizen, who discovered how

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes Lower Trophy Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- The Miami Hurricanes haven't brought  
home any hardware in three years, their longest span without 
winning a title since 1987, when they waited four years to garner 
their second national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	No rings.  
</P>
<P>
	Not even a conference crown.  
</P>
<P>
	But now, after losing three consecutive games for only the  
second time in 15 years, the 24th-ranked Hurricanes (2-3) are 
focusing the remainder of their season on winning the Big East. 
</P>
<P>
	They began the year with five non-conference games, including  
losses to No. 1 Florida State and No. 2 Penn State, and close out 
the season with seven conference games in as many weeks, beginning 
with Temple on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Big East title would be huge,'' junior linebacker Dan Morgan  
said. ``A lot of us on this team haven't won a conference 
championship yet, so it's definitely important. It's a 
steppingstone to being a national championship team. All we have 
left is the Big East, and we can win it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just got to forget about the past and move on. We still  
know we're still a good football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winning the Big East was almost a given when Miami first joined  
the conference in 1991. The Hurricanes won five league titles in 
the first six years, racking up a 31-3 record. Only a 17-14 loss at 
West Virginia in 1993 prevented them from winning six straight 
conference championships. 
</P>
<P>
	But they faltered in 1997, finishing 3-4 in the Big East. They  
followed that with a 5-2 mark a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami is hoping to return to its old form beginning Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's what's left for our season -- win the Big East,'' wide  
receiver Reggie Wayne said. ``I have no rings to show for anything. 
If we can get the Big East ring, we'll have a great bowl to go to, 
and it means the team has accomplished some kind of goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes, who won four national titles from 1983 to 1991,  
had much higher goals to start the season. But four-point losses to 
the Nittany Lions and East Carolina and last week's 31-21 loss to 
Florida State have forced them to lower their expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to bounce back emotionally from the first part of  
the season,'' coach Butch Davis said. ``But I think the kids are 
excited. They see it as a fresh start. We haven't played any 
conference games. We're 0-0, and what's going to become this season 
is what we're going to make out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As badly as the Hurricanes want a title, they're even more  
desperate for a win, which they haven't had since Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're hungry to play well and get a win,'' Davis said.  
``That's where we're at right now. We want to win a game. We can't 
change the outcomes of any of the previous games. We've learned 
from it, and hopefully we'll be a better football team these next 
seven games from some of things that we've learned in the first 
five.''

<HEADLINE> Dutch Scientists Win Physics Nobel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Two Dutch scientists, Gerardus 't Hooft  
and Martinus J.G. Veltman, won the 1999 Nobel Prize for physics 
today for their work on the quantum structure of electroweak 
interactions in physics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their work has given researchers a well-functioning  
theoretical machinery which can be used for, among other things, 
predicting the properties of new particles,'' the Royal Swedish 
Academy of Sciences said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their equations were vital in calculating the mass of the top  
quark, which was observed for the first time in 1995 at the 
Fermilab in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``An important ingredient in the theory 't Hooft and Veltman  
have developed is an as yet undemonstrated particle termed the 
Higgs particle. In the same way as other particles have been 
predicted by theoretical arguments and later demonstrated 
experimentally, researchers are now awaiting direct observation of 
the Higgs particle,'' the academy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Veltman, of Bilthoven, is retired from the University of  
Michigan, and 't Hooft has been a professor at the University of 
Utrecht since 1977. Their association began in 1969 when 't Hooft 
studied with Veltman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nobel Prize for chemistry was to be announced later today.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S.-based scientists won or shared the chemistry prize in nine  
of the previous 10 years, and the physics prize in eight of the 
previous 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The research by last year's winners, which explored the inner  
structure of matter, has had far-reaching implications. Walter Kohn 
of the University of California-Santa Barbara and John Pople of 
Northwestern University were co-winners of the chemistry prize for 
theoretical work on the quantum properties of molecules. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohn, a 75-year-old native of Austria, was cited for development  
of density-functional theory which simplified the mathematical 
description of the bonding between atoms that make up molecules. 
</P>
<P>
	Pople, a 72-year-old British citizen, was cited for developing  
computer techniques to test the chemical structure and details of 
matter. The resulting computer program is used by thousands of 
universities and companies worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The laureates in physics were Robert B. Laughlin of the United  
States, Horst L. Stormer of Germany and Daniel C. Tsui, a U.S. 
citizen born in China. 
</P>
<P>
	They discovered that ordinary electrons acting together in  
strong magnetic fields and very low temperatures can condense into 
new types of composite subatomic particles that function as a 
fluid. 
</P>
<P>
	The literature prize was awarded Thursday to German novelist  
Guenter Grass. The medicine prize was awarded Monday to Dr. Guenter 
Blobel, 63, a German native and U.S. citizen, who discovered how 
proteins find their rightful places in cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The economics prize winner is to be announced Wednesday in  
Stockholm and the peace prize on Friday in Oslo, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	The prizes, worth $960,000, are presented on Dec. 10, the  
anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist 
and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes.

<HEADLINE> Krupp Files Grievance Against Wings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Red Wings defenseman Uwe Krupp, suspended for  
failing to turn over his medical records, has filed a grievance 
against the club over the $12.3 million remaining on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Krupp was suspended without pay in August for failing to turn  
over medical records of back problems that kept him sidelined for 
much of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Krupp, whose injury has put his career in  
jeopardy, last month agreed to release the records but remains 
suspended because the Red Wings found out he may have gone 
dogsledding while recovering from a herniated disc injury. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Krupp complained the persisting pain kept him  
from returning to the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL Players Association spokesman Devin Smith did not  
immediately say when Krupp filed the grievance. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Wings general manager Ken Holland today called the grievance  
expected, said the suspension was justified and suggested the 
player's future with the team remains clouded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what his medical ability to play hockey will  
be,'' Holland said. ``I don't think anyone knows the answer. I 
don't know what his future with the Red Wings will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krupp's attorney George Googasian accused the Wings of simply  
``trying to figure out a way out of the contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the standard NHL contract, a player cannot  
participate in any organized sport without written consent from his 
team. Holland said Krupp did not request or receive permission from 
the Red Wings to race sled dogs when he was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Googasian said it was common knowledge in the Wings'  
organization that Krupp was racing sled dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Krupp signed a four-year contract as a free agent in June 1998  
for $16.4 million. Krupp scored three goals in 22 games last season 
before a herniated disc ended his season in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Krupp was listed as the driver in five races between Jan. 2 and  
Feb. 28, prompting the Red Wings to investigate whether such 
competitions violated terms of Krupp's contract or might have 
exacerbated his condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd been doing it right along,'' Googasian said. The Wings  
``are suggesting this was a surprise to them, which it wasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grievances filed in the NHL generally are heard by an  
arbitrator. No hearing has been scheduled, according to a league 
spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Habibie Choses Wiranto As VP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- President B.J. Habibie chose  
Indonesia's military chief as his vice presidential running mate 
Wednesday, the governing party spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wiranto, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, had  
been Habibie's preference for several months and his selection 
could improve the president's chances of being re-elected by the 
700-member People's Consultative Assembly, which contains 38 seats 
controlled by the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Akbar Tandjung, the chief of Habibie's ruling Golkar Party, said  
that its executive board gave the president the power to nominate 
his own candidate for the deputy post. Wiranto had been one of four 
candidates for the vice presidential position, originally nominated 
by Golkar several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie's Golkar Party decided to support him for a new  
five-year term despite his falling popularity rating and rising 
student protests, senior party officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The consultative assembly will choose the head of state for the  
world's fourth-most populous nation Oct. 20. Habibie is one of 
three contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie on Tuesday said an official farewell to his Cabinet at  
Jakarta's Merdeka Palace in a final meeting before next week's 
vote. In recent days, Habibie has repeatedly said that he was both 
confident of maintaining Golkar's support and of winning the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Golkar officials have their doubts. Their meeting,  
which began on Tuesday, stretched into the early hours of Wednesday 
morning, when they became deadlocked over what to do if Habibie was 
voted out of office. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wanted to try to form a coalition government with smaller  
parties. Others proposed they should be form a formal opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Assembly members, including some from the Golkar Party, have  
publicly criticized Habibie for his handling of the East Timor 
crisis as well as a bank corruption scandal involving his inner 
circle. 
</P>
<P>
	There also is anger over Monday's decision by Indonesia's acting  
attorney general to drop a 15-month corruption investigation of 
former President Suharto, Habibie's onetime mentor and friend. 
Habibie has not commented on the decision, but some accuse him of 
trying to protect his former boss, who like many Indonesians uses 
only one name. 
</P>
<P>
	A faction within Golkar has publicly stated doubts about Habibie  
staying in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, many senior Golkar officials, including party chief  
Akbar Tandjung, said Habibie should remain the party's sole 
candidate for now. That could change after the president makes a 
key ``accountability'' speech to the assembly on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the speech, Habibie must detail his achievements and failings  
during the 16 months since he took over from Suharto, who ruled 
Indonesian for 32 years with Golkar as his party. 
</P>
<P>
	The assembly, Indonesia's highest legislative body, has the  
power to reject the content of the speech. If it does, Habibie 
would have little choice but to withdraw his nomination for the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	That is what many student protesters want him to do.  
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people took to the streets in Jakarta on Tuesday for  
three separate demonstrations -- two criticizing Habibie and another 
in favor of one of his opponents for the presidency, Megawati 
Sukarnoputri. 
</P>
<P>
	In a march on parliament by about 600 students, at least two  
students and two security guards were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	In the contest for the presidency, Habibie also is expected to  
face Abdurrahman Wahid, the head of Indonesia's largest Muslim 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati, whose Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle defeated  
Golkar in a parliamentary election on June 7, is widely considered 
to be the frontrunner.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Wrapped Up in Veto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Disputes over hiring teachers, helping U.S.  
allies and regulating oil and mining companies have prompted 
President Clinton to threaten to veto four spending bills as this 
year's budget fight nears its defining battles. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet recent history and political maneuvering over Social  
Security are combining to complicate the veto fights further. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Clinton and congressional Republicans are separated by  
about $10 billion to $20 billion -- about the same magnitude as most 
end-of-session spending fights since the GOP took over Congress in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's tug-of-war, however, is complicated by the GOP's  
stated refusal to pay for extra spending from the Social Security 
surplus. For decades, both parties have used that as a till to find 
needed billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Having lost their coveted 10-year, $792 billion tax cut to a  
Clinton veto and broken their pledge to heed two-year-old spending 
limits, GOP leaders have made shielding Social Security a badge of 
honor during the runup to next year's congressional elections. If 
that promise holds up -- which many doubt -- it is unclear where the 
money needed for a bipartisan spending compromise would come from. 
</P>
<P>
	Compounding the problem is a sense among many nervous  
Republicans that Clinton bested them in the government shutdowns of 
1995 and 1996 and the budget-balancing and spending deals of 1997 
and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans have been through playing hardball and they got  
beat, and they've been through compromise and they got beat,'' said 
Dan Palazzolo, a University of Richmond political scientist. 
``There's a lot of ambiguity about what the proper step should 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven days into fiscal 2000, Clinton has signed just five of  
the 13 annual spending bills that pay for government operations. 
Three other fiscal 2000 measures -- covering defense, veterans, 
housing, science, agriculture and environment -- seem likely to be 
completed by Congress and signed soon. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves five other bills.  
</P>
<P>
	To keep their price tags at levels Republicans want, GOP leaders  
are considering across-the-board cuts in all 13 bills ranging from 
$3 billion to $8 billion. Lacking support for other ideas, GOP 
leaders say such cuts are fair, but the administration calls the 
plan a meat-ax approach that would hurt needed programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seem to be going from bad idea to worse,'' White House  
spokesman Joe Lockhart said today. ``It is all an effort to avoid 
making tough decisions. The president is going to make sure that 
before members of Congress go home, they sit and make tough 
decisions on this budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has already vetoed the bill covering the District of  
Columbia. GOP leaders say they will remove some items Clinton has 
objected to, covering city council members' salaries and fees paid 
to lawyers suing the schools. But the bill still would prohibit the 
medical use of marijuana and needle distribution to drug addicts, 
and is likely to continue drawing administration objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other bills face veto threats:  
</P>
<P>
	--A $300 billion-plus measure covering the departments of Labor,  
Health and Human Services, and Education. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate version is about the same size as Clinton's request,  
the House roughly $5 billion smaller. Both would cut the $1.4 
billion Clinton wants to continue his seven-year drive to hire 
100,000 extra elementary school teachers, and would give states 
more leeway in using the money. Congress also would provide less 
than Clinton wants for after-school programs, adult literacy, 
preventive health and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--A $35 billion bill for the departments of Commerce, Justice and  
State, $2 billion less than Clinton requested. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress would provide little of the $1.3 billion Clinton sought  
to help communities hire tens of thousands of police officers. 
Instead, the bill would shift resources to school safety and other 
programs. Lawmakers also would provide less than Clinton wants for 
the FBI, civil rights enforcement, high technology assistance to 
companies and back dues owed to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	--A $14 billion measure for the Interior Department, $1 billion  
less than Clinton proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate would provide about one-third of the nearly  
$800 million Clinton wants to buy state and federal park lands 
under his ``lands legacy'' program. Clinton opposes Senate 
provisions that would prevent the government from increasing 
royalties paid by oil companies drilling on federal lands, and 
would ease restrictions on waste dumping by mining firms on public 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
	--A $12.7 billion foreign aid bill, $2 billion less than Clinton  
sought. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide none of the $500 million Clinton  
requested for first payments for Israel and the Palestinians to 
carry out the peace accord negotiated last year at Wye River, Md. 
It also would provide less than he wanted for international debt 
relief, the Peace Corps and efforts to reduce the nuclear threat 
from North Korea and other countries.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Leak Blamed on Operators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's worst-ever nuclear accident was caused more  
by the private operator's failure to follow official regulations 
than lax oversight by the government, a top nuclear official said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaoru Mamiya, director-general of the Science and Technology  
Agency's nuclear safety bureau, said the government relies on the 
companies running nuclear facilities to follow operating rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is impossible for the government to look into every  
detail'' of nuclear operators, Mamiya told reporters. ``So long as 
humans are involved, mistakes are inevitable. So companies must 
have plans to rectify the situation when a mistake does occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sept. 30 accident at a fuel reprocessing plant in Tokaimura,  
70 miles northeast of Tokyo, occurred when three workers skipped 
key security steps when mixing nuclear fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident exposed at least 49 people to radiation, put three  
of them in the hospital, and forced an evacuation of surrounding 
homes. Hundreds of thousands were told to shut their windows and 
stay indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation into the accident has focused on slipshod  
safety practices at the plant, which was run by JCO Co. The company 
reportedly ordered workers to skip crucial procedures to save time. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has also been criticized for failing to uncover  
that JCO had been flouting operating guidelines for years. Prime 
Minister Keizo Obuchi has acknowledged that the government's 
response to the accident was insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mamiya said that the root cause of the accident was JCO's  
failure to follow the rules, even though government officials had 
never inspected JCO's Tokaimura site when the plant was in 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``An accident was unthinkable. We couldn't imagine how a mistake  
could have occurred. So initially, we couldn't understand why there 
was an accident,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mamiya, however, acknowledged that some government rules may  
have to be changed in the aftermath of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Existing nuclear safety regulations have been inadequate. The  
reasons for this should be revealed with investigation. It may be 
that we will have to review the legal framework of nuclear 
regulation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A full report analyzing the causes of the Tokaimura accident  
will be prepared by the commission for nuclear safety set up after 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Mamiya, who is also a member of this commission, said the report  
will outline what measures should be taken to prevent such 
accidents from reoccurring by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency  
was scheduled to start inspecting the uranium processing plant on 
Wednesday and meet with government officials, Mamiya said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident has driven fears about nuclear energy in Japan to  
new heights. A poll published by the Asahi newspaper Monday showed 
that 42 percent of the people oppose further development of nuclear 
power.

<HEADLINE> Actress Dale Evans Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VICTORVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Dale Evans, the western movie star  
and widow of the singing cowboy Roy Rogers, was hospitalized in 
serious condition Tuesday with heart problems and respiratory 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, 86, was listed in serious condition at Loma Linda  
University Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman Jennifer 
Resch-Silvestri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests show she may have suffered a mild heart attack, according  
to her grandson, Dustin Rogers. He said she is feisty and eager to 
leave the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's doing real well,'' he said. ``Her spirits are really  
high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans was admitted to Desert Valley Hospital on Monday and was  
transferred Tuesday to be closer to her cardiologist, Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her illness may have been prompted by a diet change and  
exhaustion from a Lone Pine film festival last weekend, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans starred in 35 movies and a 1950s television series with  
her husband and co-wrote his theme song ``Happy Trails to You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She has also written dozens of inspirational books and hosts a  
cable television talk show on the Trinity Broadcast Network. 
</P>
<P>
	She suffered a stroke in 1996 and a heart attack in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
	Her husband died at the couple's Apple Valley home in 1998 from  
congestive heart failure. He was 86.

<HEADLINE> BMI May Predict C-Section Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A pregnant woman's risk for a Caesarean section  
can now be predicted by determining her body mass index, a ratio of 
weight to height, according to researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowing a patient's BMI would allow an anesthesiologist to  
prepare earlier and more safely for the possibility of an emergency 
Caesarean, said researchers who presented the study Tuesday at the 
annual meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. 
</P>
<P>
	In the general population, a BMI of 30 or more is considered  
obese. No BMI standards have been set for pregnant women, though 
the researchers said those with a BMI of at least 40 at the time of 
delivery are considered at greatest risk for Caesareans. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of 2,500 women who delivered babies at Duke Medical  
Center found that mothers who had C-sections had an average BMI of 
53 at the time of delivery, compared to a BMI of 31 for those who 
had vaginal deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	While the BMI varied greatly, the average weight of patients  
ranged only from 191 pounds for patients that had C-sections to 182 
for those with normal deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Weight is not the best description of obesity. Tall people can  
weigh more than short people without being obese,'' said lead 
researcher Dr. Elizabeth Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowing there was a greater risk would allow an anesthesiologist  
to prepare for an emergency C-section by inserting an epidural 
catheter into the patient's back so regional anesthesia could be 
administered quickly. Regional anesthesia generally is considered 
safer than general anesthesia for obese women, whose airways can 
become obstructed by excess fat tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	Overweight pregnant women are at greater risk of gestational  
diabetes and tend to have larger babies. Fat tissue also can hinder 
the baby's ability to pass through the birth canal, Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that 98 percent of women with a BMI of 60 or  
greater had a C-section, while none of the women with a BMI of 20 
or less had a C-section. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate was 0.3 percent for women with a BMI of 21 to 30, 32  
percent with a BMI of 31 to 40, 78 percent with a BMI of 41 to 50, 
and 94 percent with a BMI of 51 to 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 2,500 deliveries studied, about one-third, or 833, were  
C-sections. 
</P>
<P>
	Body mass index gives obstetricians another tool, though doctors  
already knew that overweight women have more difficult deliveries, 
said Dr. Ron Ramus, who was not involved in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 to 25 percent of U.S. pregnancies end up in Caesarean  
sections, said Ramus, the assistant professor of obstetrics and 
gynecology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramus said that doctors don't recommend dieting for pregnant  
women but those already overweight should be careful not to gain 
even more weight during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	In another study released Tuesday, researchers found that the  
percentage of women getting regional anesthesia during childbirth 
has tripled since 1981 at the nation's busiest hospitals, and 
quadrupled at small and midsize hospitals. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Romanian Women Win Gymnastics Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIANJIN, China (AP) -- Romania narrowly defended its world  
women's gymnastics title today, winning when Russia's Svetlana 
Khorkina fell off the balance beam after performing two of the 
highest-scoring maneuvers of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by newcomers Maria Olaru with 38.749 and Andreea Raducan  
with 38.567, Romania scored a total of 153.527 points to Russia's 
153.209. China was third with 152.423 in a repeat of the finish 
order at the last World Championships in 1997. Ukraine was fourth 
with 152.338, next year's Olympic host Australia was fifth with 
150.932 and the United States sixth with 150.213. 
</P>
<P>
	In Russia's last routine of the day, 1997 individual champion  
Khorkina was in a position to give her team the gold medal with a 
stellar routine. She already had scored the meet's best score so 
far, a 9.825 on the uneven bars, and a 9.800 in the floor 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	But she went off the beam on a back flip and scored just 9.075,  
after Anna Kovaleva had left the Russian team in a perilous 
position by fumbling her balance beam routine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Romanians had started on the balance beam, and also ran into  
trouble, including a fall by 1997 individual silver medalist Simona 
Amanar. 
</P>
<P>
	But they bounced right back in the floor exercises, where their  
lowest score was a 9.700. Amanar scored 9.812 and Raducan, a 
16-year-old who seems to float through her routines, had 9.800. 
</P>
<P>
	The top two finishers of 1997 -- Khorkina and Amanar -- were  
performing at the same time at the end. Amanar closed with a 9.700 
on the uneven bars, and came out ninth among individuals with 
38.155. Khorkina was 11th with 37.956. 
</P>
<P>
	China had two of the top five individuals -- Ling Jie, third with  
38.418 including a 9.787 on the uneven bars, and Liu Xuan, fifth 
with 38.275, including a 9.775 on the bars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans had few mistakes, although Vanessa Atler performed  
a wobbly balance beam routine. But they didn't come up with the 
extra points needed to win a medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Elise Ray led the U.S. team with 38.187, eighth best among  
individuals, and national champion Kristen Maloney stood 14th with 
37.848. Ray's best scores were 9.725's on the bars and the floor 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams in the final were the top six from qualifying rounds  
earlier in the meet. Atler had saved the Americans a place in the 
finals with a 9.762 in the team's final routine, in the floor 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's finals was scheduled for later in the day. Individual  
competition was scheduled to start Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Futures Extend Rally  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures rose 5 percent Tuesday in extending a rally  
from last week's breathtaking price drop, buoyed in part by the 
possibility another tropical storm may be brewing in the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of other energy products also advanced sharply, led by a  
more than 5 percent hike in heating oil as the cold-weather season 
approaches in the Northern Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, coffee futures soared for a second straight  
day on mounting concern over dry weather in Brazilian growing 
regions, and hog futures closed sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearing the end of a season in which several storms have  
battered the southeastern United States, investors in energy 
futures had their eyes on a large tropical wave just south of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices pushed up on speculation that it could turn into a storm  
and endanger the energy-rich Gulf Coast. Most U.S. crude oil is 
imported between Houston and Lake Charles, La., and many natural 
gas and oil developments are based in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the late end of the season, but this has some  
characteristics it could turn into something,'' said Bill O'Grady, 
energy analyst for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. 
``Hurricanes are a big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the heels of a 16 percent drop in prices last week,  
attributed to increased OPEC production, some market watchers had 
been expecting a rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt that at the end of last week things got overdone,''  
said Bob Morris, an analyst for Paine Webber. ``I think the funds 
overdid it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several factors are bullish for crude prices, he said -- the  
North American winter is approaching, U.S. crude inventories are 
still being drawn down and OPEC nations are still largely complying 
with their production cutback agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Fund buying Tuesday was influenced by the release of American  
Petroleum Institute weekly inventory data after the close of 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	API reported a sharp 7.139 million barrel drop in crude oil  
stockpiles to 298.936 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 8. 
Analysts were anticipating the decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, U.S. gasoline stores rose 2.782 million barrels to  
204.506 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	Refinery capacity increased to 93.1 percent from 92.5 percent  
the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil for November delivery rose $1.03 to $22.30 a barrel on  
the New York Mercantile Exchange; November heating oil rose 3.02 
cents to 57.90 cents a gallon; November unleaded gasoline rose 2.74 
cents to 63 cents a gallon; November natural gas rose 10.2 cents to 
$2.927 per million British thermal units. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent crude oil for November delivery rose  
82 cents to $22.05 a barrel on the International Petroleum 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee prices jumped 6 percent on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP;  
Cocoa Exchange after a 7 percent increase the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally is spurred by the continuing dry weather in Brazil,  
where forecasts call for only light rains in some areas in the next 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
	Rainfall is particularly critical for the coffee crop in  
October, when coffee trees flower. Trees can abort their flowers, 
and the developing bean, if subjected to severe weather stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the drought emerged, experts had forecast a bumper crop of  
40 million 60-kilogram bags in 2000-01. 
</P>
<P>
	December coffee closed up 5.60 cents at 96.55 cents per pound.  
</P>
<P>
	On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, lean hogs closed up more  
than 4 percent, regaining losses from the previous day. Speculators 
who were heavily short, or holding large bets that prices will 
fall, bought futures to balance their previous sales, investors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	December lean hogs rose 1.88 cents to 46.75 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Pork bellies also were sharply higher. February frozen bellies  
rose 2.18 cents to 64.20 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Va. Investigates Prison Sex Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- State officials ordered an investigation  
into complaints of widespread sexual abuse by guards at Virginia's 
largest women's prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was ordered Monday, after The Associated Press  
reported that 25 sexual misconduct complaints have been made by 
inmates at Fluvanna Correctional Center for Women during the past 
nine months. In the nine months the prison was open in 1998, nine 
incidents were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Those cases are ``the tip of the iceberg ... in this little  
cesspool (of) seductions,'' inmate Bobinette Fearce told the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	She and others interviewed by the AP said most inmates are  
afraid to report abuse because they fear reprisals from guards. The 
prison near Charlottesville opened in April 1998 and has 900 
inmates and nearly 500 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Inmate complaints typically are investigated by the prison  
system itself. After the AP report was published, State Secretary 
of Public Safety Gary Aronhalt said he was launching his own 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are routine complaints. Sometimes they are made by  
inmates to gain advantage in the correctional center, other times 
they are founded,'' Aronhalt said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said authorities are prepared to invoke a new state law that  
can send a guard to prison for up to five years for having sex with 
an inmate, a law he said was passed ``to put the fear of God'' into 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
	American Civil Liberties Union attorney Donna Lee said she knew  
of no other women's prison with such a high rate of sexual abuse 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a strong indication of a very serious problem,'' she  
said. There are about 140,000 women in U.S. jails and prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Fluvanna correctional officers and a maintenance worker  
have resigned or been fired this year on charges ranging from 
giving gifts to inmates to sexual abuse, Senior Warden Patti Leigh 
Huffman said. Four other employees were disciplined and two 
resigned after allegations were made, she said. Investigations are 
under way in three other cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators concluded that six cases were unfounded, no  
determination could be made in one case, and five were considered 
too minor to investigate. Three 1998 cases resulted in the 
departure of a prison staff member. 
</P>
<P>
	Inmate Yolanda Gross, 44, said three guards have sexually abused  
her at Fluvanna, including one who came to her cell at night and 
another who assaulted her out of view of security cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `There's nothing you can do about it,''' Ms. Gross  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we speak out, other officers agitate you, write you  
tickets. Your job, your school, your visits are taken away from 
you,'' she said. ``We're not animals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inmate Krystle Hill, 21, said she was sexually harassed for  
months by the guard who assaulted Ms. Gross. The guard was fired 
and a grand jury later this month will consider whether to bring 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Huffman said she encourages inmates to come forward. But  
inmate Carol Arnette, 27, said the atmosphere is still sexually 
charged on her cell block, even after she accused one guard of 
sexual misconduct and the guard resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	``After I shower they will stand at my door,'' Ms. Arnette said.  
``It is so humiliating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inmates ``have expressed a pervasive feeling of being trapped  
and helpless when a staff member depended on for protection is the 
one demanding or forcing them into these situations,'' said D. 
Michael Caudill, a court-appointed attorney who provides legal 
counseling to Fluvanna inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if inmates agree to have sex with guards, it is not  
considered consensual by the Department of Corrections, because 
guards have such power over inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights groups say the answer is all-female staff in  
women's prisons. Ms. Huffman said that is impossible because of 
equal employment laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The warden said she welcomed the new state law to help curb  
inmate abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not just talking about losing your job, breaking a  
rule,'' she said. ``We're talking about penitentiary time.''

<HEADLINE> Brokerage Earnings Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three of the largest brokerage firms in the  
United States -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Paine Webber Group Inc., and 
Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette -- benefited from a strong stock market 
to beat analysts expectations for third-quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues generated from trading their own supplies of stocks  
contributed to each of the company's healthy quarterly earnings. In 
comparison, a year ago the entire financial services sector was 
swimming in losses following a huge global stock selloff in the 
wake of the Russian financial crisis. 

</P>
<P>
                         *Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	The largest brokerage firm in the United States reported strong  
third-quarter earnings Tuesday of $572 million, easily beating 
analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's profits represent earnings of $1.34 a share, a  
nickel more than the $1.29 a share analysts had predicted, 
according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third quarter of 1998, Merrill Lynch reported a loss of  
$173 million, or 48 cents a share, due to a $430 million pretax 
write-off of costs related to staff reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch cited record revenues in both global stock  
underwriting and investment banking, which includes mergers and 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Total third-quarter revenues were $5.27 billion, up from $3.85  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investment banking revenues and asset management and portfolio  
service fees set records, and our global debt and equity businesses 
posted solid trading results despite a more difficult 
environment,'' said Merrill Lynch chairman David Komansky. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, Merrill Lynch posted earnings  
of $1.9 billion, or $4.36 a share, up from $900 million, or $2.14 a 
share, in 1998, when taking into account the $430 million loss 
related to layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine month revenues came to $16 billion, compared to $13.5  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Merrill Lynch fell 75 cents to $67 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                         *Paine Webber Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-largest U.S. brokerage firm reported profits of  
$138.2 million, or 86 cents a share, a 67 percent increase over 
last year's third-quarter figures. In 1998, the firm reported $82.9 
million in earnings, or 51 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter revenues were $1.24 billion, versus $1.03 billion  
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had predicted earnings of 83 cents per share.  
</P>
<P>
	For the nine-month period, Paine Webber earned $462 million, or  
$2.88 a share. During the same period in 1998, the company earned 
$333 million, or $2.10 a share. Revenues in the first nine months 
were $5.8 billion, up from $5.5 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Paine Webber fell 68 3/4 cents to $35 in trading on the  
NYSE. 

</P>
<P>
                     *Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette    	
</P>
<P>
	The eighth-largest securities firm saw its profits quadruple in  
the third quarter, to $122.2 million, or 85 cents a share, from 
$25.7 million, or 15 cents a share, a year ago. Revenues jumped 59 
percent to $1.7 billion from $1.1 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had predicted earnings of 76 cents per share.  
</P>
<P>
	In the first nine months of the year, DLJ reported earnings of  
$409.5 million, or $2.84 a share, versus $302.2 million, or $2.18 a 
share in 1998. Nine month revenues were $5 billion versus $4.1 
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of DLJ rose $2.18 3/4 to $42.50 on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> MGM Financier Nabbed in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- U.S. investigators are seeking the  
extradition of financier Giancarlo Parretti, arrested in Italy 
after being named in a federal indictment accusing him of 
defrauding investors of $1.5 billion in a series of Hollywood deals 
that included the 1990 purchase of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. 
</P>
<P>
	An indictment unsealed on Tuesday accuses Parretti of 53 counts  
of fraud, conspiracy and other charges. His former partner, Florio 
Fiorini, also was named. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Lyonnais S.A., the French bank that financed the MGM  
purchase, was identified as an unindicted co-conspirator and has 
agreed to pay $4 million in fines to settle a criminal 
investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank also will refer two corporate officers accused of  
aiding Parretti to French authorities for possible prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, prosecutors have prepared formal extradition  
requests for Parretti and Fiorini that will be hand-carried to 
Italy. Both men are expected to fight extradition, and the process 
could take up to a year, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey B. 
Issacs, lead prosecutor in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Parretti was arrested in Orvieto, about 70 miles north of Rome,  
at the request of U.S. prosecutors, said Assistant U.S. Attorney 
Jeffrey Issacs, the lead prosecutor on the case. Fiorini, 58, was 
arrested in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from Parretti's $1.3 billion purchase of MGM  
and the 1989 purchase of The Cannon Group Inc., an independent film 
company, and other Hollywood transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend that Parretti and Fiorini relied on a  
complex web of falsified financial records and overseas shell 
companies to conceal that they actually were borrowing $1.1 billion 
of the MGM purchase price from Credit Lyonnais. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was portrayed in documents as equity that could be  
used to run the studio. Once they got MGM and Cannon, they left 
creditors unpaid and transferred assets overseas, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an order of magnitude greater in complexity than  
anything we've seen,'' Issacs said. 
</P>
<P>
	MGM, struggling before Parretti took over, was nearly destroyed  
and Credit Lyonnais' losses reached $2 billion. The bank paid $1.5 
billion to reimburse MGM investors and spent about $500 million to 
keep the studio afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Those costs contributed to a bad debt crisis that nearly swamped  
Credit Lyonnais. The state-owned bank lost $3.7 billion between 
1992 and 1994. A state bailout package approved earlier this year 
cost French taxpayers nearly $18 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment accuses Parretti of conspiracy, securities fraud,  
filing false reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
falsifying corporate records, making false statements to auditors, 
money laundering and filing a false tax return. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiorni faces 25 counts of conspiracy, securities fraud, filing  
false reports to the SEC, falsifying corporate records and making 
false statements to auditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Parretti had been in Italy since 1997, when he was convicted of  
perjury and evidence tampering in an MGM-related lawsuit. He fled 
the United States before he could be sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
	Parretti bought MGM in 1990 from Las Vegas billionaire Kirk  
Kerkorian. After he defaulted on a $888 million loan used in the 
purchase, Credit Lyonnais seized the Hollywood studio and removed 
Parretti as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	A court in Paris convicted him of corruption charges and  
sentenced him in absentia to four years in prison. France sought 
Parretti's extradition from the U.S. before he fled. France can't 
remove him from Italy because the extradition agreement between 
France and Italy does not permit the extradition of Italian 
citizens, Issacs said. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Credit Lyonnais maintained that it, too, was a victim  
of Parretti's deceptions. The bank agreed to pay fines after 
evidence emerged that two corporate officers, one at Credit 
Lyonnais and the other at its Netherlands subsidiary, had helped 
Parretti show paper assets that didn't really exist. Those assets 
were then used to gain control of Cannon and MGM. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of the deception, said Issacs, was not to make money  
but gain control of companies. Looted MGM assets were used to 
bolster the books of Parretti's overseas holdings, he said.

<HEADLINE> Texas Death Penalty DA Retiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The district attorney whose office has won more  
death sentences than any other in the nation will not run for 
another term. 
</P>
<P>
	John B. Holmes Jr. said he has not yet made plans for the  
future, but knows he doesn't want to run for his sixth four-year 
term. He was first appointed as Harris County district attorney in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``My daddy had a saying I subscribe to -- that it's time go home  
from a vacation when you're still having fun,'' Holmes said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes, 58, bristles at the suggestion that his office of  
200-plus prosecutors is a capital punishment machine, although 
about one-third of the 461 men and women on Texas' death row come 
from Harris County. Texas leads the nation in executions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prosecutors don't sentence people to death, people do,''  
Holmes said. ``I have never wanted to be known as a guru of the 
death penalty, and it's not fun when it's made to be personal. But 
somebody's got to (prosecute the cases), and whoever does it should 
do it to the best of their ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes' office seeks a death sentence in 12 to 20 cases a year  
and almost always succeeds. In his years as district attorney, his 
office has won more than 200 death penalty cases.

<HEADLINE> Ministers Oppose Lottery With Vigil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- The future of Alabama's children was  
invoked by both Gov. Don Siegelman and gambling opponents in their 
conflicting appeals to voters on the eve of a referendum on a 
statewide lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	In appearances Monday in Alabama's four largest cities, the  
Democratic governor urged voters to approve a constitutional 
amendment permitting a lottery that would fund college 
scholarships, school programs for 4-year-olds and more classroom 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's at stake is Alabama's future,'' Siegelman said, adding  
that the vote represented ``a chance to change education forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lottery opponents, including several members of Christian  
churches, said they also were worried about the future of the 
state's schoolchildren -- if the referendum passes. 
</P>
<P>
	A vote for the lottery is a vote ``against the best advice and  
wisdom of the church,'' said the Rev. Richard K. Thompson, bishop 
for the 30,000 African Methodist Episcopal Church members in 
Alabama and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gambling is addictive. In all the hype for the lottery, nobody  
is talking about those who will become addicted,'' Thompson said. 
``Those who invest the heaviest will be those who can ill afford to 
lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Voters were set to decide the issue today at the polls.  
Siegelman's proposed amendment is one of three statewide amendments 
on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Jim Bennett predicted that about 60 percent  
of Alabama's 2.4 million registered voters would turn out. That 
would surpass the 57 percent in last year's race for governor and 
approach the turnout percentages in presidential election years. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor held news conferences in Huntsville, Birmingham and  
Mobile, while Jim Cooper, chairman of Citizens Against a Legalized 
Lottery, spoke against the lottery in Montgomery, Dothan and 
Mobile. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said the lottery proposal allows the overseers too much  
secrecy and does not require competitive bidding of all contracts, 
a claim lottery supporters dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Gambling opponent Lillian Farmer prayed Monday as part of a  
24-hour prayer vigil in front of the Capitol. ``God is telling us 
we have to stand for something,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman said there wasn't an alternate way to generate $150  
million to pay for the education initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the Alabama Education Lottery there will be no money  
for these programs,'' he said. ``My opponents have no plan B.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Protection of Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to leave a lasting environmental  
legacy, President Clinton will designate as much as two-thirds of 
America's remaining road-free federal forests as permanently 
off-limits to logging, mining and other development. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, already under attack from Western Republican  
lawmakers, is expected to be crafted in a way to make it difficult 
for a future president to reverse, sources who have followed the 
issue said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was to travel to the George Washington National Forest  
in Virginia on Wednesday to announce the executive order, which 
will direct development of a regulation to protect as much as 40 
million acres of government-owned forest, most of it in the Western 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently only about 18 percent of the 192 million acres of  
federal forest is protected as wilderness. About 60 million acres 
are without roads, or sign of commercial or -- in many cases -- even 
recreational activity. Clinton's directive was expected to cover 
isolated forest areas of 5,000 acres or more. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart declined to provide any  
details, saying ``some of the larger issues'' of the proposal were 
still being worked out. Other government sources said the general 
plan has been in place for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The forest initiative is hoped by administration officials to  
provide Clinton a permanent environmental legacy, a yardstick upon 
which his presidency's conservation and environmental record will 
be measured. Earlier this year, Clinton proposed a $1 billion 
``land legacy'' initiative to purchase open spaces, but that 
program has been largely thwarted by Republicans in Congress, who 
refused to fund it. 
</P>
<P>
	The forest protection plan would require no congressional  
action, relying on regulations to be issued by the U.S. Forest 
Service after a detailed environmental review and public comments, 
said government sources, speaking on condition of not being further 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be one of the most significant land conservation  
actions by the United States government in its history,'' said 
Richard Hoppe, a spokesman for the Heritage Forest Campaign, a 
coalition of conservation groups that has waged a campaign to 
protect roadless forest areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly on par with creating the national park system  
or with setting aside the public lands in Alaska,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the action brought a sharp rebuke, even before it was  
formally announced, from some Western Republican members of 
Congress and from the logging industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's trying to be Teddy Roosevelt,'' snapped Rep.  
Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., in whose district Clinton will make his 
announcement. He accused Clinton of playing to voters at the 
expense of preserving healthy forests. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, accused Clinton of ``acting outside  
the law'' and pressing ``an agenda against public use'' that is 
contrary to Congress' intended policy of multiple use of federal 
lands. ``It's an anti-environmental policy,'' said Craig, arguing 
that forest health will be harmed without access. 
</P>
<P>
	Henson Moore, president of the American Forest and Paper  
Association, complained that Clinton's action would arbitrarily 
create millions of acres of new wilderness areas by ``walling off'' 
forests from commercial or recreational uses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very extremist,'' said Moore.  
</P>
<P>
	Specific forest areas to be covered by the regulatory change  
could not be learned Tuesday. Areas earmarked for protection 
probably will spread from the southern Appalachians to the Chugach 
National Forest in Alaska. Most roadless national forests are in 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservation groups have pressed for years to block future  
construction of roads in road-free forests, arguing the roads will 
only lead to logging, mining and other commercial development of 
the pristine forest areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the last uncorrupted enclaves of biological  
diversity, watershed protection, scenic splendor, recreational 
opportunity and spiritual solace we have left'' in the federal 
forests, more than 40 foresters and biologists wrote Clinton this 
year, urging him to act to protect roadless forest areas.

<HEADLINE> Court To Consider Police Searches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to use a Texas  
drug case to decide whether police are conducting a search, and 
must comply with constitutional requirements, when they feel 
someone's luggage to determine if drugs might be inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they will hear an appeal by a man convicted on  
drug charges after an officer felt and squeezed the bag he had put 
in an overhead bin while traveling on a bus. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Dewayne Bond was convicted of conspiracy and possession  
offenses involving the drug methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a passenger on a Greyhound bus stopped at an immigration  
checkpoint in Sierra Blanca, Texas. The bus had traveled from 
California and was enroute to Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Border Patrol agent checked the passengers' immigration  
status, then felt their luggage, including bags in overhead bins 
and under passengers' seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The agent squeezed a canvas bag in the bin over Bond's seat, and  
the shape of a ``brick-like'' object inside led him to suspect it 
contained drugs. When the agent asked Bond if he could open the 
bag, Bond said, ``Go ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agent found, wrapped inside a pair of pants, a brick-like  
object covered in tape. Tests showed it contained methamphetamine. 
Bond admitted he possessed the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond asked a trial judge in October 1997 to rule the drug could  
not be used as evidence, contending that the officer's squeezing of 
his bag amounted to a search that violated the Constitution's 
Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches. 
</P>
<P>
	The amendment generally prohibits searches unless police have  
``probable cause'' to believe they will find evidence of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge ruled against him, and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals upheld that ruling last February. The appeals court said 
Bond gave up any reasonable expectation of privacy in his bag 
because he ``exposed it to the public'' by placing it in the 
luggage bin. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal granted review today, Bond's lawyer said federal  
appeals courts have reached conflicting rulings in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal said squeezing the carry-on bags of bus passengers is  
a ``relatively new tactic in the war on drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Travelers, like Bond, have a legitimate expectation of privacy  
in their personal luggage, an expectation that the Fourth Amendment 
protects,'' his appeal argued. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Bond vs. U.S., 98-9349.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Voters Decide on Lottery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama voters turned out in large  
numbers Tuesday to decide whether to approve the governor's plan 
for a lottery to finance education or to follow church leaders who 
lined up in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The lottery was once almost a sure bet to be approved but came  
under fire from religious groups, who also claimed that a recent 
traffic ticket-fixing scandal showed that Gov. Don Siegelman's 
administration could not be trusted to administer gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman promised that a lottery, modeled after the one in  
Georgia, would generate at least $150 million a year for college 
scholarships, a pre-kindergarten program and computers in schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In a state where spending on public education has traditionally  
lagged near the bottom in national rankings, lottery supporters 
said it would be the only way to improve funding, particularly with 
voters opposed to any new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic governor called it a ``once-in-a-lifetime  
opportunity to change education in Alabama forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Religious leaders said that repealing the state's constitutional  
ban on lotteries is the wrong way to pay for government programs 
and that the state's poorest people would be the biggest losers. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Jim Bennett predicted that possibly 60  
percent of Alabama's 2.4 million registered voters would go to the 
polls, even though no state or national offices were on the ballot 
Tuesday. That would surpass the 57 percent turnout in last year's 
race for governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnout was helped in Birmingham and Montgomery by nonpartisan  
mayoral elections. 
</P>
<P>
	In Birmingham, Alabama's largest city, 14 candidates were trying  
to succeed Richard Arrington, the city's first black mayor and 
dominant political figure for 20 years. William Bell, who is black 
and Arrington's hand-picked successor, was considered the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	In Montgomery, the capital, conservative Mayor Emory Folmar  
faced six opponents in his bid for a seventh term. It was the 
biggest field of challengers since Folmar whipped more than 40 
candidates to be elected the first time in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	After Siegelman used the lottery plan in 1998 to defeat  
Republican Gov. Fob James, it moved through the Legislature quickly 
and with little opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll in late August showed 61 percent were ready to vote for  
the lottery, but later surveys showed that number shrinking after 
ministers began organizing against it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Joe Bob Mizzell, director of Christian ethics for the  
Alabama Baptist Convention, said no issue has united so many 
ministers from differing denominations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even the abortion issue -- the sanctity of human life -- has not  
come as close to bringing denominations together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman pointed out that Alabamians already can play the  
lottery in neighboring Georgia and Florida. Georgia's lottery 
director estimated that Alabamians have spent $446 million on the 
Georgia lottery since it began in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii and Utah are the only states that bar gambling entirely --  
Alabama does have four dog tracks and high-stakes bingo. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-seven states and the District of Columbia run lotteries.  
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina, where Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges ousted a GOP  
incumbent last year with a boost from the lottery issue, will vote 
in November 2000 on whether to have a lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	That state is also embroiled in a debate over video gambling,  
which became legal in 1986 and has become a $2.8 billion industry. 
Voters will decide on Nov. 2 whether to ban video gambling, as 
religious groups want, or secure its legal standing. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Supreme Court heard arguments about the legality of  
the referendum Tuesday. The justices said they would issue a ruling 
Thursday morning.

<HEADLINE> Reynolds Won't Sponsor Young Racers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. is ending  
its sponsorship of the NASCAR Winston Racing Series, saying it 
could violate the national tobacco settlement by allowing 16- and 
17-year-olds to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR's 26-year sponsorship of the series will end after the  
current racing season, but NASCAR said Tuesday the series will 
continue under other sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR said it will continue to sponsor the NASCAR Winston Cup  
Series and the NASCAR Winston West Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The $246 billion settlements reached by tobacco companies with  
the states requires the companies, among other things, to curb 
cigarette advertising and launch smoking-prevention campaigns aimed 
at teen-agers. Cigarette makers also agreed to compensate the 
states for the cost of treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Winston Racing Series is held weekly at nearly 100 paved and  
unpaved tracks nationwide. Teams of hometown competitors get a 
chance to attain local, regional and national recognition and a 
share of a $1.4 million championship fund supported by RJR's 
Winston brand. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR, however, said the series calls into question whether the  
Winston-Salem-based company is complying with ``the letter and the 
spirit'' of the tobacco settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have reached the conclusion ... that the NASCAR Winston  
Racing Series was unlikely to fulfill the requirements of the 
master settlement agreement due to longstanding rules regarding 
driving eligibility,'' Rick Sanders, president of RJR's Sports 
Marketing Enterprises, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said that, in keeping with the tobacco settlement, RJR  
this year implemented a temporary modification of racing 
eligibility rules so drivers under the age of 18 could not earn 
series points-fund awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was decided, however, that making permanent rule changes to  
exclude 16- and 17-year-old drivers from the series, to continue to 
comply with the MSA (settlement), was not in the best interest of 
the sport, which serves as the grassroots program for NASCAR,'' 
Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Deary, vice president of the NASCAR Winston Racing Series,  
pledged NASCAR's continuing support for the Winston Racing Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commitment at NASCAR to continue building our short-track  
program remains as strong as ever,'' he said Tuesday. ``We look 
forward to moving our program to even higher levels, and continue 
building a solid weekly program for competitors, promoters and 
fans.''

<HEADLINE> Philly's Greatest in a Word: Wilt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Wilt Chamberlain's hometown often had to  
love him from a distance. That never diminished his unique hold on 
Philadelphia, the city whose greatest sports treasure can be summed 
up with one word: Wilt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most dominant athlete in any sport in this country in its  
history,'' said Al Meltzer, a longtime Philadelphia sports 
broadcaster. ``Nobody dominated their sport like he dominated 
his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain, who died Tuesday in Los Angeles at 63, easily was  
Philadelphia's greatest and most famous athlete. He was born and 
raised in West Philadelphia and starred at the city's Overbrook 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
	He was respected but elusive in the city where his incredible  
life began, his status enduring even though he came home only 
occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just a loving, caring man who probably was ahead of his  
time in terms of speaking his mind to the media, whereas most 
players just gave the usual answers,'' said Billy Cunningham, 
Chamberlain's teammate with the Sixers for several years in the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain left his hometown in 1955 to attend the University  
of Kansas, then starred for the Philadelphia (and later San 
Francisco) Warriors, 76ers and Los Angeles Lakers. Friends say he 
never lost his roots despite seeking the kind of fame and lifestyle 
that only Hollywood could provide. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his 100-point game with the Philadelphia Warriors  
in 1962, Chamberlain was renting an apartment in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing I remember about the game: Here was a guy who scores  
100 points, and after the game was over, got in a car with three 
New York Knicks players and drove back to New York,'' said Bill 
Campbell, who did the radio play-by-play for the game. ``I always 
thought, `How did a guy who scored all those points against them 
get a ride back with three Knicks?''' 
</P>
<P>
	When Chamberlain did come home, he was always sure to drive past  
his old house on North Salford Street. The old gym in which 
Chamberlain played in high school has fallen into disrepair and is 
no longer used. The current team plays in a newer gym. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he ever lost his roots,'' said Cecil Mosenson,  
his high school coach in 1953-54. ``Wherever he went, he wore the 
Overbrook jacket. His fondest memories, his greatest memories, were 
not all the games he played with the NBA, but the ones he played at 
Overbrook High School.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain, who led Overbrook to three public school  
championships and two all-city titles, visited the school 10 years 
ago and was honored with a plaque which hangs prominently on the 
second floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't hear the kids refer to him a lot,'' said David Ward,  
an assistant football coach who has worked at the school since 
1967. ``He's had little to do with us. He's never shown up. He's 
only come that one time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Phil Jasner, the Philadelphia Daily News reporter who has  
known Chamberlain for years, said Chamberlain was always revered in 
the city because of his accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is he so revered here? For lack of better words, it's a  
homeboy who made the city proud, who changed the way the game is 
played,'' Jasner said. ``He wanted to be known as an athlete, not 
as Goliath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randall Vathis, 47, attended Chamberlain's 100-point game in  
Hershey with his father, Associated Press photographer Paul Vathis, 
for his 10th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a wonderful night,'' Randall Vathis said. ``I'll  
never forget it. One thing I remember thinking is, `This is 
triple-digits.' I had never thought anyone in my life would score 
triple-digits. Nobody -- nobody -- did what this guy did.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar falls broadly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell broadly Tuesday as a slumping  
U.S. stock market raised concerns that foreign investors may find 
U.S. assets less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0758, up  
from $1.0648 late Monday. The dollar also fell to 106.31 Japanese 
yen from 106.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks fell on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones industrials down  
2.2 percent on worries about upcoming earnings reports and a 
declining bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It creates an environment in which investors become  
apprehensive about U.S. assets, particularly if the stock market is 
perceived as not going much higher,'' said Tim Fox, currency 
analyst at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a risk that global investors could start to divest of  
U.S. assets and sell the dollar,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the dollar fell against the yen as traders waited  
to see what the Bank of Japan might do about the rising yen at its 
policy meeting on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some worry that the rising yen may derail Japan's economic  
recovery because a strong yen makes Japanese exports more 
expensive. The Bank of Japan has been under pressure to increase 
the domestic money supply to blunt the Japanese currency's advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4806 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4987, and 1.4746 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4730. The British 
pound rose to $1.6567 from $1.6529. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8179 German 
marks, down from 1.8370; 6.0968 French francs, down from 6.1610; 
and 1,799.67 Italian lire, down from 1,818.61.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Chided for Spurring Yalies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Those old school ties are powerful. But  
President Clinton, a Yale Law School graduate, agreed Tuesday when 
a fellow Yalie predicted that in a certain upcoming endorsement 
Clinton will spurn his alma mater in favor of a rival Ivy League 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Joel Alpert, president of the American Academy of  
Pediatricians, jokingly likened himself to Clinton as he introduced 
the president before a speech to the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``We both hold the title 'president,''' Alpert said. ``We are  
both Yalies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When asked whom you would support for the title next, I  
suspect it would be a Harvardian, maybe a Princetonian,'' Alpert 
continued. ``But for the time being, no more Yalies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore graduated from Harvard in 1969. Clinton  
is already backing Gore as his successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's Democratic challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley,  
graduated from Princeton in 1965. Clinton would presumably back 
Bradley in the general election if Bradley defeated Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	George W. Bush, Texas governor and front-runner for the  
Republican presidential nomination, graduated from Yale in 1968. 
(Alpert apparently forgot that Bush also holds a master's degree 
from Harvard.) 
</P>
<P>
	Alpert did not explain any of this to the audience, but Clinton  
got the inside joke. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's good,'' Clinton said, laughing. Gesturing toward the  
crowd, Clinton added: ``They don't know, but I do.'' Clinton was 
not speaking into a microphone, and his voice could not be heard on 
the loudspeaker system.

<HEADLINE> Experiment Looks at Cat's Eyes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- An unusual experiment that looked at  
life through a cat's eyes may help scientists see into the 
mysteries of human vision. 
</P>
<P>
	The research, conducted by University of California scientists,  
produced a video of what cats see by showing them pictures, 
measuring responses from their brain cells and then translating 
that data back into an image. 
</P>
<P>
	The cats saw a fuzzy but recognizable picture, confirming  
earlier premises about the mechanics of vision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that information in the brain is carried by electrical  
signals, like a Morse code. We want to understand the message, the 
language in the brain,'' said Yang Dan, the Berkeley assistant 
professor of molecular and cell biology who led the team. 
``Eventually we want to understand how the human brain works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her team anesthetized cats, implanted electrodes in their brains  
and then showed them images, including a face and a slow panning 
shot of a forest. They then measured the activity of 177 brain 
cells and recorded their responses to light and dark. Using a 
complicated set of mathematical equations, the data were converted 
back into an image. 
</P>
<P>
	Cats were chosen because of their sharp hunter's eyes and  
because their vision shares similarities with that of humans. They 
were shown black-and-white images because it is believed they can 
see little or no color. 
</P>
<P>
	The team of Ms. Dan, Fei Li and Garrett Stanley, now at Harvard  
University, published its findings in a recent edition of the 
Journal of Neuroscience. 
</P>
<P>
	Though others have used the mathematical decoding technique to  
study the nervous system, the team was the first to provide such a 
detailed view, Ms. Dan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dan said her lab now wants to look into the more complex  
properties of the later stages of the visual system, to find out 
just how the millions of cells in the eyes and the brain capture, 
encode and reassemble images. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibilities are intriguing; neuroscientists might one day  
be able to fashion the kind of vision implants for the blind that 
now are confined to science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Dan cautions that such applications are years -- and a  
huge engineering challenge -- away. ``What we did is a small step 
toward that goal,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Oberdorfer, a scientist at the National Eye Institute, a  
division of the National Institutes of Health that partially funded 
the experiments, called the results ``a nice piece of work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The research also could contribute to the understanding of  
mental disorders such as schizophrenia, which cause the brain to 
``see'' things that aren't there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Studies like this in the visual system give really important  
clues on what the normal codes are like in the brain,'' Oberdorfer 
said. ``If we don't know what the normal codes are, when things 
aren't working properly we'll never be able to figure it out.''

<HEADLINE> Paterno Bars Players From Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Penn State's players say their  
showdown with No. 18 Ohio State is just one more game on the 
schedule. Coach Joe Paterno is treating it a little different. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in recent memory, the Nittany Lions' coach of  
50 years is barring most of his players from talking to reporters 
in the days before Saturday's game at Beaver Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think they need a little time to themselves,'' Paterno  
said Tuesday. ``I think this thing has gotten a little bit 
ridiculous, the amount of time they have had to give up to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his team is swarmed with attention-seekers -- not just  
reporters, but from fans and autograph hounds, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't get away from it. It got to the point where we've  
got to get some control over it. You guys keep forgetting they're 
still college students. LaVar Arrington walks down the street and 
he's besieged by people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You're the first people that would crucify them if they don't  
go to class or they flunk out of school or something happens to 
them. I've got to protect them,'' he said. ``This is just a week I 
felt I had to get a grip on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the three players speaking for the team this week said doing  
interviews isn't a big deal, so there may be more to the ban than 
Paterno worrying about overwhelmed players. 
</P>
<P>
	He could be upset with No. 2 Penn State's lackluster 31-7  
victory over Iowa on Saturday, when the Lions (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten) 
needed a fourth-down stand to stave off a late rally from the 1-4 
Hawkeyes -- even though he said he was pleased with his team's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, probably closer to the point, he could be worried about  
another meeting with the No. 18 Buckeyes, a rivalry that has turned 
spirited in the six years since Penn State joined the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes are 4-2 against the Lions since 1993, beating them  
28-9 last year and embarrassing them 38-7 three years ago. In 1997, 
the No. 1 Lions came from behind to pull out an emotional 31-27 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes have lost two games already this season, but  
Paterno thinks this could be the best team Penn State has played so 
far. The Lions, meanwhile, haven't been entirely convincing in 
going undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
	They needed a blocked field goal with 4 seconds left to defeat  
Pittsburgh and a late miracle to overcome Miami. And they struggled 
to put away Indiana and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Paterno said he thinks they've been worn out.  
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `You guys get caught up in your studies, get some  
sleep.' I think we have been a tired football team. I said, `Get 
some sleep, get away from people,' '' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Derek Fox, a Lions safety from Akron, Ohio, said they're  
treating it like any other week, while in previous seasons, they've 
put Ohio State ``up on a pedestal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a big week. But this year, myself and this whole team,  
we're taking a different approach. Sometimes, we put too much 
emphasis on this game,'' Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckeyes coach John Cooper, facing a third loss, is playing  
different mind games than Paterno. He said Monday that in an even 
match, Ohio State couldn't beat the Lions -- sending his team into a 
lather. 
</P>
<P>
	``John's been in this business a long time,'' Paterno said. ``I  
think John's just trying to get an edge for his team, that's all.''

<HEADLINE> NetAid Logs 2.4M Web Visits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More than 2 million people logged on to the  
World Wide Web to watch Saturday's NetAid concerts held to fight 
poverty, organizers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site logged 2,385,455 visits for the Internet broadcasts  
alone, said Mojgan Khalili, a spokeswoman for Cisco Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Other visitors used the Web site to learn about conditions that  
foster poverty, make donations and volunteer to help. Organizers 
still were tabulating the total number of visits. 
</P>
<P>
	The NetAid concerts in London, Geneva and East Rutherford, N.J.,  
featured the Eurythmics, U2's Bono, Jewel and dozens of other 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsored by the United Nations, Cisco and other Internet  
companies, the concerts aimed to draw attention to the Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Khalili said she knew of no technical problems that  
prevented computer users from accessing the Web site during the 
peak periods Saturday. The site remains operational, and organizers 
hope to get 1 billion visits by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The endeavor proved to be a technological feat. The Web site  
used 1,500 powerful server computers in 90 locations worldwide. 
Engineers designed the site to handle 60 million ``hits'' every 
hour, a figure 10 times higher than peak online visits during the 
last Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Padres President Has Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego Padres president Larry Lucchino is  
recovering from prostate cancer surgery, the team announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 54-year-old Lucchino underwent surgery last Wednesday at  
Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and was released Saturday. Due 
to Monday's Columbus Day holiday, the team delayed making an 
announcement until after the front office staff was notified on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery, performed by Dr. Patrick Walsh, was successful and  
no additional treatments, such as radiation or chemotherapy, are 
required, club spokesman Charles Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is Lucchino's second bout with cancer. He was diagnosed  
with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in September 1985 and underwent 
surgery, as well as rigorous chemotherapy and radiation treatments 
that lasted through 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say the prostate cancer is not related to the earlier  
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucchino still owns a residence in Baltimore, where he was  
president of the Orioles from 1988 until 1993, and will remain 
there for several weeks while recuperating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres are at a critical stage in the development of a  
downtown ballpark that is scheduled to open in 2002. An 
environmental impact report is before the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second ballpark project Lucchino has been involved  
with. He was one of the forces behind the construction of 
Baltimore's Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a little rest and relaxation, and with the aid of the  
technological revolution, I will soon be reinvolved -- for better or 
for worse -- in the ongoing affairs of our club,'' Lucchino said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am as relieved as a friend can be,'' Padres owner John  
Moores said. ``I want him to take his time, rest up, then get back 
to his work of running this organization.''

<HEADLINE> China to US: Ratify Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China on Tuesday urged the United States to  
ratify the nuclear test ban treaty, saying the action would help 
persuade other countries to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratification by the United States, which has carried out more  
tests than any other nuclear power, is key to the future of the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman 
Zhang Qiyue said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. support would ``serve as an example and promote the  
ratification of the treaty by other countries,'' Zhang said in 
response to a question at a media briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	It is up to the U.S. Senate to ratify the treaty. Rejection  
would be a humiliating defeat for President Clinton, the first 
world leader to sign the 1996 pact. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Clinton asked the Senate to put off voting on the  
treaty, warning that its defeat would ``severely harm the national 
security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China, a nuclear power, has yet to ratify the treaty, although a  
senior Chinese arms control negotiator told an international 
conference last week that Beijing would speed up ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	Signed by 154 states, the treaty needs to be ratified by 44  
nuclear states to enter into force. So far 41 of them have signed 
but only 26 have ratified.

<HEADLINE> Engineers Shut Down Arkansas Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A new arena set to open with an  
NBA exhibition game and a capacity crowd of 18,000 was shut down 2 1/2 
hours before tipoff Tuesday after engineers found a crack in a 
beam. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Lakers and Washington Wizards were to christen  
the $80 million Alltel Arena. Fans were making their way toward the 
arena when the building was closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The crack was in a beam supporting an upper level of the arena.  
Engineers suggested the game be canceled so the building's 
integrity could be tested. 
</P>
<P>
	``While visual inspections of all other beams show no evidence  
of additional cracks, it is the opinion of the engineers that it is 
prudent to load test the entire upper area before allowing public 
access to the upper level seats in the arena,'' a statement from 
the Alltel Arena said. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone company paid $7 million to have the riverside  
arena carry its name. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pulaski County board that runs the arena opened the doors  
Oct. 2 to give the public a walk-through but kept visitors off the 
upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
	The crack was discovered three weeks ago; while inspecting a  
diagonal steel beam encased in concrete, engineers found that the 
beam was hung 12 inches too low, making it less able to withstand 
stress, said Willard Reese of Garver Engineers, the principal 
engineer on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews will erect steel plates on either side of the beam --  
underneath Section 210 -- to shore up the building, Reese said at a 
news conference on the floor of the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night's game was to be the arena's first test with a  
packed house. 
</P>
<P>
	Elton John is scheduled for a concert Oct. 29 in an event being  
billed as the arena's official opening. There was no immediate word 
on how long the building would be closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arkansas RiverBlades of the East Coast Hockey League are  
scheduled for their home opener in the arena Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Nabholz Building and Management Corp., the main  
concrete builder at the arena, was declared in default on its $4.78 
million contract. Officials cited shoddy work, failure to meet the 
construction manager's deadlines and failure to pay its own 
suppliers and other contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear if the shutdown was linked to the building's old  
concrete workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the trouble, members of the Pulaski County Multipurpose  
Civic Center Facility Board said they believed new crews could work 
around the problem and vowed to meet their opening date. 
</P>
<P>
	County voters in 1995 approved a one-year 1 percent sales tax.  
That money, combined with a $20 million contribution from the state 
and $17 million from private sources, paid for the construction of 
the 377,000-square-foot arena on the north side of the Arkansas 
River in downtown North Little Rock.

<HEADLINE> Retailers Predict Must-Have Toys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's that time of year again, when parents begin  
their annual search for the ``hot'' toys of the upcoming holiday 
season, and the nation's largest toy retailers are only too happy 
to offer suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	But shoppers be warned -- this list of must-haves wasn't done as  
a public service. While retailers make it their business to predict 
the public's desires, their choices also reflect what they have in 
their inventories and want to push off store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The toy business is all about spin, and this is the retailers'  
spin on what will sell,'' said Eric Johnson, a professor at the 
Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College who follows the toy 
industry. ``But I have to say that out of all the people out there 
picking hot toys, I'd say the retailers have a pretty good chance 
of knowing best what will be hot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Topping the retailers' list is Pokemon and anything tied to the  
Japanese cartoon character, from video games to plush dolls to 
trading cards. 
</P>
<P>
	While the other toys aren't ranked by number, those also  
expected to be popular include WWF and WCW wrestling dolls; Rock &AMP; 
Roll Elmo; Furby; Millennium Barbie; QX-3, an electronic 
microscope; computer-linked Legos and toys based on the movies 
``Toy Story 2'' and ``Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The list represents the latest attempt by the toy industry to  
shape Americans' buying habits during the important holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year as Christmas nears, adults choose toys for their  
children just like they pick trendy clothes and cars for 
themselves, and getting a hot toy becomes a status symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	Toy manufacturers are usually blamed for stirring up a buying  
frenzy, dumping millions of dollars into marketing and advertising. 
In recent years, the hype over Furby and Tickle Me Elmo was 
carefully orchestrated by their makers. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are also many would-be toy experts and toy ``tests''  
run by magazines and local media that add to the must-have 
mentality. Many accept money from manufacturers to promote certain 
products, but never reveal that when releasing their hot toy lists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, traditional television advertising isn't working  
like it used to, so manufacturers are using different methods to 
get their product out there into the public eye,'' said Chris 
Byrne, a toy consultant and contributing editor of Toy Wishes: The 
Ultimate Toy Buying Guide, a new magazine that tracks hot toys. 
``But everyone has the same goal: To sell something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The retailers' survey may have more credibility than others.  
While the merchants have an obvious agenda -- to encourage people to 
spend -- the findings are based on the opinions of more than a dozen 
retailers, including giant Toys R Us, online leader eToys and the 
specialty chain Noodle Kidoodle. 
</P>
<P>
	The retailers were not charged a fee to participate.  
Manufacturers were prohibited from entering products and had no say 
in the survey. That gave smaller toymakers as good a chance to get 
on the list as the companies with fatter marketing budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseeing the survey was the reputable Wall Street analyst Sean  
McGowan, of the investment firm Gerard Klauer &AMP; Mattison, and Jon 
Salisbury, publisher of the online newsletter World Toy News. 
</P>
<P>
	The list will be formally unveiled today at PlayDate '99 in New  
York, a pre-holiday gathering of toymakers and retailers. Retailers 
will be able to post the list in their stores or use it in 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not trying to say what the best toy is for every child,  
That's impossible to do,'' McGowan said. ``This survey is just 
based on what retailers are betting on what will be the 
best-sellers this year, and since they are the ones who really know 
the business, we felt confident in their choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the overall popularity list, other lists were also  
compiled, including the top computer games (led by Activision's 
Quake 3: Arena); video games (led by Nintendo's new Donkey Kong), 
and the toys expected to be top sellers online and at specialty 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate list includes 12 toys that aren't well-known, but are  
seen as possible winners. Included is Rumpus' Harry Hairball, a 
plush cat doll with a selection of fish, birds and fuzzy hairballs 
stuffed down his gullet. 
</P>
<P>
	After the holiday season, McGowan and Salisbury will compare the  
retailers' lists to actual sales figures tallied by The NPD Group, 
a Port Washington, N.Y., market research group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then we will know if we are on target or not,'' McGowan said.

<HEADLINE> O.J. Calls 911 to Help Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- O.J. Simpson frantically called 911 to get help for  
a friend he said was ``loaded out of her mind'' on cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson, 52, placed Sunday's call from the townhouse of his  
26-year-old girlfriend, Christie Prody. A police report said 
Simpson told officers who showed up at the house that he was trying 
to get help for Prody. 
</P>
<P>
	But Simpson told The Associated Press on Tuesday that there had  
been a big misunderstanding. He said he was trying to get help for 
one of Prody's friends, whom he identified only as ``Pinky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the case was closed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is being investigated,'' Detective Rudy Espinosa said.  
``It was written as an informational report and nothing else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here's what happened, according to Simpson:  
</P>
<P>
	Prody called Simpson in Los Angeles, crying and reporting that  
her friend was missing and had last been seen with former Los 
Angeles Dodger baseball star Pedro Guerrero. Simpson called 
Guerrero, who told him the woman had left his home by cab the night 
before and he didn't know where she was. Simpson then decided to 
fly to Miami and help out. 
</P>
<P>
	When he arrived in Miami on Sunday, Simpson said, the woman was  
at Prody's apartment and Prody and some friends were doing ``an 
intervention'' aimed at getting her to a drug rehab, but the woman 
was resisting. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was spaced out,'' Simpson said. ``Next thing I know she's  
in her car. I told them to call the police and get someone here 
before she goes driving ... She was a danger to herself and she 
would have been a danger to others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson called 911 and asked for help. The woman had left by the  
time two police officers arrived, he said. He said the officers 
recognized him, took pictures with him and got autographs. But he 
said there was never any mention of his girlfriend being in 
distress or on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I go to the airport to leave and, lo and behold, here  
comes a TV camera,'' he said. ``I went down there to support my 
friends who were concerned about a missing person and this is what 
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guerrero was charged with cocaine conspiracy in Miami federal  
court Oct. 1. Drug Enforcement Administration agents accused him of 
agreeing to put up the money for a relative to buy cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 911 call, Simpson told the emergency operator: ``This  
girl has spent the last two days doing drugs with him. Me and a 
friend just came over and said, `You're going into a rehab.' She 
got mad, she just got her car and now she's loaded out of her mind 
in her Mustang driving around town. She needs to be stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phone messages seeking comment from Prody and Guerrero were not  
returned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	When officers went to Prody's townhouse, two officers found  
Simpson, who told them he and Prody were having a ``verbal 
dispute,'' the officers' report said. The officers gave Simpson a 
brochure on domestic violence as required by state law in any 
domestic-related incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson was acquitted in 1995 of murdering his ex-wife Nicole  
Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. He later was found 
liable for their deaths in a civil trial and was ordered to pay 
$33.5 million in damages.

<HEADLINE> Tommy Lee Surrenders in N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Former Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee has  
surrendered to authorities on a warrant charging him with trying to 
incite a racially motivated riot during a 1997 concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee was accompanied by his attorney when he surrendered Monday  
to Guilford County sheriff's deputies. He was released on $5,000 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee faces charges of felony rioting and three misdemeanor  
charges of disorderly conduct, assault and inciting a riot. The 
band's bass player, Nikki Sixx, was arrested during a concert in 
Raleigh last month. 
</P>
<P>
	During an October 1997 concert at the Greensboro Coliseum, Sixx  
allegedly directed a racial slur at a black guard and encouraged 
the crowd of 2,500 to attack him. Other guards said Sixx and Lee 
poured a drink onto the guard's head. 
</P>
<P>
	The guard and his employer filed a lawsuit against Sixx and Lee  
last year. That civil trial is scheduled for November.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Playoff Ratings Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mark McGwire's home run total wasn't the only  
number to slip this season. Regular season baseball ratings dropped 
and the playoffs are doing the same. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6.9 combined prime-time playoff rating is down 7 percent  
from last season's 7.4 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's three-game postseason average (7.0) dropped 10 percent  
from the three divisional series games the network televised last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox posted a 6.9 rating, down 3 percent, in five games. Monday  
night's Boston Red Sox clincher over Cleveland in Game 5 posted a 
9.0 rating and a 14 share. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``Monday Night Football,'' which was on opposite the Red  
Sox victory, gained a 10.4 rating, down 38 percent from last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	A network ratings point represents 994,000 households.  
</P>
<P>
	ESPN, which televised eight games this year, saw its rating  
decrease 5 percent to a 3.03. However, that does not include the 
last three games, which were delayed until Wednesday because of 
Columbus Day. 
</P>
<P>
	A ratings point on ESPN represents about 769,000 homes.  
</P>
<P>
	The cable station was hurt by having to televise two 11 p.m. EDT  
New York Mets playoff games at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox's regular season ratings for 18 weeks of Saturday regional  
games posted a 2.9 mark, down 6 percent from a 3.1. The first two 
years of Fox's coverage had a 2.7. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN had a 17 percent drop from a 1.8 cable rating in 1998 to a  
1.5 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball is in the fourth year of a $1.7 billion, five-year  
television deal with Fox, NBC and ESPN.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices gained slightly Tuesday, boosted  
by an increase in U.S. high technology shares and hopes for company 
alliances in oil and telecommunications. The U.S. dollar fell 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 28.63 points,  
or 0.16 percent, to 18,090.81 at the end of the afternoon session 
Tuesday. The index closed down 74.37 points, or 0.41 percent, on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded at 106.28 yen at 5 p.m. (0800 GMT), 1.18 yen  
below its level of 107.46 yen late Friday in Tokyo and also below 
106.68 yen late in New York on Monday. The greenback ranged between 
106.18 yen and 106.95 yen during the day's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo financial markets were closed Monday for a national  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations of alliances in oil, telecommunications and  
financial services boosted stocks in those areas Tuesday. The 
communications sector was the top percentage gainer, rising 5.9 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks were stronger also on hopes for further realignments,  
particularly after Tokai Bank and Asahi Bank formally announced 
their integration on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street action overnight also helped Tokyo shares.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.58 points to close  
Monday at 10,648.18. Spurred by a rise in the semiconductor sector, 
however, the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 29.48 
points to 2,916.05, surpassing its all-time closing high of 
2,887.06, set Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Waning hope that the Bank of Japan will take significant action  
to stem the yen's rise against the dollar, however, tended to rein 
in enthusiasm on the market, traders said. The bank holds a policy 
meeting on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market was solidly supported, with investors buying a wide  
range of sectors,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at Tokyo 
Securities Co. ``But players generally took a wait-and-see stance 
ahead of the BOJ meeting, though we don't expect any policy 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has soared in recent months, and some have been calling  
for the BOJ to increase the domestic money supply to blunt the 
Japanese currency's advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial authorities fret that too steep a rise in the yen  
could derail a budding economic recovery here by reducing demand 
for Japanese goods abroad as a stronger currency makes them more 
expensive. Japan is struggling to emerge from its worst economic 
downturn in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was trading at 113.37 yen in  
mid-afternoon, below 114.68 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 11.97 points, or 0.78 percent, to finish the 
afternoon session at 1,542.80. The TOPIX closed up 5.79 points, or 
0.38 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 693 million shares, down from 781.47 million shares 
Friday. Advancing issues outnumbered retreaters 617 to 595, while 
125 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.7850 percent from Friday's finish of 1.7650 percent. Its price 
fell 0.17 point to 99.26.

<HEADLINE> Billy Bob Thornton: Dern's 'Haven' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Laura Dern of ``Jurassic Park'' fame says her  
relationship with ``Sling Blade'' star Billy Bob Thornton is her 
safe haven. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a friendship that blossomed, and they are now ``very  
committed to each other,'' the 32-year-old actress says in Redbook 
magazine's November edition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like, all of a sudden you look at this person who knows  
you, who you feel safe with, and you say, 'Wow. Wait a minute, I've 
been thinking about sharing my life with someone who really knows 
me and here he is.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Dern said she was hurt by rumors that she and Thornton, 44, were  
involved before his divorce from his fourth wife, who alleged 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said Billy and I were dating when we had just met at a  
Miramax party. I think I said, 'I really liked `Sling Blade,' (for 
which Thornton won a screenwriting Oscar in 1997) and the tabloids 
portrayed it as, 'Honey, I'll meet you in the car.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The two play a couple in Thornton's new comedy ``Daddy and  
Them.''

<HEADLINE> Eagles Sign Receiver Van Dyke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles added experience to  
their receiving corps Tuesday, signing Alex Van Dyke to a two-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Dyke, 25, played three seasons with the New York Jets, where  
he had 25 catches for 211 yards and three touchdowns before being 
traded to Pittsburgh in March. He was released by the Steelers 
during the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	He has also returned 21 kickoffs for 427 yards over his career.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to contributing in whatever way they want  
me to, whether it's on offense, special teams, whatever,'' said Van 
Dyke, who compiled 1,854 receiving yards while at the University of 
Nevada in 1995, an NCAA Division I-A season record. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Van Dyke on the 53-man roster, the Eagles  
waived wideout Brian Finneran, who had two catches for 21 yards in 
limited action this season.

<HEADLINE> Tricon Restaurants Post Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Tricon Global Restaurants Inc. reported a  
21 percent increase in third-quarter earnings Tuesday, as strong 
sales at Pizza Hut offset a sluggish performance by its taco and 
chicken brands. 
</P>
<P>
	The fast-food giant had earnings from operations of $112  
million, or 70 cents per share for the quarter ended Sept. 4. That 
compares with operating earnings of $91 million, or 58 cents per 
share in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat analysts' expectations by a penny a share,  
according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're on track for an outstanding year,'' said Tricon Chairman  
and CEO Andrall Pearson. 
</P>
<P>
	Pizza Hut's same-store U.S. sales rose 6 percent, marking the  
ninth consecutive quarter of strong growth. Meanwhile same-store 
sales dropped 3 percent at Taco Bell and 2 percent at KFC. 
</P>
<P>
	Tricon also credited strong overseas sales for its higher  
earnings for the most recent quarter. Operating profits in the 
international business exceeded 40 percent, more than doubling the 
showing a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pizza Hut has been the major bright spot of the company the  
last six months,'' said Damon Brundage, restaurant analyst at J.P. 
Morgan. ``The Big New Yorker (pizza) has been a very, very 
successful new product launch, and they've done a good job 
marketing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Louisville-based company reported net income of $197 million  
for the quarter, reflecting gains from accounting changes and other 
unusual items, up sharply from $128 million from the same period 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it sold more than 500 stores to franchisees  
during the third quarter, bringing the year's total to more than 
1,100 stores sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Year to date, operating earnings have increased 46 percent to  
$290 million, or $1.80 per share, from $199 million, or $1.28 per 
share for the first nine months of 1998, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tricon touted its new line of KFC chicken sandwiches and The  
Chalupa, a fried version of Taco Bell's Gordita, as products that 
could give the two chains a fourth-quarter boost. The company said 
the chicken sandwiches could contribute $100,000 to $200,000 to 
each KFC store's annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Brundage said analysts will keep close tabs on how the new  
products are faring with consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the summer went on, Taco Bell and KFC sales continued to  
soften,'' he said. ``I think the bet management is making is that 
these new products are going to move the needle and get people back 
in the stores. Right now, we don't have any idea if that is 
happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tricon's stock closed down 25 cents, at $41.81 1/4, Tuesday on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> West Has Fond Memories of Wilt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jerry West remembers how pleased he was when  
he learned Wilt Chamberlain was joining the Los Angeles Lakers. 
Then, he picked up a newspaper and was sick to his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	The story in the paper said West didn't want Chamberlain as a  
teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't know where the story came from, but ``it was the most  
ridiculous thing I've ever read in my life,'' West said Tuesday 
after learning of Chamberlain's death. 
</P>
<P>
	To the contrary, he said, it was a momentous day, because ``we  
had one of the true, great centers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, close but never champions during West's first 11  
years with the team, acquired Chamberlain from the Philadelphia 
76ers on July 9, 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	The title both yearned for finally came four years later,  
capping a season in which the Lakers won an NBA-record 33 straight 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The frustration of playing here and not being able to win a  
championship had really left me pretty bitter as a player,'' West 
said. ``That was the only thing that mattered to me after a while. 
I was obsessed with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I started to play with him, he helped make me a better  
player. We seemed to have a real good feel together. All players 
are generally judged by the number of championships they won. 
Unfortunately, he only won two. Nevertheless, his greatness as a 
basketball player can't be questioned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Hall of Famers would retire at the end of the 1972-73  
season. Chamberlain became coach of the San Diego Conquistadores 
for a year before turning to business and entertainment. West has 
been a Lakers executive for nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things when you got to know him a little bit is he  
had a very strong opinion about everything, a very strong opinion 
about himself as a player,'' West said. ``I think all of us who 
played with him realize the tremendous impact he had. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would run into him from time to time; he was one of those  
guys who was a nomad. One of the things I admired about him, you 
see the players of today, they have the entourages, he was the 
common man. He had no problem going places, no problem being 
recognized as Wilt Chamberlain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West recalled being on a team flight to St. Louis on March 2,  
1962, and the subject was Chamberlain, then a 25-year-old member of 
the Philadelphia Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were talking about Wilt, how he was going to score 100  
points in a game real soon,'' West recalled. ``When we got off the 
airplane, somebody said, `Hey, did you hear about Wilt Chamberlain? 
He scored 100 points in a game.' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one record that will never be broken, I can assure  
you.''

<HEADLINE> Downtown Sydney Hit by Power Outage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Power was cut to parts of Australia's  
largest city today, temporarily shutting down office towers, 
switching off traffic lights and trapping people in elevators 
across downtown Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Power company Energy Australia said an explosion caused by a  
fire at a substation in St. Peters, a suburb south of the central 
business district, severed a cable supplying power to downtown and 
several city areas, including at least one venue to next year's 
Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said initially that rerouting power to the  
city through other cables could take up to two hours. However, 
power to at least some parts was restored after about 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Australia's general manager, Paul Broad, said he could  
not guarantee a similar outage would not happen during next year's 
Olympics, but said the electric system would be updated by then. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Olympics will be different, say, for (Olympic venue)  
Darling Harbor, because there will be backup generation there,'' 
Broad told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be two sources of supply as well as that backup,''  
he said. ``It will be the same story at most Games sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Traffic Control Center for Sydney said it had lost  
power to more than 50 traffic lights, causing a brief period of 
chaos on the metropolis' clogged streets. There were no reports of 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency authorities said dozens of office workers were trapped  
in elevators. No one was reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
	All over downtown, workers from office towers took the stairs to  
evacuate from buildings where computers, air conditioners and other 
electrical appliances shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	Some areas appeared to escape the outage. Many switched to  
backup supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's central bank and stock exchange apparently were  
unaffected, but some commercial banks lost power. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Aubert, Energy Australia's media manager, said the utility  
had received no reports of hospitals losing power, and said they 
often had emergency back-up systems.

<HEADLINE> Alabama's Alexander Eyes Heisman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- If Shaun Alexander had his way, playing  
in the Southeastern Conference would count heavily in voting for 
the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	If that's the case, Alexander has an edge over Georgia Tech's  
Joe Hamilton, at least in the Alabama running back's mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're one of the best players in the SEC, you've got to  
have a shot,'' Alexander said Monday. ``If I do something good and 
Joe does something good in the ACC, I've got to have the advantage 
because I think the SEC is more dominant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing that's really important, though, is the numbers.  
So far, Alexander has put up enough of them to find himself thick 
in the Heisman race. 
</P>
<P>
	Once considered a long shot for college football's most coveted  
award, Alexander is suddenly very much in the picture thanks to a 
four-touchdown performance two weeks ago against Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the 11th-ranked Crimson Tide (4-1) were off last  
week, Alexander's name was heard a lot more often when candidates 
were discussed on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Not bad, considering Alexander wasn't much of a factor  
Heisman-wise before the season started -- despite the campaign 
Crimson Tide officials launched for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama has never before touted a player for an award because  
former coach Bear Bryant didn't believe in it. Because of that, the 
highest an Alabama player has ever finished in the voting was 
third, David Palmer in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Alexander chose to return to school for his senior  
season, coach Mike DuBose promised to help him win the Heisman. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose has done his part by giving Alexander the ball at least  
30 times a game. And the school has created an Alexander Web site 
and sent out a CD-ROM of his performance highlights to Heisman 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	They left the rest up to Alexander.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Heisman campaign is more of a `Hey, look over here  
at what they've got,''' Alexander said. ``If I continue to play 
well and we continue to win, it should take care of itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he's living up to his end.  
</P>
<P>
	Alexander leads the nation in scoring and is second in  
all-purpose yardage behind Stanford receiver Troy Walters. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a string of five straight 100-yard rushing efforts, one  
shy of matching the Alabama record, and needs just 519 yards to 
pass Bobby Humphrey as Alabama's career rushing leader with 3,420 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	But his best work came in nationally televised wins over  
Arkansas and Florida. Against Arkansas, he ran for 165 yards and a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The next week against Florida, he scored three rushing  
touchdowns, one receiving touchdown and had 200 all-purpose yards.

	Alexander was even impressive in a 29-28 upset loss to Louisiana  
Tech when he ran for 173 yards and two touchdowns. He scored a 
third TD on a 76-yard kickoff return -- the only time he has 
returned a kick all year.

	DuBose, who had his first chance this season to sit back and  
watch some games on Saturday, said he has yet to find a player 
better than Alexander.

	``I don't see anyone that is doing as much on and off the field  
than Shaun does,'' DuBose said. ``He's outstanding in all phases of 
the offense. His presence alone makes the 10 guys around him 
better.''

<P>
	Alexander will get a chance to showcase himself even more over  
the next two weeks when Alabama plays at No. 22 Mississippi, then 
plays host to No. 6 Tennessee. Both games will be nationally

<HEADLINE>  Russia Targets Chechen Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces pounded Chechen positions  
with an artillery barrage on several fronts today, and Russian 
authorities said they suspect Chechen militants will soon try to 
launch terrorist attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Russians and the Chechens have been fortifying fixed  
positions in recent days, but neither side has launched any major 
offensives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians have been relying mostly on their big artillery  
guns. They were hammering two areas north of Chechnya's capital, 
Grozny, this morning. The echo of the exploding shells could be 
heard throughout the city. The Russians were also methodically 
shelling near the western town of Bamut, which has been under 
attack for several days. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian Defense Ministry cited five regions in central,  
eastern and western Chechnya that were hit in artillery and air 
raids in the previous 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The shelling was the latest development in a conflict that began  
this summer, when Chechnya-based Islamic militants invaded 
neighboring Dagestan twice with the aim of setting up an Islamic 
state. They also are suspected in four Russian apartment bombings 
in September that killed about 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia responded to the attacks by sending troops into Chechnya  
two weeks ago, raising fears of another all-out war there. During 
the first conflict in 1994-96, Chechnya fought Russian troops to a 
humiliating standstill. It won effective independence for itself, 
but was left devastated and lawless. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said today that the  
Russian aim of establishing a security zone in Chechnya ``is close 
to completion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The ultimate objective is not only to form the security zone,  
but to destroy armed gangs,'' he said while on a visit to Ukraine, 
Russian news agencies reported. Government forces ``will not stop, 
but will carry on tasks to eliminate gangs and terrorist groups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Russian troops have held off mounting a ground attack  
on the capital, Russia has shown little inclination to negotiate an 
end to the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the front line is largely defined by the Terek River,  
which flows across the northern third of Chechnya, forming a 
natural defense barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians control the sparsely populated plains to the north  
of the river, though the Chechens still hold a few positions. The 
Chechens have most of the territory in the more heavily populated 
regions south of the river, though the Russians have made inroads 
in western Chechnya and have been massing forces along Chechnya's 
eastern border. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Ministry said that two of Chechnya's most prominent  
warlords, Salman Raduyev and Shamil Basayev, were both planning 
terrorist attacks inside Russia. Raduyev intended to target Russian 
nuclear facilities, while Basayev was training women militants to 
carry out attacks in southern Russia, the ministry claimed, without 
citing any evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 155,000 Chechens have fled since the fighting began,  
with most heading to Ingushetia, an impoverished region on 
Chechnya's western border. 
</P>
<P>
	Humanitarian aid has been slow in arriving, and the United  
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Moscow said the next 
convoy of assistance was being delayed due to ``the very slow 
distribution of aid already delivered,'' the Interfax news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Emergency Situations Ministry said it was flying 52 tons of  
baby food, canned meat, sugar and other supplies into the region on 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Billy Davis Jr. Marks Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As they celebrated their 30th year of  
marriage, Grammy-winning couple Billy Davis Jr. and Marilyn McCoo 
were quietly agonizing. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, the 61-year-old Davis learned he had prostate cancer.  
</P>
<P>
	``That was the hardest part, just hearing those dreaded words:  
You have cancer,'' Davis said Monday. ``Your immediate reaction is, 
'This is a death sentence.' But it's not, and I think it's 
important that other men realize that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His prostate was removed in August, shortly after the couple  
celebrated their anniversary. Davis said the cancer had not spread 
beyond the prostate, and he opted for surgery over radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	When he awoke in the recovery room, Davis was concerned about  
one thing -- his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was worried that no one had told her I was fine, and I asked  
for her. After 30 years, it was like asking for my right arm,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple met as members of the multiple Grammy-winning group  
The Fifth Dimension in 1965. They left the band to record together, 
winning a Grammy in 1976 for ``You Don't Have to be a Star (To Be 
in My Show).''

<HEADLINE> Norris-Tyson Bout Is 10 Rounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- No one bothered telling Orlin Norris that his  
fight with Mike Tyson is no longer scheduled for 12 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's because not many people think Norris will be around  
long enough for it to matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would think they would give us the common courtesy of  
notifying us,'' Norris' manager, Scott Woodworth, said Tuesday. 
``It gives me a signal that Orlin Norris is being treated like a 
preliminary guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest fight of Norris' 14-year pro career was changed from  
a 12-round fight for an obscure heavyweight title to a 10-rounder 
after Norris had already signed for the bout. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris has been training in the mountains of Southern California  
for a 12-rounder, but will now have to get his work done in 10 
rounds or less. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't really make a difference to me,'' the veteran  
fighter said. ``I know I signed a contract for a 12-round fight. 
And it was never told to me or my people it was changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norris is getting $800,000 to meet Tyson Oct. 23 at the MGM  
Grand after being handpicked by Tyson's management as a fighter 
they hope will give Tyson some badly needed rounds in the ring but 
not too much trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	That is a mistake, Norris warned Tuesday, in a fight that is the  
chance of a lifetime for the journeyman. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is this is a fight I've always wanted,'' Norris said.  
``We're both the same height. One's a boxer, the other's a puncher. 
I always thought it would be a very good fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oddsmakers don't share that belief, making Norris a 12-1  
underdog against Tyson, who will be fighting for the first time 
since Francois Botha made him look rusty and awkward before getting 
knocked out by a single punch in the fifth round of their Jan. 16 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Since that time, Tyson served a jail term in Maryland for  
assaulting two motorists and is now embarking on yet another 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	During that same time, Norris waited, hoping he would get the  
nod as Tyson's opponent, 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting back praying it was me they would pick,'' Norris  
said. ``I was hoping they would make that mistake and say we want 
Orlin Norris.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Tyson's advisers view Norris as safe because he lacks  
punching power, Norris (50-5) says he will box Tyson and hope to 
frustrate him in the later rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm coming to win this fight,'' he said. ``There's really no  
need for me to be afraid or be intimidated. I know what is in front 
of me. It's not a mystery.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Porcelain Shares Returned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A court ruling ordering private investors to  
return to the state their shares in the renowned Lomonosov 
Porcelain Factory has riled Russia's stock market regulator, who 
said it will hurt efforts to promote foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Petersburg factory, which was founded in 1744 by a  
daughter of Peter the Great, is one of Russia's best-known 
manufacturers of luxury goods and was a longtime maker of fine 
china for the czars. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was the first of its kind since wholesale  
privatization of state property began in 1992 and could provide 
additional reasons for investors, already skittish about the 
country's unstable business climate, to shun Russian ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Major shareholders affected by the court ruling are several  
executives from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co., a 
multibillion-dollar U.S. investment firm, and the United 
States-Russia Investment Fund, a U.S. government investment program 
aimed at providing assistance for Russia's stumbling economy. They 
said an appeal is planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Lomonosov produces fine china tea sets and dishes, some  
hand-painted and gilded with precious metals. Homemakers in Russia 
speak lovingly of Lomonosov products, which still sell briskly 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	After the collapse of the Soviet Union, foreign investors bought  
about 60 percent of the shares in Lomonosov, which had sales of 
about $7 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-Russia fund paid about $4.25 million for its 25-percent  
stake in Lomonosov. 
</P>
<P>
	But factory directors have said they chafed at foreigners  
controlling a Russian national treasure. A suit was filed by the 
State Property Committee and a St. Petersburg court ruled Monday 
that the 1993 privatization was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruling was viewed by regulators as a setback for  
development. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia needs foreign investment to overhaul crumbling factories  
and infrastructure, but only a relatively small number of investors 
have risked putting money into this country's chaotic economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``From our point of view, this precedent taken by the State  
Property Ministry of Russia deprives existing shareholders and 
investors of the confidence that the state protects them, and calls 
into doubt their ownership rights to shares and bonds in any 
Russian enterprises formed as a result of privatization,'' said 
Dmitry Vasiliyev, chairman of Russia's Federal Securities 
Commission in a public letter to State Property Minister Farit 
Gazizullin. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-Russia fund and executives of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  
together hold more than half of the Lomonosov shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Pending the appeal, they plan to call a shareholders' meeting in  
an attempt to take control of the board and oust top management. 
</P>
<P>
	Alistair Stobie, vice president of the fund, told a news  
conference Tuesday that investors have long wanted to remove a 
management team left over from Soviet times and to overhaul the 
factory. 
</P>
<P>
	In a few previous cases, courts have confiscated shares in  
privatized enterprises when new owners have failed to keep promises 
to invest in their property. But Monday's ruling marked the first 
reversal of a privatization where workers had received shares in a 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign investors later purchased the shares in Lomonosov on the  
secondary market from a broker. Courts have not questioned the 
legality of this type of a purchase.

<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- It's 79 days and counting till the clock  
strikes 2000, and for all the predictions of a party for the ages, 
there's still plenty of room at the inn. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotel rooms, though pricey, are still available at such New  
Year's carousing headquarters as Times Square, New Orleans and the 
Disney parks in Orlando, Fla., and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabins remain open for millennium ocean cruises. Revelers still  
can line up a limo in Las Vegas or a baby sitter in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Many travelers may be in a holding pattern, hoping exorbitant  
hotel prices will drop as the new year approaches. Some fear to 
travel because of possible problems from the Y2K bug, in which some 
computers may fail to recognize the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Others want to spend New Year's quietly with family and friends.  
And some have a sense of millennium malaise, viewing the year 2000 
as just another flip of a calendar page. 
</P>
<P>
	``All this stuff about Y2K, I'm sick of hearing about it. And  
everything about how the world's going to end,'' Mike Mumbower of 
Seattle said during a vacation to Disneyland in Anaheim. He plans 
to stay home Dec. 31. ``We're just indifferent. It's kind of like, 
who cares?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``New Year's is overrated, even this one,'' said Tanya Hotovek  
of San Francisco, who also plans to be at home. ``It turns 
midnight, it's all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surveys by Travel Weekly, a trade publication, and the Travel  
Industry Association found about four-fifths of Americans do not 
plan to travel this New Year's. In the Travel Weekly survey, 43 
percent of respondents who do not plan trips said the millennium 
meant nothing to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think the Earth is ending, but it's going to come and  
go real quick,'' said Chris Gibson of Paramus, N.J., who plans to 
jam with some musician friends on New Year's Eve. ``The next day 
it'll be back to the same thing as any other year. Trying to 
remember to write 2000 instead of 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one's calling New Year's a bust. But expectations of a  
book-early mentality among millennium revelers have faded. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was maybe an attitude of get your champagne now because  
you won't get any later,'' said Beverly Gianna of the New Orleans 
Metropolitan Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``But reality has set 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reality is that travelers are not making millennium plans much  
faster than for a typical New Year's. Some people planning big 
blowouts booked early, while others simply remain undecided about 
what they'll be doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can afford to be on the Concorde flying around the  
International Date Line, you've booked that already,'' said Erik 
Elvejord, a spokesman for Holland America cruise line. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the more down-to-earth millennium jaunts, a weekend around  
Disneyland or a ski trip to Aspen, Colo., that have not filled up 
as quickly as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	In Aspen, millennium hotel bookings are down 9 percent from  
where they were at this time for last New Year's Eve. Nearly 
two-thirds of the 40 rooms at the Boomerang Lodge are available, 
said owner Charles Paterson. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans' hotel rooms are up to 70 percent booked for this  
New Year's. At the Omni Royal Orleans, 40 percent of the 362 rooms 
and suites remain available. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are still shopping,'' Omni Royal Orleans  
general manager Steve Ferran said. ``We're hoping the shopping will 
end soon and the buying will start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Year's bookings are running a bit faster than usual at the  
Millennium Broadway hotel in Manhattan, though about 40 percent of 
the 752 rooms are still available, even a few overlooking Times 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Rooms typically costing $400 a night there are going for $550 to  
$600 with a three-day minimum stay. While the hotel expects to be 
fully booked, the Millennium might relax prices or minimum-stay 
requirements if the rooms do not fill up closer to New Year's, said 
Michael Littler, the hotel's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were surprised 12 months ago that there was space  
available,'' Littler said. ``Consumers made that assumption that 
people booked everything a year to two years out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of cabins remain available on some of the voyages  
Princess and Holland America cruise lines are running over New 
Year's. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who work for New York City's Baby Sitters Guild have not  
been completely hired out for New Year's Eve yet -- although they 
still expect to be, said associate director Maria Davalos. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambassador Limousine in Las Vegas still has 15 of its 35  
vehicles available for New Year's Eve, but general manager Jay 
Tolentino is not worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I can fill up the cars,'' Tolentino said. ``Vegas is  
such a last-minute town, people will go, `I'm showing up this 
weekend. Let's go there for the millennium.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Staying put, though, will be a favorite choice for many  
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't booked any of those $600 rooms,'' said Sue Ahlgren  
of Charger Travel Service in Dassel, Minn. ``We are a small agency 
in a small town in the middle of Minnesota. Our people are staying 
home with family and friends. They're not going to pay those 
rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ahlgren herself is spending New Year's Eve on the family farm.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have to milk cows at 4:30 in the morning on New Year's  
Day,'' she noted.

<HEADLINE> JonBenet Grand Jury Meets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- A grand jury investigating the JonBenet  
Ramsey slaying met for nearly seven hours Tuesday before recessing 
with plans to return to work Wednesday as speculation mounted that 
a decision soon would be made. 
</P>
<P>
	When the grand jurors finished for the day, they were escorted  
to their cars by armed sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The grand jury will return for more work tomorrow,'' said  
Suzanne Laurion, a spokeswoman for District Attorney Alex Hunter. 
She declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff's deputies were part of a stepped-up effort to keep  
the growing number of reporters and cameramen away from the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials erected ``Media Free Zone'' signs in the  
courtyard of the Boulder County Justice Center, barring reporters 
from areas where they once stood to videotape the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter avoided reporters so he could focus on the case, Ms.  
Laurion said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he wants to play it real close to the vest ... and I  
think he wants to not be distracted,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter fueled speculation last week by telling reporters to stay  
by their phones over the weekend, implying the jury's work was 
nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, which has met for about 13 months, has heard from  
friends, family members and police officers. It can issue an 
indictment, issue a report or disband without comment. Its term 
will expire Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter has said he could continue the investigation without the  
grand jury's help. Under a state law, a prosecutor can file charges 
directly if he believes there is enough evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet's body was found beaten and strangled in the basement  
of her parents' home Dec. 26, 1996. Police have said her parents, 
John and Patsy Ramsey, remain under an ``umbrella of suspicion.'' 
The Ramseys have steadfastly maintained their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Forensic expert Henry Lee, who has advised police in the Ramsey  
case, speculated that the grand jury would issue a decision by 
Wednesday. But Lee said in an interview on ABC's ``Good Morning 
America'' that he couldn't predict whether jurors will hand up an 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case has some inherent issues and problems,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lee, Connecticut's public safety commissioner who is perhaps  
best known for his work for the O.J. Simpson and William Kennedy 
Smith defense teams, met with Hunter over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more likely today or tomorrow there's some decision,''  
Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury has been meeting since September 1998, but took  
about four months off before resuming work last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter turned to the grand jury after the case bogged down in  
wrangling over accusations the investigation was bungled by 
authorities, who allowed Ramsey, a millionaire businessman, to 
search the house for evidence.

<HEADLINE> Women Want Pain Relief During Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- In about two weeks, Wendy McGahey is due to have  
her third child. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the first time, she'll go to the hospital knowing what  
to expect -- a relatively pain-free delivery, thanks to anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Mrs. McGahey, more women are opting for pain relief during  
labor and delivery. Doctors say they have refined painkilling 
techniques, and women are feeling less pressure from society to 
tough out the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the University of Colorado School of Medicine  
found that in large hospitals, the use of regional anesthesia -- 
epidurals and other spinal techniques -- tripled from 22 percent in 
1981 to 66 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McGahey said that when she went into labor five years ago  
with her first son, she decided against anesthesia -- until it was 
too late to change her mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``My biggest fear was getting a needle in my back,'' she said.  
But before long, ``they could have put a pitchfork in my back. It 
was intense misery and I couldn't see an end in sight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, the Hurst, Texas, woman entered the hospital to  
give birth again, and wary from her first delivery, asked for an 
epidural. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was instant euphoria,'' she said. ``There was no pain. And  
when the baby came I felt rested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McGahey, 28, said the experience was so enjoyable that she  
has no fears about giving birth to her next child -- due on 
Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time I'm not afraid,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The survey results, gathered from 750 hospitals around the  
nation, were to be presented in Dallas today during the annual 
meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found that in midsize hospitals, those with between  
500 and 1,499 births per year, 55 percent of women opted for 
regional anesthesia in 1997, compared with 13 percent in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	A huge increase was also reported at hospitals with fewer than  
500 births per year. The percentage of women receiving regional 
anesthesia went from 9 percent in 1981 to 42 percent in 1997, the 
survey found. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Joy L. Hawkins, who led the research, said the increase at  
small hospitals partly can be attributed to an increased number of 
anesthesiologists on staff in obstetrical units. In the past, some 
obstetricians provided anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Many patients in the survey also opted for narcotics to ease the  
pain during labor and delivery, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 11 percent of obstetrical patients at large and midsize  
hospitals opted for no analgesia of any kind in 1997. In small 
hospitals, 17 percent of women had no pain relief. 
</P>
<P>
	But some doctors and mothers-to-be believe epidurals and other  
pain-relievers greatly raise the chances of a Caesarean section by 
slowing labor and inhibiting the mother's ability to push. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Miller, a certified birthing assistant, or doula, says her  
clients ``have a strong belief in the natural process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They believe it's safer for their babies and safer for them,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Childbearing techniques like Lamaze and the Bradley method first  
gained popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, advocating relaxation 
techniques and abdominal breathing to ease pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hawkins said medical advances have made anesthesia safer.  
The development of ultrafine needles reduces the incidence of 
headaches to less than 1 percent, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have better needles and better drugs. We can provide pain  
relief where you can still walk around.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Is Last at World Gymnastics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIANJIN, China (AP) -- The Chinese men took their fourth  
consecutive World Gymnastics Championship title with ease Tuesday. 
Defending champions Romania won a thrilling battle with Russia for 
the women's crown. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Americans finished last in the six-team competition.  
</P>
<P>
	China finished with 230.395 points. Russia, the 1996 Olympic  
winner over the Chinese, took silver with 228.145, with Belarus 
third on 227.631. The U.S. team's 225.196 placed them sixth behind 
Japan and Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Chinese men never looked threatened, the women's  
competition went to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
	After performing two of the highest-scoring maneuvers of the  
day, Russia's Svetlana Khorkina could have clinched gold for the 
Russians with a 9.5 on the balance beam. Instead, she fell off on a 
back flip and scored 9.075. 
</P>
<P>
	The final score: Romania 153.527, Russia 153.209. China took  
bronze with 152.423. Ukraine and next year's Olympic host Australia 
also finished ahead of United States, which scored 150.213. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans complained that the judges underscored them.  
</P>
<P>
	``We should have done a better job but there's no way that we  
were the sixth team out there,'' said coach Kelly Hill. ``There 
needs to be somebody overruling the judges so that the judges are 
doing their jobs. Nobody seems to be keeping track of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans had other problems, too. Jeanette Antolin had a  
long wait while the public address system crew first played the 
wrong music for her floor exercise. Kristen Maloney's music stopped 
too soon. Coach Donna Strauss said it seemed as if competition 
organizers were trying to rattle the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney, the U.S. national champion, said the boisterous and  
mostly Chinese crowd also was a distraction. The noise peaked with 
the Americans on beam. The crowed roared when one fan waving a flag 
ran circles around the domed Tianjin Gymnasium waving and was 
quickly joined by others. 
</P>
<P>
	When Vanessa Atler began wobbling on her beam routine, some  
spectators murmured ``fall off, fall off'' in Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	She did, twice, scoring 8.025.  
</P>
<P>
	Afterwards, the 17-year-old said she'd never been so nervous.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was so scared,'' she said. ``It's fine when I've learned how  
to handle the atmosphere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These kids aren't quitters, they're fighters,'' Hill said.  
They have a lot of spirit. I'm confident that we can come back 
strong.''

<HEADLINE> Phelps Dodge Earnings Fall 20 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Phelps Dodge Corp. reported its third-quarter  
earnings fell 20.7 percent due to the continuing slump in copper 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The big copper and wire producer said Tuesday it earned $16.1  
million, or 28 cents per share, down from $20.3 million, or 35 
cents per share, reported for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge surpassed analyst expectations of 21 cents per  
share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. The results 
pleased investors, who bid Phelps Dodge stock rose $1.87 1/2 to 
$57.06 1/4 a share in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The results do not reflect a restructuring charge of $700,000,  
or 1 cent per share, for the latest quarter, and a 1998 gain of 
$8.3 million, or 14 cents per share, from the completion of the 
sale of Accuride Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales came to $742.7 million, down from $764 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The company was hurt by the lingering depression in copper  
prices and by a difficult market for wire and cable. Copper, which 
traded over $1 a pound two years ago, is now in the 80-cent range. 
</P>
<P>
	However, because of a recent uptick in prices, the Phelps Dodge  
Mining subsidiary had $36 million in operating income, its best 
quarterly performance since the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge's specialty chemicals division also continued to do  
well, thanks in part to strong business at its recently acquired 
carbon black facilities overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last several months, Phelps Dodge has been in the midst  
of trying to acquire two rivals, New York-based Asarco Inc. and 
Englewood, Colo.-based Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Asarco last week to be acquired by Phelps Dodge for about $1.1  
billion in cash and stock, but Grupo Mexico has since made a higher 
all-cash offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge has agreed to acquire Cyprus Amax for $1.8 billion  
in cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings for the first nine months of 1999 came to $17.8  
million, or 31 cents per share, down from $101.6 million, or $1.73 
per share, in the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The results do not reflect restructuring charges of $59.4  
million, or $1.03 a share, or a charge of $3.5 million, or 6 cents 
a shre, for an accounting change. They also do not include a gain 
of $131.1 million, or $2.24 per share, from the Accuride sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales came to $2,1 billion in the first nine months, compared  
with $2.36 million in the same period of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Intel's 3Q Profits Up 21 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Intel Corp.'s third-quarter operating  
profit rose 21 percent, but the chipmaker's results were shy of 
forecasts and may heighten earnings fears that helped send the 
stock market plunging on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest manufacturer of semiconductors earned $1.9  
billion, or 55 cents a share, in the three months ended Sept. 26, 
excluding one-time expenses related to acquisitions of other 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a strong improvement from last year's third-quarter  
operating profit of $1.58 billion, or 45 cents a share, but 2 cents 
per share below expectations, according to a survey of industry 
analysts by First Call/Thompson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter revenues rose 9 percent to $7.3 billion from $6.7  
billion a year earlier. While sales were particularly strong for 
Intel's Pentium III chip used in many personal computers, the 
product line drew lower profits than in previous quarters amid 
aggressive pricing by rivals intent on grabbing market share. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, released after the close of regular stock trading,  
were a surprise for many Wall Street investors who've come to 
expect Intel to meet or beat analyst forecasts. Hopes were also 
high because sales of personal computers, the overwhelming majority 
of which run on Intel microprocessors, typically rise in the third 
quarter amid back-to-school and early holiday shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, Intel's stock rose 18 3/4 cents a share to $76.68 3/4 in  
Nasdaq trading before the report, despite a steep decline on the 
overall stock market that sliced 231 points off the Dow Jones 
industrial average. In after hours trading on other markets, Intel 
fell as low as $70 a share, a drop that could spark another market 
decline at the start of Wednesday's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., took a charge during the  
just-ended quarter for expenses related to the purchase of Level 
One Communications. Including the charges, Intel posted a net 
profit of $1.5 billion, or 42 cents a share. That was down from a 
net profit of $1.6 billion, or 45 cents a share, in the same period 
last year, also including one-time charges for acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, operating income totaled $5.7  
billion, or $1.65 a share, up from $4.2 billion, or $1.19 a share, 
in the same period last year. Net revenue rose to $21.2 billion 
from $18.7 billion in the first nine months of 1998.

<HEADLINE>  Pakistan Army Surrounds Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's army shut down Islamabad  
International Airport and surrounded the state-run radio and 
television today, witnesses said, following the surprise dismissal 
of the powerful army chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif fired army chief Gen. Pervaiz  
Musharraf while the military leader was on a visit to Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissal was followed by a rapid movement of army personnel  
throughout the federal capital. 
</P>
<P>
	State-run television went off the air abruptly after reports  
that the army had taken over the station while Sharif was inside. 
Witnesses said they saw soldiers leap over the fence and go inside 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
	All entry to the television building was then barred.  
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers also have taken over the houses of government  
officials, according to witnesses who saw soldiers lock the gate of 
the Information Minister Mushahid Hussein's house. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan army also surrounded and forced the closure of  
Islamabad International Airport, according to witnesses at the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lahore, Sharif's hometown, soldiers in jeeps and trucks have  
taken up positions on the main road and at government buildings. 
There also were reports that army trucks were moving toward the 
airport in Lahore, the Punjab provincial capital. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no announcements by either Sharif or the army  
since Musharraf's dismissal was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissal, which state-run television had described as an  
early retirement, took the military by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know anything . . . go to the Defense Ministry or to  
the prime minister's house. We also have heard like you on 
television,'' Col. Salaut Raza of the military's information wing 
said when contacted by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate reason for the army chief's dismissal,  
but in recent weeks there have been reports of a yawning rift 
between the army and the civilian government. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf's term as army chief was to end in April 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	He was replaced by Gen. Zia Uddin, head of the country's secret  
service and considered a close ally of Sharif's. Before it went off 
the air, Pakistan Television showed Sharif and Uddin clasping hands 
as his promotion to army chief was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif also dismissed the Chief of General Staff Mohammed Aziz,  
according to defense sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The rift between Sharif and Musharraf developed after Sharif  
ordered militants to withdraw this summer from Indian territory in 
the Kargil region ending a bitter two-month border dispute with 
India. 
</P>
<P>
	Many feared the border dispute would escalate into an all-out  
war between the two nuclear enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	The withdrawal was negotiated between Sharif and President  
Clinton, but it reportedly did not have the support of the army 
chief, who many western analysts say orchestrated the takeover of 
Indian territory in Kargil. 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful army has ruled in Pakistan for 25 of its 52-year  
history, and army takeovers have occurred repeatedly.

<HEADLINE> Parents Protest Harry Potter Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Children clamor for the three best-selling  
books about Harry Potter, but not everyone loves the fictional 
orphan who attends a school for wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of parents on Tuesday persuaded the South Carolina's  
Board of Education to review whether the books should be allowed in 
schools, complaining that they are too violent for children. 
Parents elsewhere have raised similar objections. 
</P>
<P>
	``The books have a serious tone of death, hate, lack of respect  
and sheer evil,'' said Elizabeth Mounce of Columbia, one the 
parents who addressed the board Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The board said it was up to local school districts to decide  
whether the books are appropriate, but agreed to review them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Censorship is an ugly word, but it is not as ugly as what I've  
heard this morning,'' said board member Clarence Dickert, one of 
those who wants a review. 
</P>
<P>
	The stories, written by British author J.K. Rowling, outline the  
education of young Harry, an English wizard at the Hogwarts School 
of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
</P>
<P>
	The first book in the series, ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's  
Stone,'' has spent 42 weeks on the New York Times Bestseller list 
for adult fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 5 million hardback copies of the books have been sold  
in the United States and millions more are in paperback, said Judy 
Corman, spokeswoman for Scholastic Division. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50 people waited at a suburban Boston bookstore  
Tuesday to meet Rowling. She could not immediately be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Trotter, manager of The Happy Bookseller in Columbia, which  
sells about 100 Harry Potter books per week -- when he can keep them 
in stock -- said ``children who hate to read have started their own 
book clubs.''

	``If you fear Harry Potter, you should fear 50 percent of  
children's classics,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents in South Carolina aren't the only ones who have  
complained about Harry Potter. 
</P>
<P>
	In Marietta, Ga., elementary school principal Jerry Locke  
recently asked a fifth-grade teacher to stop reading the books in 
class until the school decided whether they were appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's questionable whether every parent wants their child to  
read or be exposed to books having to do with magic and wizardry,'' 
Locke said. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of parents at a Lakeville, Minn., elementary school  
also objected, but the principal said it was up to teachers whether 
to continue reading Potter's tales to their students. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sioux Falls, S.D., however, sixth-grade reading teacher  
Bonnie Kiesow said she was amazed at the enthusiasm she saw among 
her students. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their parents are running all over town trying to find the  
book. I've had kids who said, `My mom couldn't believe it because I 
don't sit down to read for two hours,''' she said. ``This is just 
fun to see.''

<HEADLINE> Baird To Buy British Banking Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The investment firm Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. is  
paying $39.7 million to acquire Granville PLC, a British investment 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Granville, based in London, specializes in following media  
companies, information technology, outsourcing and staffing. It has 
branches in Barcelona, Hamburg and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies have worked together on projects before, such  
as investment banking for a common client, the British staffing 
services company Select Appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee-based Baird said the deal, the 90-year-old company's  
first major acquisition, would provide an important foothold in the 
European market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very important move strategically to get us  
well-entrenched in the U.K. and Europe,'' said Paul E. Purcell, 
Baird's president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal needs to be approved by British regulators. Baird hopes  
to close the purchase by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	No jobs at either firm would be lost as a result of the deal,  
Purcell said. The addition of Granville's 200 workers would give 
Baird a work force of 2,400.

<HEADLINE> Engineers Shut Down Arkansas Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A new arena set to open with an  
NBA exhibition game before a capacity crowd of 18,000 was shut down 
2 1/2 hours before tipoff Tuesday after engineers found cracks in a 
beam. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Lakers and Washington Wizards were to christen  
the $80 million Alltel Arena. Fans were making their way toward the 
arena when the building was closed. 
</P>
<P>
	After bracing a weak beam Tuesday, engineers told the arena's  
board they would monitor the 22 beams supporting the building's 
upper level during the game. The arena board opted to cancel it. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers plan stress tests on all the spans before clearing the  
building for occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence of all the other beams is that they're perfectly  
OK, but this one was thought to be perfect until it cracked,'' said 
Willard Reese, the building's chief engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pulaski County board that runs the arena opened the doors  
Oct. 2 to give the public a walk-through but kept visitors off the 
upper deck. Arena officials said part of the upper deck would have 
been cordoned off if the game had been played. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we would have had a problem, but it wasn't a  
chance we wanted to take,'' said Bob Russell, chairman of the arena 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese said engineers were made aware of two cracks in a beam  
three weeks ago. One was about 24 inches long and the other about 
12 inches long. To look deeper into the problem, crews chipped away 
part of the concrete and discovered that steel support bars encased 
in the 70-foot-long beam were placed a foot lower than they should 
have been, Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
	The position reduced the beam's ability to withstand stress,  
Reese said. Steel plates will be attached to either side of the 
beam to reinforce it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers had developed a temporary fix and workers on Tuesday  
afternoon completed installing two metal posts beneath the beam. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our opinion that we would not have seen a failure that  
would have threatened life, but there may have been enough stress 
to have the area evacuated,'' Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elton John is scheduled for a concert Oct. 29 in an event being  
billed as the arena's official opening. There was no immediate word 
on how long the building would be closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arkansas RiverBlades of the East Coast Hockey League are  
scheduled for their home opener in the arena Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Nabholz Building and Management Corp., the main  
concrete builder at the arena, was declared in default on its $4.78 
million contract. Officials cited shoddy work, failure to meet the 
construction manager's deadlines and failure to pay its own 
suppliers and other contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear if the shutdown was linked to the building's old  
concrete workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the trouble, members of the Pulaski County Multipurpose  
Civic Center Facility Board said they believed new crews could work 
around the problem and vowed to meet their opening date. 
</P>
<P>
	County voters in 1995 approved a one-year 1 percent sales tax.  
That money, combined with a $20 million contribution from the state 
and $17 million from private sources, paid for the construction of 
the 377,000-square-foot arena on the north side of the Arkansas 
River in downtown North Little Rock.

<HEADLINE> Remote ATM locations Pose Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERCREEK, Ohio (AP) -- U.S. researchers at McMurdo Station in  
Antarctica are cut off from civilization, but not from cash. They 
have an ATM. Two, actually. 
</P>
<P>
	The automated teller machines at the outpost that sits atop the  
bleak and frozen continent are inside Building 155 in a hallway 
researchers call Highway One. The scientists use the cash when they 
frequent a base general store and assorted coffeehouse-pubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their expenses are low, but they like to do little things,''  
said Valerie Carroll, spokeswoman for Antarctica Support 
Associates, the Englewood, Colo.-based company that stocks and 
maintains the ATMs. 
</P>
<P>
	While most ATMs can still be found at bank branches, they have  
also popped up in bowling alleys, restaurants, casinos, sports 
arenas and in the remotest of locations. There are ATMs in the 
Yukon Territory, on the Galapagos Islands, in the Andes Mountains 
and aboard cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
	``That creates some real interesting challenges,'' said Chris  
Klein, senior vice president of ATM Systems in Fort Lauderdale, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein said banks and armored cars must scramble to restock the  
ATMs when the ships arrive in port. Last-minute schedule changes 
can wreak havoc, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Zink, senior vice president of ATM banking for Wells  
Fargo, which owns the Antarctica ATMs, said stocking and servicing 
ATMs ``on the ice'' also presents challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	During the winter, air service to Antarctica for ATM service  
technicians is limited because of the weather. Flights are often 
not available for four months at a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to miss that plane,'' said Zink.  
</P>
<P>
	He said that while Wells Fargo sends a crew down to do  
preventive maintenance on the machines during the summer, the 
company has had to train researchers at McMurdo Station to stock 
and service the ATMs the rest of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their second job is ATM maintenance,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In the winter, one of the two ATMs is taken out of service so  
its parts can be used to keep the other machine running. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have to send people out to fix remote machines, it's  
much more expensive than fixing a branch machine,'' said David 
Gasper, president of Gasper Corp., which electronically monitors 
and services ATMs from its headquarters in this Dayton suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 27, Gasper began developing the computer software now  
used to service half of the ATMs in the United States and one of 
every five ATMs in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasper, now 43, said the software is designed to unjam and reset  
ATMs by sending an electronic signal from a central location -- 
similar to the way space agency workers might fix an orbiting 
satellite or telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	``It saves a service call,'' he said. And that saves the cost  
not only of sending out a technician, but also whatever security 
escort is needed if the machine is away from a secure location such 
as a bank. 
</P>
<P>
	There are about 227,000 ATMs in the United States, up 21 percent  
from 187,000 only a year ago. Gasper said the average ATM processes 
4,000 transactions a month and costs $20,000 to $40,000 a year to 
operate. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks strive to minimize the time ATMs are down. Gasper's  
software collects electronic status messages emitted by the 
machines and immediately detects when they malfunction or are low 
on cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The software also calculates how much cash to put into a given  
ATM in an attempt to keep it from running out of money without 
overstocking it and causing a bank to lose earning power because 
the cash is idle. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein calls the software ``a godsend.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers have become dependent on ATMs,'' said Klein. ``They  
expect it to be working. It's very disturbing if it isn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gasper admits it is aggravating to the customer when ATMs are  
out of cash or not working. He said he once had to catch a plane 
and was forced to go to four ATMs at an airport before he found 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sweating bullets by the time I went to the fourth one,''  
he recalled. ``I was very nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gasper's success in the business world has not gone unnoticed.  
</P>
<P>
	Last month, his 75-employee company was bought by NCR Corp., the  
Dayton-based maker of ATMs. Terms of the acquisition were not 
disclosed. Gasper said he expects the subsidiary to grow 
dramatically as they begin servicing more ATMs overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasper points out that it was not so long ago that ATMs were a  
mystery to people. 
</P>
<P>
	A Gasper employee was once inside an ATM to service it when an  
elderly woman and her husband walked up to the machine, Gasper 
said. He said the woman put her ATM card into the slot. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasper said the employee pushed the card back through the slot  
and said: ``'I'm sorry ma'am, we're closed right now.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``She turned to her husband and said, 'See. I told you there  
were people inside.'''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 12, Indians 8  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- As champagne sprayed around him, John Valentin  
jumped up on a podium in the middle of Boston's clubhouse and 
screamed for quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey!'' Valentin yelled to his teammates.  
</P>
<P>
	Unsuccessful, he tried again.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hey!'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Finally, with most of the room's attention, Valentin had a  
message for the Red Sox -- and maybe one for the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'd better sweep us!'' Valentin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Boston's stunning comeback from an 0-2 deficit to win the  
division series over Cleveland with a 12-8 victory in Game 5 Monday 
night ended the Indians' season and forewarned the Yankees they had 
better not be overconfident in the ALCS beginning Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the Indians did, the Red Sox did better.  
</P>
<P>
	They outslugged them, outscoring baseball's highest-scoring team  
in 49 years. 
</P>
<P>
	They outpitched them as Pedro Martinez continued his dominant  
1999 season with a comeback as improbable as Boston's. 
</P>
<P>
	And they beat history, becoming just the fifth major league team  
to rally from an 0-2 deficit in a best-of-5 playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	``There ain't no scale that can measure the heart of this  
team,'' Boston's Trot Nixon said. ``Whether we're down two games or 
three games, there is no quit in this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And certainly none in Martinez, who pitched six hitless innings  
just two days after he couldn't even play a game of catch because 
of a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, and that so-called Boston curse. If the Red Sox are haunted,  
then Martinez might just be the one to exorcise all those demons -- 
from the Babe to Bucky to Buckner. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might say we're celebrating a little too hard,'' pitcher  
Bret Saberhagen said in the middle of the Red Sox party. ``But 
after a series like this, you have to kick off your shoes a little 
bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Making a surprise relief appearance, Martinez refused to come  
out after manager Jimy Williams put him in and struck out eight in 
a six-inning stint. The right-hander, who had to leave Game 1 with 
a strained back muscle, finished with 10 shutout innings in the 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't come out,'' Martinez said. ``As long as I was able  
to throw the ball over the plate, I was going to stay in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Troy O'Leary supplied the offense, twice thwarting the Indians'  
strategy of intentionally walking Nomar Garciaparra by driving in 
seven runs with a pair of homers -- including the first postseason 
grand slam in Red Sox history. 
</P>
<P>
	With the shocking win, the wild-card Red Sox will play their  
hated rival in the postseason for the first time, starting 
Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	It was too early for Williams to begin worrying about pitching  
matchups against the defending World Series champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who we going to pitch?'' he said. ``What day is it?''  
</P>
<P>
	The five games were a blur of comebacks, injuries, pitching  
changes and runs, runs and runs -- 79 in all, three short of the 
record for any postseason series. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Leary, who went 0-for-5 in Game 4, hit his slam in the third  
and snapped an 8-8 tie in the seventh with a three-run homer for 
the Red Sox, trying for their first World Series title since 1918. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the Red Sox have been haunted, from the trade of Babe  
Ruth to the Yankees in 1920, to Bucky Dent's homer over the Green 
Monster that propelled New York to victory in the 1978 AL East 
tiebreaker, to Bill Buckner's error that helped cost them the 1986 
Series against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe Martinez will be the one to end all that suffering.  
</P>
<P>
	It sure didn't look promising for the Red Sox a few days ago  
when Martinez pulled himself from his start in the opener after 
four innings with a strained muscle in his back. And it got worse 
for the Red Sox when Garciaparra was unable to go in Game 3 because 
of an injured wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	But Boston pounced on Cleveland's shaky pitching staff, scoring  
nine runs in Game 3 before shattering records with their 23-7 rout 
in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	But Martinez brought some sanity to a series of atrocious  
pitching, putting an exclamation point on his dominating 1999 
season. The right-hander, who went 23-4 during the regular season, 
will now get a chance to pitch the Red Sox back to the World Series 
for the first time since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``He couldn't even pick up the ball two days ago,'' Saberhagen  
said, ``and was almost in tears. He's just the most unbelievable 
pitcher I've ever seen in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Indians, who have been waiting since 1948 to win  
a Series, were denied a third straight trip to the ALCS when their 
pitching staff collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Thome homered twice and Travis Fryman hit a solo shot for  
the Indians, who will now spend the winter wondering why they could 
never shake an injury bug that plagued them all season. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, which lost Game 3 starter Dave Burba to injury, also  
watched center fielder Kenny Lofton dislocate his left shoulder 
sliding into first base Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were shorthanded, beat up and we still went out and gave a  
great effort,'' Indians catcher Sandy Alomar said. ``We battled, 
but we just got beat. Once they got the momentum, it was like 
trying to climb Mount Everest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's offseason also could include an agreement to sell  
the team that came within two outs of winning the Series in 1997 
and has won five straight AL Central titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still can't believe we lost,'' Omar Vizquel said.  
</P>
<P>
	With the score 8-8 in the seventh, O'Leary made the Indians pay  
for electing to walk Garciaparra again. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing loser Paul Shuey, Valentin singled and, after a forceout,  
Indians manager Mike Hargrove decided to walk Garciaparra, who hit 
.451 against Cleveland during the regular season (23-for-51) with 
17 RBIs in 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
	And for the second time, the strategy blew up in Hargrove's  
face, with O'Leary hitting Shuey's first pitch over the right-field 
wall for an 11-8 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We chose to put him on rather than pitch around him tonight,''  
Hargrove said. ``We had been handling O'Leary up until tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Given the cushion, Martinez took the Red Sox home from there,  
fanning Vizquel for the final out to give Boston its first win in a 
postseason series since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez crouched at the edge of the mound and was hugged by  
catcher Jason Varitek as the Red Sox poured onto the field to 
celebrate a series that three days earlier they couldn't have 
imagined winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``They talk about an MVP for this series,'' Williams said. ``I  
think it's the whole team, not just one guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* O'Leary's seven RBIs tie a major league record in the  
postseason. He shares the mark with Valentin, who did it in Game 4, 
and Mo Vaughn, who did it for the Red Sox in Game 1 of the '98 
division series. ... The record for runs in a series was set in 
Pittsburgh's seven-game win over the Yankees in the 1960 World 
Series. ... Including the postseason, Garciaparra batted .444 with 
seven homers and 21 RBIs against the Indians this year. ... Umpire 
Durwood Merrill worked first base in his last game after a 22-year 
career in the AL. The 63-year-old Merrill said he will retire to 
his home in Hooks, Texas. ... Hargrove, criticized by Cleveland 
fans and reporters for some of his decisions during Games 3 and 4 
in Boston, said injuries dictated most of them. Reliever Steve Reed 
has a strained forearm, which limited his use, and Steve Karsay is 
still trying to build his arm back up after an injury.

<HEADLINE> MGM Posts First Profit in 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. reported  
its first profitable quarter in almost three years Tuesday, earning 
$10.3 million on the strength of recent films, TV programming and 
cost-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-quarter results came in well above forecasts of Wall  
Street analysts, who had predicted a loss. 
</P>
<P>
	It marked MGM's first profit since the last three months of  
1996, when the company was privately owned. From Oct. 11 to Dec. 
31, 1996, MGM reported a $166,000 profit as the company prepared to 
go public. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 were 7 cents a  
share, compared with a $40.3 million, or 61 cents a share, loss for 
the same period in 1998. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson 
Financial had expected MGM to lose 19 cents a share in this year's 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue was $299.3 million, up from $259.6 million for the third  
quarter of 1998. Most of that increase came from MGM's television 
division, whose gains included third-run sales of its series ``The 
Outer Limits'' and ``Poltergeist: The Legacy'' to the Sci-Fi 
Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	After a string of film flops that included ``The Mod Squad,''  
``Carrie 2: The Rage'' and ``Dirty Work,'' MGM had modest hits with 
``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' which has grossed $67.4 million 
domestically, and ``Stigmata,'' which has taken in $46.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	MGM also did well with the arthouse hit ``Tea With Mussolini.''  
The film grossed $14 million after the studio acquired domestic 
rights for $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Next month, MGM releases ``The World Is Not Enough,'' the 19th  
film in its James Bond franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-quarter profit was a ``tremendous milestone for the  
new MGM,'' chairman and chief executive officer Alex Yemenidjian 
said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have set the stage for sustained improvement, with further  
revenue enhancements and diversification planned for the long 
term,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, MGM lost $546.1 million on  
revenues of $770.2 million, compared with a $113.9 million loss and 
$857.3 million in revenues for the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's losses include a $431 million charge for  
restructuring, cost-cutting and other one-time expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	MGM this month canceled a $750 million common stock offering,  
saying its current share price does not reflect the company's 
value. It substituted an offering to allow current shareholders to 
acquire up to $720 million in additional stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracinda Corp., the investment arm of billionaire Kirk  
Kerkorian, owns most of the company's stock and has pledged to 
acquire any shares not bought by other MGM investors. 
</P>
<P>
	MGM's stock remained unchanged at $22.18 3/4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Simpson Called 911 To Help Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- O.J. Simpson said it's all a big misunderstanding.  
</P>
<P>
	Simpson called 911 Sunday night, saying he was trying to get  
help for a woman he said had been on a two-day cocaine binge with a 
former baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old Simpson placed the call from the townhouse of  
his 26-year-old girlfriend, Christie Prody, in southwest Miami-Dade 
County. A police report said Simpson told officers who showed up at 
the house that he was trying to get help for Prody. 
</P>
<P>
	A day later, the couple denied she was on the drug binge Simpson  
described to police. Simpson told The Associated Press on Tuesday 
that he was trying to get help for one of Prody's friends, whom he 
identified as ``Pinky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson said Prody had called him in Los Angeles, crying and  
reporting that her friend was missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Prody told Simpson that the woman had last been seen with former  
Los Angeles Dodger Pedro Guerrero whom Simpson named in the 
emergency call he made from Prody's townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson said he called Guerrero who told him the woman had left  
his home by cab the night before and he didn't know where she was. 
Simpson said he then decided to fly to Miami and help out. 
</P>
<P>
	When he arrived in Miami on Sunday, Simpson said, the woman was  
at Prody's apartment and she and some friends were doing ``an 
intervention'' aimed at getting her to a drug rehab, but the woman 
was resisting. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was spaced out,'' Simpson said. ``Next thing I know she's  
in her car. I told them to call the police and get someone here 
before she goes driving. ... She was a danger to herself and she 
would have been a danger to others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When no one did anything, he said he called 911, not telling  
them who he was, and asked for help. By the time two police 
officers arrived, he said the woman had left. He said the officers 
recognized him, took pictures with him and got autographs. But he 
said there was never any mention of his girlfriend being in 
distress or on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I go to the airport to leave and, lo and behold, here  
comes a TV camera,'' he said. ``I went down there to support my 
friends who were concerned about a missing person and this is what 
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his 911 call, Simpson told the emergency operator: ``We have  
a problem here. I'm trying to get a girl to go to rehab. ... She's 
been doing drugs for two days with Pedro Guerrero, who just got 
arrested for cocaine, and I'm trying to get her to leave her house 
and go into rehab right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guerrero was charged with cocaine conspiracy in Miami federal  
court Oct. 1. Drug Enforcement Administration agents accused him of 
agreeing to put up the money for a nephew to buy 15 kilograms of 
cocaine. He posted $100,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	To the 911 operator, Simpson added: ``This girl has spent the  
last two days doing drugs with him. Me and a friend just came over 
and said, `You're going into a rehab.' She got mad, she just got 
her car and now she's loaded out of her mind in her Mustang driving 
around town. She needs to be stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phone messages seeking comment from Prody and Guerrero were not  
immediately returned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prody recently moved from Brentwood, Simpson's old neighborhood  
in Los Angeles, to a townhouse in southwest Miami-Dade County. 
Simpson gave police Prody's new address as his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Two police officers went to Prody's townhouse after the 911 call  
and found Simpson, who told them that he and Prody were having a 
``verbal dispute,'' the officers' report said. 
</P>
<P>
	They searched the area for Prody's car but did not find it. The  
officers gave Simpson a brochure on domestic violence. Police 
spokesman Ed Munn said state law requires officers to distribute 
the brochures during any domestic-related incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Police returned Monday morning and Prody answered the door. Munn  
said the officers returned to check on Prody's well-being and no 
police report was filed. Prody showed no signs of injury or 
impairment, Munn said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade police said they stood by the officer's report and  
that the case is closed. They said there was no sign of criminal 
activity and nothing more to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is being investigated,'' police Detective Rudy  
Espinosa said. ``It was written as an informational report and 
nothing else. There's nothing else to follow up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Simpson was acquitted of murdering his ex-wife Nicole  
Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. However, the Hall of 
Fame running back later was found liable for their deaths in a 
civil trial and was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson has said he is looking to move from California to South  
Florida and has been seen often in the Miami area in recent months.

<HEADLINE> Yanks, BoSox Rekindle Best Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Beantown vs. the Big Apple. Baseball's best  
rivalry is about to resume with, oh, only about 80 years or so of 
history coming along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
	The tension between the Red Sox and Yankees began innocently  
enough, with the sale in 1920 of an oddly shaped outfielder so that 
Boston owner Harry Frazee could fund the Broadway show ``No, No, 
Nanette.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Babe Ruth began hitting home runs and it became ``Oh, No,  
Harry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Curse of the Bambino is a well-established part of  
baseball lore, the belief that by selling one the game's first 
stars for cold, hard cash, the Red Sox violated some sacred trust. 
They've been paying for it ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the rivalry will be resumed with nothing more crucial than  
the American League championship at stake. One more chance for the 
Red Sox to exact some revenge on a franchise that has won 24 World 
Series since the sale of Ruth, which is 24 more than Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	From Babe and his 60 home runs in 1927 to Bucky and his Green  
Monster division-winning homer in 1978, New York has delighted in 
punishing Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1976, the bad feelings erupted with a brawl on the field  
after Lou Piniella slid into Carlton Fisk and came up punching. 
Boston pitcher Bill Lee got slammed to the field in the melee and 
wound up with a cracked collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
	And that happened in the serenity of May, not the pressure  
cooker of October. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no greater rivalry in the '70s,'' said Yankees coach  
Don Zimmer, who managed the Red Sox two decades ago. ``Those 
players hated each other. I don't think that's the feeling of 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players have come from the Red Sox to Yankees and thrived.  
Journeyman outfielder Danny Cater was traded to Boston for Sparky 
Lyle, who won a Cy Young Award for the Yankees. Luis Tiant and Wade 
Boggs, both Boston heroes, seemed washed up when they signed on as 
free agents with the Yankees to resurrect their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Joe Girardi knows all about the history.  
</P>
<P>
	``None of us were Yankees in 1927,'' he said. ``Our frame of  
reference is different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And they weren't Yankees in 1978, either, when New York chopped  
away at a 14-game Red Sox lead in July and forced a playoff against 
Zimmer's Red Sox in Fenway Park for the AL East title. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucky Dent, hardly a Ruthian slugger, hit a three-run homer  
against ex-Yankee Mike Torrez to put New York in front and Goose 
Gossage got Carl Yastrzemski to pop up for the last out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The roar was deafening,'' said Willie Randolph, the Yankees'  
second baseman then and third base coach now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was 12 years old,'' said Scott Brosius, now the Yankees'  
third baseman. ``I don't remember watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brosius grew up in Oregon, far removed from the passions that  
burned between Boston and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was aware of the rivalry, but not to the extent of the  
people here,'' he said. ``I didn't know how emotional it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emotional?  
</P>
<P>
	Dent, now a coach with the Texas Rangers, had a replica of the  
Fenway Green Monster erected at his baseball school. 
</P>
<P>
	Girardi learned about the heat of a Red Sox-Yankees series when  
he got to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless you experience it, you don't understand it,'' he said.  
``The level of excitement, the intensity of people standing 
everywhere in the ballpark, that's what makes it great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Leyritz of the Yankees also played in Boston.  
</P>
<P>
	``You couldn't have a better scenario to close out the  
millennium than the Red Sox against the Yankees for the pennant,'' 
he said. ``When I was there, they always wanted to catch up with 
the Yankees. You looked at the Yankees and said, `That's where we 
want to get, to that level.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Clemens got there by way of Toronto. Clemens was the ace  
of the Red Sox staff, a New England folk hero, when he signed as a 
free agent with the Blue Jays. Two Cy Young awards later, he was 
traded to -- of all people -- the Yankees. Now he will start Game 3 
in Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been removed from that situation for so many years,'' he  
said. ``If it was one year later, the situation would be different. 
But I've faced them so many times and I've been back at Fenway so 
many times. I know the mound, the wall. I'm familiar with the 
territory.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Tab Mercker To Start Game 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Boston Red Sox manager Jimy Williams spread the  
surprising news at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday: Kent Mercker is king 
of the hill, top of the scrap heap. 
</P>
<P>
	Deemed the best option on Boston's depleted pitching staff,  
Mercker will pitch Game 1 of the American League Championship 
Series against the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I was getting to start by default, if you will,''  
Mercker acknowledged as his team worked out for Wednesday's series 
opener. ``But I don't think Jimy is doing it just out of necessity; 
that there is no one else that can pitch. I think he has confidence 
in me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 2, the Red Sox plan to start Ramon Martinez against  
David Cone. Pedro Martinez would start Game 3 at Fenway Park 
against former Red Sox ace Roger Clemens, with Bret Saberhagen in 
Game 4 against Andy Pettitte. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercker went 6-5 with a 5.12 ERA as a starter and reliever with  
the St. Louis Cardinals before Boston acquired him at the trading 
deadline. With the Red Sox, he went 2-2 with a 3.51 ERA in five 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	But he spent half of September on the disabled list with a  
strain in his rib cage, then didn't pitch for 11 days while waiting 
for his turn in the playoffs. He started Game 4 of the first-round 
series against Cleveland and lasted just 1 2-3 innings, allowing 
two runs in a game the Red Sox eventually won 23-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``It probably sounds funny, but I felt too good out there,''  
Mercker said. ``You put all the things together -- the rest, the not 
feeling pain, the adrenaline, the situation -- and I was just out 
there trying to throw as hard as Pedro can. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think two days' rest is going to be good for me because I am  
not going to feel like Superman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams dismissed questions about the rotation with a terse,  
``managerial decision.'' But he did show a little bit of emotion 
when asked about the team's other moves -- notably the decision to 
drop Tim Wakefield from the postseason roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams has been effusive this season in his praise of  
Wakefield, who went from starter to closer to starter to closer and 
back to starter this season because of injuries to reliever Tom 
Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his teammates compliment Wakefield's versatility and  
his ability to ``eat up innings,'' he posted a 6-11 record and 5.08 
ERA in the regular season and allowed three runs over two innings 
in two relief appearances against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, when asked if he might keep Wakefield out of Game 4  
against Cleveland so that he could start Game 5, Williams 
misunderstood -- or pretended to -- and said that he had every 
confidence in the knuckleballer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it wasn't for Timmy, I wouldn't be here talking to you guys  
tonight,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Red Sox are unlikely to survive more shaky performances  
like Wakefield delivered in Games 2 and 4 against Cleveland. In the 
latter, he faces four batters and did not record an out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox also dropped John Wasdin and added Pat Rapp and  
Bryce Florie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tough decisions,'' Williams said, ``but (I) have to make  
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he talked to all of the pitchers involved. But Red  
Sox general manager Dan Duquette noted that the rosters aren't due 
until noon Wednesday, and they could still change.

<HEADLINE> Chamberlain Told All in Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In one of the last interviews of his life,  
Wilt Chamberlain spoke of regrets, his history with women and the 
man he thought was the best basketball player of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	Believe it or not, Meadowlark Lemon.  
</P>
<P>
	``Meadowlark was the most sensational, awesome, incredible  
basketball player I've ever seen,'' Chamberlain said. ``People 
would say it would be Dr. J or even (Michael) Jordan. For me it 
would be Meadowlark Lemon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain, who rarely did interviews in recent years, sat down  
for a television piece produced by the Philadelphia 76ers last May. 
Portions of the three-hour interview, conducted by longtime Philly 
sports anchor Al Meltzer, aired last summer on local cable. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a revealing talk in which Chamberlain's bravado really  
came through. He bragged about wanting to fight Muhammad Ali, 
explained why he publicized the number of women he'd slept with and 
lamented his teams' many failures against Bill Russell's Boston 
Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guarantee you, if you could give me 10 points in all those  
seventh games against the Boston Celtics, instead of Bill Russell 
having 11 rings, I could've at least had nine or eight,'' 
Chamberlain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain, who died Tuesday in Los Angeles, said he was close  
to signing a contract to fight Ali while he was still playing 
basketball. He said renowned trainer Cus D'Amato wanted to train 
him for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``So sure enough they offer us $5 million each to fight in the  
Houston Astrodome,'' Chamberlain said. ``And I remember leaving my 
place in L.A. and -- my father is a big fight fan -- and I said, 
`Dad, I got a couple of days off and I'm getting ready to go to 
Houston to sign to fight Muhammed Ali.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain said his father told him he should work on his free  
throws instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I looked at my Dad and said, `Well, Dad, you're probably  
right,''' said Chamberlain, who said the fight never happened 
because of money. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain said his on-and-off appearances with the Harlem  
Globetrotters scared him, ``because I liked them so well that I did 
not want to come back and play in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You must understand as a kid of color in those days, the  
Harlem Globetrotters were like being movie stars,'' Chamberlain 
said. ``You know, this was your dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain, criticized for revealing in his autobiography that  
he'd slept with 20,000 women, explained why he did so. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all fascinated by the numbers, as we were about the 100  
points,'' Chamberlain said. ``... So I thought of a number that was 
a round number that may be close and may be whatever, and I used 
that number. Now according to the average person, that number is so 
preposterous that I can understand them not believing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the point of using the number was to show that sex was a  
great part of my life as basketball was a great part of my life. 
That's the reason why I was single.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain said he regretted not explaining the sexual climate  
at the time of his escapades. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a different sexual situation going on than it is in the  
'80s and '90s, and I did a very poor job of describing that,'' said 
Chamberlain, who offered a warning for any men who admired him for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all of you men out there who think that having a thousand  
different ladies is pretty cool, I have learned in my life I've 
found out that having one woman a thousand different times is much 
more satisfying.''

<HEADLINE> Kroger Consolidates HQs, jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Kroger Co., the nation's largest supermarket  
operator, plans to add 130 jobs at its Cincinnati headquarters 
during the next three years by consolidating some operations and 
creating some new positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the jobs will be moved from other divisional offices  
around the country, including the Portland, Ore., offices of Fred 
Meyer Inc., a 900-store grocery chain that was acquired by Kroger 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The consolidation will involve accounting, finance, procurement,  
human resources and legal counsel operations, Kroger spokesman Gary 
Rhodes said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	To accommodate the additional jobs, Kroger plans to spend $6.7  
million remodeling and reconfiguring space in its main office tower 
and a nearby building the company occupies.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Fraud Causes Higher Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Almost a third of all mortgage loans are approved  
because of false information and up to 20 percent of loans wouldn't 
be made if lenders knew all the facts, a mortgage expert says. 
</P>
<P>
	And consumers are picking up the tab.  
</P>
<P>
	Richard D. Ward, a former police officer who now works as  
president of Los Angeles-based Affinity Corp. said that the money 
lost to fraud shows up in higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are paying for this, through higher loan costs,  
higher lending fees, and higher interest rates,'' Ward told the 
Mortgage Bankers Association convention Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI statistics show that $1.7 trillion in residential mortgage  
loans or refinancing packages were issued in 1998, said Roger A. 
Jackson, Affinity's chief financial officer. Of that total, about 
$60 billion was fraudulent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most common forms of fraud is ``property flipping,''  
in which a property is bought and then resold -- or ``flipped'' -- 
several times, each time at a falsely inflated higher price, among 
a single group of people. 
</P>
<P>
	The property is then sold to an unsuspecting mortgage company  
that, seeing the previous purchase and sale prices, pays much more 
for the property than its market value. 
</P>
<P>
	When the company tries to resell the property, it loses tens of  
thousands of dollars. Often, the property sellers can't be tracked 
down because they've left town or used fake names. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Boston and all over the nation, we're seeing a huge number  
of property flips,'' said Ward, whose firm helps clients avoid 
fraud by compiling nationwide statistics on individuals and 
companies in the real estate industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said the increase of online banking transactions in  
recent years made fraudulent activities easier, because of the ease 
with which computer users can create bank statements, verifications 
of employment, W-2 tax forms and other documents needed for 
mortgage applications. 
</P>
<P>
	David J. Kuff, an Affinity spokesman, also said the potential  
for fooling a bank or mortgage company increases as more people 
become involved in the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can be up to 44 different parties involved with a  
mortgage, from the termite inspector to the accountant to the real 
estate agent, and any one of them could be fraudulent,'' Kuff said.

<HEADLINE> Piazza Starts, Left Thumb Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza was back in his  
accustomed cleanup spot Tuesday night for the opener of the 
best-of-7 National League Championship Series against the Atlanta 
Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't help as the Braves beat the Mets 4-2 in Game 1.  
</P>
<P>
	Piazza missed the last two games of the NL division playoffs  
because of a reaction to a cortisone shot to his injured left 
thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	``The swelling had gone down and it's feeling better,'' Piazza  
said prior to Game 1. ``I had to make sure I was ready. I've had a 
couple of days off and the trainer has cleared me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza, who hit .303 with 40 home runs and 124 RBIs this season,  
said he's about ``95 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to go,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Piazza went 0-for-4, grounding out all four times. He did drive  
in New York's first run in the fourth with a grounder to third, 
scoring Edgardo Alfonso, who had doubled and taken third on a 
single by John Olerud off Greg Maddux. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza hit .211 with two home runs and eight RBIs during the  
regular season in which Atlanta defeated the Mets nine times in 12 
games. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO ROJAS:* National League president Leonard Coleman said  
Tuesday he had turned down the appeal of New York Mets third base 
coach Cookie Rojas, who was suspended for five games and fined 
$500. 
</P>
<P>
	Rojas drew the suspension for bumping umpire Charlie Williams  
during Game 4 of the division series against Arizona on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spoke with Rojas last night,'' Coleman said. ``We've been  
friends for years. I think he's done a lot for baseball. He just 
made a mistake, and that's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman also announced he had fined Williams $500 for using  
profanity during the confrontation with Rojas. 
</P>
<P>
	Rojas, will be eligible for Game 6, if the series goes that far.  
He was replaced on the coaching lines by bench coach Bruce 
Benedict. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time I coached third base was in 1996 when I was at  
Norfolk,'' Benedict said. 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk is New York's Triple-A farm club in the International  
League. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there'll be some kind of adjustment for me and for the  
players. I haven't done it on an everyday basis, but I have done 
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be a different look, but we're professionals and we'll  
get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JORDAN A-OK:* Braves outfielder Brian Jordan, who struggled for  
much of the second half of the season with a sore right hand and 
wrist after being hit by a pitch on June 22 by Mike Thurman, is 
giving credit to personal trainer Bob Kersee for his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``My hand is a lot better,'' said Jordan, who batted .471  
(8-for-17) with a home run and seven RBIs in the four-game division 
series win over Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Kersee used ``cross friction'' treatment on his right  
hand and now doesn't think he'll need offseason surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to work. Bob said my joint was so jammed up in my  
wrist, and that was the reason for all the pain,'' Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he did was actually pull it and reach in and just put me  
in a lot of pain, but actually it loosened up my joint and now I 
can swing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan was 0-for-3 with an intentional walk Tuesday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan hit .283 with 23 homers and 115 RBIs during the regular  
season, but hit only .207 (19-for-92) with one home run and 14 RBIs 
in 26 games in September and October.

	 *WEISS STARTS:* As expected, opening-round hero Walt Weiss  
replaced Jose Hernandez as starting shortstop for the Braves in 
Game 1 of the NLCS. 
</P>
<P>
	What wasn't expected was his hitting.  
</P>
<P>
	Weiss went 3-for-4, drove in a run and scored another Tuesday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The postseason. It's a new start. It's been a tough year,''  
said Weiss, who hit only .226 while starting 69 games. He was 
primarily a defensive replacement after Atlanta picked up Hernandez 
from the Cubs just before the July 31 trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was prepared either way,'' Weiss said. ``I wasn't sure if I  
would start, but it's nice to be out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He started two of the final three regular season games, but the  
Braves already had clinched the NL East. Hernandez started all four 
games of the division playoffs against Houston but was only 
1-for-11 (.091) and made an error. 
</P>
<P>
	``The postseason is a chance to contribute. When I wasn't  
playing, I was in the cage early in games just trying to get sharp. 
Actually, I never was sharp. So this is nice, this makes it fun,'' 
Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss made the play of the season for Atlanta with a diving stop  
on Tony Eusebio's line drive up the middle in the 10th inning of 
Game 3 in the NL division series. The Braves escaped a 
bases-loaded, no-out situation, won the game two innings later and 
wrapped up the series the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	On the field prior to the start of Game 1, Weiss was still being  
asked about his remarkable play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard from my perspective to evaluate it,'' he said. ``It  
happened so quick. Afterward, I was like, `What happened?'''

<HEADLINE> Success Rates of Heart Transplants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        A list of the nation's heart transplant centers and their survival  
and death rates. 
</P>
<P>
        The first number is the number of patients put on the waiting  
list for a heart transplant between April 1994 and December 1996. The 
second number is the percent who were alive one year later, adjusted 
for the severity of a center's patients' illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
        The third number is the number of patients on the waiting list  
between April 1994 and December 1997. The fourth number is the percent 
of them who received transplants within one year. The fifth number 
is the percent who died while waiting for a transplant. Both numbers 
are adjusted for severity of illness. 
</P>
<P>
        Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, which  
produced this report, caution that individual numbers may be misleading; 
in a few cases, transplant centers had failed to provide all appropriate 
data, for instance. Generally, the more patients, the more reliable 
the data.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Grains Advance / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures jumped higher today in early  
trading on the Chicago Board of Trade on news that key growing 
areas in South America are bone-dry as planting season nears. 
Grains also advanced sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans opened slightly higher amid dry conditions in key  
northern Brazil growing areas, then leaped over the $5-a-bushel 
barrier. Prices increased 2 percent in the first 45 minutes of

York, where prices also soared in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn also advanced as buyers anticipated a crop update report  
later in the day by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Solid 
harvest progress is expected into next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures rose after a long-range weather forecast called  
for no precipitation in the U.S. winter wheat belt for the next 
week or more, possibly causing problems for the newly planted crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 4 1/2 cents to $2.58 a bushel;  
December corn rose 3 3/4 cents to $2.02 1/2 a bushel; December oats rose

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Announces Schedule for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The 2000 Winston Cup schedule,  
announced Tuesday by NASCAR, is a virtual carbon copy of this 
year's 34-race slate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Helton, senior vice president and CEO of NASCAR, said the  
only change involves the spring race at Bristol Motor Speedway 
flip-flopping weekends with Texas Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have spent the last several years building the NASCAR  
Winston Cup Series schedule into an extremely strong lineup,'' 
Helton said. ``The schedule includes NASCAR's typical assortment of 
superspeedway, short track and road course excitement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The schedule includes points events at 21 tracks from coast to  
coast. Two non-points events, the Bud Shootout at Daytona 
International Speedway and The Winston at Lowe's Motor Speedway, 
will be run again in addition to the 34 championship races. 
</P>
<P>
	The season will be in Daytona Beach with the Daytona 500 on Feb.  
20 and conclude on Nov. 19 at Atlanta Motor Speedway.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Governor Rejects E-Mail Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Privacy advocates say California has lost  
the chance to clarify whether companies have a right to monitor 
employees' e-mail and punish them for transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
	As hundreds of companies implement monitoring policies, a bill  
vetoed Sunday by Gov. Gray Davis would have required those doing 
business in the state to notify employees in writing of such 
action. Davis said the law would infringe on employers' rights and 
leave them open to unjust lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy  
Information Center, a non-profit research group, called Davis' veto 
``befuddling.'' Some states are considering banning e-mail 
monitoring altogether as a cottage industry evolves to make it 
easier for companies to snoop, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a Democrat, likened e-mail monitoring to other employer  
rights, such as the right to limit personal long-distance phone 
calls. He also noted that businesses can be sued if employees use 
work computers to defame or harass someone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It therefore follows that any employer has a legitimate need  
to monitor, either on a spot basis or at regular intervals, such 
company property, including e-mail traffic and computer files 
stored on either employer-owned hard drives, diskettes or 
CD-ROMs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of Fortune 1000 companies and six federal  
agencies now use monitoring software to watch over their office 
computers, according to the American Management Association. By 
2001, 80 percent of large companies are expected to be using such 
software, according to International Data Corp., a research firm in 
Framingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers say they want only to improve productivity, ferret out  
computer products that could malfunction in 2000 and avoid legal 
problems, such as leaking company secrets or someone sending racist 
or harassing computer messages. 
</P>
<P>
	But state Democratic Sen. Debra Bowen, who sponsored the  
notification bill, said employees should at least be fully informed 
when a company plans to keep tabs on them electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	``I disagree with the governor's starting point, that equipment  
in a business is always company property,'' Bowen said Monday. 
``Because an employer provides you a restroom, that doesn't give 
him a license to videotape everything you do in there.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST HARTFORD, Conn., (AP) -- British Airways has selected a  
Pratt &AMP; Whitney engine for its new Airbus Industrie A318 aircraft , 
a deal worth more than $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline selected Pratt's PW6000 engine for the new planes.  
British Airways has a firm order for 12 A318s and an option on 12 
more with deliveries beginning in January 2003 as part of its 
effort to revamp its aging fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt &AMP; Whitney Engine Services also was selected to provide a  
long-term fleet management program for the engines. 
</P>
<P>
	The first flight on the A318 will be in 2001 with entry into  
service in 2002, said company President Louis R. Chenevert on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The engine was created for 100-passenger aircraft which  
typically make several flights a day with quick turnarounds. It is 
designed to stay in service for up to 12,000 flights.

<HEADLINE> Financier Parretti Nabbed in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, who engineered  
a takeover of Metro-Goldwin-Mayer in 1990, has been arrested 
pending an extradition request by the United States for a 
MGM-related case. 
</P>
<P>
	Parretti, 57, was taken into custody Monday in Orvieto, a  
hilltop town 70 miles north of Rome, police there said. 
</P>
<P>
	An Italian court must now decide whether Parretti should be  
detained until a hearing can be held on the extradition request. A 
decision was expected later this week, lawyer Francesco Caroleo 
Grimaldi was quoted as saying by Italian papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Parretti bought MGM in 1990 for $1.3 billion, using loans raised  
by French bank Credit Lyonnais. 
</P>
<P>
	After he defaulted on a $888 million loan, Credit Lyonnais  
seized the Hollywood studio and removed Parretti, accusing him of 
mismanagement -- a decision validated by a court in Delaware, where 
MGM is incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
	Parretti was later convicted in Delaware of perjury and evidence  
tampering, and fled the United States in January 1997, before he 
could be sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been in Italy ever since.  
</P>
<P>
	France is also seeking Parretti's extradition, after a court in  
Paris convicted him on corruption charges and sentenced him in 
absentia to four years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Tonya Harding Making Pro Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- When Tonya Harding makes her professional  
debut next week at a small arena in West Virginia, she'll skate to 
the sounds of ZZ Top while wearing a turquoise and purple dress. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding is determined to have a little fun in her first  
competition since the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, and she doesn't 
particularly care whether it leads to any more offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very excited that I got this second chance,'' she said  
Tuesday. ``If something comes from this, great, but if it doesn't, 
that's OK too. I take life day by day. I just want to go out there 
and have fun and skate well. Win or lose, it doesn't matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harding, who turns 29 next month, will perform in the Pro  
Skating Championships in Huntington, W.Va., next Monday and 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Her adviser, Michael Rosenberg, said the event's promoter told  
him about one-third of the 5,780-seat Huntington Civic Arena's 
tickets have been sold, but that he expected a sellout by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my concern how many tickets they sell in West  
Virginia, which is not skating territory,'' Rosenberg said. ``It's 
how many million people see it on ESPN.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The network will air the competition on tape delay Oct. 25, Nov.  
1 and Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding, implicated in a 1994 attack on rival skater Nancy  
Kerrigan, is banned for life from competing in an amateur event. 
But the U.S. Figure Skating Association has no jurisdiction over 
professional events. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding announced her comeback plans in February, but Rosenberg  
wasn't able to put together a deal. The big-ticket professional 
revues, and many skaters, had been leery of appearing on the same 
ice as her. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding is unfazed, saying she only skates for her fans now.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there's people who do not want me back in the skating  
world,'' she said. ``But that's their problem. Skating is my life. 
It's all I know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harding will skate the technical and artistic programs. Others  
entered in the competition include Surya Bonaly, Elizabeth Manley, 
Tonia Kwiatkowski and Pasha Grischuk. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing on local talk shows, Harding looks fit and much more  
trim than she was in Lillehammer, where she finished eighth after a 
broken shoelace and the enormous pressure made her weep. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrigan won the silver medal, just weeks after a shadowy thug  
whacked her on the knee during the U.S. Championships in Detroit. 
Harding later pleaded guilty to hindering prosecution, resulting in 
$160,000 in fines and 500 hours of community service. Her 
ex-husband and two other men served time in jail for planning the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than practices at a local mall, Harding last skated in  
public in February 1997, during a two-minute exhibition between 
periods at a minor league hockey game in Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding has turned down several other opportunities, including  
one to wrestle in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had many, many offers to do things that for myself are  
not acceptable,'' she said. ``I've turned down things that were in 
the six-digit range because I have high morals and standards for 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As memories of her past fade, Harding also is becoming more  
accepted in her hometown. A recent practice session at the mall was 
met with some applause from the crowds that always gather to watch 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a 60-40 split,'' she said. ``It used to be zero.''  
</P>
<P>
	She said she's looking forward to the less-rigid structure of a  
pro event. Her odd musical selections range ZZ Top's heavy 
metal-tinged ``Sleeping Bag'' to David Sanborn to a song by a group 
called Funky Green Dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I picked out music that's very fun for me.''

<HEADLINE> Four Elected to Track Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Bill Rodgers, a four-time winner of both the  
Boston and New York City marathons, will join three others to be 
inducted to the National Track and Field Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers, former world triple jump record-holder Willie Banks,  
former NCAA and Olympic hurdles champion Charles Moore, and former 
Princeton track coach Larry Ellis, will be inducted in Los Angeles 
on Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The 51-year-old Rodgers, who competed at Wesleyan University,  
finished third in the world cross country championships in 1975 and 
won his first Boston Marathon a month later. He later won four U.S. 
distance titles and set two American marathon records. His time of 
2 hours, 9 minutes and 28 seconds in winning the 1979 Boston 
Marathon still is fifth-best among all U.S. runners. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks, 43, a two-time NCAA runner-up at UCLA, set his first  
American record in 1981 and set a world record of 58 feet, 11 1/2 
inches at the national championships in Indianapolis in 1985, when 
he was named U.S. Olympic Committee athlete of the year. Banks was 
a member of the 1980, 1984 and 1988 Olympic teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, 70, never lost a 400-meter hurdles race. He broke the  
intermediate hurdles world record three times and won two Olympic 
medals in 1952. He also was the NCAA 220-yard hurdles champion in 
1951. Recently retired as athletic director at Cornell, Moore now 
is a member of the USOC board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis, who died last year, was a middle distance runner at New  
York University. He coached 13 years at Jamaica (N.Y.) High School 
before going to Princeton in 1970, where he coached Bob Beamon, 
former world record holder in the long jump, and Craig Masback, now 
the head of USA Track &AMP; Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis was U.S. men's coach of the 1984 Olympic and 1998 World  
Cup teams and was president of USATF from 1992-96. 
</P>
<P>
	``This induction ceremony will have a special meaning for me,''  
Masback said. ``Larry Ellis was an inspiration to me as my college 
coach, and Willie Banks and Bill Rodgers were my contemporaries. 
Charlie Moore remains one of our legendary performers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four inductees bring to 180 the number of members in the  
Hall of Fame, located in the RCA Dome in Indianapolis.

<HEADLINE> India Worries Over Pakistan Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's army was on high alert at the  
border and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee held a crisis 
meeting Tuesday night after a military takeover in neighboring 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a serious development for ... Kashmir,'' said a senior  
officer in the northern command in Kashmir, speaking on condition 
of anonymity. Border disputes over Kashmir have prompted two wars 
between India and Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	India's Cabinet Committee on Security will meet Wednesday  
immediately after Vajpayee is sworn in for another term of office, 
said Ashok Tandon, the prime minister's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee, who was re-elected in a monthlong vote that ended Oct.  
3, had said that one of his new government's first tasks would be 
to restart peace talks with Pakistan that were disrupted by recent 
fighting in Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani troops took over state-run media Tuesday, closed  
airports and announced that the democratically elected government 
had been removed after the prime minister tried to fire the army 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports coming from Pakistan ``are causing grave concern,''  
Tandon said. ``We are monitoring the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee met for about an hour with Foreign Minister Jaswant  
Singh, Home Minister L.K. Advani and National Security Adviser 
Brajesh Mishra. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prime minister is keeping constant touch with the  
embassy'' in Islamabad, Tandon said. ``Everyone is safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan and India have fought three wars since they became  
independent from Britain in 1947, and their forces fought from May 
to July this year when the Indian army discovered Pakistan-based 
intruders in parts of Kashmir claimed by India. 
</P>
<P>
	Both nations tested nuclear weapons last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Security analysts in New Delhi said an unstable Pakistan would  
have ominous portents for the entire South Asian region. 
</P>
<P>
	``India should remain alert and give a clear message that any  
mischief will be met with a swift, clear and overwhelming 
response,'' said J.N. Dixit, former Indian foreign secretary, 
according to the United News of India.

<HEADLINE> Sound Bites: Audio Reviews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Puccini's ``La Boheme,'' opera in 4 acts (Decca) -- starring  
Angela Gheorghiu, Roberto Alagna, Elisabetta Scano, Simon 
Keenlyside, Roberto de Candia and Ildebrando D'Arcangelo. Chorus 
and orchestra of La Scala, conducted by Riccardo Chailly. A 2-CD 
set. 

</P>
<P>
	The opportunity for another album featuring opera's Most Famous  
Married Couple provides an answer to the obvious question: Why 
another recording of ``La Boheme''? 
</P>
<P>
	And fans of the Romanian soprano and French-Sicilian tenor won't  
be disappointed, as both are captured here in fine voice. Alagna 
sounds fresh and strong, investing the familiar ``Che gelida 
manina'' with youthful fervor and tenderness. Perhaps he overdoes 
the sobbing a bit at Mimi's death, but that's a common failing. 
Gheorghiu, always the superior of the two vocally, is radiant, 
especially in her upper register. Her soprano is incisive without 
ever turning harsh, and she maintains a remarkably even sound 
throughout her range. 
</P>
<P>
	Decca has supplied a generally strong supporting cast,  
especially the estimable English baritone Simon Keenlyside, who 
makes a particularly warm and sympathetic Marcello. The one weak 
link is the young Italian soprano Elisabetta Scano, a shrill and 
quavery Musetta. 
</P>
<P>
	Riccardo Chailly conducts a first-rate performance by orchestra  
and chorus, which must know this music in their sleep. The program 
notes proclaim this the ``first studio recording of the new 
critical edition,'' but only scholars are likely to hear a 
difference -- a few notes for a flute in Act 1, a new phrase for the 
chorus in Act 2. 
</P>
<P>
	-- By Mike Silverman, Associated Press Writer.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Renee Fleming Sings Strauss Heroines'' (Decca) -- with Barbara  
Bonney and Susan Graham. Christoph Eschenbach conducts the Vienna 
Philharmonic. 

</P>
<P>
	Renee Fleming seems to be at that magical point in her career  
where she can tackle just about any role and sing it definitively. 
Her vocalism on this collection of scenes from Richard Strauss 
operas is, in a word, ravishing. And the maturity she brings to the 
characterizations and the delicate shading she imparts to the 
German words put her interpretations on a par with such 
standard-setters of the postwar years as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and 
Lisa Della Casa. 
</P>
<P>
	The selections here are few but extended. From ``Der  
Rosenkavalier'' we get the Marschallin's Act 1 monologue, in which 
she ruminates about her inevitable loss of youth, and the ending of 
Act 3, from the sublime trio through the ecstatic duet for Octavian 
and Sophie. From ``Arabella,'' there's the Act 1 duet for the 
heroine and her sister, Zdenka; from ``Capriccio,'' the Countess' 
long final monologue. 
</P>
<P>
	It's hard to imagine better vocal support than that provided by  
soprano Barbara Bonney and mezzo Susan Graham. The sound of their 
voices blending together in the Rosenkavalier trio is enough to 
melt the hardest heart, despite the eccentrically slow tempo chosen 
by conductor Christoph Eschenbach. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Arabella duet, my own favorite on the album, Bonney is a  
wonderful partner, tracing her high-lying vocal part with warmth 
and silver purity. The ``Capriccio'' selection shows Fleming more 
than ready to take up the mantle of this autumnal role from Dame 
Kiri te Kanawa, who has made it a specialty in recent years. 
</P>

	``Jaze'' (Universal) -- Jaze  

</P>
<P>
	Truth be told, there's nothing particularly jazzy about Jaze, a  
new all-male soul quartet out of Orlando, Fla. Unlike some other 
male groups, their lyrics aren't dripping with sexual references 
and their voices aren't overshadowed by overused musical hooks. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's probably what makes their self-entitled debut so  
refreshing. It's just pure music, pure harmonizing, and that makes 
for a pure enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
	In the vein of Boyz II Men, Jaze's emphasis is on mid-tempo  
grooves or slow love ballads, like ``Have You Ever,'' or the 
dreamy, wistful ``Fly Away.'' The group co-wrote seven tracks on 
the disc. But the real draw here listening to the blending voices 
of the group -- Larry Ballard, John Gibson, Chauncy Jackson and Jose 
Perez. In fact, their best vocal performance is done a capella -- 
their beautiful, serene version of ``The Lord's Prayer.

	``What Does It Take'' (N-Coded Music) -- Candy Dulfer  

</P>
<P>
	Saxophonist Candy Dulfer has toured with artists like Madonna,  
Pink Floyd and the Artist formerly known as Prince. So it's 
probably no surprise that she dabbles in just about every style of 
music on her latest release, ``What Does It Take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that that's a bad thing. What could have been a disastrous  
case of trying to appeal to all genres actually comes across as a 
great musical melting pot that keeps your attention on each track. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grammy-nominated Dulfer sounds very Prince-like on ``2025,''  
a funky jam that features her performing both alto sax and vocals. 
Then, on the remake of ``What Does It Take to Win Your Love,'' 
Dulfer takes a back seat and allows the Jonathan Butler, the South 
African guitarist/vocalist, to take center stage, singing on the 
more mellow tune. 
</P>
<P>
	She even infuses a little Caribbean sound on ``Island Lady,''  
that features her saxophonist father, Hans Dulfer. But her use of 
different sounds doesn't sound forced or contrived. It's just 
entertaining.

	``Jellycream'' (RCA Records) -- Bramhall  

</P>
<P>
	Doyle Bramhall II keeps the blues in his back pocket for his  
second solo effort, ``Jellycream.'' It's a guitar-driven recording 
that showcases the six-string talents of ``Bramhall,'' his new, 
two-syllable, one-word moniker. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a tough edge to the music with purposeful solos and  
crisp production. There's also some honest songwriting, done by 
Bramhall in collaboration with Chris Bruce, who also sings backup 
and plays bass and guitar on some of the tracks. Son of Texas 
bluesman Doyle Bramhall, the younger is best known for his work 
with the Fabulous Thunderbirds, his own former band, Arc Angels, 
and, most recently, as lead guitarist on tour with Pink Floyd 
founder Roger Waters. Such diverse influences came together to help 
Bramhall make a strong sophomore showing.

	``What Is Hip?'' (Warner Archives/Rhino Records) -- Tower of  
Power 

</P>
<P>
	To answer what is hip, listen to ``Soul With a Capital 'S''' on  
the new Tower of Power anthology. It captures everything about one 
of the country's best known multiracial soul bands. It sets up with 
a funky guitar riff backed by the powerful TOP horn section and it 
lays out in words the band's love for the music that won't let you 
sit still. Founders Emillio Castillo and Stephen ``Doc'' Kupka 
teamed up in 1968 in Oakland, Calif. and have been laying down a 
steady groove for more than 30 years since. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Is Hip?'' delivers 35 cuts from the band's history.  
Amazingly, the band's style has hung together through lineup 
changes and the pressures generated by the public's constantly 
changing tastes. Certainly, TOP wouldn't sell today like it did in 
the funk-driven era of disco in the 1970s. Still, the music has 
strong appeal across time. Great party music never dies.

	Wilt Chamberlain Is Dead  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Wilt Chamberlain, the 7-foot-1 Hall of Famer  
who dominated the NBA in the 1960s, died today at 63, the Los 
Angeles Lakers said. Chamberlain's body was found by authorities 
called to his Bel-Air home shortly after noon PDT. He might have 
had a heart attack, according to a fire department spokesman. 
Called ``Wilt the Stilt,'' Chamberlain played from 1959 to 1973 for 
the Philadelphia (later the San Francisco) Warriors, the 
Philadelphia 76ers and the Lakers. He scored 31,419 points and 
averaged 30.1 points per game. He was named MVP and rookie of the 
year in 1959, and MVP from 1966 through 1968.

	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistani troops staged a coup  
against the democratically elected government Tuesday, seizing 
state-run media and confining the prime minister to his home in a 
move that raised tensions in the world's newest nuclear region. In 
a TV address, Army Chief Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf accused the 
government of ``systematically destroying'' state institutions and 
driving the economy toward collapse. Sharif was under apparent 
house arrest in Islamabad hours after he tried to fire Musharraf.

	Nuclear Test Ban Is Debated  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hopelessly outnumbered, Senate supporters of a  
global ban on nuclear testing mounted a last-ditch effort today to 
persuade majority-party Republicans to delay a vote on the pact. 
Republican leaders dashed cold water on one Democratic strategy. 
But efforts were advancing on several other fronts to come up with 
a plan for a delay that would save face for both sides without 
forcing a party-line vote. Trying to meet one Republican demand, 
the Democrats promised not to press again for Senate action on the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty before 2001. The Republicans don't 
want the issue revived as presidential-year election issue.

	Clinton: Help World's Poor

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says the world's nations  
must work harder to erase the grinding poverty in which many people 
spend their lives. He was responding to estimates by the United 
Nations that the world's population hit the 6 billion mark. ``We 
must refuse to accept a future in which one part of humanity lives 
on the cutting edge of a new economy, while another part lives on 
the edge of survival,'' Clinton said.

	U.S. Has $1 Billion Surplus  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government ran a $1 billion  
surplus excluding Social Security in the last fiscal year, the 
Congressional Budget Office estimated today. It would be the first 
such surplus since 1960. The fiscal 1999 surplus would have been 
larger had congressional Republicans and President Clinton not 
agreed to $21 billion in ``emergency'' spending for defense and 
domestic programs, including $15 billion for Kosovo, aid to U.S. 
farmers.

Technology was honored for using the rapid-fire laser flashes that 
illuminate the motion of atoms in a molecule, the Royal Swedish 
Academy of Sciences said. Two Dutch researchers, Gerardus 't Hooft

forecasts. The world's largest manufacturer of semiconductors 
earned $1.9 billion, or 55 cents a share, in the three months ended 
Sept. 26, excluding one-time expenses related to acquisitions of 
other companies. It was a strong improvement from last year's

anxious about interest rates, found themselves nervous about 
third-quarter earnings reports as well. The Dow Jones industrial 
average ended down 231.12 at 10,417.06. On the NYSE, losers led 
gainers 2,175-866. The Nasdaq composite index fell 43.50 to

<HEADLINE> Testimony Clarifies Hiss Indictment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was one thing in the late 1940s for the  
communist threat to lurk far away behind the Iron Curtain, quite 
another for Reds to be working in the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
	Red hysteria swept the nation. A young congressman from  
California named Richard Nixon was determined to expose Alger Hiss, 
a State Department official, as a communist. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearful that a grand jury might not indict Hiss, Nixon, a member  
of the Red-hunting House Committee on Un-American Activities, 
boldly requested to testify himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, 4,200 pages of secret testimony given before the grand  
jury were made public, and they show -- as historians expected -- 
that Nixon lobbied strongly for Hiss' indictment. But while he 
argued convincingly, historians who have read the testimony say he 
did it with masterful, clever oratory, not blatant manipulation of 
the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing at a news conference, Hiss' son, Tony, said his late  
father was convinced that the transcripts ``contained important 
information which would help him demonstrate both his innocence and 
patriotism and the cruel and bizarre unfairness of the case against 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the transcripts are likely to raise new questions about  
the reliability of his father's accuser, Whittaker Chambers, and 
about the ``propriety and truthfulness of the astonishing 
last-minute appearance before the grand jury by Congressman Richard 
M. Nixon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Days before Nixon testified, Chambers, a senior editor at Time  
magazine and a former member of the Communist Party, had led 
investigators outside his farmhouse near Westminster, Md., and 
retrieved microfilm he'd hidden in a hollowed-out pumpkin -- 
evidence, he said, of Hiss' complicity in a communist spy ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am here solely as a messenger for the House,'' Nixon told  
the grand jury. ``I have the microfilm in my physical custody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jurors wanted the ``pumpkin papers.'' Nixon refused,  
citing House rules. He didn't want to give the film to a grand jury 
impaneled by a Justice Department that was run by the Truman 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury foreman again asked Nixon for the film. Nixon  
refused and suggested the matter be decided by a court. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he said: ``Regardless of a ruling of the court, I will not  
part with the films. If the films go into evidence, I go with 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later the grand jury, which did eventually get the  
films entered into evidence, indicted Hiss on two counts of perjury 
-- one for having lied about not giving classified State Department 
papers to Chambers and the other for lying about when he last saw 
Chambers. 
</P>
<P>
	Transcripts of the testimony show Chambers was a repeat witness  
before the initial grand jury that indicted Hiss and a second 
impaneled right afterward to conduct a broader probe of communist 
infiltrators in the government. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 17, 1948, Chambers testified that he was asked to go  
into the communist underground in the summer of 1932 to be a 
liaison between the underground and more public sectors of the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understood that the Communist Party is divided roughly into  
two organizational parts -- the open Communist Party which functions 
as everybody knows, in its public offices, and in the streets and 
in the trade unions, and an unadmitted secret section of the 
Communist Party which is -- which has its own form of organization 
for its own purposes,'' Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was in this capacity that he was allegedly associated with  
Hiss. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiss later went to jail. Nixon went on to become a senator, vice  
president and president. 
</P>
<P>
	But the case that redefined both men's lives never died.  
Historians still debate: Did Hiss get a fair trial? Was he the 
victim of Red hysteria? Was the grand jury process conducted 
appropriately? Did Nixon interfere in the legal process when he 
testified before the grand jury? 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon teased the jurors with the contents of the microfilm, said  
historian Bruce Craig, who has read the testimony. He testified in 
a clever, subtle, masterful way, Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was Nixon's crowning achievement as an orator before his  
Checkers speech,'' Craig said, referring to Nixon's emotional 
televised message in 1952 which kept him from being thrown out as 
Dwight D. Eisenhower's running mate because of slush fund 
allegations. In his talk, Nixon spoke of his daughters' puppy, 
Checkers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the Hiss case that completely changed the public's  
perception of domestic communism,'' Nixon wrote in his memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
	The thousands of pages of transcripts will yield more clues.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that this will not end debate, but give each side more  
ammunition,'' said David Vladeck, a lawyer for the group of 
scholars and historical associations that petitioned a federal 
court for the release of the papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand jury testimony is almost always sealed in perpetuity. But  
last year, Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group that works to 
open government records, petitioned for the release of the six 
volumes of grand jury documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the group argued the records could be opened because  
50 years had passed, all major figures in the case have died and 
the records have historical value that overrides the need to keep 
grand jury records secret. In May, U.S. District Judge Peter 
Leisure of the Southern District of New York ordered the government 
to unseal the testimony.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Protection of Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton hopes to preserve as many as  
40 million acres of federally owned forest -- an area the size of 
Virginia and West Virginia combined -- as roadless areas protected 
from development. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was traveling to the George Washington National  
Forest today to announce details of the preservation plan, which is 
already under attack from Western Republican lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House hopes the forest plan will afford Clinton a  
permanent environmental legacy. Earlier this year, Clinton proposed 
a $1 billion ``land legacy'' initiative to purchase open spaces, 
but that has been largely thwarted by Republicans in Congress, who 
refused to fund it. 
</P>
<P>
	The forest protection plan would require no congressional  
action, relying on regulations to be issued by the U.S. Forest 
Service after a detailed environmental review and public comments, 
said government sources, speaking on condition of not being further 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, about 18 percent of the 192 million acres of federal  
forest is protected as wilderness. About 60 million acres are 
without roads, or signs of logging, mining and other development. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan would cover isolated forest areas of 5,000 acres  
or more and would affect road-building and other development in 35 
states, most of them in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be one of the most significant land conservation  
actions by the United States government in its history,'' said 
Richard Hoppe, a spokesman for the Heritage Forests Campaign, a 
coalition of conservation groups that has pressed for protection of 
roadless forest areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Roads open forest areas to development, erosion and pollution.  
They also disrupt wildlife, plantlife and natural systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Roadless federal land also contains some of the most desirable  
timber owned by the Forest Service. Timber companies and their 
allies in Congress oppose any effort to close off future 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's trying to be Teddy Roosevelt,'' snapped Rep.  
Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., in whose district Clinton will make his 
announcement. He said Clinton is trying to please environmentally 
conscious voters at the expense of preserving healthy forests. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, accused Clinton of ``an agenda  
against public use'' contrary to Congress' intended policy of 
multiple use of federal lands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very extremist,'' said Henson Moore, president of the  
American Forest and Paper Association.

<HEADLINE> Price 'Drives' Home Point to Garcia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) -- Nick Price has some advice for  
Spanish golfing prodigy Sergio Garcia: improve your driving game. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, the 19-year-old who led Spain to the Dunhill Cup title  
Sunday at St. Andrews, defeated Price 67-70 in a third-round match 
on the Old Course. They could meet again Friday in the 
quarterfinals of the World Match Play championship at Wentworth. 
</P>
<P>
	Price, one of four seeds, along with defending champion Mark  
O'Meara, Ernie Els and Colin Montgomerie, said Garcia will have to 
make some ``refinements'' to win on the narrow fairways used in the 
U.S. Open and U.S. PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``His (Garcia's) short game right now is about as good as  
anyone's I have ever seen,'' Price said. ``It is something about 
that Spanish blood. None of them (Seve Ballesteros, Jose Maria 
Olazabal and Garcia) drive the ball well, but they all chip and 
putt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to drive the ball well to win major championships,''  
Price added. ``You saw at Carnoustie (British Open) this year where 
he (Garcia) had a horiffic first round (89) ... so there are 
certain golf courses where he's going to struggle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's pairings: Craig Parry, Australia vs. Paul Lawrie,  
Scotland (winner faces O'Meara); Garcia, Spain vs. Retief Goosen, 
South Africa (winner faces Price); Carlos Franco, Paraguay, vs. 
Padraig Harrington, Ireland (winner faces Els); Jose Maria 
Olazabal, Spain vs. Notah Begay, United States (winner faces 
Montgomerie). 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie, who pulled out of the Dunhill Cup with a toothache,  
said he was ``more or less certain to play'' in the World Match 
Play. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe's top-ranked player has a severe inflammation of his  
mouth and is due to have a tooth removed next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I should be all right,'' Montgomerie said Tuesday.  
``It's become the most famous tooth in the world, and I've found 
that when I swing it hurts my chin.

<HEADLINE> King Holiday To Be Flag-Display Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Martin Luther King Jr. holiday would be  
added to the list of nine federal holidays on which Americans are 
encouraged to display the U.S. flag under legislation the House 
passed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, introduced by Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas, also  
encourages Americans ``to honor the nation's greatest civil rights 
leader in the same way that other historic figures are remembered 
during federal holidays,'' said a statement released by the House 
Republican Conference. It was passed by voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would amend a section of the U.S. code referred to as  
the ``flag code,'' which describes the rules and customs 
surrounding the proper display of the flag. The code, for example, 
says that ``the flag should be hoisted briskly and lowered 
ceremoniously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress approved the King holiday in 1983, but due to an  
oversight, failed to add it to the list. The King holiday is 
celebrated on the third Monday of January. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal holidays currently in the flag code are New Year's  
Day, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor 
Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed the bill in June.

<HEADLINE> Friend Called in Gingrich Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- Newt Gingrich filed a motion asking a judge  
for permission to question one of his wife's longtime friends in 
their pending divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Villio of Warren, Ohio, served as a witness to a 1987  
separation agreement between Gingrich and his wife, Marianne. Ms. 
Villio and Mrs. Gingrich, who grew up near Warren, have been 
friends since the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion, filed Monday in Cobb County Superior Court, was not  
specific about what the former U.S. House speaker hopes to learn 
from Ms. Villio. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gingrich already has received permission to question a  
number of her husband's friends and associates, and a judge has 
ruled that a 33-year-old congressional aide, Callista Bisek, must 
testify about her relationship with Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bisek tried to block the subpoena, but a judge in Washington  
last week found her arguments to be ``without merit.'' A decision 
is pending on what documents Ms. Bisek must turn over. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, 56, separated from his wife of 18 years on May 10 and  
filed for divorce July 29. He had stepped down as House speaker and 
resigned from Congress after the Republicans' relatively weak 
showing in last November's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The earlier separation, in 1987, lasted several years before the  
Gingriches reconciled in late 1993 or early 1994, Gingrich's 
attorney has said.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Hail The Great Pumpkin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- The growing popularity of Halloween is  
turning into a treat for the New York state pumpkin industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The gourds are sold at roadside stands, farmers' markets,  
grocery stores and street corners. It's all added up to putting New 
York state on the pumpkin map as the No. 2 producer in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big cash crop nowadays,'' fruit and vegetable grower  
Paul Grisamore of Cayuga County told the Syracuse newspapers. 
``Everyone's raising them. We used to be the only one growing them 
... but Halloween's the fastest-growing holiday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For farmers, pumpkins are easy to grow, require little  
attention, and add a cash crop just in time to help get the family 
through the winter. For dairy farmers, who have usually just 
finished getting the hay stored, and cash crop farmers like apple 
growers, pumpkin season offers another product for the market. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's drought this spring and summer did not hurt most  
pumpkin patches. Some farmers say their pumpkins are a bit smaller 
than average, but they generally look good. Prices range from 25 
cents a pound to $4 for picked pumpkins.

	New York farmers planted 5,100 acres in pumpkins in 1997, an  
increase of 1,000 acres from 1992. It's now enough to make New York 
No. 2 after Illinois, according to the New York Agriculture and 
Markets Department's most recent statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pumpkins are becoming more and more a popular commodity for  
New York state farm families,'' said Pete Gregg, a department 
spokesman. ``They're easy to grow and farmers are getting a good 
price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Sheils started growing and selling pumpkins about 10 years  
ago after some friends at Cornell University suggested he try. 
Sheils, a 1989 Cornell graduate, runs a roadside stand on his 
family farm near King Ferry in Cayuga County. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little skeptical, but it has turned into a  
moneymaker,'' Sheils said.

	GREENVILLE, N.H. (AP) -- While New Hampshire leaf-peepers argue  
whether the foliage is as good as it could be, there's no argument 
about another October touchstone -- pumpkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers say it's been a fine year, with the drought having no  
effect on the crop. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crop has been excellent. The drought didn't really effect  
it; we didn't even irrigate,'' said Mat McQuesten of his family's 
farm in Litchfield, echoing the comments of many area growers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers are great, and the quality is right up there,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got mega-pumpkins, '' said Windy Hill Orchard owner Tim  
Washburn. 
</P>
<P>
	A host of varieties is available, from jack-o'-lanterns to those  
destined for pies. 
</P>
<P>
	The crop is almost too good, especially with Canadian farmers  
``flooding the market,'' Washburn said. ``Because of that, we've 
got more than we can sell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leftovers will be fed to cattle or pigs, or harrowed back into  
the soil. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm stands in southern New Hampshire report that the season  
turned out fine for many fruits and vegetables despite the drought. 
</P>
<P>
	As for pumpkins, ``I don't think most people have an idea of all  
the different varieties available'' said Kris Mossey at McLeod's 
Farm in Milford. ``I like 'fat boys' myself. I just love the 
name,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While most new varieties aim to make the pumpkin more popular in  
the kitchen, the University of New Hampshire recently developed a 
variety with seeds that can be eaten without being shelled.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Arrive in NYC Exhausted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees were hoping their AL  
championship series opponent would come into town hurting. They 
didn't expect to have their own worries to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Boston Red Sox arrived today, New York hoped to find out  
whether Paul O'Neill's fractured rib would keep him out of the 
league championship series, which starts at Yankee Stadium on 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, who hasn't played since Thursday, intended to take  
batting practice, along with running and outfield drills. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll go out and see if it's possible to play,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill was injured Oct. 2 when he crashed into a low fence  
chasing a foul ball at Tampa Bay, then went 1-for-4 in each of the 
first two games of the AL playoffs against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre benched him for the clincher,  
convinced the injury was hampering O'Neill. The team sent the 
36-year-old outfielder to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center on 
Monday for new X-rays and an MRI, which showed a small fracture of 
the 10th rib on his right side. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, I guess, it shows up later,'' O'Neill said in the  
parking lot outside Yankee Stadium after returning from the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston, which finished four games back in the AL East and won  
the wild card, has a different problem going into the best-of-7 
series. Pedro Martinez, who won Monday night's 12-8 thriller with 
six hitless innings of relief, won't be available to start until 
Game 3 at Fenway Park on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother, Ramon, probably will start the opener against  
Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be great series. Its going to be exciting,''  
Ramon said amidst Boston's celebration at Jacobs Field. ``Each game 
we played during the regular season was exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York was just 4-8 against Boston, including three straight  
losses at Yankee Stadium from Sept. 10-12 that cut its AL East to 
3 1/2 games. The only other teams to win their season series against 
the defending World Series champions were Anaheim and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Yankees got their wish -- their opponent's pitching is  
pooped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping for a 21-inning game tonight,'' general manager  
Brian Cashman said before Monday night's game. ``I'm hoping for an 
extra-inning, rain-delayed slugfest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the first time the Yankees and their traditional  
rival have met in postseason play. New York's win at Fenway Park in 
the 1978 tiebreaker for the AL East is considered a regular-season 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosters for the championship series must be set by 10 a.m. EDT  
Wednesday, and the Yankees won't make any decisions until then, 
according to Cashman. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, who hit .285 this season with 19 homers and 110s RBIs,  
is an intense competitor who plays through pain. In 1996, he 
hobbled on a torn hamstring for much of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Joe Torre and the medical staff will be able to see  
how debilitating it's going to be,'' Cashman said. 
</P>
<P>
	If O'Neill can't play for the start of the best-of-7 series, the  
Yankees probably would activate Shane Spencer, who wasn't on the 
roster for the first-round sweep of Texas. O'Neill's teammates 
still hope he'll be able to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``With him in there, we have a hitter capable of producing a lot  
of runs,'' Darryl Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
	To open a spot if O'Neill is questionable, New York probably  
would cut either Clay Bellinger, used mostly as a pinch runner, or 
pitcher Hideki Irabu, who didn't pitch against the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez was 2-1 with a 2.70 ERA against Boston during the  
regular season after going 1-0 versus the Red Sox last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He allowed two hits in eight shutout innings during the playoff  
opener and is 3-0 with an 0.41 ERA in three postseason starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre must decide whether to follow his first-round rotation --  
Andy Pettitte in Game 2 and Roger Clemens in Game 3 -- or try to 
insert David Cone, who didn't pitch against Texas because the 
series never got to a fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Mercker is likely to pitch Game 2 for the Red Sox.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Plunge Affects Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The overnight plunge on Wall Street took its toll  
on Asian markets early Wednesday, with exchanges from Japan to 
Australia opening sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders attributed the stock swoons to a mix of reaction to the  
231.12-point dive in the Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday 
and domestic economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Market players, however, said the impact would be limited.  
</P>
<P>
	``The market is a little cautious today,'' said Woon Ha, a  
dealer at Daiwa Securities in Singapore. ``It's taking the U.S. 
market as a source of direction. The market will be a bit soft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The losses in New York were dramatic. The Dow closed at  
10,417.06 in the average's 10th biggest point drop in history, and 
the steepest since May 27, when the blue-chip index fell 235.23 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard and  
Poor's 500 fell 22.17 to 1,313.04, and the Nasdaq composite index 
fell 43.52 to 2,872.43, retreating from the new record close of 
2,915.95 set Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	That had an immediate impact in Asia. In Tokyo, the benchmark  
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 253.69 points, or 1.40 percent, 
to 17,837.12 at the end of the morning session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Straits Times Index in Singapore was down 29.20 points, or  
1.38 percent, shortly after opening. Hong Kong blue chips also 
tumbled: by midmorning, the Hang Seng Index was off 2.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern about the dollar and bond prices helped drag down the  
market in New York. In Asia other factors were also at work, either 
adding to the depressing effect of Wall Street or acting to buoy 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the market was also pushed down by disappointment that  
the central bank will probably not act to blunt the advance of the 
yen against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in Japan are worried that the strengthening yen could choke  
off a delicate economic recovery by making Japanese exports too 
expensive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were also largely sidelined early Wednesday ahead of a  
Bank of Japan meeting later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors have adopted a strong wait-and-see attitude,''  
Hidenori Karaki, general manager at Tokyo Mitsubishi-Personal 
Securities, said Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taipei, shares recovered from a 38.61-point drop at the  
opening of the market when investors shrugged off the news from New 
York, snapping up low-priced plastics and paper issues to boost the 
Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange 43.36 points, or 
0.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's rotational buying. We think shares of semiconductor  
makers will also outperform in coming sessions as the global 
semiconductor industry continues to recover,'' said Jessica Huang, 
manager at Jih Sun Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the large point loss on Wall Street, traders in Asia  
showed signs of becoming accustomed to the Dow's volatility. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bangkok, Thai shares fell 1.8 percent at the market's  
opening, in reaction to the Dow and profit-taking from Tuesday's 
sharp 3 percent gain on the Stock Exchange of Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders expected the market to fall back to the level it was  
before climbing Tuesday to 401.36 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly not panic,'' said Eric Holman of SG Asia  
Credit. ``It's that the market rebounded yesterday and we're giving 
up our gains. It's pretty muted.''

<HEADLINE> Raytheon Reportedly Behind Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The defense firm Raytheon is behind schedule or  
over budget on at least a dozen fixed-price Pentagon orders, 
including orders for Tomahawk cruise missiles and reconnaissance 
aircraft, The Wall Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, based in Lexington, Mass., is responsible for any  
differences above the preset contract amounts unless the Pentagon 
agrees to amend the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon disclosed last month it was having difficulties in its  
defense electronics and construction units that will result in a 
third-quarter pretax charge of between $350 million and $450 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Pentagon contracts are included in the charge,  
details of which Raytheon will reveal to financial analysts 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tomahawk, P-3 Orion patrol aircraft and RC-135  
reconnaissance aircraft programs are among the contracts running 
over cost, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the 
company. Other programs in trouble are the shoulder-held Javelin 
missile and a Navy satellite communications system. 
</P>
<P>
	The total value of the programs exceeds $2 billion, with the  
Javelin and Tomahawk programs accounting for about $750 million 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	A Raytheon spokeswoman declined to comment on details of  
meetings her company had with the Pentagon two weeks ago or on 
upcoming investor conferences.

<HEADLINE> Car Lease Down Payments Weighed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: I plan on leasing a car and the dealer is encouraging me to  
put more money down to lower my monthly payments. Is this a good 
idea? 

</P>
<P>
	A: Capital-cost reduction, as it's called, allows dealers to get  
more money up front, but it doesn't necessarily make sense for the 
consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	While it makes sense to put as much money down as you can afford  
when buying a car, that's not the case when leasing, says Jack 
Gillis, a spokesman for the Consumer Federation of America in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	When buying, ``the more you put down up front, the less you'll  
pay in interest. That's a tangible benefit,'' he says. With a 
lease, the total cost is fixed up front anyway, he notes. 
</P>
<P>
	A down payment on a lease could put you at greater financial  
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Should you wreck the car, not only would you lose the money you  
put down, but you also would be out a vehicle. Since you're 
essentially renting the car, your insurance would pay only the 
dealer if something happened to the car, Gillis says. 
</P>
<P>
	What is a reasonable amount to put down on a lease? ``Nothing,''  
Gillis says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole point is that the one benefit of leasing is you  
don't have to put anything down,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Lin Peacock, executive director of dealership operations at the  
National Automobile Dealers Association in McLean, Va., agrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``That defeats the purpose of a lease to begin with, and it's  
not going to affect the monthly payment appreciably,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	For the consumer, that money could be put to better use either  
by investing it or putting it aside for a rainy day, Peacock and 
Gillis agree. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillis adds that if you negotiate the best deal on a lease,  
there should be no need to try to put down money up front to make 
the payments more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the nice things about leasing, is basically you're just  
paying for depreciation on the car instead of paying principal and 
interest'' on a loan, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	That leads to another advantage of leasing: You can often get a  
more expensive car for what you would pay to buy a smaller or 
less-equipped car. That's because a luxury model retains more of 
its value, therefore the difference between what the car is worth 
when the lease begins and when it ends is less than it would be on 
a mid-priced car. 
</P>
<P>
	Although leasing means you'll always have car payments, it also  
means you can always have a car that's under warranty and can get a 
new car every three years, Peacock says. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillis says it's more prudent to buy the car rather than lease  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leasing has all of the headaches and responsibility of car  
ownership, with none of the benefits,'' he says. ``If you can eke 
out a few extra dollars a month, at the end of the loan period you 
have a tangible asset -- you have a vehicle.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall Sharply / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen Wednesday  
morning as traders waited to see if the Bank of Japan would act to 
rein in the yen's recent strength. Tokyo stock prices fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded at 106.34 yen at late morning, 0.06 yen above  
its level of 106.28 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo and also higher than 
106.31 yen in late New York trading Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 253.69 points,  
or 1.40 percent, to 17,837.12 at the end of the morning session. 
The index closed up 28.63 points, or 0.16 percent, Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar moved higher on buying from  
Japanese institutional investors after having slipped earlier on 
selling by Japanese interbank dealers, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders said the greenback's moves would be limited, pending  
the outcome of a Bank of Japan policy board meeting, which began 
Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Market players, however, were not expecting that the central  
bank will increase the domestic money supply as one way of slowing 
the ascent of the yen, which has soared in recent months on 
optimism over Japan's budding economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has regained some ground since last month when  
finance ministers from major countries expressed concern about the 
yen's strength. But the gains have been limited due to market 
skepticism about the BOJ's ability to bring the yen back down. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial authorities fret that too steep a rise in the yen  
could derail economic recovery by reducing demand for Japanese 
goods abroad as a stronger currency makes them more expensive. 
Japan has been struggling to emerge from its worst economic 
downturn in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was trading at 114.62 yen, above  
its level of 113.37 yen late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, share prices fell following a drop on Wall  
Street overnight caution over the BOJ policy meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors have adopted a strong wait-and-see attitude,'' said  
Hidenori Karaki, general manager at Tokyo Mitsubishi-Personal 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Although investors largely expect the central bank to leave its  
zero interest rate policy unchanged, they remain worried about a 
further slide in New York, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading Tuesday in New York, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 231.12 points at 10,417.06 as traders, 
already anxious about interest rates, found themselves nervous 
about third-quarter earnings reports as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 16.20 points, or 1.05 percent, to 1,526.60. The 
TOPIX closed up 11.97 points, or 0.78 percent, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.7900 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.8000 percent. Its 
price rose 0.08 point to 99.22.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Profit Beats Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the largest brokerage firm  
in the United States, reported strong third-quarter earnings 
Tuesday of $572 million, easily beating analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's profits represent earnings of $1.34 a share, a  
nickel more than the $1.29 a share analysts had predicted, 
according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third quarter of 1998, Merrill Lynch reported a loss of  
$173 million, or 48 cents a share, due to a $430 million pretax 
write-off of costs related to staff reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch cited record revenues in both global stock  
underwriting and investment banking, which includes mergers and 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Total third-quarter revenues were $5.27 billion, up from $3.85  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investment banking revenues and asset management and portfolio  
service fees set records, and our global debt and equity businesses 
posted solid trading results despite a more difficult 
environment,'' said Merrill Lynch chairman David Komansky. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, Merrill Lynch posted earnings  
of $1.9 billion, or $4.36 a share, up from $900 million, or $2.14 a 
share, in 1998, when taking into account the $430 million loss 
related to layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine month revenues came to $16 billion, compared to $13.5  
billion a year ago.

	Covenant House Founder Dies at 72  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Rev. Bruce Ritter, who founded the Covenant  
House shelters for homeless teen-agers but was forced to resign 
after several young men accused him of seducing them, is dead at 
72. The Roman Catholic priest had suffered from Hodgkin's disease, 
cancer of the lymph nodes. Ritter had denied the accusations of 
sexual misconduct and was never formally charged. He resigned from 
Covenant House in 1990; in August 1991, Ritter left the Franciscan 
order. At its peak, Covenant House was the largest private child 
care agency in the country.

	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- About 1 million people in the Western  
Pacific are now infected with HIV and the rate of infection is 
rising rapidly in many countries in the region, the World Health 
Organization said today. Last year, WHO officials estimated there 
were about 700,000 HIV infections in the region and 40,000 actual 
cases of AIDS. If left unchecked, they said, the number of HIV 
infections in the region will exceed 1.5 million in 2000.

shut down when an airlock door leading into the reactor came off 
its hinges, engineers said today. Nuclear officials told The 
Associated Press there was no danger of any radioactive leakage and 
repairs would be completed by the end of the month. The incident 
occurred Sept. 30 at the 220-megawatt nuclear power plant at Narora 
110 miles east of the Indian capital New Delhi. The Indian Express 
newspaper, which reported the shut down today, quoted R. 
Chidambaram, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, saying there

	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's earthquake caused an estimated  
$9.2 billion in damage, equal to 3.3 percent of the island's gross 
domestic product, the government said. The damage to buildings and 
homes was the costliest, totaling $6.6 billion, according to the 
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. The 
remaining losses were reported by industry, agriculture and 
transportation, the agency said yesterday in a report. The total 
damage estimate from the 7.6-magnitude quake on Sept. 21 was much 
lower than the $100 billion in damage in Japan after a 
7.2-magnitude quake struck the southern city of Kobe in 1995, the 
report said.

Indonesia's next president in a vote on Oct. 20. Many Golkar 
officials, including party chief Akbar Tandjung, say Habibie should 
remain the party's sole candidate for now.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is directing education and  
health officials to develop ways of enrolling uninsured children in 
federal health insurance for the poor through their schools. 
Clinton, in a speech to the American Academy of Pediatrics today, 
was announcing a campaign to reach children eligible for Medicaid 
and the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. The program 
permits states to offer Medicaid or other insurance to children in 
low-income working families who are not poor enough to qualify for 
traditional Medicaid.

from an impossibly low angle deflected off Buffalo defenseman 
Alexei Zhitnik's skate and wobbled underneath Sabres goaltender 
Dominik Hasek.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Norfolk Southern Corp. has formed a  
subsidiary to sell fiber-optic and microwave capacity to 
telecommunications companies along its 21,600-mile railway system. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications Inc., doing  
business as ``T-Cubed,'' will sell the bandwidth as a wholesaler to 
providers of telephone, Internet and cable TV service. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other railroad operators, the parent company of Norfolk  
Southern Railway holds valuable right-of-way agreements designed 
for trains and tracks, but also useful for ``shipping'' the digital 
traffic of an increasingly electronic economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies interested in sending voice, data, video and cable  
signals ``will be seeking ways to reach beyond the major 
metropolitan markets into regional centers and even smaller 
locations,'' Charles W. Moorman, president of T-Cubed, said 
yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Hoosiers' Ogunleye To Have Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Defensive end Adewale Ogunleye, who passed  
up the NFL for one more season at Indiana, will have surgery in a 
few weeks for a knee injury that ended his college career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hoosiers' all-time leader in sacks suffered ligament damage  
in Saturday's victory over Northwestern. Doctors expect a full 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5, 266-pound Ogunleye, a fifth-year senior who had  
been projected as a first-round pick this year, was in Birmingham, 
Ala., on Monday to be examined by the surgeon who will perform the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogunleye had one sack and two tackles for losses before the  
injury in the fourth quarter on Saturday. His 34 career sacks are 
fifth-best in Big Ten history, and his 64 tackles for losses are 
sixth-best. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wally had another great game against Northwestern and was  
having, no question, an All-Big Ten season, an All-American season, 
and we're going to miss him,'' Cameron said. ``But he'll continue 
to captain this football team.''

<HEADLINE> Davie, Irish Seniors Await USC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Bob Davie saw his share of rivalries as  
an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas-Texas A&AMP;M. Pitt-Penn State. Arizona-Arizona State.  
Tulane-LSU. 
</P>
<P>
	None, he says, compare to Notre Dame-Southern Cal.  
</P>
<P>
	``All of us have been involved in a lot of big games, certainly  
every week you play a big football game here. ... But I think this 
game is the biggest one I've been involved with in my coaching 
career,'' Davie said Tuesday as the Irish (3-3) prepared to play 
host to the Trojans (2-3) on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also been one of the most disappointing rivalries in  
Davie's three-year stint as Notre Dame's coach. Davie is 0-2 
against USC and his seniors are 0-3 as the Irish have gone 1-3-1 in 
their last five meetings. The only victory in that streak came 
while the fifth-year seniors were still freshmen and Davie was 
Notre Dame's defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Even worse, each of those losses was devastating for the Irish.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, freshman kicker Jim Sanson missed the $8 million kick,  
an extra point attempt that would've put the Irish up by nine 
points with two minutes to play -- and likely led them to the Fiesta 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The miss allowed the Trojans to march the length of the field,  
tie the game with a touchdown and 2-point conversion, and win in 
overtime 27-20, ending Lou Holtz's career at Notre Dame with a loss 
and keeping the Irish away from the Fiesta's $8 million payout. 
</P>
<P>
	The next year, Sanson was just 1-of-4 on field goal attempts as  
the Irish lost 20-17. Last season, Notre Dame was blanked 10-0 with 
quarterback Jarious Jackson on the sideline after injuring his knee 
the week before. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 loss snapped an eight-game winning streak and kept the  
Irish from being considered for the Bowl Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking about maybe having the opportunity to go to a  
BCS bowl game in both those occurrences,'' Davie said of the 1996 
and 1998 defeats. ``Those were devastating losses for us. ... This 
is a great rivalry if we hold up our end of the bargain and come 
out and play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson is healthy this year, and Sanson isn't kicking anymore  
after being benched for hitting just 3-of-9 field goal attempts 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the games don't mean as much -- at least in terms of the  
BCS. The Irish have evened their record at 3-3 after a three-game 
slide to the Big Ten, a comeback 34-30 victory over Oklahoma and a 
dominating 48-17 defeat of Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
	While the BCS bowls are out of reach, their Irish are still in  
good position to play somewhere in a bowl after their disastrous 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	Davie said the Irish have an extra incentive as well. The Irish  
have an open date next week that coincides with Notre Dame's fall 
break, meaning players will get to go home for the first time after 
staying at school all summer in preparation for the preseason Eddie 
Robinson Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means a lot to us because we've scratched and clawed, and  
I'm proud of this football team for getting back to 3-3,'' Davie 
said. ``Now what do we do with that? We've finally dug ourselves 
somewhat out of that hole, we've got to where we can see the light 
a little bit, now what are we going to do?''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Expands Insurance Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton pressed his effort to enroll  
more children in government-funded health programs Tuesday, and 
rival interest groups announced they were coming together to look 
for ways to get coverage for millions of uninsured Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Disappointed that a new children's health program has not  
reached more children, Clinton directed federal agencies to look 
for ways to find these kids in school. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to bring more health care to children, we're  
going to have to start where the children are,'' Clinton said in a 
speech before the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, only days after the House finished a contentious  
debate over giving patients new rights in dealing with their 
insurance companies, two of the leading interest groups -- on 
opposite sides -- announced a conference in January to address the 
larger issue of the uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is no longer appropriate for any of us who care about the  
uninsured ... to go our separate ways,'' said Ron Pollack, 
president of Families USA, a liberal consumer group that campaigned 
for new patient protections. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined Chip Kahn, president of the Health Insurance  
Association of America, in announcing the conference in which 
groups representing hospitals, doctors, nurses, workers and 
employers will present their ideas for addressing the issue of the 
uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	Kahn's group created the television advertisements featuring  
Harry and Louise that helped kill Clinton's plan to provide 
universal health insurance, something Families USA strongly 
supported. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope this will spur politicians, pundits and, above all,  
the public,'' he said. The timing, at the start of 2000, is meant 
to inject the issue into the presidential election, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two pollsters -- one Democratic, one Republican -- were on hand to  
present new polling data indicating that Americans say the issue of 
the uninsured is important and believe it's getting worse. They 
actually overestimate the number of people without insurance and 
say they would be willing to pay more taxes to help them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Center for Studying Health System Change released a study  
Tuesday that found 20 percent of uninsured Americans are offered 
insurance by an employer but decline it, mostly because the 
premiums are too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, about 14 percent of people decline employer-sponsored  
insurance, with about two-thirds of them finding coverage 
elsewhere. That leaves the rest -- about 7 million people -- without 
any insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the number of people without health insurance rose  
to 44.3 million Americans last year. The number of children without 
insurance remained about 11 million, despite creation of a $24 
billion program to get children coverage, targeting those whose 
families earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the Children's Health Insurance Program has only signed  
up about 1 million of the 11 million uninsured children, although 
it has enough money for about 2.5 million. On several occasions, 
Clinton has urged states to look harder for these children, and he 
announced a renewed push Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is simply inexcusable that we're sitting here, and have  
been, with the money for two years to provide health insurance to 5 
million kids and 80 percent of them are still uninsured,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton hopes to help a total of 5 million uninsured children by  
enrolling some 2.5 million through the new program, plus other 
children who have always been eligible for Medicaid but for some 
reason have not enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
	The president planned to sign an executive order instructing the  
secretaries of health and human services, education and agriculture 
to report to him in six months on how to institutionalize the 
school outreach programs. 
</P>
<P>
	And this week, the secretaries of health and human services and  
education will send information to state agencies explaining how 
schools and state governments can use CHIP funds to pay for school 
outreach programs.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Earnings, Sales Up Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sales of digital mobile phones gave Motorola  
Inc.'s revenue a boost, helping the company post third-quarter 
earnings that met expectations as it continues an impressive 
comeback from a bad year. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's No. 2 maker of cell phones, which lost the top spot  
to Nokia in 1998, on Tuesday reported a 7 percent increase in 
overall sales for the third quarter over the same period a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the gains were in digital cell phones, where sales and  
orders increased sharply in the Americas, Europe and especially 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola also is the world's third-leading semiconductor maker,  
and a strong showing in semiconductor sales helped it to overcome a 
significant charge for its disastrous investment in Iridium, the 
ambitious satellite-based mobile phone network that filed for 
bankruptcy in August. 
</P>
<P>
	For the period ending Oct. 2, the company's third-quarter  
operating earnings excluding special items were $332 million, or 53 
cents per share, compared with $40 million, or 7 cents a share, for 
the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That matched the 53 cents anticipated by securities analysts in  
the most recent survey by First Call/Thomson Financial, although 
some analysts said the ``whisper'' on Wall Street was that it would 
be 55 or 56 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	It also helped show that the Schaumburg, Ill.-based  
communications and equipment maker is rebounding well from a rough 
stretch in which it underwent a billion-dollar restructuring and 
laid off 24,000 people in late 1998 and early 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there is good news in the report, ``I think the Street  
will be disappointed they didn't give us a little more on the 
bottom line,'' said analyst Pete Peterson of Volpe, Brown, Wheland 
and Co. in San Francisco, referring to hopes the company would beat 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola said third-quarter sales were $7.7 billion, up 7  
percent from $7.2 billion for the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparing results without the businesses Motorola sold since  
last year, the company noted that sales in ongoing operations were 
up 12 percent to $7.6 billion compared with $6.7 billion a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, the most rapid cell-phone sales growth occurred in  
Global System for Mobile, or GSM, communications products in 
Europe, which Peterson said will position Motorola well against its 
European competitors when that market takes off. 
</P>
<P>
	``These strong improvements in our financial operating  
performance are a result of significant sales growth in digital 
wireless phones and a focused repositioning and restructuring of 
our semiconductor and digital communications businesses over the 
last year,'' said Robert L. Growney, president and chief operating 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola, like its competitors, continues to suffer from  
declining sales for paging products and said paging orders also 
declined in all regions, especially Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola recorded special charges for the quarter of $344  
million, largely to prop up its 18 percent investment in Iridium. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income including the special items was $91 million, or 14  
cents a share, up from $27 million and 4 cents per share a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Still pending is the recently announced merger with General  
Instrument, which dominates the market for cable TV set-top boxes. 
Pushing into the fast-growing cable television field, Motorola is 
expected to make General Instrument part of a new business unit 
once the merger is approved, probably in the first quarter of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The comprehensive changes we have made across the company over  
the last 18 months are improving our ability to execute and perform 
financially,'' said Christopher B. Galvin, chairman and chief 
executive officer.

<HEADLINE> Senate Nears Deal on Tax Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans and Democrats neared  
agreement Tuesday on a short extension of expiring business tax 
provisions, including the research and development tax credit 
backed by high-tech companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The emerging Senate Finance Committee compromise would extend  
most of the breaks through Dec. 31, 2000, at a cost of roughly $7.8 
billion, according to congressional sources who spoke on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	That contrasts sharply with the 10-year, $75 billion proposal  
outlined last week by Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, 
R-Del., that would have made some of the breaks permanent. Roth's 
proposal encountered bipartisan resistance due to its cost and use 
of projected non-Social Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is more of a consensus toward moving to the shorter-term  
bill,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the No. 2 Senate GOP leader 
and a Finance Committee member. 
</P>
<P>
	There is widespread sentiment that the Senate could never  
approve a large tax bill without encountering delaying tactics and 
dozens of crippling amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth has met with Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the  
committee's top Democrat, to work out a list of tax break 
extensions that can be paid for with a variety of revenue offsets. 
Democrats say they won't vote for any ``extenders'' bill that 
spends projected surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to be paid for in the first year,'' said Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``What happens after that 
depends on how big it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The extensions, most of which were part of the 10-year, $792  
billion GOP tax cut vetoed by President Clinton, include credits 
for businesses that hire former welfare recipients and people from 
groups that have trouble holding jobs. In addition, middle-class 
taxpayers who claim personal credits would be protected from the 
complex alternative minimum tax for the upcoming tax filing season. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever package the Senate produces would have to be reconciled  
with a $23.3 billion House version that renews many business 
credits for five years and permanently fixes the AMT problem.

<HEADLINE> Bank Failures Tapping FDIC Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bank failures this year are expected to cause  
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s biggest losses since the 
regional banking crises of the early 1990s, the agency says. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the total was caused by the failure of a big West  
Virginia bank. 
</P>
<P>
	While the FDIC has plenty of money to cover losses to  
depositors, the failures bolster recent warnings by regulators that 
some banks may need to tighten lending standards. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke, who oversees  
nationally chartered banks, told a bankers' group Monday that 
regulators see signs of risk spreading in the banking industry 
despite high earnings and hefty assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Federal Reserve warned banks and directed its  
examiners to watch for signs of a pileup of risky bank loans. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Fed, the FDIC and two other bank regulatory  
agencies told banks and thrifts they would come under closer 
scrutiny of examiners if they made too many risky home-equity loans 
that let customers borrow more than their homes' value. 
</P>
<P>
	The new type of loans, known as high loan-to-value residential  
loans, have become increasingly popular in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank, thrifts and consumer finance companies have been in heated  
competition for the new loans, marketed primarily as a way for 
homeowners to consolidate debts. The loans break the rules of 
traditional financing by letting customers borrow as much as 125 
percent of their homes' value. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, examiners may ask banks or thrifts to sell high  
loan-to-value loans or to raise more capital, the regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDIC estimates the five bank failures so far this year will  
cost the insurance fund $760 million. ``You'd have to go back to 
the early 1990s to find a time the insurance fund has taken this 
kind of a hit in any one year,'' FDIC spokesman David Barr said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Through most of the decade, there have been fewer than 10 bank  
failures a year. But in 1992, at the height of the banking crisis, 
122 banks failed, mostly in Texas and New England as their oil and 
real estate booms, respectively, collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking debacle was not nearly so severe as the savings and  
loan crisis of the same period, in which lax lending eventually 
forced a government bailout of hundreds of billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Then as now, the bank insurance fund, which backs each account  
up to $100,000, has an adequate cushion to cover depositors' 
losses. The fund currently has $29.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A huge portion of this year's losses -- an estimated $750 million  
-- stems from the failure of First National Bank of Keystone, a 
large bank based in Keystone, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators, who closed the bank last month, said they  
found ``evidence of apparent fraud that resulted in the depletion'' 
of its capital. They alleged, for example, that $515 million in 
loans fraudulently remained on the bank's books after they had been 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDIC now controls the bank's assets. Several lawsuits, some  
by other banks, have been filed in federal court making claims on 
Keystone assets.

<HEADLINE> City May Name KKK Terrorist Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- The City Council considered whether to  
declare the Ku Klux Klan a terrorist group Tuesday so it can limit 
the white supremacist organization's right to march and speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cities have tried to limit Klan activity with laws  
prohibiting people from assembling while wearing masks, for 
example. Some measures have been upheld and others have been 
overturned, said Mark Potok, a spokesman for the Southern Poverty 
Law Center in Montgomery, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Potok said he had never heard of a proposal like the one being  
considered in Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I seriously doubt such a designation would allow a city to  
deny the right of the Klan to rally,'' Potok said. ``It sounds like 
a resolution that can't be enforced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Klan last marched in Charleston several years ago.  
</P>
<P>
	The resolution says the city welcomes diverse opinions ``but not  
those views that instigate fear, bias, bigotry and hate.'' It also 
says ``the Ku Klux Klan has been involved in numerous acts of 
domestic terrorism throughout its history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution is sponsored by Councilman Wendell Gilliard, who  
is black. He said someone painted ``KKK'' on his car several weeks 
ago while it was parked at the plant where he works. 
</P>
<P>
	Horace King, leader of the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan  
in South Carolina, refused to comment.

<HEADLINE> Two Unions Break Ranks With AFL-CIO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Teamsters and United Auto Workers broke  
ranks Tuesday with the AFL-CIO to oppose the labor federation's 
anticipated endorsement of Vice President Al Gore, saying their 2.2 
million members need more time to consider the field of 
presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not anti- any particular candidate. It is because we  
think it's too early to endorse,'' said Teamsters President James 
P. Hoffa, emerging from an hourlong meeting of the AFL-CIO's 
political committee, which voted to recommend Gore's endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	The federation's executive council and full convention, meeting  
at the Los Angeles Convention Center, are set to approve the 
recommendation Wednesday morning, with Gore's acceptance speech 
already on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a good week,'' Gore exclaimed at a beachside  
fund-raiser Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president's aides cast his win as rival Bill Bradley's  
failure and an energized Gore campaign prepared to launch its first 
television ad campaign. Shopping now for air time, the campaign was 
expected to air this first wave of ads, described as largely 
biographical, starting this weekend or next. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, Gore's sole rival for the Democratic presidential  
nomination, will not be too far behind in airing his first ads, 
Bradley's advisers said. 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said Gore had won ``a very  
valuable endorsement that really allows for mobilizing 13 million 
members around the country ... who are looking to support a 
candidate who has a proven record of addressing working family 
issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Gore will win the presidency, Sweeney said,  
``Definitely! You think we would endorse a loser?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Gore joined his campaign brass -- including chairman  
Tony Coelho, campaign manager Donna Brazile and senior strategist 
Michael Whouley -- in downtown Los Angeles, to thank labor leaders 
for their early support despite Bradley's lobbying for a delay. 
</P>
<P>
	After a full-court final press from Gore, his aides, his allies  
and President Clinton, the vice president dropped by the convention 
hotel, in between fund-raising appearances, to thank some of the 
unions that had been on the fence until very recently -- including 
the Steelworkers, Paperworkers and building trades. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters, with about 1.4 million members, and the UAW, with  
800,000, did not represent enough votes to block the endorsement 
actively advocated by Sweeney. UAW Vice President Elizabeth Bunn 
made clear to the AFL-CIO political committee that her ``no'' vote, 
like the Teamsters', was not anti-Gore or pro-Bradley, Sweeney told 
reporters after the closed-door session. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement earlier Tuesday, Hoffa said he polled his members  
and ``they need more time to see the candidates in action. ... No 
one should construe our position as favoring or opposing one 
candidate over another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho emphasized triumphantly, ``Bill Bradley, at one point,  
thought he could stop the endorsement. Bradley fought us very 
hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser countered: ``The entrenched power  
that the vice president had here was a dramatic advantage. The case 
Bill Bradley made to labor will continue to resonate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's win with labor did not come without a glitch.  
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee AFL-CIO President Jim Neeley, attending the  
convention, made excuses for the vice president, whose campaign 
hired a non-union contractor last week to do the initial wiring of 
his new Nashville, Tenn., headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Modern Electrical Contracting had 30 phone and computer lines  
installed for Gore by last Friday, when the New York Daily News 
first reported the contract. They were pulled from the job Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Neeley said Gore aides contacted him here and he forgave their  
predicament after being told it was a rush job and no union firm 
was immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Lee, business manager of Local 429 of the International  
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, faulted the campaign for not 
checking with Nashville's local union but said Tuesday that he was 
satisfied that his workers were at Gore headquarters first thing 
Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the perfect world of things, this shouldn't have  
happened,'' Neeley said. ``But I know Al Gore. I know what his 
commitment is to working union families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokeswoman Kiki Moore called it ``one instance on a very  
limited job that was rushed.'' All other work on the new 
headquarters was being done by union labor, she said.

<HEADLINE> Raytheon Slashes Expected Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Shares of defense giant Raytheon Co. plunged more  
than 40 percent Tuesday after the contractor slashed its earnings 
projections for 1999 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Blaming lower than-expected revenue, the defense contractor said  
Tuesday its 1999 earnings per share will be between $1.40 and $1.50 
per share -- including a $638 million pretax charge for 
restructuring and project problems. Excluding the charges, this 
year's earnings per share will be $2.70 to $2.80, well below Wall 
Street expectations of $3.56 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	For 2000, the company estimates earnings per share will be in  
the range of $2.10 to $2.25, compared to estimates of $3.91 per 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading in shares of Raytheon was halted for most of the day on  
the New York Stock Exchange. After trading began in the late 
afternoon, Class B shares fell $18.75, or 44 percent, to close at 
$24.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Other defense contractors fell as well. General Dynamics fell  
$4.68 3/4 to $57.68 3/4 while Litton Industries fell $3.56 1/4 to $49.31 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon chairman and chief executive Daniel Burnham said the  
company lowered its revenue estimates by $600 million, to $200 
billion, due to increased competition and because it took longer 
for buyers to decide to buy defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition is lowering profit margins at Raytheon Systems Co.,  
its defense and electronics unit, from 15 percent to 12 percent, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What surprised us and shouldn't have,'' Burnham said, ``is how  
the business has shifted.'' He said aggressive bidding eliminated 
much of the company's gains from consolidation after its recent 
acquisitions, including General Motor's Hughes Defense Electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnham also defended Raytheon against a Wall Street Journal  
report Tuesday that the company is behind schedule or over budget 
on at least a dozen fixed-price Pentagon orders, including orders 
for Tomahawk cruise missiles and reconnaissance aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there are contract problems with only eight projects,  
resulting in $320 million in charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is not taking a charge on the Tomahawk, the RC-135  
or the Javelin program, none of which have cost problems, Burnham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pentagon spokesman said Tuesday that Raytheon should not be  
singled out for having problems in meeting conditions of its 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not consider Raytheon a troubled contractor,'' Pentagon  
spokesman Ken Bacon said. ``Like all defense contractors, there are 
some contracts that are not always on schedule or within cost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An industry analyst said Raytheon, like the rest of the defense  
industry, is seeing lower earnings growth because cost savings due 
to consolidations have already been realized. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Raytheon is going through is perfectly natural,'' said  
Jon Kutler, an analyst with Quarterdeck Investment Partners. 
``Historically it's been one of the best managed defense aerospace 
companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon, he said, is extremely well-positioned in the growth  
areas of electronics and missiles. ``Investors who truly understand 
this industry will look past this and at the very attractive 
opportunities handed Raytheon,'' Kutler added. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon is predicting annual revenue growth for 1999 and 2000  
of 3 percent, at least half of its earlier projections of 6 percent 
to 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Restructuring charges account for another $274 million and $74  
million in special charges will be taken, primarily to write down 
company assets to fair-market value such as the company's wireless 
networking inventory and its investment in troubled satellite 
mobile phone company Iridium. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon disclosed last month it was having difficulties in its  
defense electronics and construction units that would result in a 
third-quarter pretax charge of between $350 million and $450 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnham said there will be some more layoffs of the company's  
108,000 employees worldwide, though how many more is unclear. At 
least 2,380 positions will be eliminated, with possibly a couple 
hundred more, largely in California and New York state with some in 
Texas.

<HEADLINE> AOL, Universal Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- America Online, the world's largest Internet  
service provider, has formed a marketing alliance with Universal 
Studios that will offer online services to theme park visitors, the 
companies announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement, five Internet kiosks that use AOL  
software are to be installed shortly at the Islands of Adventure 
theme park in Orlando, Fla., Universal spokeswoman Hellene Runtagh 
said. They could be added to other parks later. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL members can use the kiosks to send and receive e-mail and  
browse other online content, said AOL spokesman Joe Redling. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors can also use the free computer access to scan for  
information about the park and local travel, as well as products 
from Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the consumers in the park will be clients of AOL and  
others will not,'' Ms. Runtagh said. ``The purpose of the project 
is to entertain them and get them to be permanent subscribers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for installing the kiosks, AOL will promote  
Universal products and services to its nearly 18 million 
subscribers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The marketing alliance was designed to see whether  
cross-promotion will be more successful in reaching new customers 
than standard advertising, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kiosk program ... is a natural fit, aligning our online  
service with the world's most technologically advanced theme 
park,'' Redling said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Over Italy Antiquity Plea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a public hearing that raised  
long-standing disagreements between art dealers and archaeologists, 
a government commission is considering a request by Italy to block 
import of a millennium's worth of ancient artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department's Cultural Property Advisory Committee is  
to make a recommendation on the request, but the decision 
ultimately will be President Clinton's. It is the most sweeping 
demand ever for restricting the sale of art objects from another 
country under international agreements and a 1983 U.S. cultural 
properties law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian request covers a long list of pottery, stoneware,  
architectural elements, glassware, coins, sculpture, jewelry and 
other items for a 1,000-year period beginning with the fifth 
century B.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Art dealers and museum curators insist such a restriction would  
limit U.S. public access to Italy's great cultural past. 
Archaeologists and the Italian government say it would help curb 
looting and theft of a treasured Italian heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission agrees in the concern about the need to better  
understand the scope of the request being submitted,'' said the 
commission's chairman, Martin E. Sullivan, at a hearing Tuesday. A 
decision is not expected for weeks, possibly months. 
</P>
<P>
	An Italian Embassy representative observed the hearing but did  
not testify. Embassy officer Luigi Maccotta said he could not speak 
officially for the government but said he is bothered as an Italian 
by suggestions of some art dealers that Italy is trying to take 
away their freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are just trying to establish some order,'' Maccotta said.  
``We are not trying to limit the freedom of the public. We don't 
like the chain of illegal selling of objects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers questioned the extent of stolen Italian artifacts on the  
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we now going to allow a repressive society to reach beyond  
its borders?'' asked Arielle Kosloff, a New York gallery operator. 
``Italy says its sites are being pillaged. I do not believe this is 
true at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the head of the Archaeological Institute of America, Ricardo  
Elia, cited what he called ample evidence of continuing pilferage 
and theft, including recent successes by Italian art police in the 
confiscation of more than 30,000 looted artifacts in three separate 
raids. 
</P>
<P>
	Elia clashed with a representative of Sotheby's, the New York  
auction house, on the source of Italian vases sold at the auction 
in New York and on the extent of the looting problem in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the appearance of 4,200 southern Italian vases on world  
markets in recent years, Elia said, ``It's too much.'' He insisted 
such a hoard could not be legitimate, and most of the vases come 
from looted archaeological sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it isn't,'' shouted Rena Moulopoulos, Sotheby's director  
of compliance. She said when the value of specific art objects 
increases, they begin to surface from a variety of sources, 
including legitimate private collections around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, appointed by the president, normally includes  
two members representing museums, three experts in archaeology or 
related fields, three representing art dealers and three members of 
the general public. Two of the dealer seats are vacant.

<HEADLINE> Braves Mouthy as Mets Come to Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Brian Jordan had his chance.  
</P>
<P>
	A free agent last offseason, he visited Shea Stadium, shook some  
hands and thought about signing with the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the big-hitting outfielder joined the Atlanta Braves  
and spent the season helping them beat up the Mets. And he's not 
shy about admitting a dislike for them, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, I could say so,'' Jordan said after Monday's workout  
at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just that New York City thing,'' he said. ``Whenever you  
go there, the fans try to rattle you and get all over you. 
Eventually, you say, `I can't stand New York.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He was not alone going into Game 1 of the NL championship series  
tonight against New York. Greg Maddux was to pitch for Atlanta 
against Masato Yoshii, and Mets slugger Mike Piazza was expected to 
return to the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We beat them nine out of 12. I don't know how Bobby Valentine  
can say a word,'' reliever John Rocker said. ``Just as we have 
respect for them, Bobby Valentine doesn't have much respect for 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How about it, skip? Braves manager Bobby Cox has a kind word for  
everybody -- surely he would have something nice to say about his 
Mets counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know Bobby Valentine that well,'' Cox said.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked about such remarks, Valentine rubbed his forehead and bit  
his lip. 
</P>
<P>
	``Animosity?'' he said. ``Our guys are loving, caring, good  
fellows who go about their business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enough said?  
</P>
<P>
	``You either come to play baseball or you come to talk,'' Cox  
said. ``You better come to play baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, though, the edgy Mets and the usually businesslike  
Braves are acting a bit snippy. 
</P>
<P>
	Even New York general manager Steve Phillips seemed a bit peeved  
after the Mets began their workout two hours early Monday night 
after being notified by the Braves that thunderstorms were coming. 
That storm never arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	But at least there was this encouraging sign: Piazza seemed  
confident he will be able to start. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star catcher missed the last two games of the  
first-round victory over Arizona because of a swollen left thumb. 
He looked good in batting practice Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to say definitely,'' Piazza said. ``But I'm  
feeling close to 90 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, however, will be minus third-base coach Cookie Rojas.  
He was suspended for five games by NL president Len Coleman on 
Monday for shoving umpire Charlie Williams during Saturday's 
clinching win over the Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Braves catcher Bruce Benedict, currently the Mets' bench  
coach, will take over at third. He might be the only person in a 
New York uniform getting a nice reception. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody is trying to build up this thing between the  
Mets and Braves,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rojas declined comment on his penalty until meeting with  
Coleman, which was likely to occur today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people think all he does is coach third base,'' Valentine  
said. ``He does a lot more. He will be missed dearly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux will be followed by Kevin Millwood, Tom Glavine and John  
Smoltz in the best-of-7 series. After Yoshii, Kenny Rogers, Al 
Leiter and Rick Reed will pitch for the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshii was 0-2 in three starts against Atlanta this year. He  
smiled when asked about bitter feelings between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't dislike them or anything,'' he said through an  
interpreter. ``We just have to beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux was a bit surprised to see the Mets in October,  
considering they were two games out of the wild-card spot with only 
three left in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker was more complimentary -- sort of. He praised the Mets'  
hitting, pitching and fielding, then added, ``I'm really shocked to 
see how they had to squeak into the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine was aware of that assessment.  
</P>
<P>
	``I never heard them say anything other than we underachieved,''  
he smirked. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza laughed off the supposed hostilities.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny how the trash talking gets magnified,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	One edge the Mets appeared certain to enjoy: crowd support. As  
of late Monday, the Braves had 6,500 tickets left for Game 1 and 
nearly 10,000 remaining for Game 2 at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who talked to the Mets during his free-agent tour in the  
offseason, knows what to expect when the series shifts to Shea. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a no-brainer,'' he said. ``I mean it's pretty tough in  
New York.''

<HEADLINE> Duncan, Spurs Take on Rest of World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs will at least make  
sure they break a sweat in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	While no NBA team has lost in the 12-year history of the  
McDonald's Championship, the Spurs say they'll take their opponents 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, seriously enough to get a good workout.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to use these games over here to get better,'' said  
Tim Duncan, who arrived Tuesday in Milan with the rest of the NBA 
champs. ``These are like preseason games for us. We have to use 
them to get ready for the real season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six-team tournament, held every two years since 1991,  
includes the European, South American, Asian and Australian 
champions, plus an Italian team. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA teams are 16-0, including the Chicago Bulls' 104-78 victory  
over European champion Olympiakos in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been some close calls, though.  
</P>
<P>
	The New York Knicks were taken to overtime by Italy's Scavolini  
Pesaro in 1990, and Magic Johnson's Los Angeles Lakers edged a 
Spanish team by 2 points in the title game the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know anything about the other teams here, and this is  
huge for them,'' said Avery Johnson, who hit the winning shot in 
Game 5 against New York to give San Antonio its first NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shouldn't take this lightly, because the track record shows  
that other teams took it lightly and games went down to the last 
minute or last 30 seconds,'' Johnson said. ``We want to take things 
seriously from the first minute out there and play like the NBA 
champs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio has a bye into Friday's semifinals, where it will  
meet the winner of Thursday's game between Brazil's Vasco da Gama 
and Australia's Adelaide 36ers. The other teams are European 
champions Zalgiris Kaunas, Lebanon's C.S. Sagesse, and Italian 
League champ Varese Roosters. The final is Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Italy, basketball is second in popularity to soccer, and as  
of Tuesday there were still hundreds of tickets left for Thursday's 
first-round games at the 10,122-capacity FilaForum on the outskirts 
of Milan. Organizers said they expect to sell out the arena for 
Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs, who opened their exhibition season Sunday with a  
98-97 win over the Philadelphia 76ers, make their regular season 
debut Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson missed the Philadelphia game with a stiff lowed back  
but should play this week. Wearing flip-flops and a ``NBA Champions 
1999'' T-shirt, the 1995 league MVP acknowledged that this week 
throws a kink in the team's preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is scheduled to make a series of public appearances,  
ranging from a McDonald's restaurant to the city's 14th-century 
Gothic cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough in the middle of training camp to fly across the  
world,'' Robinson said. ``We've only been together for a week and 
right now we have to be working on getting ourselves going.''

<HEADLINE> Braves Want To Avoid a Near-Miss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves have seen this picture once  
too often. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the San Diego Padres took a snapshot on the mound at  
Turner Field after winning the NL pennant. The previous October, 
the Florida Marlins posed for the same portrait. 
</P>
<P>
	Easy to see why the Braves are focused on not letting the New  
York Mets take a similar photo this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly don't want to be known as the Buffalo Bills of  
the '90s,'' reliever John Rocker said before Game 1 of the NLCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, that label has been liberally applied to Atlanta in  
the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves have been the majors' biggest winners in the regular  
season since 1991 -- with 860 victories, they're 76 ahead of the New 
York Yankees -- but they have only one World Series championship to 
show for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they can lament a string of near-misses.  
</P>
<P>
	If Lonnie Smith doesn't get lost on the bases, maybe they beat  
Jack Morris and the Minnesota Twins in Game 7 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	If Jeff Reardon doesn't give up a ninth-inning homer to Ed  
Sprague in Game 2, maybe they go on to defeat Toronto in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	And if Mark Wohlers doesn't hang that breaking ball to Jim  
Leyritz in Game 4, maybe they beat the Yankees in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they're still searching for that elusive second title.  
Their fans are waiting, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves had plenty of tickets left for the first two games of  
the NLCS as Tuesday night's opener in the best-of-7 series 
approached. Though they've reached the NLCS eight straight times, 
home sellouts have been rare. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell you, it's surprising,'' Atlanta outfielder Brian Jordan  
said. ``I've been spoiled because I've been in St. Louis for the 
last six years, and they're true baseball fans. Win, lose or draw, 
they're always there. 
</P>
<P>
	``And to come here and be in a postseason and don't have a  
sellout crowd is surprising,'' he said. ``I know they are used to 
the Atlanta Braves winning, but not winning the big game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox hopes to end that trend this fall. Especially  
after seeing other teams celebrate on the Turner Field mound the 
last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Having beaten Houston in the division series, the NL East  
champions continue their quest in this recently troublesome second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what you can learn from them,'' he said. ``We've  
won some and we've lost some. I don't know if you learn from 
winning or learn from losing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we'll have a little luck,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Braves sure could use some, having lost Andres Galarraga,  
Javy Lopez, Kerry Ligtenberg and others to illness and injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of people have been doubting us from the  
beginning,'' Rocker said. ``And in past years, people have just 
been penciling us into the World Series back in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we really got that treatment this year,'' he  
said. ``I think we don't have quite as much to prove.''

<HEADLINE> Colo. Gov., Lt. Gov. Resolve Feud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado's governor and lieutenant governor have  
settled an eight-month feud that included a disagreement over 
whether the lieutenant governor should drive a state sports utility 
vehicle or a sedan. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Owens met for an hour Tuesday with Lt. Gov Joe Rogers  
to discuss the dispute that started during their campaign for the 
governorship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gov. Owens had a productive and cordial meeting with Lt.  
Governor Rogers,'' a statement from Owens' press office said. ``The 
governor said that `Joe and I agreed to work together in the 
future, just as we have in the past.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The chief executive and his second-in-command, both Republicans,  
have been sniping for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Their dispute publicly flared after a member of Rogers' staff  
member sued Owens -- with Rogers' approval -- to get her paycheck 
released. She had balked at undergoing a long, detailed criminal 
background check that Rogers maintained had not been required of 
all Owens staff members. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers said he and the governor agreed to a ``very much positive  
relationship,'' which included the eventual withdrawing of his 
employee's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all will be worked out,'' Rogers said.  
</P>
<P>
	Other issues that emerged included a dispute involving a state  
employee Rogers failed to discipline for driving a state car more 
than 100 mph before being stopped by a state trooper. Rogers was in 
the car at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was a flare-up over what kind of state car the  
lieutenant governor should be allowed. Owens has a sport utility 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers also had a SUV, but Owens sent it elsewhere and gave  
Rogers a sedan.

<HEADLINE> Senate Nears Vote on Farm Bailout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eastern senators who said their farmers were  
being shortchanged failed Tuesday to delay passage of an $8.7 
billion package of assistance for farmers hurt by bad weather and 
low commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 79-20 to limit debate on the $69 billion  
agricultural spending bill that includes the aid package. A final 
vote on the legislation, which would send it to President Clinton 
for his signature, was expected Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sooner we pass this legislation, the sooner we can assist  
the family farmer,'' Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa., said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first aid checks could be going to farmers within a few  
weeks after the president signs the bill, said Agriculture 
Secretary Dan Glickman. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators from the Northeast were unhappy that the legislation  
didn't provide more money for growers hit by drought this year and 
doesn't allow New England states to continue fixing milk prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need real help, particularly this year when low prices and  
the drought severely affected us,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, 
D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Work on the bill has been delayed several times, starting in  
late June when Senate Democrats tried to attach controls on HMOs. 
Last month, the bill was held up in a House-Senate conference for 
more than a week because Republican leaders refused to include 
provisions to allow sales of food and medicine to Cuba and overhaul 
the Agriculture Department's new milk-pricing regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is that the time is late, we need to get some  
assistance out to rural America,'' said Tom Buis, a lobbyist for 
the National Farmers Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the measure Oct. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	The aid package includes $5.5 billion to double the annual  
``market transition'' payments that farmers were to have gotten 
this year and $1.4 billion in disaster relief, including $200 
million earmarked for livestock producers. Additional money is 
targeted for tobacco, soybean and peanut growers and to reduce 
premiums that farmers pay for crop insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders are considering providing additional  
assistance later for North Carolina producers whose land was 
flooded by Hurricane Floyd last month, said John Czwartacki, a 
spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. Farm 
losses in the state are estimated at $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would benefit some of the nation's largest and  
most profitable farms by increasing the maximum amount of crop 
subsidies one operation can get from $150,000 to $300,000. With the 
additional market transition payment, that means some farms could 
claim as much as $460,000 in government payments this year, not 
counting what they could get through various conservation programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, about 550 farms nationwide claimed the maximum in  
crop subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the looser payment rules fear they will encourage the  
consolidation of farms and hasten the demise of smaller-scale 
operations. Big farms will use the extra cash to buy up land from 
neighbors, which will drive up land prices, said Chuck Hassebrook, 
program director of the Center for Rural Affairs in Walthill, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is the purpose of these farm programs? Is it to help very  
wealthy, very large landowners get bigger and get richer? If it is 
then this all makes sense,'' Hassebrook said. However, he said, ``I 
don't think that's what the public supports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But farm organizations that pushed for raising subsidy limits  
say low commodity prices hurt big farms as well as small ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Producers need to get their income from the marketplace, (but)  
the marketplace simply isn't providing it right now,'' said Steve 
Pringle, legislative director of the Texas Farm Bureau.

<HEADLINE> Transplant Center Disparity Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Patients' chances of getting a new liver or  
heart and surviving at least a year differ vastly depending on what 
hospital treats them, according to a first-ever government study 
that found a ``striking'' disparity in the success of U.S. 
transplant centers. 
</P>
<P>
	At the University of Kansas Medical Center, 89 percent of people  
awaiting liver transplants got them in the mid-1990s; at the 
University of Maryland in Baltimore, it was just 21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is the first to examine survival rates of all  
patients who enter transplant waiting lists and presents the first 
analysis of a patient's chances of getting a liver or heart, of 
dying while waiting and of surviving after a year with or without a 
new organ. 
</P>
<P>
	``This answers the questions a transplant patient would have:  
Will I get a transplant? Will I be alive a year from now?'' 
explained Campbell Gardett, a spokesman for the Department of 
Health and Human Services, which did the analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he cautioned that a center's particular results may be  
the product of special circumstances. ``It should prompt questions 
rather than conclusions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several factors explain the national variation, experts say.  
They include policies for distributing scarce organs, a community's 
willingness to donate and the effectiveness of the local organ bank 
in collecting organs. They also include a transplant surgeon's 
medical skills -- both in keeping patients alive while awaiting 
organs and in operating on and treating those who get transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was obtained by The Associated Press a day before  
legislation remaking the nation's transplant policies is expected 
to pass the House Commerce Committee. That bill, strongly opposed 
by the Clinton administration, would severely curtail the 
administration's power over the transplant network. It would also 
allow the network to keep data like that in the new study secret 
from everyone but transplant patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which examined only livers and hearts, found large  
variations among more than 100 transplant programs across the 
country. It looked at patient chances in three distinct ways, 
adjusting for the severity of each transplant center's particular 
patients: 
</P>
<P>
	--Chance of getting a transplant, which relates primarily to  
policy questions but also involves doctors' medical judgment about 
which organs to accept. 
</P>
<P>
	On this score, patients at liver centers in the bottom 10  
percent got transplants just 24.9 percent of the time. Among the 10 
percent, it was 71.2 percent. For heart transplant programs, 35.8 
percent got transplants at the bottom compared with 71.8 percent at 
the top. 
</P>
<P>
	--Chance of dying while waiting for a transplant, which involves  
the speed in which organs are procured and the ability to stay 
alive during the wait. 
</P>
<P>
	In the lowest-scoring liver programs, 22.3 percent of patients  
died, vs. 7.7 percent at the top programs. For heart transplant 
centers, 84 percent of patients at the bottom centers died, vs. 67 
percent at the top programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Chance of surviving a year after coming on the list, whether  
the patient gets a transplant or not. This involves a surgeon and a 
center's skill at transplantation and postoperative care, along 
with the ability to keep patients alive while waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	At the lowest liver programs, 65.3 percent of patients survived  
a year, vs. 85.9 percent at the top. At the lowest heart programs, 
67 percent of patients survived a year, vs. 84 percent at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond the variation at the top and the bottom, mixed results  
were recorded in the middle as well, noted the report's author, Dr. 
Henry Krakauer. Normally, statisticians expect a few low performers 
and a few high performers, with most clustered in the center. But 
this report found that on several measures, hospitals were all over 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
	``The range of probabilities is in all cases substantial, but  
the breadth of the distribution of the transplant rates, especially 
in the case of the liver, ... is striking,'' the report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The report includes data through early this year that cover all  
patients who came onto the transplant waiting list between April 
1994 through the end of 1997. It was reviewed by experts in the 
field, including officials from the United Network for Organ 
Sharing, which collects the wealth of raw data from transplant 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to use this with a combination of a whole host of  
information,'' cautioned network spokesman Bob Speilbruner. 
</P>
<P>
	The network also produces data on patient survival, but only  
among those patients who receive transplants. This is the first 
report to factor in a patient's chances of getting an organ in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Congress, who are considering major changes in  
transplant policy, requested the report from HHS. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Waxman, R-Calif., says the report provides the most  
up-to-date, complete information for patients seeking transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a patient, your chances of survival depend  
enormously on where you get your transplant,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But experts at HHS allow that they do not understand all the  
reasons for the disparity. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to take the next step and understand why,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Titleist Keeps Tiger Woods  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The five-year deal that Tiger Woods signed with Titleist last  
weekend is nothing like the one he signed when he turned pro in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't look for any print advertisements about why Woods likes  
the Titleist driver. You won't see him in television commercials 
holding up a Titleist ball. In fact, Woods won't even be carrying a 
Titleist bag before long. 
</P>
<P>
	The only benefit that Titleist gets from its contract with Woods  
is a guarantee that he won't be playing another company's 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiger Woods is clearly one of those very special players and  
very special people whose impact on the game and society will 
transcend everything that he accomplishes on the course,'' said 
Wally Uihlein, president and CEO of Acushnet Co. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Titleist has agreed to withdraw its  
complaint against Nike, Inc., that alleged false advertising and 
contract interference. That stemmed over the two Nike commercials, 
one in which Woods bounces a ball off his wedge, the other showing 
Woods' magic rubbing off a dozen other people on the driving range. 
</P>
<P>
	Golf World reported last month that Woods was renegotiating a  
deal with Nike that would pay him about $90 million over five 
years. Mark Steinberg, Woods' agent at IMG, refused to confirm the 
numbers but said a Nike deal could be completed in the next two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nike swoosh likely won't show up on Woods' bag, but that  
appears to be the next order of business. Two likely names for the 
bag are American Express and Rolex, which already have endorsement 
deals with Woods. One source close to Woods, however, said the 
bidding right now is wide open. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ST. ANDREWS CRITICS:* Remember when Scott Hoch was bashed for  
his disparaging remarks about at St. Andrews? He's not alone. It 
was open season on the Old Course during the Dunhill Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider this exchange between England's Mark James and Lee  
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played here in the Walker Cup (in 1975) and thought there  
were about 15 blind holes -- and I wasn't all that keen on the other 
three,'' James said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say it was in my top 200,'' Westwood added.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the east of Scotland?'' James asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``In Fife,'' Westwood replied, referring to the county where St.  
Andrews is located. 
</P>
<P>
	Westwood's complaint was that the Old Course does not reward  
accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can hit what you think is a very good tee shot, pitch on a  
very severe slope and kick into a bunker that is hard to get out 
of,'' he said. ``You can pitch on to a green 10 feet from the flag 
and roll 30 yards away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westwood should keep that it mind when the British Open is  
played there next year. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PEAK PERFORMANCE:* Three players on the verge of having to  
return to qualifying school came up big in the Betsy King Classic 
last week, none more than former NCAA champion Marisa Baena. 
</P>
<P>
	Baena closed with a 70 and tied for fifth, worth $28,273. That  
was enough to move her from 107th on the LPGA money list to 86th, 
giving her full-exempt status for 2000. Only the top 90 keep full 
playing privileges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an indescribable feeling to earn my card on the final  
day of the season,'' Baena said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CAPTAIN'S POOL:* While Curtis Strange is regarded as the  
front-runner to be the next Ryder Cup captain, the class of 
candidates behind him is deep. 
</P>
<P>
	That means at least one potential captain is going to get  
squeezed out, similar to what happened to Larry Nelson and Hale 
Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once a player is eligible for the Senior Tour, he no longer  
can be considered as a captain,'' said one player close to the 
selection process, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Because 
once you're on the Senior Tour, you lose touch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corey Pavin and Paul Azinger are 39. Tom Lehman and Fred Couples  
are 40. Hal Sutton is 41, while Payne Stewart is 42. Including 
Strange, that leaves seven potential captains available for the 
next five Ryder Cup teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody is that group is not going to make it, and that will  
be too bad,'' Azinger said. ``But that's the way it has to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's possible the PGA of America could start considering younger  
captains. Tom Watson was 44 in 1991, the youngest U.S. captain 
since the matches got serious in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're getting jammed up with guys who are real close in  
age,'' Davis Love III said. ``You might start seeing guys more in 
their mid-40s than their late 40s.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Colin Montgomerie has been named European Tour player  
of the month for September for picking up 3 1/2 points in the Ryder 
Cup -- and for handling the harsh heckling at The Country Club. ... 
Cindy McCurdy was re-elected to a two-year term as president of the 
LPGA executive committee. ... Tom Kite on whether he is looking 
forward to next year, when he will be eligible for the Senior Tour: 
``You get over the anticipation of birthdays after you get your 
21st behind you.'' Kite says he plans to continue to play a few 
events on the PGA Tour. ... The purse for the 2000 Women's British 
Open has increased from $1 million to $1.25 million. The Open will 
be played at Royal Birkdale next year. ... According to a National 
Golf Foundation online survey of nearly 600 golfers, 33.8 percent 
said they would play if the temperature was 35 degrees or lower. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAT OF THE WEEK:* Looking for a favorite to win the British  
Open next year. Consider Carlos Franco, who was 16-under in three 
rounds at St. Andrews during the Dunhill Cup. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FINAL WORD:* ``It's taken me a long time to do something Monty  
couldn't do.'' -- Sam Torrance, after defeating Raul Fretes of 
Paraguay in the Dunhill Cup. Fretes upset Colin Montgomerie in the 
1993 Dunhill Cup.

<HEADLINE> Nurses Welcome New California Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Every day, nurse Julie Meylor  
struggles to balance the care of her ailing patients with the staff 
levels in her cardiac surgery unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The workload is steadily rising, and there is never enough time  
or nurses for all who need them, said Meylor, 42, who has 18 years 
experience in nursing. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of tempers flare. People yell at you. That happens every  
day,'' she said. ``The crises get taken care of, but the basic 
stuff is put on hold, and patients expect that the basics get 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents of a new law say they have the medicine for Meylor's  
staffing problems: Legislation that makes California the first 
state to require all its licensed hospitals to meet fixed 
nurse-to-patient ratios. 
</P>
<P>
	Nurses like Meylor at Mercy General Hospital in Sacramento  
cheered news that Gov. Gray Davis had signed the law over the 
weekend. She said it will mean more nurses, less tension and better 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	Kay McVey, president of the California Nurses Association, which  
sponsored the bill, described Davis' signing as ``one of the most 
significant days in the history of nursing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the American Hospital Association in Washington, D.C.,  
spokeswoman Alicia Mitchell said that the bill ``is the first of 
its type in the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents of the measure argued that each hospital should  
make its own staffing decisions and that state intervention would 
only drive up treatment costs in an era of HMOs -- and even reduce 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Healthcare Association, which represents 460 of  
the state's 470 hospitals, said the bill will only make it harder 
to maintain quality levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the quality of care is very high in California  
hospitals,'' said Doris Harms, vice president of the hospital 
association. She said she was unaware of overextended staffs or 
nurses. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if that's true, this bill isn't going to help that,''  
Harms added. ``There are no more nurses available to hire. What 
hospitals will have to do is close some units'' to increase 
staffing in others and reduce patient access to services. 
</P>
<P>
	Current California regulations require each hospital to assess  
the needs of patients during every shift and then set their nurse 
staffing levels accordingly. The state sets nurse-patient ratios 
only for critical care units and neonatal intensive care units. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law does not specify a minimum nurse-to-patient ratio,  
but instead requires the state Department of Health Services to set 
such standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also will bar hospitals from assigning unlicensed  
workers to perform certain procedures, including administering 
medication, and it will prohibit hospitals from shifting nurses 
trained in one unit to another unit without adequate preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	Assemblywoman Sheila Kuehl, D-Los Angeles, sponsored the  
legislation and agreed to postpone the date at which it goes into 
effect until Jan. 1, 2002, in order to give hospitals a chance to 
adjust. 
</P>
<P>
	At Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, the nation's largest  
teaching hospital, nurse Juanita Jones said the nursing bill would 
be welcomed by those who perform medical triage every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's past way overdue,'' said Jones, 46, who cares for  
patients who have undergone surgery. She said her workload -- which 
can soar to nine patients at a time -- is tremendous. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to cut it down,'' Jones said. She said it would be  
more manageable in her department if each nurse had to care for 
four patients at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always the issue here. We have a lot of patients,'' said  
Ghennet Haile, 32, dialysis nurse at County-USC for six years. 
``It's stressful and patients don't get as much care.''

<HEADLINE> Drug Said Effective Vs. Fractures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A new osteoporosis drug has been found to reduce  
hip, leg and some other fractures in postmenopausal women that some 
drug treatments fail to prevent. 
</P>
<P>
	Some existing drugs effective in preventing spinal fractures  
have not been as effective in curbing other bone fractures caused 
by osteoporosis, the bone-weakening condition that afflicts an 
estimated 10 million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say the new drug, risedronate, reduced other  
fractures as well as spinal fractures and increased bone density. 
Their study appears in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's lead author says the findings should be particularly  
heartening for older women who can't tolerate or aren't given 
estrogen treatments after menopause -- still considered key to 
preventing or slowing the effects of osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prevailing feeling is that once you're old and starting to  
have problems, there's not much you can do ... but I think this 
gives a lot of encouragement,'' said Dr. Steven T. Harris, chief of 
the Osteoporosis Clinic at the University of California, San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was funded by Proctor &AMP; Gamble Pharmaceuticals and  
Hoechst Marion Rousell, which are seeking approval from the Food 
and Drug Administration to sell risedronate under the trade name 
Actonel. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year study of 939 postmenopausal women found that the  
number of non-spinal fractures dropped 39 percent for women who 
took the drug while spinal fractures decreased 41 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug also was found to boost bone density by as much as 5  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Another osteoporosis drug -- alendronate, marketed under the  
trade name Fosamax -- has had similar results in terms of fractures 
and bone density increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other drugs have shown comparable results for spinal but not  
non-spinal fractures, Harris said. Those include calcitonin, 
marketed as Calcimar, and raloxifene, marketed as Evista, which the 
FDA recently approved as an osteoporosis treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Another osteoporosis expert, Dr. Lawrence Raisz, head of the  
general clinical research center at the University of Connecticut, 
said he was not surprised by the study's finding but said it is 
still unclear whether women experience less stomach upset with 
risedronate than they do with alendronate.

<HEADLINE> Quotes About Wilt Chamberlain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Quotes about Wilt Chamberlain, who died Tuesday at age 63:  

</P>
<P>
	``Wilt was one of the greatest ever, and we will never see  
another one like him.'' -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who broke 
Chamberlain's record to become the NBA's leading career scorer. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``When I started to play with him, he helped make me a better  
player. We seemed to have a real good feel together, I think it 
translated into a confidence with him. All players are generally 
judged by the number of championships they won. Unfortunately, he 
only won two. His greatness as a basketball player can't be 
questioned. He was fun, we used to laugh at him a lot, some of the 
things that would happen. I once told him, no one roots for 
Goliath.'' -- Jerry West, former teammate and current executive vice 
president of basketball operations with the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``As I grew up, Wilt the Stilt was THE player. Just the things  
he was able to do. I guess one year they told him he couldn't make 
as much money as he wanted because he couldn't pass the ball, so he 
went out and led the league in assists. Watching Wilt, you always 
kind of got the idea he was just playing with people. That he was 
on cruise control and still 10 times better than anybody else that 
was playing at that time.'' -- Denver Nuggets coach Dan Issel. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, he was both literally and figuratively a  
larger-than-life sports figure of the 20th century. He dominated 
his sport like almost no one else.'' -- Atlanta Hawks president Stan 
Kasten. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the NBA. He was the guy on the top. Wilt was the guy  
you talked about -- he and Bill Russell. He was the most dominating 
center -- the best center to ever play in the NBA.'' -- Former NBA 
center and Bulls coach Johnny ``Red'' Kerr, who played part of one 
season in Philly with Wilt and against him for six-plus years. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always a person that I viewed as being bigger than life  
in more ways than one. I had recently heard through friends and 
associates that he hadn't been feeling well, but again, I felt Wilt 
was a person who was able to overcome anything, so I was totally 
shocked to hear of his death.'' -- Al Attles, a former teammate of 
Chamberlain's with the Warriors and now the team's vice president 
and assistant general manager. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Wilt Chamberlain had a great deal to do with the success of  
the NBA. His dominance, power, demeanor and the rivalry with Bill 
Russell says it all. He will be sorely missed by myself and 
everyone in the basketball community. Wilt was a great performer 
and a great athlete.'' -- Former Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a terrific guy. It is a great loss to the sports world.  
Wilt Chamberlain had a special place in basketball history and he 
will be missed. We had many battles with Wilt. He was a fun guy to 
be around; he was a 'Gentle Giant.''' -- Boston Celtics great and 
Hall of Famer Tom Heinsohn. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent 12 years in his armpits, and I always carried that  
100-point game on my shoulders. After I got my third foul, I said 
to one of the officials, Willy Smith, `Why don't you just give him 
100 points and we'll all go home?' Well, we did.'' -- Darrall 
Imhoff, who as a 6-foot-10 rookie center for the Knicks, guarded 
Chamberlain during his 100-point game. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We've lost a giant of a man in every sense of the word. The  
shadow of accomplishment he cast over our game is unlikely ever to 
be matched.'' -- NBA commissioner David Stern. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shock to all of us in the basketball community. This is  
a guy whose impact changed the rules of the game ... he changed the 
interior part of our basketball game.'' -- Los Angeles Lakers coach 
Phil Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``He was more inquisitive than anybody I ever knew. He was  
writing a screenplay about his life. He was interested in world 
affairs, sometimes he'd call me up late at night and discuss 
philosophy. I think he'll be remembered as a great man. He happened 
to make a living playing basketball but he was more than that. He 
could talk on any subject. He was a Goliath.'' -- Sy Goldberg, 
Chamberlain's longtime attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``He just was a wonderful person. He comes off one way, but he  
is truly a family-oriented person, a person who loves his friends 
and friends loved him. ... He is a person that will always be one 
of our favorite, favorite people. Not only because he was a great 
basketball player, but he was a great son, a great brother, a great 
uncle and he was just a nice, nice person.'' -- Chamberlain's 
sister, Barbara Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I did see him about four times a week -- big, strong, big  
smile. He always thought he could play still better than all the 
guys in the game could play. He is gone and I can't believe it.'' -- 
Announcer Chick Hearn, who broadcast all of the Lakers games when 
Chamberlain played for them. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The 76ers family is deeply saddened by the loss of not only  
one of our greatest players of all time, but by an incredible human 
being. We pass along our condolences to his family and join the 
millions of basketball fans around the world mourning this loss.'' 
-- 76ers owner Pat Croce. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Wilt was a tremendous individual, I really got to know him  
when I was coaching at UCLA. He spent a lot of time with the team. 
As far as basketball, he changed the way the game is played. This 
is a great loss.'' -- 76ers coach Larry Brown.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 231.12 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tumbling bond prices and a weak outlook for  
Raytheon deflated stocks Tuesday as traders as traders, already 
anxious about interest rates, found themselves nervous about 
corporate profits as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 231.12 to close at  
10,417.06. It was the Dow's 10th biggest point drop in history, and 
the steepest since May 27, when the blue-chip index fell 235.23 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 fell 22.17 to 1,313.04, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 
43.52 to 2,872.43, retreating from the new record close of 2,915.95 
set Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A drop in bond prices depressed stocks Tuesday. Bond investors,  
nagged by persistent worries about interest rates, sold ahead of 
this week's government reports on wholesale prices and industrial 
production. The reports are expected to bring the latest signs of 
whether inflation is escalating. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still concerns out there about whether the Fed is  
going to raise rates again,'' said Barry Berman, head trader for 
Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee. ``And given the strength of the 
market last week, that provides as good an opportunity as any for 
some profit-taking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks soared last week after the Federal Reserve held interest  
rates steady. But the Fed left open the possibility of another rate 
increase, which would be the third this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in bond prices pushed the yield on the 30-year Treasury  
bond up to 6.23 percent Tuesday from 6.20 percent late Friday. The 
bond market was closed Monday for the Columbus Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising bond yields can present an attractive alternative to  
stocks by offering a fixed, guaranteed return. Financial services 
stocks, which are most vulnerable to rising rates, were among the 
Dow's worst performers Tuesday. American Express fell 3 5/8 to 145 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, traders were able to set aside some of their interest  
rate worries amid expectations that strong third-quarter earnings 
reports, which began in earnest Tuesday, would bolster stock 
prices. But that optimism vanished Tuesday amid news of trouble at 
Raytheon. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense contractors fell following reports that Raytheon is  
behind schedule or over budget on some major Pentagon orders. While 
market officials delayed the start of trading for Raytheon shares, 
most of its rival contractors tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final hour of trading, Raytheon confirmed that its  
earnings for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 will come in sharply below 
analysts' expectations. Once the stock opened, Class B shares 
plummeted 18 3/4 to 24 1/4. General Dynamics fell 4 11/16 to 57 11/16, 
and Litton fell 3 9/16 to 49 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Even strong earnings reports couldn't guarantee solid market  
performances Tuesday. Several Wall Street brokerages reported 
significant profit growth, yet failed to attract buyers for their 
stock. Merrill Lynch fell 3/4 to 67 after reporting it earned $1.34 
per share in the third quarter, beating analysts' estimates of 
$1.29 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Paine Webber said its third-quarter profits rose to 86 cents per  
share from 51 cents per share in the same period of 1998. Analysts 
had expected Paine Webber to earn 83 cents per share. The 
brokerage's stock slipped 11/16 to 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette fared best, rising 2 3/16 to 42 1/2  
after the firm reported third-quarter earnings of 85 cents a share, 
beating Wall Street's estimate of 76 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were also held down by the dollar's weakness against the  
Japanese yen. In late New York trading, the dollar bought 106.31 
yen, down from 106.68 yen late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same old devil is hurting the market,'' said John H.  
Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. ``Investors 
are worried about bonds and the dollar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Volume of all listed shares totaled 946.65 
million shares, compared with 791.73 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.52 to 424.67.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.2 percent.  
European indexes were mostly lower, as Germany's DAX index lost 1.0 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.0 percent, and France's CAC-40 
fell 1.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Spurs' Robinson Enjoying Anonymity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- David Robinson is enjoying the rare taste of  
anonymity he's getting in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being 7 feet tall, you can't hide,'' the San Antonio Spurs  
center said with a laugh, ``but I walked around for four or five 
hours today and I only was asked for four or five autographs. 
That's a lot different from being in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nice break.''  
</P>
<P>
	Robinson and his Spurs teammates arrived in Milan on Tuesday for  
what for them should be a nice break from the NBA preseason -- the 
McDonald's Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	While there have been some close calls, NBA teams boast a  
combined 16-0 record in the tourney's 12-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's six-team field includes the NBA, European, South  
American, Asian and Australian champions, plus the Italian League 
titlist. 
</P>
<P>
	In Italy, basketball is second -- albeit a distant second -- in  
popularity to soccer, and as of Tuesday there were still hundreds 
of tickets left for Thursday's first-round games at the 
10,122-capacity FilaForum on the outskirts of Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio has a bye into Friday's semifinals, where it will  
meet the winner of Thursday's game between Brazil's Vasco da Gama 
and Australia's Adelaide 36ers. The other teams are European 
champions Zalgiris Kaunas, Lebanon's C.S. Sagesse and Italy's 
Varese Roosters. 
</P>
<P>
	The final is Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough in the middle of training camp to fly across the  
world,'' said Robinson, the 1995 NBA MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've only been together for a week and right now we have to  
be working on getting ourselves going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA bills the event as deciding the best club in the world,  
but Spurs forward Tim Duncan views these games as a way for his 
team to ease into a title defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to use these games over here to get better,'' last  
June's NBA Finals MVP said. ``These are like preseason games for 
us. We have to use them to get ready for the real season. We want 
to get a lot of people on the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Greg Popovich acknowledged he knows little about the  
Spurs' potential opponents here, but said his aim this week will be 
``getting our big people involved in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only Lithuanian club Zalgiris Kaunas, with George Zidek (a  
member of UCLA's 1995 NCAA champions) and Eurelijus Zukauskas 
(whose NBA rights are owned by the Milwaukee Bucks), has two big 
men that could hope to clog the middle against San Antonio's pair 
of 7-footers, Duncan and Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basketball has obviously improved around the world, but the  
players are a little bit smaller,'' said Spurs guard Avery Johnson, 
who at 5-foot-11 is short by NBA standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fact,'' he quipped, ``I may even find somebody out here my  
size.''

<HEADLINE> Tighter Control Sought on Rape Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal control of two compounds that have  
been used as ``date rape'' drugs would tighten under legislation 
passed Tuesday by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, introduced by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., would amend  
the Controlled Substances Act to place gamma hydroxybutyric acid, a 
central nervous system depressant also known as GHB, on a list of 
drugs that are the most strictly regulated under the federal 
Controlled Substances Act because of their danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Ketamine, an animal tranquilizer, would be listed, but at a  
lower level of restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps as many as 90 kids have died in the past couple of  
years because of these drugs,'' Upton said during debate on the 
House floor. ``This is a nightmare that needs to end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill passed 423-1. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, was the lone  
dissenter. 
</P>
<P>
	GHB also is known as ``G,'' ``Liquid X,'' ``Liquid Ecstasy,''  
``Grievous Bodily Harm,'' ``Georgia Home Boy,'' and ``Scoop,'' the 
bill said. 
</P>
<P>
	A person who drinks a soda laced with a few drops of GHB -- which  
is colorless and odorless -- can lose consciousness within 20 
minutes. Victims frequently have no memory of what happened, and 
the drug is difficult to trace, often leaving the body within 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``This drug, GHB, has been used in innumerable rapes across the  
country,'' said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, a cosponsor. 
``Without this bill, the illicit use of GHB would increase 
dramatically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would make it illegal to possess GHB with the intent to  
manufacture, distribute or dispense it, with a maximum prison term 
of 20 years for a first offense. Exceptions would be made for GHB 
clinical studies approved by the Food and Drug Administration to 
determine if the drug helps with medical problems such as 
narcolepsy, a sleeping disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill has been named the Hillory J. Farias Date-Rape  
Prevention Drug Act, after a 17-year-old La Porte, Texas, girl who 
died in August 1996 after someone slipped GHB into her soft drink 
at a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers have not yet acted on similar legislation introduced  
in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 2130.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Expands Insurance Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is directing education and  
health officials to develop ways of enrolling uninsured children in 
federal health insurance for the poor through their schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in a speech to the American Academy of Pediatrics  
today, was announcing a campaign to reach children eligible for 
Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. The 
program permits states to offer Medicaid or other insurance to 
children in low-income working families who are not poor enough to 
qualify for traditional Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the more than 10 million children who qualify for  
the programs are unenrolled, a White House statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some participating states, including Alabama, Georgia, Indiana,  
Florida, Illinois and New Jersey, already are using schools to 
enroll children in the programs. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,500 schools in 49 states that were asked in August  
to participate have said they would join the Insure Kids Now 
campaign, a program launched in February to sign up children for 
CHIP, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the secretaries of health and human services and  
education will send information to state agencies explaining how 
schools and state governments can use CHIP funds to pay for school 
outreach programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton planned to sign an executive order instructing the  
secretaries of health and human services, education and agriculture 
to report to him in six months on how to institutionalize the 
school outreach programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new recruiting measures include:

                            *Frank Baker    	
</P>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- The Rev. Frank Baker, an authority on the  
founder of Methodism, John Wesley, died Monday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker was ordained as a Methodist minister in 1937 and served  
pastorates in central and northern England until 1959. He joined 
the Duke University Divinity School faculty in 1960 and retired as 
professor emeritus of English church history in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke Divinity School dean L. Gregory Jones called Baker ``the  
leading authority on the history of the Wesleys and early 
Methodism.'' He was the author of 30 books and more than 200 
articles. 
</P>
<P>
	During his career, Baker was closely associated with a 36-volume  
compilation of Wesley's writings. The work is being published by 
Abington Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Baker Methodist Research Center was established  
at Duke to serve as a focal point for future Wesley scholarships.

</P>
<P>
	BELLEVUE, Wash. (AP) -- Donald Campbell, a supervisor of two  
national forests who was respected by both conservationists and 
loggers, died of a heart attack Thursday during an 18-mile hike on 
Mount Rainier. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	An Army veteran of World War II and forestry graduate of Utah  
State University, Campbell joined the U.S. Forest Service as a 
ranger in central Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	He was named supervisor of the Okanogan National Forest in 1967  
and the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, the largest in the 
state at 1.7 million acres, in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell took it as a compliment when, once during a broadcast  
debate, an audience member said he couldn't tell if Campbell was 
more in favor of the environment or logging. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired in 1980.

</P>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- E. William Crotty, a major Democratic  
fund-raiser who became U.S. Ambassador to the eastern Caribbean 
last year, died Sunday of pneumonia. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Crotty, a longtime Daytona Beach attorney and civic activist,  
was ambassador to seven nations -- Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, 
Dominica, St. Lucia, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent 
and The Grenadines. He was appointed to the post in November and 
was based in Barbados. 
</P>
<P>
	He was former chairman of the Executive Committee of the  
Democratic National Committee Board of Directors and a fund-raiser 
for numerous candidates, including President Clinton and Vice 
President Al Gore.

                           *Milt Jackson    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Milt Jackson, a jazz vibraphonist who made the  
instrument sing like the human voice as a longtime member of the 
Modern Jazz Quartet, died Saturday of liver cancer. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was considered one of the best improvisers in jazz and  
an outstanding blues player. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson originally was a singer in a Detroit gospel quartet. In  
the 1940s, he created a new sound by slowing the motor on his 
Deagan Vibraharp's oscillator to a third of the speed of Lionel 
Hampton's. The result was a warm, smoky sound with a vibrato 
approximating his own singing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's style came from Charlie Parker, whose rhythmic traits  
he adopted. He was one of the first bona fide be-bop vibraphone 
musicians, and he became a jewel in Dizzy Gillespie's band. He 
recorded be-bop classics with the band, such as ``A Night in 
Tunisia,'' ``Anthropology'' and ``Two Bass Hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1951, Jackson teamed with Thelonius Monk, recording ``Criss  
Cross'' and ``Straight, No Chaser,'' among others. 
</P>
<P>
	When a pianist in Gillespie's band, John Lewis, decided to form  
a new group, one going beyond soloists with a rhythm section, 
Jackson signed on. In 1952, the Modern Jazz Quartet was born.

</P>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Thomas H. Lake, former Eli Lilly and Co.  
president who also led the Lilly Endowment for 15 years, died 
Sunday. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of a Saltsburg, Pa., coal miner, Lake received his  
bachelor's degree in pharmacy and chemistry from Temple University 
in 1941. He served in the Army in World War II, rising to the rank 
of major. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake began his career with drug company Lilly in 1946 in sales.  
He was president from 1973-1976 and served on the board of 
directors from 1965-1989. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1977-1992, Lake also was chairman of the Lilly Endowment,  
one of the largest private foundations in the nation. He served as 
the foundation's president from 1997-1984.

<P>
                           *Bruce Ritter    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Rev. Bruce Ritter, who founded the Covenant  
House shelters for homeless teen-agers but was forced to resign 
after several young men accused him of seducing them, died 
Thursday. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roman Catholic priest had suffered from Hodgkin's disease,  
cancer of the lymph nodes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritter had denied the accusations of sexual misconduct and was  
never formally charged. He resigned from Covenant House in 1990; in 
August 1991, Ritter left the Franciscan order. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak, Covenant House was the largest private child care  
agency in the country. It sheltered 2,000 homeless teen-agers a 
night and took in $92 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	It operated shelters in six U.S. cities and in Toronto, Canada,  
four orphanages in Central America. Ritter was visited by Mother 
Teresa; President Reagan hailed him as a hero in his 1984 State of 
the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	Covenant House started in 1969, when Ritter was living in a  
shabby apartment in the East Village of Manhattan, an area teeming 
with flower children and drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Six homeless teen-agers asked if they could stay in his living  
room during a snowstorm. ``I didn't have the guts to throw them out 
so I kept them,'' he once said. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1972, hundreds of youngsters were seeking shelter in Ritter's  
informal group homes. He obtained a license to run a child care 
agency and opened a crisis shelter in Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal that led to his downfall broke in December 1989,  
when a former prostitute said he had had an affair with Ritter. 
Ritter denied it, but several other young men came forward with 
similar stories, saying he seduced them after they sought his help. 
</P>
<P>
	Questionable financial transactions surfaced. In February 1990,  
the Franciscans ordered Ritter to take a leave of absence. Later 
that month, he resigned from Covenant House.

</P>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- John White, a correspondent for The  
Associated Press in Olympia for 23 years, died Monday. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	White had been diagnosed with lung cancer last summer.  
</P>
<P>
	He joined the AP in Boise, Idaho, in 1963. He transferred to the  
Portland, Ore., bureau in 1967 and, later that year, was named 
correspondent in Fresno, Calif. He came to Olympia in 1971, and in 
1973 he was named correspondent of the capital bureau. He retired 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	A press center near the Capitol that is occupied by the AP and  
other news organizations bears White's name. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Evelyn, and five children.

<HEADLINE> Cuomo Writes Children's Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo is spinning his  
wisdom to a younger audience these days. 
</P>
<P>
	He has written a children's book, ``The Blue Spruce,'' due out  
in bookstores next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a beautiful story,'' Cuomo says in Tuesday's New York  
Post. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Blue Spruce'' is about a tree uprooted by a storm and how  
a boy and his father try to save it. Cuomo relates the story's 
lesson -- never give up -- to his own life as he grew from the son of 
Italian immigrants into a political leader.

<HEADLINE> Russian Tea Room Reopens With Glitz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Russian Tea Room, an old favorite of A-list  
celebrities, reopened Monday, and the see-and-be-seen crowd was 
back to judge whether the restaurant still has it after a 
four-year, $22 million renovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The ladies who lunch streamed through the revolving doors ``just  
left of Carnegie Hall'' beginning promptly at 11:30 a.m., greeted 
by waiters in red tunics pouring vodka and dishing caviar. 
</P>
<P>
	Reminiscent of the restaurant's glory days, the well-to-do were  
seated in buttery red leather seats that look nearly identical to 
the vinyl ones once reserved for Jackie O. and Paul Newman. 
</P>
<P>
	Shiny hunter-green walls and gilded molding offset period  
Russian paintings and antique samovars, making the old crowd feel 
right at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those with reservations the first day were entertainment  
agent Sam Cohn, writer Sidney Sheldon, and the former owner of the 
Russian Tea Room, Faith Stewart-Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beautiful,'' said Ms. Stewart-Gordon. ``I was really  
stunned when I saw it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the restaurant opened in 1926, it really was a tea room,  
and its patrons were largely Russian artists, especially dancers. 
Over the years, it became a full-service establishment that served 
up to 1,000 people a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Stewart-Gordon sold the restaurant to Tavern on the Green  
proprietor Warner LeRoy in 1995, after he promised a top-to-bottom 
renovation would preserve the soul of the place. The ground floor 
is a carefully recreated version of its former self. 
</P>
<P>
	A 700-pound ice sculpture modeled after St. Basil's Cathedral in  
Moscow graced the entrance to the first-floor dining room Monday, 
its turrets filled with premium vodka and champagne. Two more like 
it will be delivered each day. 
</P>
<P>
	An 18-foot revolving aquarium designed for snub-nosed sturgeon  
welcomes second-floor visitors, who are seated on red velvet or 
green brocade upholstery beneath a 700,000-piece Tiffany stained 
glass ceiling. The aquarium dominates the room, but shares the 
spotlight with a towering gold-painted tree hung with 35 
Faberge-inspired glass eggs worth about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The upper floors are reserved for private use, and include a  
fireplace, sapphire-blue walls, domed ceilings painted in bronze, 
and a three-dimensional diorama of pre-revolutionary Red Square, 
complete with a little czar reviewing Russian troops. 
</P>
<P>
	LeRoy calls the food an American reinvention of Russian cuisine.  
He even enlisted a Russian history professor-turned-cookbook author 
to help. 
</P>
<P>
	The over-the-top style carries with it the risk that the  
once-venerable establishment will become little more than a 
pre-revolutionary Russian theme restaurant alongside Planet 
Hollywood, one of its neighbors on West 57th Street. 
</P>
<P>
	LeRoy isn't worried. He says the place is his fantasy come true.  
</P>
<P>
	``And restaurant going, I think, is a fantasy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'The Story of Us' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Bruce Willis, wisecracking action hero, is this season's ``It''  
boy. He's emerged with back-to-back raves for his work in ``The 
Sixth Sense'' and ``Breakfast of Champions'' and now steps out with 
a romantic comedy, ``The Story of Us.'' What do AP critics think? 
Here are two divergent reviews. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *A Hit    	

</P>
<P>
	What happens when the most engaging, soulmatish couple you know  
hits splitsville? 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Reiner tries to answer that question in ``The Story of Us,''  
a funny, teary, endearing movie that marks the director's return to 
the romantic comedy formula he mined so well in ``When Harry Met 
Sally ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starring Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer, ``The Story of Us''  
might be alternately titled ``When Harry and Sally Grew Sick and 
Tired of Each Other 15 Years Down the Road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willis and Pfeiffer play Ben and Katie Jordan, a picket-fence  
perfect couple with two oh-so-lovable children whom real-life 
parents would salivate to sire. 
</P>
<P>
	As the film opens, the family is together at the dinner table,  
playing a daily quiz, asking one another about their highs and lows 
of the day. For critics who rail against Hollywood sex and 
violence, it's precisely the portrait of family values they want 
the movie industry to present. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet as the kids wander off to prepare for summer camp, it  
becomes clear that all is not well with Mom and Dad. Though 
seemingly suited to a T, their marriage has dried up from the sheer 
wear and tear of the job of staying together. 
</P>
<P>
	Their moments alone are either thunderous with arguments or more  
thunderous with silence. They don't make eye contact much any more, 
afraid they might find there's no one there. So Ben and Katie go 
their separate ways. They split while the children are away and 
begin to contemplate the next question: one lawyer or two? 
</P>
<P>
	Through well-produced, though at times mildly interruptive,  
flashbacks, the movie presents snapshots of the Harry and Sally 
that Ben and Katie used to be. It balances nicely with the 
present-tense George and Martha they've become. 
</P>
<P>
	Basically, it's all over but the shouting. And the Jordans do a  
lot of shouting. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling their first meeting, when Katie donned a pith helmet  
to ward off the paperclips Ben hurled her way in jest, he asks, 
``What happened to that fun girl? ... Where did she go?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her fierce retort: ``You beat it out of me.''  
</P>
<P>
	Willis, fresh from a subtle performance in ``The Sixth Sense''  
and an outrageous satiric turn in ``Breakfast of Champions,'' 
proves he can do a lot more than blow things up in action movies. 
He displays the comic charm that launched his career in 
television's ``Moonlighting,'' while evoking credible anger and 
remorse over a marriage done in by time. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no surprise that Pfeiffer shines in the darker, dramatic  
moments. Her fits of rage are icy and vicious. But she also shows a 
real bent for comedy, infusing Katie with an infectious 
spiritedness and goofy good humor that makes it clear why Ben is 
the more reluctant of the pair to consign their fortunes to divorce 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer and Willis get excellent support from Paul Reiser,  
Julie Hagerty, Tim Matheson and Betty White, Red Buttons, Jayne 
Meadows and Tom Poston as Ben and Katie's parents. Reiner and Rita 
Wilson are priceless as the Jordans' best friends, the couple Ben 
and Katie think of as their Fred and Ethel Mertz. 
</P>
<P>
	Reiner pontificates on the false nomenclature of the derriere,  
while Wilson has a wonderful scene in which she compares the sexual 
apparatus of the genders, advising that the female anatomy must 
relax and realize that the male anatomy is a ``peaceful visitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone who's experienced the painful end of a long relationship  
might snort at the reasoned and reasonable approach the Jordans cop 
once they decide to separate. They also might find it a stretch 
that nothing more overt than the mileage of the years, plus an 
overheard conversation in which hubby discusses his spousal 
problems with another woman, could jeopardize a marriage so 
enviably better than almost anyone else's. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer and Willis carry it off, though. They demonstrate  
endearing chemistry and sincerity as the Jordans in both the happy 
years and the spiteful ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``That girl in the pith helmet is still in here,'' Katie tells  
Ben at a moment of vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
	Something to think about for couples on the brink.  
</P>
<P>
	-- By David Germain, Associated Press Writer.

</P>
<P>
	 *A Miss    	

</P>
<P>
	Ben Jordan is buffed and a successful writer. Katie Jordan has  
an hourglass figure and is a crossword puzzle designer. They have 
two pinup kids and a half-million dollar home. Are they happy? 
</P>
<P>
	Nah.  
</P>
<P>
	They spend hours with marriage counselors. They ditch the kids  
and fly off to Venice to recapture their mojo. They cart the kids -- 
who never seem to have a clue that something's wrong at home -- off 
to summer camp, then take a vacation from each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben stays in a hotel, eats cheese puffs and swizzles beer all  
day long while Katie stays home, tidies up a tidy house, works on 
her crossword puzzles and swaps calls with Ben. (Day and night he's 
lying next to the phone.) 
</P>
<P>
	Tough life.  
</P>
<P>
	Why would Ben and Katie want out of this union?  
</P>
<P>
	The reasons are hard to understand in Universal Picture's ``The  
Story of Us,'' the latest product to roll out of the Hollywood 
romantic comedy pipeline. Perhaps it's because the movie spends too 
much time being smooth and clever and not enough time being bumpy 
and awkwardly real. Perhaps it's because this film takes a stab at 
subtlety and misses. Maybe it's because Hollywood still thinks that 
sugared water tastes better than just plain water. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever it is, this tale of marital not-so-misfits is less a  
story of US and more a story of THEM. 
</P>
<P>
	Romantic comedies work best when they're about two people who  
seem completely wrong for each other, yet learn to rethink their 
prejudices and overcome their differences. They spread out into 
bigger themes: what it means to be American, what it means to 
sacrifice some things to get others. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Jordans are too snug a fit, even when they're  
throwing fits. They appear to like their neighborhood, each other's 
friends. They dress like one another, they play well with each 
other. (After 15 years of marriage, they're still playing this 
nauseatingly cute game called ``High-Low'': ``OK, dear. You tell me 
about your high point today and I'll tell you about my low 
point!'') At times you get the feeling, even when they raise their 
voices, that they're struggling to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	As Katie, Michelle Pfeiffer does what she can to make this film  
barely OK. She's not nearly as sharp as when she played Susie 
Diamond in ``The Fabulous Baker Boys''; that would require a 
script. But she does lend Katie a spryness, a tenderness, a wryness 
that endears. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Willis? Nice try, but he still can't reach any depth,  
still can't offer any nuances into characters that aren't 
guns-blazing cops who die hard. He's too stiff to make us believe 
that Ben is still boyish, carefree, vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	There are moments when ``The Story of Us'' makes you giggle:  
Like the fantasy scene in which Ben and Katie's parents appear next 
to them in bed and jabber away their romantic mood (Red Buttons, 
Betty White, Jayne Meadows and Tom Poston pop in with fine cameos); 
or when the couple hides from -- and keeps running into -- the 
tourists from hell in Venice; and when their marriage counselor 
interrupts their therapy session every minute to visit the 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	And director Rob Reiner very effectively gives a history of the  
couple's sniping sessions in layered, one-line flashbacks -- 
back-to-back and take-that-and-that attacks that show how a 
marriage disintegrates day by day, put-down by put-down. 
</P>
<P>
	But then silly things happen, the dialogue turns stilted, and  
you're reminded that you're watching a pair of pretty actors and 
not your next-door neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Just listen to Rob Reiner and Rita Wilson (who misplay Stan and  
Rachel, the Jordan's annoying best friends), the Fred and Ethel 
Mertz of the 1990s, as they opine on married life: 
</P>
<P>
	``Marriage is the Jack Kevorkian of romance -- it is virtually  
impossible to French kiss a person who leaves the new roll of 
toilet paper resting on top of the empty cardboard roll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no definitive answers in life; it is all an  
illusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willis -- even Pfeiffer -- commit a few fouls, too. In a moment of  
illumination, Bruce says: 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about people who don't like themselves enough to be  
liked by others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Pfeiffer ponders:  
</P>
<P>
	``When is that moment in a marriage when a spoon becomes a  
spoon?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who cares?  
</P>
<P>
	And please -- who talks like that, anyway?

	HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) -- Fifth-grader Christopher Hoch waited all  
of Tuesday morning to ask Vice President Al Gore what his middle 
name is. But when the big moment came, mum was the word from the 
Democratic presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore toured Roberta C. Cartwright Elementary School in this Las  
Vegas suburb to talk up his plan to put more teachers in classrooms 
and to reduce class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	After he spent nearly 45 minutes talking with parents and  
teachers, Christopher decided he couldn't wait any longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's your middle name?'' he asked.  
</P>
<P>
	Instead of answering, Gore asked Christopher for his full name.  
Gore either didn't hear Christopher or didn't want to reveal his 
middle name. Press aides and Secret Service agents later said they 
didn't know what it was either.

	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The Republican battle for South Carolina  
has begun. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP presidential candidates George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain  
both claimed Tuesday to have been the first to build a statewide 
organization here. 
</P>
<P>
	Both said they did it first.  
</P>
<P>
	McCain issued an announcement at about 8:30 a.m.; Bush, the  
governor of Texas, followed with a statement just before 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``Far and away it was us. They reacted to our release,'' said  
Jim Merrill, McCain's state campaign director. 
</P>
<P>
	First or not, Bush's campaign said it has signed up 10,000  
volunteers statewide, including 500 last weekend at the state fair, 
said state director Heath Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think it shows the tremendous support that he has  
here,'' Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill said his group has 4,000 people signed up. McCain has  
said South Carolina and New Hampshire are do-or-die states in his 
pursuit of the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, GOP presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole plans to  
open her state campaign headquarters on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina will hold its first-in-the South GOP primary Feb.  
19.

<HEADLINE> Assemblywoman Leaves Green Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Citing a need for campaign cash, a woman  
who stunned the political establishment when she won election to 
the state Assembly as a candidate of the Green Party has quit the 
party and will seek re-election as an independent. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by Assemblywoman Audie Bock, who had been the Green  
Party's highest-ranking elected official in the nation, means she 
can skip the March 7 primary next year. As an independent, she will 
win a spot on the November general election ballot if she collects 
signatures of 5,677 registered voters in her Oakland-based 
district. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadline in state law for her to give up her Green Party  
affiliation and become eligible to file as an independent was last 
week. Bock made her decision Thursday and told party members 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Running in a runoff special election in March, Bock narrowly  
defeated the Democratic nominee, former Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris, 
who had held the 16th Assembly District seat for 12 years before 
his election as mayor in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Bock did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment  
left at her Oakland and Sacramento offices today by The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Jan, a member of the Green Party's Alameda County Council,  
said it was known within party circles that Bock was concerned 
about the party's ability to raise the kind of money it would take 
to run a serious campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Her first campaign was run on a shoestring. But Green Party  
members said she told them she could not make a reasonable 
re-election bid for less than $250,000. Bock's most recent campaign 
finance report, filed last June, showed she had $7,090 on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the pressures, the winner-take-all voting system in this  
country and big money campaigns, she did what she felt she had to 
do,'' Jan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bock, who often votes with the Democratic majority, has  
acknowledged it isn't easy being Green. Elected after the 
Legislature's deadline for introducing bills this year, she has 
pushed unsuccessfully for universal health care, a bigger increase 
in school funding, more vigorous enforcement of environmental laws 
and more money for mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
	Her party is similar in philosophy to Green parties in various  
European countries, sharing goals such as feminism, decentralized 
authority, nonviolence and environmental consciousness.

<HEADLINE> Irvin Injury Gives Rookie a Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- The play that opened a spot in the Dallas  
Cowboys' lineup for Wane McGarity brought tears to his eyes. And 
they weren't ones of joy. 
</P>
<P>
	The rookie receiver was frightened Sunday when he saw teammate,  
friend and mentor Michael Irvin lay motionless after being tackled 
by the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	McGarity was inactive for the game and opted to watch it at his  
mother's home in San Antonio. He saw Irvin catch a pass for an 
8-yard gain, then turned away from the television after the tackle. 
He looked back at the screen and Irvin was still down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Move! Move! Move something so I know you're OK,'' McGarity  
screamed, his eyes filling with tears. 
</P>
<P>
	McGarity prayed and worried for hours until learning Irvin would  
be OK. His spinal cord is swollen and he has a herniated disc, but 
he's expected to play again this season. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, coaches told McGarity they're counting on him to pick  
up some of the slack in Irvin's absence. It's quite a promotion for 
a fourth-round draft pick who has dropped both passes thrown to him 
and has been inactive the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
	But coaches saw enough from McGarity in the preseason to give  
them confidence in the former University of Texas receiver. Even 
quarterback Troy Aikman, a tough critic, has raved about the 
5-foot-8 McGarity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he is right where he was when training camp ended,''  
Dallas coach Chan Gailey said. ``He had a few drops in the Atlanta 
game, but overall he's played pretty good. He made some big plays 
in the preseason, and we're hoping he can pick up right where he 
left off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ernie Mills will start opposite Raghib Ismail, but McGarity also  
will see action there. When the Cowboys go with three or four 
receivers, Mills likely will go to his usual spot and McGarity will 
take Irvin's place. 
</P>
<P>
	McGarity wondered what the Cowboys thought of him when he was  
made inactive before the Arizona game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went home that day and thought about what could I have  
possibly done. In talking to people, I don't think I did anything 
wrong,'' McGarity said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was a numbers game. McGarity was active the first  
two weeks because he was needed to catch punts, not passes. With 
Deion Sanders healthy and able to return punts, McGarity was 
replaced by Jason Tucker, another reserve receiver who plays on 
various kick coverage units. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearing the explanation from coaches was one thing. Hearing it  
from someone like Irvin was much more reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike's been a big part of my adjustment to the NFL,'' McGarity  
said. ``I went through a rough time being inactive and he was one 
of the guys who kept my head up. He came to me and told me not to 
worry about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGarity began watching Irvin and copying his practice habits  
during training camp. He eventually got the courage to ask Irvin 
for advice. A friendship blossomed quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``He puts something in you,'' McGarity said. ``You don't know  
what it is, but you just want to go out there and compete. You want 
to go out and do your best because that's how he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next pass McGarity catches will be his first in the NFL.  
Even though he's rusty from not playing much and hardly practicing 
the past month, he's ready for this opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I'm a quick learner,'' McGarity said. ``I can go  
out there and adjust real quick. 
</P>
<P>
	If things don't work out right away, McGarity will have the  
confidence to continue. All he has to do is fall back on something 
Irvin often tells him: ``Always, always keep working hard, keep 
going out there and trying to do the things you can do, and don't 
let anybody tell you different.''

<HEADLINE> World Population Hits 6 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A population clock at U.N. headquarters  
hit 6 billion Tuesday and started racing toward 7 billion as an 
anxious world pondered what the new millennium holds for an 
increasingly crowded planet. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed the symbolic Baby 6  
Billion in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- a boy born to refugee 
parents in a region returning to life after a decade of war. 
</P>
<P>
	Adnan Nevic's birth ``should light a path of tolerance and  
understanding for all people,'' Annan said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tens of thousands of children born on the Day of 6  
Billion are far more likely to face lives of poverty and illiteracy 
in developing countries. UNICEF head Carol Bellamy noted that 1 in 
3 children in the world's poorest countries won't live beyond age 
5. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge facing the world, Annan said, is to find ``the  
will'' to feed, clothe and house every inhabitant of Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, meanwhile, President Clinton said the world's  
nations must work harder to erase the grinding poverty in which 
many of their people spend their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must refuse to accept a future in which one part of  
humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new economy, while another 
part lives on the edge of survival,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. demographers had determined that the population would hit 6  
billion on Tuesday, a doubling of the Earth's inhabitants in less 
than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The population clock in the visitors lobby at U.N. headquarters  
was racing so fast Tuesday morning that it skipped from 
5,999,999,998 to 6,000,000,001. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody had triplets,'' quipped one U.N. official.  
</P>
<P>
	The clock was inside a display set up by the U.N. Population  
Fund, which has advocated the right of people to determine the size 
of their families. 
</P>
<P>
	It is campaigning to fulfill the goal of the 1994 U.N.  
population conference -- to provide basic education for all 
children, especially girls, by 2015, since research shows that 
educated women have fewer children. 
</P>
<P>
	With more than 1 billion people 15 to 24 just entering their  
reproductive years, the next population milestone will depend on 
the decisions they make about family size. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their choices will determine how many people will be on the  
planet by 2050 and beyond,'' read the Population Fund display. 
</P>
<P>
	And there is another ``youthquake'' coming, with 1.8 billion  
people under the age of 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with fertility rates falling, the United Nations projects  
that by 2050, the world's population will be between 7.3 billion 
and 10.7 billion, with 8.9 billion the most likely figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said the birth of the 6 billionth  
human being would have occurred four years ago if it wasn't for the 
country's one-child policy. In a letter to a national meeting 
Tuesday on population controls, he said the strict limit on family 
size saved the world 300 million births. 
</P>
<P>
	But local officials have been accused of using threats,  
sterilizations and late-term abortions to meet stringent birth 
quotas, although the government denies it condones such tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	With a population of 1.25 billion, China is the world's most  
populous country. But India is set to hit the 1 billion mark next 
year, and U.N. demographers predict it will become the most 
populous nation by 2040. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's announcement that India's population will be 1 billion  
on May 11, 2000 -- the anniversary of its multiple nuclear tests -- 
provided a stark reminder of the choice between feeding millions 
and becoming a nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
	While humanity is adding about 78 million people a year -- more  
than 200,000 a day -- the number of older people also is increasing 
dramatically in both developed and developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Population Fund's Richard Leete said the aging of the  
world's population is raising questions for the 21st century: 
Should retirement ages be raised? Will people in industrialized 
countries be forced to work longer because their pensions won't 
sustain their retirement? What should be done to keep older people 
active mentally and physically?

<HEADLINE> Bush Helps Republicans Raise Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who already has  
amassed $56 million for his Republican presidential campaign, used 
his fund-raising skills Tuesday to help other GOP candidates 
increase their coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	It important for Republicans to win in the Nov. 2 election to  
``send a clear message to the rest of America that our philosophy 
is working,'' Bush said at a $500-a-plate fund-raising luncheon for 
Gov. Jim Gilmore's political action committee, which is working to 
get a Republican majority in the Virginia legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's so many positive things to talk about all over the  
country,'' Bush said. ``I'm reminding people that our conservative 
philosophy is a compassionate philosophy, that our philosophy ... 
about ushering in a responsibility era, is a philosophy that will 
lead to a more decent, hopeful, optimistic tomorrow for everybody 
that is fortunate enough to call themselves an American.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 250 people attended the luncheon, including religious  
broadcaster Pat Robertson. Bush was scheduled to attend another 
fund-raiser, a private dinner in McLean, later Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The events are raising money for Gilmore's New Majority  
political action committee, which he is using to help fellow 
Republicans in next month's pivotal legislative elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP holds a narrow edge in the Senate and needs to pick up  
two seats to take undisputed control of the House of Delegates. The 
majority party in the next legislature will control redistricting 
in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's wife, Laura, and his father, former President Bush, made  
similar appearances with Gilmore last week. The events were 
expected to raise a total of more than $1 million, said Todd Reid, 
the PAC's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now if you really want to win, you've got to get my mother,''  
Bush joked. He added that former first lady Barbara Bush taught him 
that in politics it is important to ``remember who your friends 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's campaign reported raising more than $56 million through  
September, far outpacing his Republican and Democratic rivals. He 
reported having $37 million in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmore and the Bush family have a history of mutual support.  
The Texas governor aided Gilmore in his 1997 race for governor. In 
April, Gilmore became the 15th GOP governor to endorse Bush for 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmore said he and George W. Bush are ``longtime friends. We  
believe in the same things, we campaign in the same way, we govern 
in the same way -- a broadening out of the Republican party.''

<HEADLINE> Basketball Great Chamberlain Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Wilt Chamberlain, one of the most dominant  
players in the history of basketball and the only one to score 100 
points in an NBA game, died Tuesday at 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain's body was found by authorities who were called to  
his Bel-Air home shortly after noon PDT, said John Black, a Los 
Angeles Lakers spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire department spokesman, Jim Wells, said there were signs  
that Chamberlain might have had a heart attack. Chamberlain, who 
stayed active after his career as a long-distance runner, was 
hospitalized with an irregular heart beat in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as ``Wilt the Stilt'' and ``The Big Dipper,'' the 7-foot-1  
Chamberlain starred in the NBA from 1959 through 1973, when he 
played for the Philadelphia (later the San Francisco) Warriors, the 
76ers and the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	He scored 31,419 points during his career, a record until Kareem  
Abdul-Jabbar broke it in 1984. Chamberlain, who never fouled out in 
a 1,205 regular-season and playoff games, holds the record for 
career rebounding with 23,924. 
</P>
<P>
	He was such a force that the NBA changed some of its rules,  
including widening the lane to try to keep him farther from the 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wilt was one of the greatest ever, and we will never see  
another one like him,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Long after his career ended, Chamberlain made news by claiming  
in an autobiography that he had had sex with 20,000 women. 
</P>
<P>
	``The women who I have been the most attracted to, the most in  
love with, I've pushed away the strongest,'' the lifelong bachelor 
said in a 1991 interview with The Associated Press. ``There are 
about five women I can think of I could have married. I cared for 
them a lot, but not enough to make a commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain, who began his professional career with the Harlem  
Globetrotters in 1958, was one of only two men to win the MVP and 
rookie of the year awards in the same season (1959-60). He was also 
MVP in 1966 through 1968. He led the NBA in scoring seven straight 
seasons, 1960-66, and led the league in rebounding 11 of his 14 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his most famous records is the 100 points he scored in a  
single game in the Philadelphia Warriors' 169-147 defeat of the New 
York Knicks on March 2, 1962, in Hershey, Pa. He also holds the 
single-game record for rebounds, 55, against Boston in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain averaged 30.1 points a game in his career, including  
a record 50.4 in the 1961-62 season with Philadelphia. He also was 
one of the most versatile big men ever, leading the league in 
assists with 702 in 1967-68. 
</P>
<P>
	He led his team into the playoffs 13 times, winning two world  
championships. The first came in 1966-67 with the Philadelphia 
76ers, the second in 1971-72 with the Lakers, which won a record 33 
straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	His teams lost in the finals four other times and were beaten in  
the conference final six times. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Russell and the Boston Celtics almost always seemed to be  
the nemesis of Chamberlain-led teams, beating them twice in the 
championship series and five times in the conference finals. Three 
times, a series was decided by a seventh game that Boston won by 
either one or two points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've lost a giant of a man in every sense of the word,'' NBA  
commissioner David Stern said. ``The shadow of accomplishment he 
cast over our game is unlikely ever to be matched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilton Norman Chamberlain was born on Aug. 21, 1936, in  
Philadelphia. He didn't begin playing basketball until he was in 
the seventh grade. He grew 4 inches in three months when he was 15, 
and was 6-11 when he entered Philadelphia's Overbrook High School. 
</P>
<P>
	After leading Overbrook to three public school championships and  
two all-city titles, Chamberlain became one of the most recruited 
players ever with over 200 colleges interested. 
</P>
<P>
	He chose the University of Kansas and Hall of Fame coach Phog  
Allen. In his first game against the Kansas varsity -- freshmen 
weren't allowed to compete against other teams then -- he scored 50 
points before a packed Allen Fieldhouse crowd of more than 15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The next year, Chamberlain scored 52 points against Northwestern  
in his first game, a total he never surpassed in college, partly 
because of zone defenses designed to keep him from getting the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	As a junior, he led the 1957 Jayhawks to the NCAA tournament  
finals, where Kansas lost to unbeaten North Carolina in triple 
overtime in his final college game. Disgusted by being smothered by 
the zone defenses, Chamberlain left Kansas the next year and joined 
the Globetrotters. 
</P>
<P>
	Extremely agile for his size, Chamberlain ran cross-country in  
high school and was an outstanding high jumper and shot-putter at 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	He had remained active after his NBA career and was considered  
an outstanding volleyball player. He also ran in the Honolulu 
marathon recently and competed in a 50-mile race in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, Chamberlain made his first official visit to  
Kansas since his college career ended. His jersey was raised to the 
rafters of Allen Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned in life that you have to take the bitter with the  
sweet, and how sweet this is,'' Chamberlain said at the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	He seemed genuinely surprised at how much he was loved by the  
rabid Kansas fans, especially after staying away for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forty years ago I lost a heartbreaking battle, losing to North  
Carolina by one point in triple overtime,'' he told the crowd, 
referring to the NCAA title game his sophomore season in 1957. ``It 
was a devastating thing for me because I felt like I let the 
university down, I let KU down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd interrupted, yelling, ``No, no,'' before resuming  
another standing ovation. His huge hand brushed his cheek as he 
paused again, drowned out by more applause.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC had the three most popular shows last week  
but CBS, buoyed by its two new legal dramas, managed a narrow 
victory in the Nielsen Media Research ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	With summer's end, viewers are returning to ``ER'' in droves.  
NBC's Thursday night medical drama was the most-watched show by a 
wide margin, with nearly 7 million more viewers than second-place 
``Friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Frasier'' came in third place for the week, Nielsen said  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, CBS had a 9.1 rating and 15 share. NBC was second  
with a 9.0 rating and 15 share, ABC had an 8.1 rating and 13 share 
and Fox was at 6.1 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS and NBC seem headed for a particularly heated competition  
this year. They tied for the ratings crown last week and only 
one-tenth of a ratings point separates them for the season so far. 
NBC has a much wider lead among 18-to-49-year-old viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's new ``Judging Amy'' cracked the Nielsen top 10, the  
network's highest-rated entertainment show after ``Touched By an 
Angel.'' CBS's other new legal drama, ``Family Law,'' finished a 
solid 18th place. 
</P>
<P>
	Two shows with identical 4.9 ratings last week have far  
different outlooks. Fox's ``Harsh Realm,'' produced by Chris 
Carter, was a disappointing fourth in its time slot for its 
premiere. Meanwhile, the WB's ``Roswell'' was extremely promising 
in its debut, finishing as the network's most-watched show after 
``7th Heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WB had a 3.4 rating and 6 share for the week, UPN had a 2.7  
rating and 4 share and Pax TV had a 0.7 rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``NBC Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings race with  
a 7.2 rating and 15 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was second 
with a 7.0 rating and 15 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had 
a 6.3 rating and 13 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Oct. 4-10, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: 
</P>
<P>
	``ER,'' NBC, 19.5; ``Friends,'' NBC, 14.9; ``Frasier,'' NBC,  
14.7; ``NFL Monday Night Football: Buffalo at Miami,'' ABC, 14.0; 
``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 12.9; ``Law and Order,'' NBC 12.5; ``Jesse,'' 
NBC, 12.2; ``Stark Raving Mad,'' NBC, 12.2; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 11.5; ``Judging Amy,'' CBS, 11.4.

	Pakistani Prime Minister Dismissed  
</P>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif  
and his Cabinet have been dismissed, army-controlled television 
said today. Troops took control of airports and government 
buildings throughout the country. The ouster means that army chief 
Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, who had been fired hours before by Sharif, 
likely would be the country's new leader. He will address the 
nation in a broadcast speech. Pakistani troops took over state-run 
TV and radio stations when Sharif surprisingly fired Musharraf 
while the army chief was visiting Sri Lanka. In recent weeks there 
have been reports of a rift between the army and the civilian 
government.

	Wyo. Gay Slaying Defense: Drugs  
</P>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Attorneys for a man accused of beating a  
gay student to death do not dispute Aaron McKinney's role in the 
killing, but say drugs and alcohol spurred his actions. Attorney 
Dion Custis told prospective jurors that McKinney's use of those 
substances would be a core part of his defense in the trial of the 
murder of Matthew Shepard. Jury selection continued today in the 
case. McKinney, 22, could face the death penalty if convicted of 
Shepard's murder. His alleged co-conspirator, Russell Henderson, is 
already serving a life sentence after pleading guilty to felony 
murder and kidnapping in the beating of Shepard.

	Court To Decide Overtime Issue  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide  
whether public employees who agree to take extra time off instead 
of overtime pay can be forced to use the time off at the employer's 
convenience. The court voted to hear arguments by more than 120 
Harris County, Texas, sheriff's deputies that they -- not their 
government employer -- have the right to control when such time-off 
credits are used. The Fair Labor Standards Act generally requires 
public and private employees to be paid time-and-one-half if they 
work more than 40 hours a week. Since 1985, the law has let public 
employees agree to take compensatory time off instead of overtime 
pay.

	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- A U.S. scientist won the Nobel Prize  
for chemistry today for capturing ultrafast snapshots of atomic 
reactions. Two Dutch researchers won the physics prize for refining 
the theory predicting the existence and behavior of some of the 
smallest particles in the universe. Ahmed H. Zewail, 53, of the 
California Institute of Technology was honored for pioneering a 
revolution in chemistry by using the rapid-fire laser flashes that 
illuminate the motion of atoms in a molecule as they occur. Dutch 
scientists Gerardus 't Hooft and Martinus J.G. Veltman took the 
physics prize.

	German Pays Fine in Iran Sex Case  
</P>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- A German businessman who  
previously had been sentenced to death on charges of having illegal 
sex paid a fine today, closing his case and removing the biggest 
hurdle to his release from prison. It was not clear, however, when 
Helmut Hofer would be freed because he faces a string of other 
charges, including espionage and insulting a prison officer. Hofer 
was acquitted last month of charges of illegal sex, for which he 
was twice sentenced to death for having sex with a Muslim woman. 
Under Iranian law, sex outside marriage is punishable by flogging, 
but if the man is not a Muslim, he faces the death penalty.

nationwide youth smoking-prevention program in addition to the one 
included in the industry's $206 billion settlement with 46 states. 
The program urges parents to talk to their children about not 
smoking and includes national print and broadcast announcements,

lacked credibility with children.

<HEADLINE> LPGA Is Looking Good at 50  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The success of the LPGA Tour is too often judged by the wrong  
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind that Karrie Webb is soaring toward $1.5 million this  
year, or that a record 78 players have earned more than $100,000. 
The nagging question is why the LPGA purses pale in comparison to 
the men. 
</P>
<P>
	The LPGA sanctioned 38 events this year on four continents, but  
seems to make headlines only when it loses a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	So what that the 240 hours of television time is more than any  
other women's sport? Critics want to know why more tournaments are 
not broadcast by the networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe those critics should spend more time with Patty Berg.  
</P>
<P>
	A winner of 15 major championship and 57 tournaments, Berg  
measures success by the number that matters the most: The LPGA Tour 
is about to celebrate its 50th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fifty years! That's marvelous,'' the 81-year-old Berg said  
from her home in Fort Myers, Fla. ``It just goes to show what 
happens when you work together and have a vision that this was 
going to one of the best organizations -- and it is. 
</P>
<P>
	``Others may disagree,'' she said, alluding to tennis,  
basketball and now soccer. ``They have wonderful organizations, 
too. But I happen to be talking about mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the LPGA Tour belongs to Berg, Alice Bauer, Bettye  
Danoff, Marlene Hagge, Betty Jameson, Marilynn Smith, Shirley Spork 
and Louise Suggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 12 members who chartered the LPGA Tour in 1950, those  
eight living founders will gather in New York on Oct. 19 to help 
begin a year of celebration for the longest-running women's sports 
association. 
</P>
<P>
	These are the women who help LPGA Tour commissioner Ty Votaw  
appreciate how far women's golf has come, and make him optimistic 
about the next half-century. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure I would have had as much optimism that it would  
have lasted 50 years,'' Votaw said. ``At the time, society was not 
sending many signals that women could or should be professional 
athletes in a touring sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What would have tempered some of that pessimism were the  
people involved, and that indomitable spirit they had in bringing 
the issue to a head,'' he said. ``We have 50 years of history, and 
a foundation on which to build. The LPGA Tour has stood the test of 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't easy.  
</P>
<P>
	Consider the average week of a touring pro. Most arrive at a  
tournament no later than Tuesday, get in a practice round, play in 
a pro-am, give interviews to a half-dozen reporters and cash a 
check at the end of the week that could be worth as much as 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Jameson and her pals also used to show up at tournaments a  
couple of days early, albeit for a much different purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to set the pins,'' said Jameson, 80, who lives in  
Delray Beach, Fla. ``Someone else marked the course. We did all the 
running of the tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday night, they stayed late to compile the scores and send  
them off to Western Union. They were more than just performers. 
They were press agents, tournament organizers, rules officials. 
Berg recalled one tournament in which a player -- head of the rules 
committee that year -- had to stop playing in the middle of her 
round to make a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had to do this on their own,'' Votaw said. ``I would  
equate it to trying to dunk a basketball from the standing 
position. And they reached pretty high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inaugural LPGA season featured nine tournaments with a total  
purse of $50,000. The LPGA Tour had 43 tournaments on the schedule, 
including off-season events, worth more than $36 million in prize 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Television was only a baby in 1950, televised golf not even a  
consideration. Now, a week rarely goes by that Berg isn't glued to 
her set watching players from all over the world playing a tour 
that she helped start. 
</P>
<P>
	``The publicity is terrific,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to founders like Berg, Jameson, Suggs and Zaharias, women  
with a love for the game have a tour they can call their own. 
Thanks to Hall of Famers such as Mickey Wright, Betsy Rawls and 
Kathy Whitworth, they have a standard for excellence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come a long way,'' Jameson said. ``I'm glad I could be  
part of the history. I wouldn't exchange that for anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's time to put away the yardsticks and break out the party  
favors. It's time to stop the incessant, unfair comparisons to the 
PGA Tour and begin to measure the LPGA Tour on its own merits. 
</P>
<P>
	By that standard, the LPGA has been an enormous success.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Ga. Murderer's Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rejecting a Georgia killer's appeal Tuesday,  
the Supreme Court turned away efforts aimed at forcing states to 
provide free lawyers for some death row inmates after their first 
round of appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, let stand a ruling in which the  
Georgia Supreme Court, by a 4-3 vote, said prisoners have ``no 
state or federal constitutional right to an appointed lawyer'' 
after their first round of appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1989 Supreme Court decision in a Virginia case said the state  
did not have to provide free lawyers for death row inmates who lost 
their initial round of appeals. But the scope of that 5-4 ruling 
was limited by one member of the court's majority, Justice Anthony 
M. Kennedy, who noted that no one in Virginia had been denied a 
lawyer's help in such proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia death row inmate Exzavious Lee Gibson says he wanted a  
lawyer but was not given one when he stood before a state judge in 
his second round of appeals. Gibson was convicted in 1990 of 
murdering Douglas Coley during a robbery at an Eastman, Ga., 
grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's action came as Congress and the Supreme Court have  
been attempting to streamline the appeals process in capital 
punishment cases. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 federal law, the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death  
Penalty Act, greatly limited death row inmates' access to federal 
courts after they receive one round of ``direct'' state court 
appeals and a second round in state courts, which is known as 
``habeas corpus'' review. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing all direct appeals, Gibson received help in  
preparing a habeas appeal that said his trial lawyer failed to 
provide constitutionally adequate help. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it came time for a court hearing on that appeal, Gibson  
did not have a lawyer to help him. He is described by his new 
lawyers as borderline mentally retarded, with an I.Q. of 76 to 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson repeatedly told the judge he did not know how to proceed  
and did not have a lawyer. State prosecutors introduced evidence at 
the hearing; Gibson did not. Five months later, the state judge 
issued a decision rejecting the claims Gibson had raised. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outcome of this case, and those that are accumulating in  
its wake, is shocking,'' his appeal said. It was supported in 
friend-of-the-court briefs submitted by the American Bar 
Association, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the 
Southern Center for Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker urged the justices to  
reject Gibson's appeal. He said lawyers for the Georgia Appellate 
and Educational Resource Center, a group that tracks death penalty 
cases in the state, could have represented Baker. Resource Center 
lawyers prepared the habeas appeal for him, Baker noted.

<HEADLINE> India Encourages Telecom Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- India's new government will encourage foreign  
participation in the development of its telecommunications network, 
an official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Contracts for building domestic long-distance networks will be  
put up for bid on Jan. 1 and foreign companies are welcome to 
participate, said Anil Kumar, secretary of the Department of 
Telecommunications, speaking at the Telecom 99 industry fair. 
</P>
<P>
	More network operating partnerships are envisioned over the next  
five years on a revenue-sharing basis, Kumar said, adding that new 
wireline and wireless licenses will be offered once a review is 
completed by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. 
</P>
<P>
	India is looking to provide telephone service to the 250,000  
villages in the country that aren't connected to any telecom 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has been talking to satellite system operators as one  
means of bringing service to the 250,000 villages. But they may 
need government subsidies since operators wouldn't be able to 
charge consumers more than cellular services do. 
</P>
<P>
	Atal Bihari Vajpayee was named India's prime minister Monday and  
said his National Democratic Alliance will speed up economic 
reforms, an assurance that buoyed the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote count last week showed the alliance collecting support  
from more than 300 legislators, enough to form a stable government 
and perhaps complete a full five-year term.

<HEADLINE> Yankee Energy Approves One Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MERIDEN, Conn. (AP) -- Shareholders of Yankee Energy System Inc.  
accepted a $679 million, or $45 a share cash and stock, offer by 
Northeast Utilities, even though some anticipated that NU would 
soon become part of another power giant, Consolidated Edison Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 percent of Yankee shareholders voted Tuesday in favor  
of the merger that would make the Meriden-based natural gas 
distributor a subsidiary of the largest electric utility in New 
England. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal -- which returns to NU a company it was forced to spin  
off 10 years ago -- still needs the approval of federal regulators 
but is expected to be completed early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankee Chief Executive Officer Charles E. Gooley made the case  
for the merger with NU to shareholders Tuesday, saying Yankee could 
not compete with bigger companies in the coming deregulated market. 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of natural gas companies in surrounding states and  
across the country have a customer base several times ours and are 
benefiting from the economies of scale these customer counts 
offer,'' Gooley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankee serves about 185,000 customers in 68 Connecticut cities  
and towns. Northeast Utilities serves more than 2.3 million 
customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Wall Street was abuzz Tuesday with continuing rumors  
that Berlin, Conn.-based NU would be bought by New York's Con Ed or 
Britain's National Grid Group PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward J. Tirello Jr., an analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex.  
Brown, said the combination makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Con Ed has been looking to expand, and Connecticut is a very  
affluent market. There's a lot of synergies, and in the new world 
you've got to be big,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal, citing a source it did not identify,  
reported Tuesday that Con Ed is offering a combination of cash and 
stock for NU. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Con Ed nor NU has commented on the rumors, although Con  
Ed officials said last week the company was always on the lookout 
for a good investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeast Utilities stock, traded on the New York Stock  
Exchange, closed up 12 1/2 cents, at $21.25. Con Ed, also traded on 
the NYSE, was down 75 cents at $36.43 3/4. The merger rumors have led 
to unusually high trading volumes on both stocks.

<HEADLINE> Court Refuses N.Y. School Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to let state  
officials in New York resurrect a public school district for a 
community of Hasidic Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, by a 6-3 vote, turned away the state's argument that  
its third attempt to create a district for disabled children in the 
Kiryas Joel community does not breach the constitutionally required 
separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas  
voted to hear arguments in the case, but four votes are needed to 
grant such review. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiryas Joel is a community of ultra-Orthodox Jews in Orange  
County, about 45 miles northwest of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all residents are members of the Satmar Hasidic sect,  
which maintains an insular community where people wear special 
clothing, follow a strict schedule of prayer and religious study 
and usually speak Yiddish. 
</P>
<P>
	State lawmakers first created a Kiryas Joel school district in  
1989 after village residents withdrew their disabled children from 
other public schools, saying they were traumatized by having to 
attend class outside the village. 
</P>
<P>
	Children who are not disabled attend private religious schools  
in the village. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York State School Boards Association challenged the  
creation of the public school district, saying it 
unconstitutionally advanced the Satmar religion. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest court agreed in 1994, ruling that creation  
of the Kiryas Joel district ``fails the test of neutrality'' 
because it ``singles out a particular religious sect for special 
treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York legislators passed a new law that year, again allowing  
creation of a Kiryas Joel district, but it was thrown out by the 
state's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	A third law, enacted in 1997, sought to set neutral criteria  
under which a Kiryas Joel district could be established. 
</P>
<P>
	But New York's highest court invalidated that law last May.  
Under the law's criteria, only two municipalities -- Kiryas Joel and 
the town of Stony Point in neighboring Rockland County -- could 
create public school districts, the state court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York court suggested the dispute could be resolved by  
taking advantage of a 1997 Supreme Court ruling that allows public 
school teachers to offer remedial help at church-run schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, the state's lawyers said the 1997  
law sets ``religiously neutral criteria'' and ``in no way singles 
out Kiryas Joel for a forbidden religious preference over other 
similarly situated groups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A law cannot be unconstitutional ``simply because a community of  
religious believers benefits'' from it, the state's appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The school board group's attorneys said the law is not  
religion-neutral because it is so narrowly drawn that only two of 
more than 1,500 municipalities in New York could benefit from it. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, state lawmakers enacted a measure that would give  
Kiryas Joel a new chance to create its own school district if the 
Supreme Court failed to overturn the New York court's ruling. The 
measure would allow 29 small municipalities to establish new school 
districts with approval by the school superintendent and voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Pataki vs. Grumet, 98-1932.

	Raytheon Cuts Earnings Projections  
</P>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- Defense giant Raytheon Co. is slashing  
its earnings projections for 1999 and 2000, blaming 
lower-than-expected revenue. The contractor said today it also 
plans to take a $638 million pretax charge for restructuring and 
project problems. The Lexington company estimates its 1999 earnings 
per share will be between $1.40 and $1.50 per share, including the 
charges, or $2.70 to $2.80 per share excluding charges -- well below 
the Wall Street expectations of $3.56 per share. For the year 2000, 
the company estimates earnings per share will be in the range of 
$2.10 to $2.25, compared to estimates of $3.91 per share. Shares of 
Raytheon were halted before news of the earnings warning was 
released. They had not traded today on the New York Stock Exchange. 
On Monday, Class B shares fell 50 cents to $43.

	Weyerhaeuser Earnings Up 115 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) -- Forest products maker Weyerhaeuser Co.  
said its third-quarter earnings more than doubled thanks to strong 
U.S. demand and the economic recovery in Japan. The company also 
said it planned a reorganization aimed at cutting costs and that 
would affect an undetermined number of employees. Weyerhaeuser 
reported today net earnings of $237 million, or $1.18 per common 
share, compared to $110 million, or 56 cents per common share, for 
the same three-month period of 1998. The results easily surpassed 
analysts' expectations. Net sales for the quarter were $3.12 
billion, up nearly 15 percent from $2.74 billion last year. 
Weyerhaeuser stock was up 1 1/8 at 60 9/16 this afternoon.

<P>
	Phelps Dodge Earnings Fall 20 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Phelps Dodge Corp. reported its third-quarter  
earnings fell 20.7 percent as a result of the continuing slump in 
copper prices. The big copper and wire producer said it earned 
$16.1 million, or 28 cents per share, down from $20.3 million, or 
35 cents per share, reported for the same period last year. Phelps 
Dodge surpassed analyst expectations of 21 cents per share. The 
results do not reflect a restructuring charge of $700,000, or 1 
cent per share, for the latest quarter, and a 1998 gain of $8.3 
million, or 14 cents per share, from the completion of the sale of 
Accuride Corp. Phelps Dodge stock was up 2 5/16 at 57 1/2.

pilots and flight attendants how to exit aircraft in emergency 
situations. The two airlines are competing for passengers flying in 
and out of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Northwest controls about 80

The program, which urges parents to talk to their children about 
not smoking, includes national print and broadcast announcements,

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Church-State Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court turned its back on three  
church-state disputes Tuesday, a triple dose of bad news for those 
who favor more government help for religious schools and 
enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from settling anything, the rejected appeals are likely to  
fan the national debate over tuition vouchers and other financial 
help. One immediate result: Maine can continue subsidizing children 
who attend some private schools while denying such vouchers for 
those who go to religious schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices also refused to let Pennsylvania exempt religious  
publications from sales taxes and rejected New York's effort to 
revive a public school district in a community of Hasidic Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's actions set no legal precedent, but drew immediate  
reaction from partisans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly appears the justices are in no mood to use the  
current term to move the boundary markers on church-state 
separation,'' said the Rev. Barry Lynn of Americans United for 
Separation of Church and State. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn said the court's denial of review in the Maine case pleased  
him most. ``It's a victory of sorts because it establishes that the 
taxpayers of Maine do not have to fund religious schools,'' he 
said. ``Parents can create religious schools but cannot get 
everyone to pay for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Komer of the pro-voucher Institute for Justice voiced  
disappointment but added, ``We have no doubt (the court) will 
ultimately vindicate the rights of parents to secure high-quality 
educational opportunities for their children regardless of whether 
the school they select is religious or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the court's signals to date have been mixed. Just last  
week, the justices let Arizona give tax credits to people who 
donate money for scholarships at religious schools. The court 
previously had declined to strike down a voucher program that aids 
religious-school students in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices have one church-state dispute on the 1999-2000  
term's decision docket. They will decide, sometime by late June, 
whether computers and other instructional materials paid for with 
taxpayer money can be used by religious schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Maine case, the justices rejected without comment an  
appeal in which parents of religious-school students said the state 
violates their rights by refusing them the same financial help 
given to parents whose children attend private, nonreligious 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Maine's public school districts in sparsely populated  
areas do not operate schools for all grades but instead pay tuition 
to send some children to nearby public or private schools of their 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1981, the state has barred tuition vouchers for children  
attending religiously affiliated schools. Five families from 
Raymond who send their children to such schools challenged the 
state policy in state court, while three families from Minot went 
to federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maine Supreme Judicial Court and the 1st U.S. Circuit Court  
of Appeals both upheld the state policy. Those decisions were left 
intact Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Pennsylvania case, the court let stand rulings that  
barred the state from including ``religious publications and 
articles'' in materials exempted from sales taxes. Those rulings 
may leave others states with similar tax laws vulnerable to 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania law exempts a wide variety of items from the  
state's 6 percent sales tax, including newspaper and magazine 
subscriptions. One category was ``the sale ... or use of religious 
publications sold by religious groups and Bibles and religious 
articles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two state residents sued, saying the exemptions violated the  
constitutionally required separation of church and state. 
Pennsylvania courts agreed with them. 
</P>
<P>
	The court split 6-3 in rejecting New York's attempt to reinstate  
a public school district to serve disabled children who live in a 
Hasidic Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas  
voted to hear arguments in the case but four votes are needed to 
grant such review. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all residents of Kiryas Joel, a village in Orange  
County about 45 miles northwest of New York City, are members of 
the insular Satmar Hasidic sect. 
</P>
<P>
	State lawmakers first created a Kiryas Joel district in 1989  
after village residents withdrew their disabled children from other 
public school districts, saying they were traumatized by having to 
attend classes outside their community. Children who are not 
disabled attend private religious schools in the village. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruled in 1994 that the state had unlawfully  
singled out a particular religious sect for special treatment. Two 
more recent efforts by New York legislators to create a school 
district within the village also were struck down, but in August a 
fourth law was enacted.

<HEADLINE> More Black Farmers Try Joining Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 15,000 black farmers have filed claims  
in the settlement of a racial discrimination lawsuit against the 
Agriculture Department, and lawyers are seeking time for additional 
producers to join the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday was the deadline for claims, but a judge has been asked  
to extend it to Oct. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers in North Carolina and South Carolina who were victims of  
Hurricane Floyd haven't had time to file yet, and large numbers of 
last-minute filings in Alabama and Mississippi have delayed claims 
as well, said Alexander Pires, the lead attorney in the case. Eight 
members of the Congressional Black Caucus joined in requesting the 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman doesn't think a court-ordered  
extension is necessary, USDA spokesman Andy Solomon said, because 
the settlement already allows the judge to accept late claims by 
farmers who couldn't file in time due to uncontrollable 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	That is ``adequate leeway to allow any farmer who is impacted by  
something like Hurricane Floyd to participate,'' Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman, who approved the  
settlement in April, said he would wait to hear from Glickman 
before ruling on the extension request. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, farmers with less documented evidence of  
discrimination can take a $50,000 payment, as well as $12,500 to 
cover taxes, and have their government debts forgiven. Farmers with 
more evidence could opt to go before an independent arbitrator and 
seek larger damages. Farmers could also choose to opt out of the 
lawsuit and pursue their own cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Pires said he expected the number of claims to reach 18,000.  
</P>
<P>
	``Surely we should have an enlargement of time (to file claims)  
since USDA had discriminated against black farmers for decades,'' 
said John Boyd Jr., president of the National Black Farmers 
Association.

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear Grazing Rights Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ranching and farming groups today won a  
Supreme Court hearing for their challenge to the Clinton 
administration's regulation of livestock grazing on millions of 
acres of federal land throughout the West. 
</P>
<P>
	The court voted to study an appeal that says the  
administration's 1995 rules violate a 65-year-old law and threaten 
the livelihood of tens of thousands of ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguments in the case will be held this winter, and a decision  
is expected by late June. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 20,000 livestock producers have permits to graze their  
cattle and sheep on 170 million acres of federal rangeland in 13 
states, including large parts of Nevada, Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1934, such grazing has been regulated by the Department of  
Interior. Those with permits got preference for renewal when the 
permit expired, and permit-holders could own the fences they built 
on public land. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the Interior Department announced revised rules  
intended to improve management and protection of federally owned 
land. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other changes, the new rules amended the permit process to  
conform with land-use plans, dropped the requirement that permit 
applicants be in the livestock business, and gave the government 
title to new fences or other permanent improvements built by 
permit-holders. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Public Lands Council, the National Cattlemen's Beef  
Association and other groups went to court, a federal judge in 
Wyoming threw out those three provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated them, ruling  
that land-use plans have been considered in the permit process 
since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal acted on today said the new rules threw longstanding  
grazing privileges into uncertainty, and as a result banks will no 
longer consider government permits as security for loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once established, the grazing privilege is to be regarded as  
an indefinitely continuing right,'' the appeal said, adding that 
the Interior Department exceeded its authority under the 1934 law. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers said the rules were a ``change in  
terminology'' that should provide greater stability for livestock 
owners, not less. Longstanding grazing permits established 
``grazing privileges, not rights to graze,'' the government lawyers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Public Lands Council vs. Babbitt, 98-1991.

<HEADLINE> Plath's Journals To Be Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One of literature's great underground documents  
is coming to bookstores: the complete journals of Sylvia Plath. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, readers have obsessed like conspiracy theorists  
about Plath, the poet and novelist who killed herself in 1963. 
Biographers continue to analyze everything from her work to her 
famously difficult marriage to fellow poet Ted Hughes. Their 
relationship has lived on in Plath's posthumously issued poems and 
letters and in Hughes' ``Birthday Poems,'' published just months 
before he died in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact nature of their relationship and why she committed  
suicide is still debated: The journals may offer clues. An edition 
published in the 1980s is believed to contain only one-third of the 
collection. The new book will almost certainly add hundreds of 
previously unpublished pages. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision has been made to publish them in their entirety,  
unedited, so the world can judge for themselves,'' said Joanna 
Mackle, publishing director for London-based Faber and Faber, which 
in April will issue the book in Britain. A U.S. publisher is 
expected to be announced shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of her death, Plath had just one book published  
under her name. But a decade later, she was a feminist martyr, the 
mourned and beloved author of the ``Ariel'' poems and the novel 
``The Bell Jar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Hughes was cast as the cold, oppressive villain, the  
man who stifled Plath in life and censored her in death. Plath fans 
harassed Hughes at readings and hacked his name off Plath's 
tombstone, which had been inscribed: ``Sylvia Plath Hughes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While friends of Hughes defended him as a caring husband driven  
away by his unstable wife, the poet himself said little in public 
for decades. But privately, he agonized -- and wrote. In early 1998, 
he published the acclaimed ``Birthday Letters,'' a passionate, 
mournful and often bitter collection about Plath. 
</P>
<P>
	``A reassessment of Ted Hughes' life and work is already under  
way,'' said Steve Enniss, curator of literary collections at Emory 
University, where Hughes' papers are stored. ``And the Plath 
journals will add to that. Any kind of attention given to one 
inevitably brings attention to the other. They are intertwined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few have seen all the journals, which have been stored for years  
at Plath's alma mater, Smith College, but the Faber and Faber 
catalogue promises an ``intimate portrait'' of ``vigorous 
immediacy.'' The manuscript handed in by the editors at Smith runs 
at least 1,000 pages, more than double the original publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Mackle, who handles questions on behalf of the Plath estate,  
would not give a specific reason for the decision but she did 
confirm that it was made before the death of Hughes, who was 
appointed Britain's poet laureate in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The estate is now run by their children, Frieda and Nicholas.  
</P>
<P>
	What ended up as one of the great cottage industries both in  
publishing and academia began as a romance. Hughes and Plath were 
in their 20s when they met at Cambridge University in England, in 
the winter of 1956. She was an American student and writer living 
abroad, he a young British poet trying to establish a literary 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	They were married within months, but by the end of 1962, they  
were living apart. Hughes was seeing another woman and an 
increasingly unhappy Plath had moved with the children from their 
country house to a London flat. Plath, who had a history of mental 
problems, killed herself in February 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the upcoming journals are not technically ``complete''; at  
least one notebook is apparently gone forever. In an announcement 
that enraged many, Hughes confessed in the first edition's 
introduction that he had destroyed pages which covered the months 
immediately preceding her suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think by suppressing or trying to suppress for the  
children's sake all accounts , etc., of Sylvia's more difficult 
side, I have done everybody an ill-service. Myself especially, 
perhaps,'' he later wrote to a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	In the original introduction, Hughes also claimed another  
notebook ``disappeared,'' but he later wrote that it ``may, 
presumably, still turn up.'' Those entries are not believed to be 
included in the new edition, which will cover the years 1950-1962.

<HEADLINE> Strange Still Not Offered Captain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- While Curtis Strange says he would be honored to  
be Ryder Cup captain for the 2001 matches in England, a spokesman 
for the two-time U.S. Open champion said Tuesday he has not been 
offered the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fact, he has not spoken to anyone from the PGA of America  
since the conclusion of the last Ryder Cup at Brookline,'' said Bev 
Norwood of IMG. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Chronicle cited several unidentified sources in a  
story Tuesday that said the 44-year-old Strange had agreed to be 
the captain for the matches to be held at the Belfry. 
</P>
<P>
	PGA spokesman Julius Mason said a replacement for Ben Crenshaw  
has not been named and an announcement was not immediately planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to have a captain for the 34th Ryder Cup matches  
by the end of the year,'' Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strange has been regarded as the frontrunner since the Ryder Cup  
ended at The Country Club, where the Americans staged the greatest 
comeback in the cup's 72-year history, winning for the first time 
since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Strange is still involved with the current PGA players and is  
not hurt by his work as an analyst for ABC Sports. He also has some 
player support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Curtis would do a great job,'' Justin Leonard said.  
``I don't know who the PGA of America is thinking about, but he 
would certainly be on my short list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the Buick Challenge, Strange said only that ``everybody  
would treat it as a tremendous honor to go to the Belfry and be a 
captain. But haven't talked to anybody, so I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper cited sources as saying Strange is the only player  
on the PGA's list. 
</P>
<P>
	It also quoted a player who requested anonymity as saying,  
``Curtis is absolutely pumped about it. And the players will have a 
different sort of respect for him once they see those fiery eyes.''

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Moss Has NBA Aspirations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Vikings general manager Tim  
Connolly says he would be the first in line to watch Randy Moss try 
his hand at the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard he's a better basketball player than a football  
player,'' Connolly said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings don't have a position on Moss' NBA aspirations,  
``but he's a tremendous athlete and we'd all be curious and 
interested to see him play pro basketball,'' Connolly said in his 
first comments on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, Minnesota Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders said  
one of Moss' representatives had contacted him to float the idea of 
Moss playing alongside fellow superstar Kevin Garnett at some 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss refused to discuss the issue this week, and his agent,  
Dante DiTrapano, didn't return phone calls from The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	But in August, the Vikings' star receiver said he would love to  
try playing professional basketball. He was twice named West 
Virginia's Mr. Basketball when he was in high school, when his 
teammate was Sacramento Kings guard Jason Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders said the arrangements of a two-sport career could be  
complicated but not impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd probably have to see him play in the summer time,''  
Saunders said. ``I'd never say never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Vikings coach Dennis Green has said that Moss' electrifying  
athletic skills would suit him in the NBA, where he'd miss about 
half the season providing the Vikings go deep into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Connolly said he's not sure if Moss is serious about playing in  
the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never spoken to Randy about it, I've not spoken to his  
agent about it and I've not spoken to the Timberwolves about it,'' 
Connolly said. ``But I think Randy Moss is one of those rare people 
who could play two sports. With the Minnesota Vikings, he's got a 
home as long as he wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moss sprained his ankle playing hoops two days before the team's  
May minicamp after he was drafted last year. He sat out the camp 
with a cast and, according to Green, the injury hampered Moss's 
play his entire rookie season, which was nonetheless spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Moss signed a four-year, $4.4 million contract that's  
widely expected to be torn up after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Connolly said that despite the increased chance of injury, any  
new deal for Moss, the 1998 Offensive Rookie of the Year, wouldn't 
include language discouraging Moss from pursuing a pro basketball 
career on the side. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a standard NFL contract, 20 games and hopefully  
playoffs,'' Connolly said. ``What he does in his spare time is his 
business. Some guys like to hunt, some guys like to fish, some guys 
like to golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he want to play basketball, then more power to him. I'd  
love to see it.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Prices Fall / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell modestly Tuesday amid nagging  
concerns about inflation and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/2 point,  
or $5.00 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, rose to 6.22 percent from 6.19 percent late 
Friday. The bond market was closed Monday in observance of the 
Columbus Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities were unchanged to down  
1/32 point while intermediate maturities fell 1/16 point to 3/16 
point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond investors, worried about interest rates, sold ahead of this  
week's government reports on wholesale prices and industrial 
production, analysts said. The reports are expected to offer the 
latest signs of whether inflation is escalating in the U.S. economy 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve policy-making committee held interest rates  
steady last week, but the Fed left open the possibility of another 
rate increase, which would be the third this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said inflation remains the market's overriding concern.  
A rise in commodity prices, mostly a jump in crude oil futures, 
added to the market's anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.91 percent as the  
discount rose 0.11 percentage point from Friday to 4.78 percent. 
Six-month yields were 5.12 percent, as the discount rose 0.03 
percentage point to 4.92 percent. One-year yields were 5.32 percent 
as the discount rose 0.03 percentage point to 5.06 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate held steady at 5.31 percent, the same as  
late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 110 5/8 from 111 7/32 late Friday. The 
average yield to maturity rose to 5.99 percent from 5.95 percent on 
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Governor Rejects E-Mail Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Privacy advocates say California has lost  
the chance to clarify whether companies have a right to monitor 
employees' e-mail and punish them for transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
	As hundreds of companies implement monitoring policies, a bill  
vetoed Sunday by Gov. Gray Davis would have required those doing 
business in the state to notify employees in writing of such 
action. Davis said the law would infringe on employers' rights and 
leave them open to unjust lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy  
Information Center, a non-profit research group, called Davis' veto 
``befuddling.'' Some states are considering banning e-mail 
monitoring altogether as a cottage industry evolves to make it 
easier for companies to snoop, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a Democrat, likened e-mail monitoring to other employer  
rights, such as the right to limit personal long-distance phone 
calls. He also noted that businesses can be sued if employees use 
work computers to defame or harass someone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It therefore follows that any employer has a legitimate need  
to monitor, either on a spot basis or at regular intervals, such 
company property, including e-mail traffic and computer files 
stored on either employer-owned hard drives, diskettes or 
CD-ROMs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of Fortune 1000 companies and six federal  
agencies now use monitoring software to watch over their office 
computers, according to the American Management Association. By 
2001, 80 percent of large companies are expected to be using such 
software, according to International Data Corp., a research firm in 
Framingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers say they want only to improve productivity, ferret out  
computer products that could malfunction in 2000 and avoid legal 
problems, such as leaking company secrets or someone sending racist 
or harassing computer messages. 
</P>
<P>
	But state Democratic Sen. Debra Bowen, who sponsored the  
notification bill, said employees should at least be fully informed 
when a company plans to keep tabs on them electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	``I disagree with the governor's starting point, that equipment  
in a business is always company property,'' Bowen said Monday. 
``Because an employer provides you a restroom, that doesn't give 
him a license to videotape everything you do in there.''

	Dutch Scientists Win Physics Nobel  
</P>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Two Dutch scientists, Gerardus 't Hooft  
and Martinus J.G. Veltman, won the 1999 Nobel Prize for physics 
today for their work on the quantum structure of electroweak 
interactions in physics. ``Their work has given researchers a 
well-functioning theoretical machinery which can be used for, among 
other things, predicting the properties of new particles,'' the 
Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. Their equations were vital 
in calculating the mass of the top quark, which was observed for 
the first time in 1995 at the Fermilab in the United States.

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces pounded Chechen positions  
with an artillery barrage on several fronts today, and Russian 
authorities said they suspect Chechen militants will soon try to 
launch terrorist attacks. Both the Russians and the Chechens have 
been fortifying fixed positions in recent days, but neither side 
has launched any major offensives. The Russians have been relying 
mostly on their big artillery guns. They were hammering two areas

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Despite continuing economic

military with missiles and biochemical weapons, a South Korean 
defense report said today. But South Korea's 690,000-member armed 
forces, backed by 37,000 U.S. troops stationed here, can cope with 
any military threat from the hard-line communist North, the report 
said. As in past years, North Korea is believed to be spending more 
than 30 percent of its budget this year on its military, already 
the world's fifth largest, the paper said.

after several young men accused him of seducing them, is dead at 
72. The Roman Catholic priest had suffered from Hodgkin's disease, 
cancer of the lymph nodes. Ritter had denied the accusations of 
sexual misconduct and was never formally charged. He resigned from 
Covenant House in 1990; in August 1991, Ritter left the Franciscan

	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- About 1 million people in the Western  
Pacific are now infected with HIV and the rate of infection is 
rising rapidly in many countries in the region, the World Health 
Organization said today. Last year, WHO officials estimated there 
were about 700,000 HIV infections in the region and 40,000 actual 
cases of AIDS. If left unchecked, they said, the number of HIV 
infections in the region will exceed 1.5 million in 2000.

	BOMBAY, India (AP) -- A nuclear power plant in northern India was  
shut down when an airlock door leading into the reactor came off 
its hinges, engineers said today. Nuclear officials told The 
Associated Press there was no danger of any radioactive leakage and 
repairs would be completed by the end of the month. The incident 
occurred Sept. 30 at the 220-megawatt nuclear power plant at Narora 
110 miles east of the Indian capital New Delhi. The Indian Express 
newspaper, which reported the shut down today, quoted R. 
Chidambaram, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, saying there

$9.2 billion in damage, equal to 3.3 percent of the island's gross 
domestic product, the government said. The damage to buildings and 
homes was the costliest, totaling $6.6 billion, according to the 
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. The 
remaining losses were reported by industry, agriculture and 
transportation, the agency said yesterday in a report. The total 
damage estimate from the 7.6-magnitude quake on Sept. 21 was much 
lower than the $100 billion in damage in Japan after a 
7.2-magnitude quake struck the southern city of Kobe in 1995, the 
report said.

	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's army surrounded  
Islamabad's airport and state-run radio and television today, 
witnesses said, following the dismissal of the powerful army chief 
of staff. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's firing of Gen. Pervaiz 
Musharraf took the military by surprise. There was no immediate 
reason for the army chief's dismissal, but in recent weeks there 
have been reports of a rift between the army and the civilian 
government. Musharraf's term was to end in April 2000. The rift

Lee, known for his work in the O.J. Simpson case, says he can't 
predict if there will be indictments in the 3-year-old case because 
it ``has inherent issues and problems.'' JonBenet's body was found

<HEADLINE> Thomas Makes First Stop of CBA Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WAYNE, Ind. (AP) -- Isiah Thomas isn't going to change the  
54-year-old Continental Basketball Association much in his first 
year as the league's owner. But he is going to dress it up a 
little. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, speaking in Fort Wayne on Tuesday on his first of nine  
stops in a league tour, said he plans to transform the NBA's 
official development league from one that's just been surviving 
year-to-year to one that has a long-term plan for success. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't plan to change too much of anything on a league-wide  
standpoint,'' Thomas said. ``We want to enhance the game. We want 
to enhance the flavor of the fan experience and what he or she 
feels when they come into the building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Detroit Pistons and Indiana University star  
officially became majority owner of the nine-team league last week 
after league owners approved the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who also is negotiating to buy the nine-team  
International Basketball Association, plans to reorganize the CBA 
from an association with 40 owners into a single entity league. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also talked about instituting a dress code and about  
eliminating the double-team defense to speed up games. 
</P>
<P>

national championship team, said he expects the new owner to bring 
in a sense of professionalism and class, something he said both of 
them learned at IU. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things he's going to bring and what he's brought  
every place he's gone is a championship attitude, and trying to 
make the league or teams or what have you look more corporate,'' 
Smart said. ``He just wants to bring that to a new level.''

	Thomas also said making Indiana the first stop of his tour was a  
natural starting point after his career at IU.

	``I grew up here,'' he said. ``I came here as a young kid and  
had I not gone to Indiana, there was no way I would've had the type 
of success that I've enjoyed and there's no way I would have become 
the type of person that I've become. Thank God I didn't go to 
Purdue.''

	Puccini's ``La Boheme,'' opera in 4 acts (Decca) -- starring  
Angela Gheorghiu, Roberto Alagna, Elisabetta Scano, Simon 
Keenlyside, Roberto de Candia and Ildebrando D'Arcangelo. Chorus 
and orchestra of La Scala, conducted by Riccardo Chailly. A 2-CD 
set. 

</P>
<P>
	The opportunity for another album featuring opera's Most Famous  
Married Couple provides an answer to the obvious question: Why 
another recording of ``La Boheme''? 
</P>
<P>
	And fans of the Romanian soprano and French-Sicilian tenor won't  
be disappointed, as both are captured here in fine voice. Alagna 
sounds fresh and strong, investing the familiar ``Che gelida 
manina'' with youthful fervor and tenderness. Perhaps he overdoes 
the sobbing a bit at Mimi's death, but that's a common failing. 
Gheorghiu, always the superior of the two vocally, is radiant, 
especially in her upper register. Her soprano is incisive without 
ever turning harsh, and she maintains a remarkably even sound 
throughout her range. 
</P>
<P>
	Decca has supplied a generally strong supporting cast,  
especially the estimable English baritone Simon Keenlyside, who 
makes a particularly warm and sympathetic Marcello. The one weak 
link is the young Italian soprano Elisabetta Scano, a shrill and 
quavery Musetta. 
</P>
<P>
	Riccardo Chailly conducts a first-rate performance by orchestra  
and chorus, which must know this music in their sleep. The program 
notes proclaim this the ``first studio recording of the new 
critical edition,'' but only scholars are likely to hear a 
difference -- a few notes for a flute in Act 1, a new phrase for the 
chorus in Act 2.

	``Renee Fleming Sings Strauss Heroines'' (Decca) -- with Barbara  
Bonney and Susan Graham. Christoph Eschenbach conducts the Vienna 
Philharmonic. 

</P>
<P>
	Renee Fleming seems to be at that magical point in her career  
where she can tackle just about any role and sing it definitively. 
Her vocalism on this collection of scenes from Richard Strauss 
operas is, in a word, ravishing. And the maturity she brings to the 
characterizations and the delicate shading she imparts to the 
German words put her interpretations on a par with such 
standard-setters of the postwar years as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and 
Lisa Della Casa. 
</P>
<P>
	The selections here are few but extended. From ``Der  
Rosenkavalier'' we get the Marschallin's Act 1 monologue, in which 
she ruminates about her inevitable loss of youth, and the ending of 
Act 3, from the sublime trio through the ecstatic duet for Octavian 
and Sophie. From ``Arabella,'' there's the Act 1 duet for the 
heroine and her sister, Zdenka; from ``Capriccio,'' the Countess' 
long final monologue. 
</P>
<P>
	It's hard to imagine better vocal support than that provided by  
soprano Barbara Bonney and mezzo Susan Graham. The sound of their 
voices blending together in the Rosenkavalier trio is enough to 
melt the hardest heart, despite the eccentrically slow tempo chosen 
by conductor Christoph Eschenbach. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Arabella duet, my own favorite on the album, Bonney is a  
wonderful partner, tracing her high-lying vocal part with warmth 
and silver purity. The ``Capriccio'' selection shows Fleming more 
than ready to take up the mantle of this autumnal role from Dame 
Kiri te Kanawa, who has made it a specialty in recent years.

	``Jaze'' (Universal) -- Jaze  

</P>
<P>
	Truth be told, there's nothing particularly jazzy about Jaze, a  
new all-male soul quartet out of Orlando, Fla. Unlike some other 
male groups, their lyrics aren't dripping with sexual references 
and their voices aren't overshadowed by overused musical hooks. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's probably what makes their self-entitled debut so  
refreshing. It's just pure music, pure harmonizing, and that makes 
for a pure enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
	In the vein of Boyz II Men, Jaze's emphasis is on mid-tempo  
grooves or slow love ballads, like ``Have You Ever,'' or the 
dreamy, wistful ``Fly Away.'' The group co-wrote seven tracks on 
the disc. But the real draw here listening to the blending voices 
of the group -- Larry Ballard, John Gibson, Chauncy Jackson and Jose 
Perez. In fact, their best vocal performance is done a capella -- 
their beautiful, serene version of ``The Lord's Prayer.

	``What Does It Take'' (N-Coded Music) -- Candy Dulfer  

</P>
<P>
	Saxophonist Candy Dulfer has toured with artists like Madonna,  
Pink Floyd and the Artist formerly known as Prince. So it's 
probably no surprise that she dabbles in just about every style of 
music on her latest release, ``What Does It Take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that that's a bad thing. What could have been a disastrous  
case of trying to appeal to all genres actually comes across as a 
great musical melting pot that keeps your attention on each track. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grammy-nominated Dulfer sounds very Prince-like on ``2025,''  
a funky jam that features her performing both alto sax and vocals. 
Then, on the remake of ``What Does It Take to Win Your Love,'' 
Dulfer takes a back seat and allows the Jonathan Butler, the South 
African guitarist/vocalist, to take center stage, singing on the 
more mellow tune. 
</P>
<P>
	She even infuses a little Caribbean sound on ``Island Lady,''  
that features her saxophonist father, Hans Dulfer. But her use of 
different sounds doesn't sound forced or contrived. It's just 
entertaining.

	``Jellycream'' (RCA Records) -- Bramhall  

</P>
<P>
	Doyle Bramhall II keeps the blues in his back pocket for his  
second solo effort, ``Jellycream.'' It's a guitar-driven recording 
that showcases the six-string talents of ``Bramhall,'' his new, 
two-syllable, one-word moniker. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a tough edge to the music with purposeful solos and  
crisp production. There's also some honest songwriting, done by 
Bramhall in collaboration with Chris Bruce, who also sings backup 
and plays bass and guitar on some of the tracks. Son of Texas 
bluesman Doyle Bramhall, the younger is best known for his work 
with the Fabulous Thunderbirds, his own former band, Arc Angels, 
and, most recently, as lead guitarist on tour with Pink Floyd 
founder Roger Waters. Such diverse influences came together to help 
Bramhall make a strong sophomore showing.

	``What Is Hip?'' (Warner Archives/Rhino Records) -- Tower of  
Power 

</P>
<P>
	To answer what is hip, listen to ``Soul With a Capital 'S''' on  
the new Tower of Power anthology. It captures everything about one 
of the country's best known multiracial soul bands. It sets up with 
a funky guitar riff backed by the powerful TOP horn section and it 
lays out in words the band's love for the music that won't let you 
sit still. Founders Emillio Castillo and Stephen ``Doc'' Kupka 
teamed up in 1968 in Oakland, Calif. and have been laying down a 
steady groove for more than 30 years since. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Is Hip?'' delivers 35 cuts from the band's history.  
Amazingly, the band's style has hung together through lineup 
changes and the pressures generated by the public's constantly 
changing tastes. Certainly, TOP wouldn't sell today like it did in 
the funk-driven era of disco in the 1970s. Still, the music has 
strong appeal across time. Great party music never dies.

<HEADLINE> Lofton Dislocates Left Shoulder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Sports Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland center fielder Kenny Lofton  
dislocated his left shoulder during Monday night's fifth and 
deciding game of the AL division series won by the Boston Red Sox 
12-8. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton was admitted to Lutheran Hospital after being hurt in the  
fourth inning. The Indians said Lofton's shoulder had been popped 
back into the socket. He was expected to spend the night at the 
hospital and undergo X-rays to determine if there was additional 
damage to his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton had been 2-for-15 in the series before hitting a ground  
ball to first baseman Mike Stanley and sliding head first in an 
attempt to beat the throw to pitcher Pedro Martinez, covering at 
first. After Lofton was called out, he lay face down on the ground 
for several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton, who had two stints on the disabled list this season with  
hamstring injuries, got slowly to his feet and was helped off the 
field by Indians assistant trainer Jim Warfield, who had his hand 
under Lofton's left elbow for support. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton was replaced in center field in the top of the fifth by  
Dave Roberts with the score 8-8. Roberts struck out and lined out 
in his two at bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez entered the game to start the fourth, his first  
appearance since straining a muscle beneath his right shoulder 
blade during last Wednesday night's series opener at Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
	He pitched six hitless innings, striking out eight and walking  
three in earning the victory.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Helps Hurricane Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURGAW, N.C. (AP) -- His Airness popped in at a disaster recovery  
center for Hurricane Floyd flood victims Tuesday, dispensing cases 
of underwear and hugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan, who grew up in nearby Wilmington, walked into  
the Salvation Army disaster recovery center about 12:30 p.m. and 
spent 15 minutes listening to the victims' stories, said Salvation 
Army spokeswoman Amy Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a big morale booster for flood victims in the Burgaw  
area,'' Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The region was badly flooded when Floyd drenched eastern North  
Carolina with up to 20 inches of rain Sept. 16. The storm was 
blamed for at least 49 deaths and is expected to surpass the 
state's worst-ever natural disaster, Hurricane Fran, which caused 
$6 billion in damage in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter said several of Jordan's cousins have received  
assistance from the Burgaw center and his aunt volunteered there. 
The center serves Pender and Duplin counties. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Jordan's donation of Hanes underwear -- one of the many  
products he endorses -- was most welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually that was something we really needed, so that was a  
big help,'' Carpenter said.

<HEADLINE> Justice Probing Baltimore Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Justice Department said Tuesday it will  
investigate the fatal shooting of a black man by two white city 
police officers to determine if civil rights laws were violated. 
</P>
<P>
	NAACP President Kweisi Mfume sought the investigation, saying  
the civil rights organization was concerned about the discrepancy 
between the police version of Larry Hubbard's shooting and 
eyewitness accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good police officers and good law-abiding citizens can only  
benefit from a complete and thorough finding of the facts in this 
case. Absent that, we are left with the possibility of charges, 
counter charges and anarchy,'' Mfume said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Hubbard, 21, was shot in the head while struggling  
with officers after being pulled over for driving a stolen car. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI will investigate the case and present the findings to  
the Justice Department's attorneys, who will decide whether to take 
legal action.

<HEADLINE> Justices Urged To Uphold Penalties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Polluters sued by private citizens under  
federal environmental laws should not be able to avoid paying 
damages by stopping their misconduct while the case is under way, a 
lawyer for environmental groups told the Supreme Court on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But a South Carolina hazardous waste plant owner told the  
justices the company should not have to pay a penalty for ``long 
past violations'' of wastewater discharge limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is a test of the federal Clean Water Act's provision  
letting private citizens file lawsuits to help enforce the law. 
Under the law, citizens can seek court orders requiring an end to 
misconduct, plus financial penalties to be paid to the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court threw out a $405,800 penalty against  
Laidlaw Environmental Services. The court said once a judge 
determined that violations of discharge limits had ceased and a 
court-ordered ban on future violations was not needed, the case was 
moot and a financial penalty was no longer warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce J. Terris, the lawyer for three environmental groups who  
sued, called that ruling a ``perverse result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey P. Minear, supporting the  
environmental groups, said the ruling would encourage 
``gamesmanship'' and give polluters an ``incentive to string the 
litigation along'' until a case could be declared moot. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant owner's lawyer, Donald A. Cockrill, said the lower  
court correctly ruled that the environmental groups could not 
continue seeking a financial penalty because they would not benefit 
from a fine paid to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices asked questions on numerous aspects of the  
citizen-lawsuit provisions, including whether a penalty paid to the 
government would help private citizens by deterring future 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``What difference does it make if the penalty goes to the  
government as opposed to private parties as far as a deterrent?'' 
asked Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice David H. Souter suggested Cockrill's argument ``turns  
this into kind of a sport'' by requiring private citizens to 
continue seeking a ban on future misconduct in an effort to keep 
alive their request for financial penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Justice Antonin Scalia questioned the whole idea of  
letting private citizens seek financial penalties to be paid to the 
government. ``Just because Congress has said it does not mean the 
courts can do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Laidlaw was sued in 1992 over wastewater discharges from its  
hazardous waste incinerator in Roebuck, S.C. The lawsuit by Friends 
of the Earth, Citizens Local Environmental Action Network and the 
Sierra Club said the plant violated limits on mercury discharges. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time a federal judge ruled on the lawsuit in 1997,  
Laidlaw was found to have come into compliance with the discharge 
limits. Therefore, the judge did not issue an order banning future 
violations, but instead imposed a $405,800 civil penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the penalty last  
year and declared the case moot. The appeals court said that once 
the judge decided not to ban future violations, the only remaining 
remedy -- a civil penalty -- would not benefit the environmental 
groups because it would be paid to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Friends of the Earth vs. Laidlaw Environmental  
Services, 98-822.

<HEADLINE> AP's Report on Chamberlain's 100 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDITORS: The following is The Associated Press story filed March  
2, 1962, the night Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points in a game	
against the New York Knicks.	
</P>
<P>
	HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- Wilt Chamberlain set a National Basketball  
Association scoring record of 100 points tonight as the 
Philadelphia Warriors defeated the New York Knickerbockers, 
169-147. The combined score was an association record, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain toppled many records with his awesome display. The  
7-foot-1-inch Warrior center set a league record for field goals 
(36), free throws (28 of 32), most points for a quarter (31), and 
most points for a half (59). 
</P>
<P>
	The 316 points by the two teams surpassed the record of 312 made  
in Boston's victory over Minneapolis on Feb. 27, 1959, at Boston. 
The Celtics set a single-team record in that game, when they beat 
the Lakers, 173-139. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 4,124 shrieked, ``Give it to Wilt, give it to  
Wilt,'' as the Philadelphian scored again and again on his fallaway 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warriors realized early that Chamberlain was hot. So they  
fed him the ball repeatedly. The Knicks tried to stall and then 
tried to mob Chamberlain with defense in an effort to slow his 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final period, Darrall Imhoff, who had been assigned to  
guard Chamberlain most of the night, fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
	When Wilt hit 100, a few seconds before the end, the fans  
swarmed onto the court. The game was held up until they were 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warriors seemed determined to run away with the game,  
scrambling to a 19-3 advantage. However, with Richie Guerin 
hitting, the Knicks drew closer, and it was 79-68 at the half. But 
Guerin, with 39 points, Cleveland Buckner (33), and Willie Naulls 
(31) couldn't overcome the lift given the Warriors by Wilt 
Chamberlain, who had 25 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain's effort broke the league scoring record of 78  
points, a mark he had set earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The recognized collegiate scoring record also is 100 set by  
Frank Selvy for Furman against Newberry in 1954. Selvy now plays 
for the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two over-100 efforts by Paul Arizin of Villanova and Bevo  
Francis of Rio Grande (Ohio) College are not recognized by the 
National Collegiate Athletic Association because they were made 
against junior-college teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the records set tonight was one by the Knickerbockers.  
Their 147 points was the most ever scored by a losing team, topping 
the previous mark of 139 by Minneapolis against Boston in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilt said, ``I wasn't even thinking of hitting 100 but after  
putting in nine straight free throws I was thinking about a 
foul-shooting record. It was my greatest game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He credited his teammates with helping him set the record.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been impossible to score this many if they  
hadn't kept feeding me,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> HS Football Coach Also a Preacher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LADONIA, Texas (AP) -- With a coach who's a preacher, mothers who  
moonlight as groundskeepers and a girl who scores touchdowns, 
Ladonia Fannindel High School has the most unusual football team in 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when most of the players were born, and I even  
remember their mothers when they were little,'' said Cecil Jones, a 
Baptist minister who doubles as an assistant coach at the 
62-student school, the smallest in the state with an 11-man 
football team. ``I don't think there's a lot of high school 
football coaches who can say that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That the Falcons are coached by a pastor is appropriate. Just  
about everyone pulls one form of double duty or another in Ladonia, 
population 761. 
</P>
<P>
	Mothers trim the grass and paint the fences at Fannindel's  
football field. Janna Reel, the owner of Reel's Cafe on the town 
square, makes care packages presented to the players at pep 
rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	And to top it all off, the student coaches call ``the smartest  
girl in school'' is also a Falcons running back-receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	That's right -- Jentaisha Scott, a 5-foot-8-inch sophomore with  
powerful legs and a winning smile, is believed to be the only girl 
in Texas to have scored a touchdown this season. 
</P>
<P>
	With only 33 boys in the entire high school, head coach Kris  
Crews told Scott she was more than welcome to join the squad when 
she asked this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she had no football experience before practice began in  
August, Scott has more than stepped up to the challenge, emerging 
as the junior varsity's starting tailback and one of the varsity's 
best wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	And how do opponents react after being scored upon by a female?  
</P>
<P>
	``Most of them don't realize it until halftime,'' Scott said.  
``They look pretty surprised when I take my helmet off, though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those Fannindel students who don't strap on helmets at practice  
every afternoon are few and far between. Like many Class 1A high 
schools, every able-bodied boy in the school is expected to play 
football, and all but five of the boys who attend Fannindel do just 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	The school is small enough to be eligible for six-man football,  
but administrators and coaches have never considered making the 
switch because of tradition and the athletic program's history of 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Falcons are 1-5 this year, they reached the state  
semifinals in 1988 and the school won the 1A state basketball title 
a few months later. 
</P>
<P>
	National TV crews converged on Ladonia when the Texas  
Legislature instituted its ``no pass, no play'' rule in the 
mid-1980s. At one point, the team was down to just 11 eligible 
players, but the Falcons responded by winning four of their last 
five games and reaching the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like it that we're smaller than everybody else,'' said  
Derrick Houston, the starting running back and defensive end, 
``because it gives us an even bigger chance to prove ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite recent struggles, pride runs rampant in Fannindel's  
program. As much as coaches tout star players like quarterback 
Quentin Dowdy, they brag even more about stellar fan support and 
the cohesiveness of the community. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, so many Ladonia residents are Falcons fans that Reel  
closes her restaurant on the nights of home games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people here are uniquely close,'' athletic director Mike  
Smith said. ``They might fight with each other sometimes, but if 
one of them gets in trouble, everybody in town is fighting on the 
same side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players thrive on that support. They say the advantages of  
living in a laid-back, small town far outweigh the drawbacks of 
being a half hour away from the nearest movie theater or 
McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the kids that go to school in the city are the ones  
who are missing out,'' said junior running back Dustin Smith, 
Mike's son. ``They'll never feel the sense of family and the 
closeness that we feel here. I wouldn't trade places with 
anybody.''

<HEADLINE> Dylan Makes Sitcom Appearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that he's made his sitcom debut on ``Dharma  
&AMP; Greg,'' a whole new world of possibilities opens up for Bob 
Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
	How about a role as a high school teacher on ``That '70s Show''?  
A space alien on ``3rd Rock From the Sun''? Or one of the 
interchangeable cads on ``Sex and the City''? 
</P>
<P>
	The inscrutable rock legend started simply -- with a jovial  
version of himself -- in an unbilled appearance on the ABC sitcom 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It came at the end of the show, when Dharma, played by Jenna  
Elfman, decides to show off her drum skills by trying out for a 
band. Dylan is the bandleader. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll count it off,'' Dylan advises Dharma as a song begins.  
</P>
<P>
	The odd appearance was engineered by Eddie Gorodetsky, a writer  
on the sitcom who is friendly with Dylan. When producers sought a 
nationally known musician for the cameo role, they decided to test 
the contact. 
</P>
<P>
	Through his manager, Dylan requested a few tapes of ``Dharma &AMP;  
Greg,'' said the show's creator, Chuck Lorre. About a month later 
came the word: Bob was game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a series of miracles,'' Lorre said.  
</P>
<P>
	Taping took an hour, with Ms. Elfman trying her best to keep up  
with the legend. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Dylan suggests a meringue beat, then a polka.  
</P>
<P>
	When Dharma tries a different beat, she says, ``That's kind of  
too funky for your style, eh? 
</P>
<P>
	``Not at all,'' Dylan says with a wide smile.  
</P>
<P>
	He demurs when Dharma asks if she's passed the audition, but  
laughs when she asks whether he can help pack up her drum kit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, sure,'' he says, already completing more dialogue than  
he uses during most concert appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no telling what it was about ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' that  
appealed to Dylan; his spokesman didn't return a call for comment 
on Tuesday. And Dylan insisted a tight lid be kept on all 
publicity: ABC officials concealed his identity during show promos 
and wouldn't even confirm his appearance hours before the taped 
show aired. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime he wants to do another episode,'' Lorre said, ``we'll  
figure it out.''

<HEADLINE> Gulati Returns As Manager for Kraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sunil Gulati, fired eight months ago as Major  
League Soccer's deputy commissioner, returned to the league Tuesday 
as managing director of Kraft Soccer Properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulati, 40, will have control of the New England Revolution and  
San Jose Clash, including player personnel operations, as well 
future projects the Kraft family might enter. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulati, who for the first three years of MLS' existence was  
responsible for every player signing by the league, says his first 
priority will be to hire a replacement for Walter Zenga, who was 
dismissed as the Revolution's goalkeeper-coach on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a fundamental decision, since your coach has to be  
central to your player decisions, has to be on the coach,'' Gulati 
said. ``After that, we have to be reasonable in determining what 
players we want and who the league has the resources to get. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody gets all those decisions right, not at Manchester  
United, not in MLS. You hope to get two or three right in any 
season. We have to get three or four right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite both teams having qualified for the playoffs only once  
each in their four years, Gulati's immediate attention will be on 
the Revolution because their needs are more immediate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a different dynamic (with the Clash),'' Gulati said.  
``We'll focus early on the Revolution. The Clash have coach in 
place, and there are fewer decision variables.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gulati was a key executive in the organizing committee of the  
1994 World Cup and later moved on to become one of the major 
figures in launching MLS in 1996. Under the league's ``single 
entity'' system, in which the league owns all the teams and 
singularly negotiates and signs all players to contracts but 
investors pay for the right to operate the clubs, Gulati was 
responsible for all player acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his decision to unilaterally exercise the option on Tab  
Ramos' contract, renewing it without the approval of New York-New 
Jersey MetroStars' operator-investor Stuart Subotnick, that 
reportedly caused then-MLS commissioner Doug Logan to fire Gulati 
on Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan was subsequently fired by the MLS Board of Governors,  
headed by Subotnick, on Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulati said he feels his extensive experience within American  
soccer, his international contacts and his intimate knowledge of 
MLS' internal machinations give him a unique perspective that 
should enable him to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``From where I sat for the last few years, I think I have a  
pretty good understanding of what parameters the league operates 
under,'' Gulati said. ``You're not going to find us in a situation 
where we are going to be in the New England press or the (San 
Francisco-San Jose) Bay area press saying we didn't get players we 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we going be irritated if we don't get exactly the player  
we wanted? Sure. But we're going to take responsibility for the 
decisions we make. Everybody is playing with same constraints.''

<HEADLINE> Moderate GOP Illinois Rep. Retiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. John Porter of Illinois, part of a  
dwindling band of Republican moderates in the House, announced 
Tuesday he will not seek a 12th term next year, further 
complicating the GOP's effort to hold its tenuous majority. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have the best job in America,'' said Porter, who chairs a  
subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee that oversees 
education, social and health programs. ``I just think it's time I 
move on to other challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, 64, did not rule out a future run for the Senate or  
other public office, but his surprise decision not to seek 
re-election gives Democrats an unforeseen shot at the Illinois 10th 
District he has represented since 1980. He becomes the 16th 
Republican to decide against running for re-election, compared to 
only six Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats now have 211 seats plus Rep. Bernie Sanders of  
Vermont, an independent who reliably votes Democratic. They need to 
reach 218 to take back the majority in the 2000 election, and 
Porter's district in Chicago's North Shore suburbs has recently 
trended Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton carried the district in 1996. More recently, a  
Democrat won an upset victory in 1998 for an Illinois House seat in 
the same area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view this as a competitive seat,'' said Erik Smith,  
spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, joined at a Capitol Hill news conference by his wife,  
Kathryn, said one factor in his decision was a House GOP rule 
requiring committee and subcommittee chairmen to relinquish their 
posts after six years -- a limit he will reach next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter has used his post to blunt GOP cuts in social programs  
and to fight for such programs as increased biomedical research 
funding and global family planning. But he said he was not 
frustrated as a moderate in a House run by conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can still exist as members of the same party, even though  
we don't agree on everything,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter said he made his announcement Tuesday, two months before  
the filing deadline for the Illinois primary, to give prospective 
candidates time to prepare their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the lone Democratic candidate for the seat is Chris  
Cohen, a former Chicago alderman, but Porter's retirement is likely 
to produce more candidates on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican who said Tuesday he would take a look at the race  
is Mark Kirk, a former Porter chief of staff who works for the 
House International Relations Committee. National Republican 
leaders, meanwhile, were hoping to persuade Illinois Lt. Gov. 
Corinne Wood to run, according to GOP sources speaking on condition 
of anonymity.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Awarded Euro 2004 Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AACHEN, Germany (AP) -- Portugal was awarded soccer's 2004  
European Championships on Tuesday, beating out neighboring Spain 
and a joint Austria-Hungary bid. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the first time the quadrennial championships are  
held in Portugal. The 2000 tournament will be played in Belgium and 
The Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, following a secret vote, was announced by Lennart  
Johansson, president of Europe's governing soccer body. The 
Portuguese delegation, including soccer great Eusebio, cheered 
wildly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Portugal is a small country but we love football,'' Eusebio  
said as Portuguese delegation officials popped open bottles of 
champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal plans to hold the tournament in eight cities: Lisbon,  
Porto, Aveiro, Braga, Coimbra, Faro/Loule, Guimaraes and Leiria. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the happiest day in my life,'' Portuguese soccer  
federation president Gilberto Madail said. ``We did everything 
possible to prove that Portugal was capable and worthy of staging 
the European Championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Portuguese bid plans, games will be played in eight  
cities: Lisbon, Porto, Aveiro, Braga, Coimbra, Faro/Loule, 
Guimaraes and Leiria. Lisbon and Porto will provide two stadiums 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	Five stadiums need extensive renovation and five new ones will  
be built, according to the Portuguese bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a complete surprise,'' Spanish soccer federation  
president Angel Maria Villar said. ``(The Portuguese) don't have 
the better facilities but there were other reasons they won it and 
one of the reasons is precisely that they don't have the 
resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz Palme, chief of the Austria-Hungary bid, said his first  
reaction was that it was a ``wrong decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's hope that it will be a good decision for football,'' he  
said. ``I think they have a lot of stadiums to build for a small 
nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest soccer event Portugal ever held was the youth World  
Cup in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Clemens Looks Forward to Fenway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Red Sox fans have dreaded the idea of Roger  
Clemens walking atop the mound at Fenway Park, showing Boston what 
a mistake it was to let him go. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-time Cy Young Award winner is scheduled to start for  
the New York Yankees against Boston's Pedro Martinez, a soon-to-be 
two-time winner, when the AL championship series switches to Fenway 
Park on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much action as there's going to be on the field, I think  
there will be among the fans,'' Clemens said Tuesday, a day before 
the series opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving the Red Sox to sign with Toronto after the 1996  
season, Clemens has pitched at Fenway Park just three times. He won 
3-1 on July 12, 1997, striking out 16 and walking none as he 
allowed one run and four hits in eight innings. He didn't get a 
decision on Sept. 18, giving up one run and five hits in seven 
innings and striking out 10. 
</P>
<P>
	In his only start at Boston since his trade to the New York  
Yankees during spring training, Clemens got a no-decision on July 
31. He left leading 5-3, allowing four runs and five hits in five 
innings, but the Yankees lost 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a problem pitching in Boston,'' Clemens said.  
``Obviously, I know the mound and the surroundings, I know the 
mound and I know the wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest problem there might be tickets.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of close friends who are going to be calling,  
asking us to stay with them rather than the hotel,'' Clemens said. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not worried about getting too pumped up against the team  
with which he became a star. 
</P>
<P>
	``My emotions are racing all the time,'' he said, ``whether I'm  
playing in a game in the playoffs or a game in Minnesota.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's game is scheduled to start in the late afternoon,  
which means shadows that make the ball difficult for hitters to 
pick up. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the sun is out, it ought to be interesting,'' Yankees  
manager Joe Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PEDRO OK:* The report on Martinez after Monday night's epic  
relief appearance: He feels fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure I can be as good as I can be'' on Saturday, when he  
is scheduled to start Game 3 against Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez strained a back muscle and had to leave Game 1 of the  
first-round playoff series against Cleveland after four innings. 
Last Saturday he could barely throw a baseball, but he tested his 
arm again on Monday night and got the go-ahead to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	He came out of the bullpen and pitched six innings of hitless  
relief, striking out eight. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a certain aura to the game when Pedro came in. There  
was a certain respect,'' Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette said. 
``When they (the Indians) saw he was throwing like Pedro Martinez, 
the momentum switched to the Red Sox.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AGE-OLD QUESTION:* Orlando Hernandez, the Yankees' Game 1  
starter, wouldn't address the question of his age. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees media guide claims Hernandez turned 30 on Monday,  
but New York Magazine this week reported on a document in his 
divorce case that says he is actually four years older. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only one that has got a right to ask me about my age is  
George Steinbrenner,'' Hernandez said through an interpreter, 
referring to the Yankees' owner. ``George never asked me nothing 
about my age.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GRUDGE MATCH:* Duquette remembers the last time the Red Sox and  
Yankees met in a playoff-type game. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 1978, and the teams were tied atop the AL East at the end  
of the regular season, necessitating a one-game playoff for the 
right to meet Kansas City in the AL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston GM was a 20-year-old Amherst student watching from  
the grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here for another shot at the Yankees,'' Duquette said.  
``We're playing the Yankees for the American League pennant and we 
have seven games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one-game playoff is considered a regular-season game. That  
means that until the addition of the wild card to the playoffs in 
1995, it was impossible for the Red Sox and Yankees to meet in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	But a guy can dream.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's something that I've wanted to do since I was 10 years  
old,'' Duquette said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *REMEMBERING CATFISH:* The family of Catfish Hunter, the former  
Yankees pitcher who died Sept. 9 of Lou Gehrig's disease, will 
throw out the ceremonial first pitches before Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Helen Hunter, Catfish's wife, will be accompanied by sons Tod  
and Paul, and daughter Kim Hunter-Layne.

<HEADLINE> College Hoopster Dies in Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SWANNANOA, N.C. (AP) -- A Warren Wilson basketball player died  
after he apparently stumbled head first into a cinder block wall 
while running sprints. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam Stein, 20, of Nashville, Tenn., died of a broken neck at  
around 6 p.m. Monday in the school's gymnasium, the college said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had turned my back and didn't see what happened,'' coach  
Steve Henry said Tuesday, his eyes red from crying after a one-hour 
memorial service. ``A couple of the players started yelling and two 
of them started CPR on Adam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The college had installed padding on the cement gym wall  
underneath the baskets, but had none along the rest of the wall's 
face. There is about 10 to 12 feet from the wall to the court's 
baseline, where players running sprints, turning around and heading 
back to the other baseline. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to understand how this could happen with that much  
room,'' Henry said. ``He must have stumbled about 12 feet. It's 
unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stein had transferred to Warren Wilson from Front Range  
Community College in Boulder, Colo. He played high school 
basketball at University School of Nashville until his senior 
season, when he decided to concentrate on other interests, 
according to his prep coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a real artistic-type kid, very nice to everyone,''  
coach William Belliford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren Wilson participates in the National Small College  
Athletic Association, a group of about 75 colleges and universities 
around the country with enrollments of 1,000 or less.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Cowboy Kicker To Sign With Bears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Badly in need of a place-kicker, the  
Chicago Bears on Tuesday came to terms with former Dallas Cowboy 
Chris Boniol. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said it planned to sign Boniol on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Jaeger, the Bears' career leader in field goal percentage  
(.759), will be placed on injured reserve or accept an injury 
settlement, the team said in a release. 
</P>
<P>
	A hip injury sustained in training camp kept Jaeger sidelined  
until two games ago. He re-injured himself in Sunday's victory at 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Boniol kicked for both Philadelphia and Cleveland in training  
camp this summer. The last two seasons, he kicked for the Eagles, 
the Bears' opponent this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	With Dallas, he hit 27 of 28 field goal attempts in 1995. In  
five years in the NFL, he has made 117 of his 145 field goal 
attempts (.807).

<HEADLINE> Jordan Visits Hurricane Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURGAW, N.C. (AP) -- His Airness popped in at a disaster recovery  
center for Hurricane Floyd flood victims Tuesday, dispensing cases 
of underwear and hugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan, who grew up in nearby Wilmington, walked into  
the Salvation Army disaster recovery center about 12:30 p.m. and 
spent 15 minutes listening to the victims' stories, said Salvation 
Army spokeswoman Amy Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a big morale booster for flood victims in the Burgaw  
area,'' Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The region was badly flooded when Floyd drenched eastern North  
Carolina with up to 20 inches of rain Sept. 16. The storm was 
blamed for at least 49 deaths and is expected to surpass the 
state's worst-ever natural disaster, Hurricane Fran, which caused 
$6 billion in damage in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter said several of Jordan's cousins have received  
assistance from the Burgaw center and his aunt volunteered there. 
The center serves Pender and Duplin counties. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Jordan's donation of Hanes underwear -- one of the many  
products he endorses -- was most welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually that was something we really needed, so that was a  
big help,'' Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can bring something good to them, then that's as special  
to me as it is to them,'' Jordan said after having his picture 
taken with three volunteers. ``That's worth anything I've made in 
my whole career.''

<HEADLINE> O'Meara: Even Ryder Feels Like Loss  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) -- It's been that kind of year for  
Mark O'Meara: Even the Ryder Cup victory feels like a loss. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara, the defending champion when the World Match Play  
championship begins Thursday, won last year's final 1-up over Tiger 
Woods in the 36-hole final on the West Course at Wentworth, just 
outside London. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of the most exciting, most unique, most fun quality  
golf matches that I have ever been associated with,'' said O'Meara, 
who also won the British Open and Masters last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year has been a different story,'' added the American,  
who has struggled all year with his driver. ``It has been kind of a 
battle out there on the course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara, who didn't score a point in the Americans' widely  
criticized Ryder Cup win, said Tuesday the controversy soured the 
victory, though he was lauded by the Europeans as one of the good 
guys. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel like I won anything at the Ryder Cup. Even  
though all that great golf was played on both sides of the 
Atlantic, it just seemed to be so negative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if Europe had won if it would have been that  
negative or not. But it just seems like the two winning teams that 
I have been on, everything has been so negative about what happened 
that it doesn't feel like we won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara also said he might skip the Nov. 4-7 World Golf  
Championships at Valderrama in southern Spain if his game doesn't 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara, Ernie Els, Colin Montgomerie and Nick Price have the  
four byes in Thursday's opening round. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-round matches:  
</P>
<P>
	Craig Parry, Australia vs. Paul Lawrie, Scotland (winner faces  
O'Meara); Sergio Garcia, Spain vs. Retief Goosen, South Africa 
(winner faces Price); Carlos Franco, Paraguay, vs. Padraig 
Harrington, Ireland (winner faces Els); Jose Maria Olazabal, Spain 
vs. Notah Begay, United States (winner faces Montgomerie). 
</P>
<P>
	Price warned the 19-year-old Garcia to improve his driving game.  
Garcia led Spain to the Dunhill Cup title Sunday at St. Andrews and 
defeated Price 67-70 in a third-round match on the Old Course. They 
could meet again on Friday in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``His (Garcia's) short game right now is about as good as  
anyone's I have ever seen,'' Price said. ``It is something about 
that Spanish blood. None of them (Seve Ballesteros, Jose Maria 
Olazabal and Garcia) drive the ball well, but they all chip and 
putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not asking him to change his swing, just refine it.  
Shorten it a bit or whatever it takes to slow those hands down a 
bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he does make those refinements as Tiger Woods has done ...  
then come four, five, six years he is going to be a real powerhouse 
in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The least-known name in the 12-man field is Begay. A surprise  
entry in the tournament, he made organizers look good when he won 
the Michelob Championship on Sunday in Williamsburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Begay is the only American Indian playing on the U.S. tour.  
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie, who pulled out of the Dunhill last week with a  
toothache, said he expects to play this week and will have his bad 
tooth pulled next week.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' O'Neill Testing Broken Rib </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees were hoping their AL  
championship series opponent would come into town hurting. They 
didn't expect to have their own worries to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Boston Red Sox arrived today, New York hoped to find out  
whether Paul O'Neill's fractured rib would keep him out of the 
league championship series, which starts at Yankee Stadium on 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, who hasn't played since Thursday, took batting  
practice, along with running and outfield drills. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave himself a good workout today,'' Yankees manager Joe  
Torre said. ``He said he felt pretty good, probably felt as good as 
he did in the early part of the Texas series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill was injured Oct. 2 when he crashed into a low fence  
chasing a foul ball at Tampa Bay, then went 1-for-4 in each of the 
first two games of the AL playoffs against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre benched him for the clincher, convinced the injury was  
hampering O'Neill. The team sent the 36-year-old outfielder to 
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center on Monday for new X-rays and 
an MRI, which showed a small fracture of the 10th rib on his right 
side. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, I guess, it shows up later,'' O'Neill said.  
</P>
<P>
	Boston, which finished four games back in the AL East and won  
the wild card, has a different problem going into the best-of-7 
series. Pedro Martinez, who won Monday night's 12-8 thriller with 
six hitless innings of relief, won't be available to start until 
Game 3 at Fenway Park on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Mercker starts the opener against Orlando ``El Duque''  
Hernandez and Pedro's brother, Ramon, starts against David Cone in 
Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I got the start by default,'' Mercker said.  
</P>
<P>
	When the series to Fenway Park on Saturday, Roger Clemens starts  
for the Yankees against Pedro Martinez in Game 3. Andy Pettitte 
pitches Game 4 for New York against Bret Saberhagen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be great series. Its going to be exciting,''  
Ramon said amidst Boston's celebration at Jacobs Field. ``Each game 
we played during the regular season was exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York was just 4-8 against Boston, including three straight  
losses at Yankee Stadium from Sept. 10-12 that cut its AL East to 
3 1/2 games. The only other teams to win their season series against 
the defending World Series champions were Anaheim and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Yankees got their wish -- their opponent's pitching is  
pooped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping for a 21-inning game tonight,'' general manager  
Brian Cashman said before Monday night's game. ``I'm hoping for an 
extra-inning, rain-delayed slugfest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the first time the Yankees and their traditional  
rival have met in postseason play. New York's win at Fenway Park in 
the 1978 tiebreaker for the AL East is considered a regular-season 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosters for the championship series must be set by 10 a.m. EDT  
Wednesday, and the Yankees won't make any decisions until then. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll try to push it right up against the deadline,'' Torre  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	O`Neill, who hit .285 this season with 19 homers and 110s RBIs,  
is an intense competitor who plays through pain. In 1996, he 
hobbled on a torn hamstring for much of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Joe Torre and the medical staff will be able to see  
how debilitating it's going to be,'' Cashman said. 
</P>
<P>
	If O'Neill can't play for the start of the best-of-7 series, the  
Yankees probably would activate Shane Spencer, who wasn't on the 
roster for the first-round sweep of Texas. O'Neill's teammates 
still hope he'll be able to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``With him in there, we have a hitter capable of producing a lot  
of runs,'' Darryl Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
	To open a spot if O'Neill is questionable, New York probably  
would cut either Clay Bellinger, used mostly as a pinch runner, or 
pitcher Hideki Irabu, who didn't pitch against the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez was 2-1 with a 2.70 ERA against Boston during the  
regular season after going 1-0 versus the Red Sox last year. He 
allowed two hits in eight shutout innings during the playoff opener 
and is 3-0 with an 0.41 ERA in three postseason starts.

<HEADLINE> Recovering Irvin in Good Spirits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Not even a frightening neck injury can dim  
Michael Irvin's high-voltage personality. 
</P>
<P>
	After a night in a Philadelphia hospital, Irvin visited the  
Dallas Cowboys' locker room Monday evening and was as jolly as 
possible -- considering he was wearing a neck brace and had a 
swollen spinal cord and herniated disc. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a great visit,'' coach Chan Gailey said. ``He was in  
really good spirits. It really made me feel better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was injured early in Sunday's 13-10 loss to the Eagles. A  
visit to a spine specialist Wednesday should determine how long 
he'll be out. The 12-year veteran is expected to return this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to play,'' Gailey said. ``Anybody who knows Michael  
knows that's him. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the first questions I got from him was, `What kind of  
coverages did they play the rest of the game?' That's just the kind 
of guy he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin will see the same spine specialist who has treated  
teammate Daryl Johnston, whose is out for the season with a neck 
injury. Johnston remains with the team and is working with the 
practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wants to talk to me about anything regarding that type  
of injury, I'd be more than happy to talk to him,'' Johnston said. 
``But my first concern is to see how he's doing physically. The 
mental part will come later on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a scary thing. I'm sure he had a lot of thoughts racing  
through his mind when he was being taken off the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey said he hopes Irvin remains close to the team during his  
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want him with the team,'' he said. ``I want him to be on the  
plane. We're not trying to push him on the side and say come back 
when you're well. We're all in this thing together. I still want 
him in the meetings, on the sidelines -- everywhere.''

<HEADLINE> Wyo. Gay Slaying Defense: Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Whether or not Aaron McKinney helped  
pistol-whip a gay student, leaving him to die in the freezing 
prairie, is not in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	At the opening of McKinney's murder trial on Monday, his lawyer  
said he would not contest that McKinney played a role in the fatal 
beating of Matthew Shepard last October. 
</P>
<P>
	However, attorney Dion Custis told prospective jurors that drugs  
and alcohol spurred McKinley's actions, and his client's use of 
those substances would be a core part of his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you have to decide in this case is basically a question  
of why,'' Custis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection continued today in Albany County District Court  
behind closed doors, with attorneys questioning potential jurors 
individually. It is expected to take about two weeks to seat the 
panel. The session was closed because sensitive questions such as 
feelings about homosexuality and the death penalty could be 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Henderson, 22, is already serving a life sentence after  
pleading guilty to felony murder and kidnapping in the beating of 
Shepard. The 21-year-old University of Wyoming freshman died a year 
ago today, five days after being lured out of a bar, driven to a 
remote spot on the freezing prairie, lashed to a wooden fence and 
pistol-whipped into a coma. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney, 22, could face the death penalty if convicted of  
Shepard's murder. Henderson has been subpoenaed by McKinney's 
lawyers to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say McKinney, accompanied by Henderson, instigated a  
plan to rob the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard of $20, but that 
Shepard may have been targeted because he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney has said he did not know Shepard was gay and does not  
hate homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	In unveiling his defense strategy, Custis said he would not  
contend that McKinney was insane, but told them ``his mental state 
will certainly be a crucial question for you to answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Alcohol will be an issue,'' he said. ``Methamphetamine ... is  
a big issue and had a big part in this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard's brutal death provoked a national debate over hate  
crimes and led to measures across the country adding sexual 
orientation to anti-discrimination laws. However, hate-crime 
legislation failed in Wyoming last winter after lawmakers argued 
that gays and other groups would receive special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Custis told prospective jurors he was concerned about the  
widespread attention stemming from the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone here is going to suggest this is a hate  
crime,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the trial began, a few anti-gay protesters demonstrated  
outside the courthouse, along with people who came to honor 
Shepard's memory, wearing angel costumes to spread what they said 
was a message of love. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the day, 21 prospective jurors had been dismissed,  
including a man reporters saw pass a note to Shepard's mother 
during the lunch break. The man indicated the note expressed his 
condolences.

<HEADLINE> Public Records Bill Vetoed in Calf. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California's governor has vetoed a  
bill that would have required government agencies to make 
computerized public records available to the public and press in an 
electronic format. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would also have prohibited agencies from charging  
more than the actual cost of providing the records on computer 
disks or in other electronic formats. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was ``well intentioned'' but many state computer  
systems could not comply with it without compromising confidential 
material stored in those systems, Gov. Gray Davis said in his veto 
message, released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the state's information technology resources should  
be directed toward making sure its computer systems are year-2000 
compliant,'' Davis added, rather than diverting time and money to 
designing programs to separate confidential from public information 
in computer files. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Franke, general counsel of the media-supported California  
First Amendment Coalition, said the bill would have prevented 
agencies that keep records in easily searchable formats from 
instead releasing them only in a more expensive and hard-to-search 
``haystack of hundreds of pages of paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second public records bill Davis has vetoed in the  
past week. On Friday, he vetoed a that would have imposed 
$100-per-day fines for deliberately withholding public records.

<HEADLINE> Nine Planet Hollywoods To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Planet Hollywood filed for Chapter 11  
bankruptcy protection Tuesday, a day after the movie-themed 
restaurant chain closed nine of its 32 U.S. restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando-based company and 25 of its subsidiaries sought  
protection from its creditors while it reorganizes its finances 
with the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. The 
company said Monday it would release its reorganization plan in the 
near future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is the first step in our plan to position Planet  
Hollywood for a return to long-term profitability and healthy 
growth,'' said Robert Earl, chairman and chief executive officer, 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's plan calls for upgrading several of its  
movie-themed restaurants and menus, Earl said. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurants closed Monday were in Chicago, Costa Mesa,  
Calif.; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Gurnee, Ill.; Houston; Indianapolis; 
Maui, Hawaii; Miami and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	There may still be a couple of additional closings or franchise  
conversions, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the reorganization, Planet Hollywood International  
Inc.'s two largest shareholders and a trust for Earl's children 
have agreed to provide a $30 million cash infusion to help keep the 
international chain of glitzy restaurants going. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankruptcy filing was the latest setback for the operator of  
nearly 80 Planet Hollywood restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Former president William Baumhauer resigned in June, just three  
months after the company's co-founder resigned his board position. 
Keith Barish, who started the venture with Earl and actors 
Sylvester Stallone, Demi Moore, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce 
Willis, left the company in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been trying to cut operating costs by reducing  
corporate overhead, putting in cost-control systems, streamlining 
store-level operations and disposing of nonessential corporate 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite those moves, analysts have said aggressive expansion and  
increased competition have hurt the company.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin To Decide Alvarez's Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Barry Alvarez isn't so old that his  
favorite topic of conversation is his health. In fact, he'd rather 
be talking about almost anything else. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the misadventures the Wisconsin coach has undergone in  
the past months with his badly damaged knee, that's all anyone 
wants to ask him about. In the meantime, the 17th-ranked Badgers 
play on -- likely for at least another week -- without their leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just kind of in limbo right now. I just want to do  
something. I just want to make a move,'' Alvarez said. ``I don't 
think I've ever been this confined in my life. It's very, very 
difficult for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez was released from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.,  
and returned to Madison on Tuesday, a week after his knee 
replacement surgery turned into a cleaning operation to remove an 
infection from his right leg. He didn't speak to the team, though 
he probably will later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials say it hasn't been decided whether Alvarez will  
sit in the Camp Randall Stadium press box for Saturday's game 
against Indiana, or whether he will watch it from home. He might 
have contact with his players at week's end, perhaps meeting with 
them at the team hotel on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez still needs the knee replacement, but the six weeks of  
antibiotics he must take to treat the infection have postponed the 
procedure yet again. Originally, Alvarez had hoped to put off the 
surgery until after the season, and now he'll get his wish -- though 
his role in coaching the Badgers for the rest of the season is 
still up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez monitored the Badgers' 20-17 overtime win at Minnesota  
last Saturday from his hospital bed with a television and a 
headset, though he said he didn't contribute much to his 
assistants' winning game plan. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Badgers seized Paul Bunyan's Axe and pretended to chop  
down the Gophers' goal post, Alvarez's pride and frustration grew 
apace. 
</P>
<P>
	``There never seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel with  
this knee,'' Alvarez said. ``Every day I get a little better, but 
you know what it's like after you go through surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez has a 10-inch incision, which has been closed by a few  
fragile sutures, stretching above and below his knee. Since even a 
slight jolt could open the sutures and invite infection again, he 
likely won't be attending practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
	During last week's 2 1/2-hour surgery, damaged tissue around his  
knee was removed, along with spurs and cysts. It also revealed the 
infection, which doctors are still working to identify. 
</P>
<P>
	He has lost much of the muscle and movement in the joint, but  
although he's still in pain, ``it's a different kind of pain,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest pain of all, he said, is being unable to get on  
the field with the players and the program he has built over the 
past decade. Alvarez reaped the fruits of his labors last season 
with a Rose Bowl win, and this year's team still has a shot at an 
excellent season and even the Big Ten title. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the final moments of the Minnesota game, when Vitaly  
Pisetsky kicked the game-winning field goal and the Badgers seized 
the axe, were difficult to watch without getting overexcited. He 
did so much whooping in his hospital room that the staff asked him 
to quiet down. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, the box is passive enough, let alone sitting in a  
hospital room with your wife and a headset on,'' Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez usually speaks to his team every Friday night before a  
game, and last week he videotaped a message he said was upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't try to play on their emotions because I thought the  
week had been emotional enough,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Braves Game Still Not a Sellout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Chipper Jones can't understand it -- the Atlanta  
Braves again are having a tough time selling tickets to the 
National League championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an exciting team, a blue-collar team, and this team  
deserves to have the backing of its fans,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	After drawing franchise lows for the divisional series, the  
Braves this morning were 6,000 tickets short of a sellout for 
tonight's opening game of the playoff series against the hated New 
York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 9,000 tickets remained for Game 2 on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the fans are taking for granted that we're going to make it  
to the World Series, the Mets may have something to say about 
that,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaints about Atlanta's postseason apathy are not new. Former  
Braves outfielder David Justice ripped the fans in 1995 for not 
making enough noise during the World Series against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	But it seems to be getting worse.  
</P>
<P>
	The Braves drew only 39,119 fans to the first game of the  
division series against Houston -- nearly 11,000 short of capacity 
at Turner Field and the smallest crowd ever in Atlanta's 44-game 
postseason history. The second game wasn't much better with only 
41,913 in the seats. 
</P>
<P>
	David Teske, a fan from Jonesboro, said the 4 p.m. game times  
against Houston hurt attendance. It's hard for working fans to 
attend afternoon games on the weekdays, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other fans see the empty seats as a symptom of the Braves'  
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the fans are getting a little complacent,'' said Vicki  
Reidy of Newnan, who bought tickets for tonight's game on her lunch 
break Monday. ``They're used to winning, and they like to wait 
until the end before they show up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lukewarm support in the playoffs follows what may have been  
one of the Braves' most exciting seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	With Andres Galarraga recovering from cancer and Javy Lopez  
still out with a knee injury, the Braves managed to fight off the 
hard-charging Mets in the final week of the season. They won more 
than 100 games for the third straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I was a little spoiled playing in St. Louis the last  
few years,'' said Braves right fielder Brian Jordan. ``Those are 
true baseball fans. Win, lose or draw they were always there. To 
come here and be in the postseason and not have sellouts is 
surprising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Braves officials were predicting tickets for Game 1 would sell  
out later today. ``I think Atlanta fans are going to rise to the 
occasion,'' said Paul Adams, director of ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Fortt, a New York Yankees fan who lives in Atlanta, said  
he wasn't going to any playoff games at Turner Field because of the 
expensive tickets. Reserved seats are $45, and box seats are $60. 
</P>
<P>
	Leetha Hayes of Chamblee said the Braves don't have the same  
magic they had in 1991 when they went from worst to first in a 
single season and lost to Minnesota in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a fan at one time when they had Deion (Sanders) and Fred  
McGriff,'' said Ms. Hayes. ``After they traded them away, it hasn't 
been the same.''

<HEADLINE> Lorillard Announces Anti-Smoke Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO (AP) -- Lorillard Tobacco Co. is launching a  
nationwide youth smoking-prevention program in addition to the one 
included in the industry's $206 billion settlement with 46 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, which urges parents to talk to their children about  
not smoking, includes national print and broadcast announcements, 
Web sites and a multi-city tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris Inc., the leading cigarette maker, sponsored a  
similar program earlier this year that critics said lacked 
credibility with children. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorillard officials said their program was carefully researched  
to ensure it wouldn't be perceived as even remotely encouraging 
tobacco consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have developed a program that is aggressive, highly  
creative and effective in getting the message to kids that they 
should not smoke,'' Ron Milstein, a Lorillard vice president, said 
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Bowden Discusses Warrick Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida State wide receiver Peter  
Warrick won't play Saturday against Wake Forest no matter what 
happens with theft charges he faces, Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Warrick is keeping his original lawyer, despite  
another attorney's statement in court papers that he was 
representing the player. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick and former Florida State wide receiver Laveranues Coles  
were arrested Thursday and charged with grand theft. Police allege 
they paid $21.40 for $412.38 worth of clothes with the help of a 
department store clerk. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, a top Heisman Trophy candidate before the arrest, was  
suspended from the top-ranked Seminoles. Coles, who had other legal 
troubles in the past, was dismissed from the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step in the case is for prosecutors to file formal  
charges, deciding whether to maintain the preliminary felony charge 
or prosecute the case as a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	The distinction is important for Warrick because university  
rules don't allow him to play while he is facing felony charges. If 
he is charged with a misdemeanor, Bowden and other school officials 
make the decision whether he can return to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	If Warrick is charged with a misdemeanor, ``I'll recommend he  
plays again,'' Bowden said on ESPN's ``Up Close'' Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if prosecutors file reduced charges this week, ``I'm  
still not going to let him play in the next ballgame,'' Bowden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick will continue to be represented by his original lawyer,  
John Kenny. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal injury attorney Henry Hunter had filed papers in court  
Monday stating his intent to take over the case and represent both 
players. But Hunter and Kenny both said Tuesday that Kenny will 
stay on as Warrick's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been the attorney of record since Thursday and he's said  
all along he wanted me to be his representative,'' Kenny said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter said he will still represent Coles.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' O'Neill Set for Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Paul O'Neill's broken rib has improved and he  
expects to be in the lineup Wednesday night for the start of the 
American League championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better today than a few days ago,'' the Yankees' right  
fielder said Tuesday. ``I feel better knowing what it is. Before, 
it was like `I don't want to do too much, I might tear something.' 
It's going to be there. It is there when I wake up in the morning; 
it is there when I go to bed at night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill took about two dozen swings in the batting cage Tuesday  
before manager Joe Torre, bench coach Don Zimmer, trainer Gene 
Monahan and team physician Dr. Stuart Hershon as the team worked 
out for its opener against the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt pretty good,'' he said. ``I had some batting practice,  
I threw, I ran. If I don't feel I can play and help my team win, I 
won't play. If I worry about it, I shouldn't be out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees can make roster changes until 10 a.m. Wednesday and  
Torre said they would wait until the deadline to make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he felt pretty good,'' Torre said of O'Neill.  
``Probably as good as he did in the early part of the Texas series. 
He gave himself a good workout.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill was injured in the final week of the season at Tampa  
when he ran into a low fence in foul territory. 
</P>
<P>
	He played the first two games of the division series against  
Texas, going 2-for-8. Torre sat him out for Game 3 at Texas and 
after the Yankees returned home, he learned of the broken rib 
diagnosis Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill said he felt the pain most at bat.  
</P>
<P>
	``It comes and goes a bit,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He is being treated with heat and whirlpool and pain killers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even know the names of a lot of the things,'' he said.  
``I haven't taken that much stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As of now, I'm playing unless I wake up tomorrow and something  
I did today sets it back, which I don't think anything has. If we 
were an hour from the game right now, I am pretty sure that Joe 
would have me in the lineup. That's the way I look at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Spencer, inactive for the division series, probably would  
replace O'Neill on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill batted .298 with two home runs and six runs batted in  
against the Red Sox this season. Spencer hit .111 on 3-for-18.

<HEADLINE> Umpires Seek To Decertify Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Umpires disenchanted with union head Richie  
Phillips petitioned the federal government on Tuesday to decertify 
their current union and form a new one. 
</P>
<P>
	The dissidents, headed by three AL umpires, met the National  
Labor Relations Board's requirement of having signatures from at 
least 30 percent of the bargaining unit, which in this case is the 
93 major league umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Silverman, the NLRB's New York regional director, called for  
an Oct. 22 hearing on the election request and said that if there 
are not objections, he anticipated balloting would take place in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	The dissidents would not say if they had the support of a  
majority of the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board keeps confidential the names of the persons who  
signed cards and submit them,'' said Joel Smith, a lawyer for the 
dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the dissidents plan to invite all umpires to a Nov.  
2 meeting in Baltimore, a lawyer familiar with their organizing 
said, speaking on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The dissident umpires, most in the American League, blame  
Phillips and union president Jerry Crawford for the union's 
strategy of mass resignations, which backfired in July and cost 22 
umpires their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Major League Umpires Association, which Phillips  
heads, has filed a grievance to regain the jobs of the 22, the 
union has not agreed to any of the proposed dates for the hearing 
before arbitrator Alan Symonette, a lawyer involved in the case 
said Tuesday. Union lawyer Pat Campbell declined comment on the 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	The dissidents call themselves the Major League Umpires  
Independent Organizing Committee and have been organized by three 
AL umpires -- Dave Phillips (who is not related to the union head), 
Joe Brinkman and John Hirschbeck. They have been working with 
lawyer Ron Shapiro, who is Cal Ripken's agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Phillips referred questions about the petition to  
Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is certainly not a surprise. They've been broadcasting  
this for months,'' Campbell said. ``I think that Jerry and Richie 
Garcia believe there is a solid majority that supports the Major 
League Umpires Association.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, an AL ump who is among the 22 who lost their jobs, is a  
strong supporter of the current union. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman said NLRB staff lawyer Stephen Appell will take  
testimony during the hearing, which will be held in New York.. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I will issue a decision on whether there will be an  
election,'' Silverman said. ``That decision is subject to appeal to 
the National Labor Relations Board in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires embarked on their mass resignation strategy in an effort  
to spark early negotiations to the collective bargaining agreement 
that expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners, concluding umpires were getting out of control, then  
hired 25 new umps from the minors and accepted the resignations of 
the 22 -- who tried to withdraw the resignations but were told it 
was too late.

<HEADLINE> Man Saves Ex-Wife's Home From Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULUTH, Minn. (AP) -- Jeff Odden could have just let the house  
burn down. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, it used to be his house, but after the divorce it was  
his ex-wife's. 
</P>
<P>
	But when a co-worker spotted the smoke Monday morning, Odden  
rushed to the scene, turned on a garden hose and stopped the fire 
from spreading. 
</P>
<P>
	``My ex-husband -- the hero,'' said Heather Odden, who was at her  
boyfriend's home when the fire broke out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were just standing there at work and one of the other guys  
said, `Hey, there's smoke coming from over near your old house,' so 
I looked at it and thought, `It's awfully close, it probably is,' 
so I drove over and sure enough,'' Jeff Odden said. 
</P>
<P>
	When firefighters arrived, they found the garage, a van inside,  
and a deck engulfed in flames -- and Odden wetting down the house 
with a garden hose. 
</P>
<P>
	``It very easily could have got the house but it didn't, thank  
goodness,'' Assistant Fire Chief Rich Mattson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the fire is under investigation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Gays Urged To Renounce Homosexuality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Activists accused the Rev. Jerry Falwell of  
promoting violence such as the beating death of a gay Wyoming 
college student as he led conservative Christians in urging gays to 
renounce homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Christian bigots out of our city!'' cried Josh Trenter, who  
was hauled away by police after allegedly tossing a blueberry pie 
during Monday's ``Come Out of Homosexuality'' event. He and another 
member of a gay rights group were cited for battery and released. 
</P>
<P>
	Declaring that ``God loves you and so do I,'' Falwell, who  
appeared via satellite, told the audience of about 60 that ``just 
as people can come out of the closet, so can people choose to come 
out against a sinful lifestyle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The presentation was designed ``to reach out to the homosexual  
community in a spirit of love,'' said Allen Wildmon, a spokesman 
for the American Family Association, a conservative Christian group 
that sponsored the event with Falwell, the former leader of the 
now-defunct Moral Majority. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not to force anybody's views on anyone,'' said  
Wildmon, who timed the lecture to counter publicity from National 
Coming Out Day, an annual event celebrating gay life. ``We all have 
a freedom of choice in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The event came as jury selection began in the first-degree  
murder trial of Aaron McKinney, accused of killing gay college 
student Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyo. Falwell condemned 
Shepard's killers and said the lecture's timing was coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing ``was very tacky,'' said San Francisco Supervisor Tom  
Ammiano, who has long been active in the gay rights movement. ``I 
think it's extremely disrespectful and I think it reflects the 
depth of their insensitivity and self-serving agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Supervisor Leslie Katz agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's such hatred that comes out in that approach. It  
implies people can change,'' Katz said. ``That's the behavior that 
results in people on the fringes committing grievous acts against 
others.''

<HEADLINE> Ad Growth Leads Dow Jones' Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dow Jones &AMP; Co. earned $45.5 million in the  
third quarter, exceeding analysts' expectations, amid continued 
advertising gains at its flagship newspaper, The Wall Street 
Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The profits for the three months ended Sept. 30 were equivalent  
to 50 cents per share, surpassing the 47 cents per share forecast 
by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparable earnings for the same period a year ago, which do not  
include a restructuring charge of $9.6 million related to severance 
costs at the company's community newspapers, were $35.4 million, or 
37 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures for the most recent quarter do not include a  
one-time gain of $57.3 million from the sale of stock in United 
States Broadcasting Inc. Including that gain, Dow Jones earned 
$102.8 million, or $1.13 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Total revenues rose 6 percent during the quarter to $469.8  
million from $443.6 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from print publishing, which include Barron's and  
SmartMoney magazines, rose 18 percent to $310 million. Advertising 
linage at the Journal, which has been lifted by the strong stock 
market, jumped 27 percent during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from Dow Jones' electronic publishing business, which  
includes a news database partnership recently formed with Reuters, 
rose 3 percent in the third quarter to $101.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating income in that area fell 65 percent to $6.2 million,  
which the company attributed to higher costs for content and 
increased spending on investment and sales. The electronic 
publishing segment includes Dow Jones Newswires, several Web sites 
and numerous stock indexes, including the widely quoted industrial 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Dow Jones earned $145.2  
million, or $1.59 per share, compared to $129.6 million, or $1.33 
per share. Revenues fell to $1.44 billion from $1.67 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the earnings beat expectations, Dow Jones stock fell  
$1.31 1/4 to $57.68 3/4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Off 231.12 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tumbling bond prices and a weak outlook for  
Raytheon deflated stocks Tuesday as traders, already anxious about 
interest rates, found themselves nervous about corporate profits as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 231.12 to close at  
10,417.06. It was the Dow's 10th biggest point drop in history, and 
the steepest since May 27, when the blue-chip index fell 235.23 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 fell 22.17 to 1,313.04, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 
43.52 to 2,872.43, retreating from the new record close of 2,915.95 
set Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A drop in bond prices depressed stocks Tuesday. Bond investors,  
nagged by persistent worries about interest rates, sold ahead of 
this week's government reports on wholesale prices and industrial 
production. The reports are expected to bring the latest signs of 
whether inflation is escalating. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still concerns out there about whether the Fed is  
going to raise rates again,'' said Barry Berman, head trader for 
Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee. ``And given the strength of the 
market last week, that provides as good an opportunity as any for 
some profit-taking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks soared last week after the Federal Reserve held interest  
rates steady. But the Fed left open the possibility of another rate 
increase, which would be the third this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in bond prices pushed the yield on the 30-year Treasury  
bond up to 6.23 percent Tuesday from 6.20 percent late Friday. The 
bond market was closed Monday for the Columbus Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising bond yields can present an attractive alternative to  
stocks by offering a fixed, guaranteed return. Financial services 
stocks, which are most vulnerable to rising rates, were among the 
Dow's worst performers Tuesday. American Express fell 3 5/8 to 145 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, traders were able to set aside some of their interest  
rate worries amid expectations that strong third-quarter earnings 
reports, which began in earnest Tuesday, would bolster stock 
prices. But that optimism vanished Tuesday amid news of trouble at 
Raytheon. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense contractors fell following reports that Raytheon is  
behind schedule or over budget on some major Pentagon orders. While 
market officials delayed the start of trading for Raytheon shares, 
most of its rival contractors tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon confirmed Tuesday morning that its earnings for fiscal  
years 1999 and 2000 will come in sharply below analysts' 
expectations, but the stock remained closed until the final hour of 
trading. Once the stock was available for trading, investors bid 
down Raytheon's Class B shares 18 3/4 to 24 1/4. General Dynamics fell 4 
11/16 to 57 11/16, and Litton fell 3 9/16 to 49 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Even strong earnings reports couldn't guarantee solid market  
performances Tuesday. Several Wall Street brokerages reported 
significant profit growth, yet failed to attract buyers for their 
stock. Merrill Lynch fell 3/4 to 67 after reporting it earned $1.34 
per share in the third quarter, beating analysts' estimates of 
$1.29 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Paine Webber said its third-quarter profits rose to 86 cents per  
share from 51 cents per share in the same period of 1998. Analysts 
had expected Paine Webber to earn 83 cents per share. The 
brokerage's stock slipped 11/16 to 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette fared best, rising 2 3/16 to 42 1/2  
after the firm reported third-quarter earnings of 85 cents a share, 
beating Wall Street's estimate of 76 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were also held down by the dollar's weakness against the  
Japanese yen. In late New York trading, the dollar bought 106.31 
yen, down from 106.68 yen late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same old devil is hurting the market,'' said John H.  
Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. ``Investors 
are worried about bonds and the dollar.''	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-2 margin on the 
New York Stock Exchange. Volume of all listed shares totaled 946.65 
million shares, compared with 791.73 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.52 to 424.67.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.2 percent.  
European indexes were mostly lower, as Germany's DAX index lost 1.0 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.0 percent, and France's CAC-40 
fell 1.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pfizer Must Pay in Trademark Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Pfizer Inc. was ordered Tuesday to pay $143  
million to a British medical electronics company that accused the 
U.S. pharmaceutical company of stealing its name. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. District Court jury awarded the damages to Trovan Ltd.,  
and said Pfizer must change the drug's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Trovan Ltd. sued Pfizer for using the name Trovan for an  
antibiotic introduced in 1998. The drug later was linked to several 
cases of liver failure, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
has restricted its use. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer plans to appeal the original verdict and the damage  
award. ``These jury verdicts are not supported by either the law or 
the facts, and we are confident this decision will not be upheld,'' 
said Paul S. Miller, Pfizer's general counsel and executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Trovan Ltd. and its U.S. distributor, Electronic Identification  
Devices of Santa Barbara, Calif., contended that their reputations 
were damaged by being linked to the antibiotic. 
</P>
<P>
	``A company's reputation is everything,'' said Joseph Masin,  
president of Electronic Identification Devices. ``... With this 
victory, we can continue to grow our company knowing once and for 
all that Trovan is indisputably ours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Privately held Trovan Ltd. manufactures identification tags that  
are implanted with computer chips containing information about 
patients' medical conditions. The tags also are used by researchers 
and hospitals to track blood supplies and by pet owners to track 
their animals in case they become lost or stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	Trovan attorneys said Pfizer introduced its Trovan antibiotic  
last year despite objections from the British company. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict is the second setback for New York-based Pfizer in  
recent weeks. In August, the company announced it was halting 
development of Alond, a potentially lucrative drug designed to 
reduce diabetic nerve damage. Pfizer had similarly high 
expectations for Trovan when it was introduced in 1998. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Calif. Reapportionment on Ballot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A measure that would let an  
independent commission rather than the Legislature draw new 
congressional and legislative district lines after the 2000 census 
has won a spot on the March ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Initiative petitions drew at least 130,000 more signatures from  
registered voters than the 670,000 they needed, Secretary of State 
Bill Jones said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure's sponsors are trying to make it more appealing to  
voters by including a provision that would mandate a 25 percent cut 
in state legislators' salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	That has enraged many Republican lawmakers who otherwise would  
be among the measure's strongest supporters, and could cut off an 
important source of funds in favor of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is sponsored by the conservative People's Advocate  
political action group and most of California Republican members of 
Congress, who say they fear Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and a 
Democratic-controlled Legislature will draw congressional and 
legislative boundaries to help their party and hurt Republicans.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: `Romance' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	If it's possible to make a boring film about sex, ``Romance'' is  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Tedious and utterly joyless, ``Romance'' is the so-called  
provocative tale of a young French woman's quest for sexual 
independence. Actually, it's a series of graphic encounters 
connected by our shallow heroine's musings on genitalia. 
</P>
<P>
	Caroline Ducey plays Marie -- elementary school teacher by day,  
naughty nymph by night. Marie is trapped in a passionless 
relationship with pretty-boy male model Paul (Sagamore Stevenin), 
but she's too madly in love with him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	And who could blame her? When he's not looking pouty in a  
toreador costume for a photo shoot, he's reading Bukowski while 
dining alone at a sushi bar. This guy is deep. 
</P>
<P>
	Feeling frustrated in the middle of the night, Marie gets out of  
bed, gets dressed and begins her search for intimacy, logically 
enough, at a bar. There she meets Paolo (Rocco Siffredi, Italy's 
most famous porn star), who is equally eager for a fling. Paolo is 
kind and attentive to her, and freakishly well-endowed. She uses 
him and pushes him away. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, she hooks up with Robert (Francois Berland), her boss at  
school who claims he's a ``sexologist'' and has bedded 10,000 
women. He's not nearly as attractive as Paolo, but he has a bevy of 
bondage equipment. This intrigues Marie. However, it forces the 
audience to suffer through a lengthy scene in which he ties her up, 
half naked, in elaborate knots using very long pieces of white 
rope. As she peers around at the predicament she's gotten herself 
into, she looks neither aroused nor frightened. She looks bored. We 
are, too. 
</P>
<P>
	There is one funny moment, though, when Robert takes his  
sadomasochistic game too far and makes Marie cry. In an effort to 
console her, he strokes her hair and promises, ``I can tie you up 
less severely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marie later gets raped in a stairwell, which she finds  
liberating. ``When he wants an evening without me, I make the best 
of it,'' she rationalizes. This is not philosophical -- it's 
disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
	A scene in which Marie visits the gynecologist is about as  
erotic as her sexual encounters. She finds bitter pleasure in the 
fact that, on this particular day, her doctor has a group of male 
interns with him, who pull on rubber gloves and take turns probing 
her. For Marie, this is almost like group sex -- another step in her 
sick journey. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing about this film is arousing. The sex is intentionally  
clinical and mechanical, which is supposed to make it edgy and 
arty. Instead, the acts are just plain dull. 
</P>
<P>
	What's worse is the incessant banter in Marie's head. She  
obsesses over why her boyfriend won't touch her, the size of men's 
organs, the size of her own, the intricacies of foreplay. Can't 
this woman think about anything else? 
</P>
<P>
	It's impossible to care about her or any of these people, mostly  
because writer-director Catherine Breillat tells us little about 
them beyond their sexual quirks. We never even learn Marie's name 
until the closing credits roll. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's use of color is interesting, though. Paul's pad is  
full of sleek modern furniture and decorated all in white -- the 
sheets, the curtains, the kitchen table, even his cat -- to reflect 
his lack of passion. By contrast, the sexologist's babe lair is 
full of dark wood and rich earth tones. He seems to own just one 
shirt -- we see him repeatedly in a red button-down. And as Marie 
sinks deeper into her relationship with him, she discards her 
neutral-colored, conservative attire for an off-the-shoulder red 
gown. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the film's promotional materials, Marie's quest  
``eventually leads to her fulfillment.'' If only the audience had 
gotten so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Romance,'' a Trimark Pictures release, is not rated but  
contains strong language and graphic sexual situations. It is in 
French with English subtitles and runs 95 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Killer Gets Stay of Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court has issued a  
stay of execution for a child rapist and murderer who was scheduled 
to become the first person executed by Tennessee in 39 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Glen Coe was scheduled to receive a lethal injection next  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Martin, one of Coe's public defenders, said he was  
relieved but not surprised by the stay, issued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The surprise would have been if they denied it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled Coe should have more time to ask the U.S.  
Supreme Court to reconsider a request to hear an appeal of his 1981 
conviction for killing an 8-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Coe, 43, said that in 1979, he kidnapped Cary Ann Medlin near  
her home, raped and sodomized her, then choked her and stabbed her 
in the throat with a pocket knife. The former auto mechanic told an 
FBI agent that he became enraged when the girl kept saying, ``Jesus 
loves you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coe recanted before his 1981 trial and his lawyers used an  
insanity defense. The jury took an hour to convict him. 
</P>
<P>
	Coe's lawyers have argued that there was no scientific evidence  
linking him to the crime, that the confession was unreliable and 
that evidence pointing to another man had been hidden or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Coe's conviction was set aside by a federal judge who  
said the jury was not given proper guidance. But a federal appeals 
court reinstated the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee is the only Southern state that hasn't executed anyone  
since the high court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The 
state has 99 men and two women on death row.

<HEADLINE> CBS Airs Columbine Chaos Snippets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- CBS aired choppy snippets of videotape  
Tuesday that showed for the first time how chaos erupted in the 
Columbine High School cafeteria when two teen-age gunmen opened 
fire last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The grainy video, taken from school surveillance cameras and  
recorded by an Albuquerque station during a law enforcement 
seminar, outraged Colorado authorities, who never authorized the 
release of the footage and asked stations to stop showing it. 
</P>
<P>
	The silent tape begins with a scene of bustling students around  
lunchtime, then shows a bomb exploding. Students scatter and 
collide as they duck under tables in a frantic effort to evade 
bombs and gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	Seconds later, a gunman appears, brandishing a weapon.  
Authorities said no bodies are seen in the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	The videotape had been kept in the hands of school and sheriff's  
authorities in Colorado until affiliate KRQE-TV obtained the 
snippet by recording it while it was aired at a training seminar 
aimed at helping school officials prepare for bomb threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Salamone, news director for the Albquerque affiliate, said  
the tape was in the public domain and said pulling it off the air 
would be unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
	KRQE aired about 40 seconds of the nearly two minute tape on  
Monday newscasts. CBS ran a shorter version nationally Tuesday, as 
did other CBS affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was certainly our editorial judgment to run it. We think it  
has news value,'' said Kim Akhtar, spokeswoman for ``CBS Evening 
News.'' She said the tape was carefully edited and didn't show 
graphic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver CBS affiliate KCNC-TV chose not to run the videotape on  
its own newscast, but showed the footage when ``CBS Evening News'' 
aired in that market. 
</P>
<P>
	``After weighing the journalistic merits of the tape, we have  
decided not to air it on our local broadcasts,'' anchorman Bill 
Stuart of KCNC-TV told viewers of the 5 p.m. newscast. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials tried unsuccessfully to stop the tape from  
being broadcast, said Barbara Monseu, the school district 
administrator in Jefferson County, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bad thing is for the victims' families,'' said Jefferson  
County, Colo., sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said. ``They are 
being notified as we speak that some stations have chosen to air 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Student gunmen Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, killed 12  
students and a teacher, then took their own lives. At least 23 
others were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Springs, Colo., affiliate, KKTV-TV, decided to run  
the tape during its 4:30 p.m., 5:30 p.m., and 10 p.m. broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt it was important to allow viewers to make the decision  
themselves whether to watch,'' news director Brian Rackham said. 
``It is not up to us to prevent them from watching it.''

	Vajpayee Sworn In As Indian PM  
</P>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was  
sworn in Wednesday as India's leader for the third time amid 
political upheaval in neighboring Pakistan, where a military coup 
may further complicate relations between the two rivals. Vajpayee's 
government fell in April when a southern politician withdrew her 
party's 18 seats from the coalition and Vajpayee lost a confidence 
motion by one vote. No other group was able to form a government 
and Vajpayee remained in charge of a caretaker government while 
elections were held. Vajpayee had said that one of the first tasks 
of his new government would be to restart peace talks that were 
disrupted by recent fighting in Kashmir, which has been the cause 
of two of the three wars between Pakistan and India. 

</P>
<P>
	Coup Throws Pakistan Into Chaos  
</P>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- A military coup has thrown Pakistan  
into political disarray just one year after it exploded a nuclear 
device and months after a conflict with India nearly erupted into a 
full-fledged war. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and most of his 
government ministers were under apparent house arrest, with 
soldiers surrounding their homes refusing to let anyone in or out. 
Army Chief Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf spoke briefly on national 
television urging calm and saying the military had no choice but to 
take over. Western diplomats say it was Musharraf who orchestrated 
the takeover of Indian territory in Kashmir this summer, provoking 
a bitter border dispute that many feared would escalate into an 
all-out war. 

</P>
<P>
	Test Ban Agreement Remains Elusive  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While bipartisan support is building in the  
Senate to delay a nuclear test ban vote, finding a graceful exit 
from near-certain defeat of the pact remains elusive. A small group 
of conservatives continues to threaten to block any effort at 
meeting President Clinton's request that the vote on the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty be postponed. Unless a deal can be 
reached, a showdown vote on the pact will occur late today. Clinton 
and other supporters concede they are far short of the 67 needed 
for ratification if all 100 senators vote. Senate Minority Leader 
Tom Daschle, D-S.D., offered a pledge to Republicans on Tuesday 
that he would not seek to reschedule a vote on the treaty before a 
new president and new Congress is sworn in in 2001 ``barring 
extraordinary circumstances.'' 

</P>
<P>
	U.S., China Plan High-Level Talks  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Top-level U.S. negotiators will head to Beijing  
later this month to try again to reach an agreement to lower 
China's trade barriers to American products, a prerequisite to U.S. 
endorsement of that nation's bid for membership in the World Trade 
Organization. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Tuesday he 
will lead a delegation of top economic policy-makers from a number 
of Cabinet agencies. The talks are set to begin Oct. 25. Once a 
deal is struck, the United States has said it will drop its 
objections to China's entry into the 134-member WTO, the 
international group that sets rules for world trade.

	Basketball Great Chamberlain Dead At 63  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Basketball Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain was  
found dead Tuesday in his Bel-Air home. He was 63 years old. 
Authorities said there were signs that Chamberlain might have had a 
heart attack. Sy Goldberg, Chamberlain's agent, said he had been 
hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat in 1992, and was on 
medication. ``Wilt the Stilt'' played from 1959 to 1973 for the 
Philadelphia (later the San Francisco) Warriors, the Philadelphia 
76ers and the Lakers. He averaged 30.1 points per game. 

</P>

	U.S. Rescue Planes Head to S.Pole  
</P>
<P>
	CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) -- After a 24-hour delay caused by  
bad weather, two U.S. military cargo planes departed for Antarctica 
Wednesday to prepare to rescue a doctor at the South Pole who has a 
lump in her breast. Two Air National Guard Hercules LC-130 cargo 
planes set out for McMurdo base on the northern coast of Antarctica 
after high winds and swirling snow eased on the frigid continent. 
The 1,975-mile flight was expected to take about eight hours, 
putting the planes into McMurdo late Wednesday afternoon New 
Zealand time (1 a.m. Wednesday EDT).

	Alabama Rejects Lottery  
</P>

	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama voters soundly rejected the  
governor's appeal for a lottery Tuesday, heeding the warnings of 
ministers over arguments that the revenue would be vital to 
improving the state's lagging schools. With 94 percent of precincts 
reporting, 54 percent had voted against the lottery, and 46 percent 
were for it. The lottery was once thought to be a sure bet to be 
approved, but it came under fire from church groups who said it 
would exploit the poor.

York, the Dow ended down 231.12 at 10,417.06.

<HEADLINE> Heisman Trophy Is Now Up for Grabs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Hours before Florida State risked its No. 1 ranking against  
Miami, a car pulled out of the parking lot of a Tallahassee hotel 
with a message painted on the rear window: 
</P>
<P>
	``Hilfiger or Heisman? U make the call.''  
</P>
<P>
	Less than a week ago, the call was simple: Peter Warrick, the  
Seminoles' sensational wide receiver, was the clear favorite to win 
the Heisman Trophy, college football's grandest individual prize. 
</P>
<P>
	The choice is not so easy anymore. Warrick was suspended  
indefinitely last week following his arrest for felony theft -- 
underpaying for designer clothes at a Tallahassee department store. 
He missed Florida State's 31-21 win over Miami, and is expected to 
sit out Saturday's game against Wake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	And as he waits for his lawyer to sort out his legal mess,  
Warrick's Heisman chances have all but slipped away. 
</P>
<P>
	A sampling of several dozen Heisman voters nationwide indicate  
Warrick has little or no chance to win the award presented by New 
York's Downtown Athletic Club on Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``Peter Warrick is out of it, in my mind,'' voter Steve Kirk of  
the Birmingham News said. ``And not because of the moral issues. He 
missed a big game and there's only 11 of them. You can't miss a big 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Bracken, sports editor of the Centre (Pa.) Daily Times, said  
he would have a tough time voting for Warrick because, ``you want 
that guy standing up there getting that trophy to be somebody that 
can be looked up at and admired and a youngster can say, `I want to 
be like him.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick may be the nation's best player whether he misses one,  
two or more games, but Heisman voter Bruce Hooley of The 
(Cleveland) Plain Dealer adds, ``I also think the Heisman stands 
for something more than what he stood for at Dillard's (department 
store).'' 
</P>
<P>
	By winning the Heisman, a player is guaranteed lifelong  
recognition by football fans everywhere. Now, Warrick is likely to 
be remembered as the first player to lose it because of his 
misadventures in a mall. 
</P>
<P>
	With Warrick on the sideline, the leading Heisman contender  
looks to be Georgia Tech's Joe Hamilton, the nation's top-rated 
passer with 1,347 yards and 12 touchdowns. He's also run for 321 
yards and six TDs for the eighth-ranked Yellow Jackets, whose only 
loss came against Warrick and the Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
	Also moving up on voters' ballots is Alabama's Shaun Alexander,  
who averages 203.6 all-purpose yards -- second in the nation -- and 
has 14 TDs. Others still being considered by the 921 Heisman voters 
are Purdue quarterback Drew Brees, Wisconsin running back Ron Dayne 
and Warrick's teammate, quarterback Chris Weinke. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone seems to think Warrick being out has automatically  
given the award to Joe Hamilton,'' Heisman voter Andrew Bagnato of 
The Chicago Tribune said, ``but I don't think that's a given just 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vinny Testaverde, the 1986 Heisman winner from Miami now with  
the New York Jets, has reserved judgment on Warrick, but says, ``if 
it's true, I'm sure it will hurt him, but if it's not true he's 
right up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick may be the first to lose the Heisman because of felony  
theft -- Florida State policy calls for an automatic suspension if 
an athlete is charged with a felony -- but at least one player has 
won the award without playing every game. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, Texas A&AMP;M's John David Crow missed three games with an  
injury and won by playing in just seven games. He ran for 562 yards 
and six TDs, threw for five scores, caught two TD passes and had 
five interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Warrick's out of it, but he's got to come back  
and miss only two games.'' Tony Barnhart of the Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution said. ``I think that's the magic number. The 
fact that he's apologized, and if he plays well, I think enough 
Heisman voters will give him a second chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Says Lee Barfknecht of the Omaha World-Herald: ``I've suspended  
Warrick from my ballot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So has Bob Smizik of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: ``I will not  
vote for Peter Warrick, even if he is cleared of criminal charges 
and returns to play. I thought what they did last week by putting 
him on TV, having him address the team and be on the sidelines, 
they were trying to make a celebrity of him, and I thought it was 
an outrage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Heisman rules, Warrick remains a candidate, but William J.  
Dockery, president of the award, said the receiver would become 
ineligible if convicted of a felony. Should he win the Heisman and 
then be convicted, the award can be taken away. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, a day after the Seminoles held off the Hurricanes,  
Bowden said he, too, doubts Warrick has a Heisman hope left. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he comes back I would tell him to take a very back seat,  
a very back seat,'' Bowden said. ``You go out and play the best you 
can play, and don't even think about the Heisman. That's probably 
blown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A week before the Heisman winner is announced, the Downtown  
Athletic Club invites the top four or five vote-getters at the time 
to attend the ceremony. Warrick may or may not be among them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that now that he finally has his ensemble to  
wear to the Heisman announcement,'' Tom Luicci, a Heisman voter 
from The (Newark) Star Ledger said, ``that he may not be invited.''

<HEADLINE> Red Wings' Krupp Files Grievance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Red Wings defenseman Uwe Krupp, suspended for  
failing to turn over his medical records, has filed a grievance 
against the club over the $12.3 million remaining on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Krupp was suspended without pay in August for failing to turn  
over medical records of back problems that kept him sidelined for 
much of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Krupp, whose injury has put his career in  
jeopardy, last month agreed to release the records but remains 
suspended because the Red Wings found out he may have gone 
dogsledding while recovering from a herniated disc injury. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Krupp complained the persisting pain kept him  
from returning to the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL Players Association spokesman Devin Smith did not  
immediately say when Krupp filed the grievance. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Wings general manager Ken Holland did not immediately return  
phone calls this morning seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Krupp's attorney George Googasian accused the Wings of simply  
``trying to figure out a way out of the contract.''

	According to the standard NHL contract, a player cannot  
participate in any organized sport without written consent from his 
team. Holland said Krupp did not request or receive permission from 
the Red Wings to race sled dogs when he was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Googasian said it was common knowledge in the Wings'  
organization that Krupp was racing sled dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Krupp signed a four-year contract as a free agent in June 1998  
for $16.4 million. Krupp scored three goals in 22 games last season 
before a herniated disc ended his season in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Krupp was listed as the driver in five races between Jan. 2 and  
Feb. 28, prompting the Red Wings to investigate whether such 
competitions violated terms of Krupp's contract or might have 
exacerbated his condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd been doing it right along,'' Googasian said. The Wings  
``are suggesting this was a surprise to them, which it wasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grievances filed in the NHL generally are heard by an  
arbitrator. No hearing has been scheduled, according to a league 
spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Raytheon Slashes Expected Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Raytheon Co. said increased competition in the  
defense industry is cutting into its bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lexington-based defense contractor on Tuesday slashed its  
earnings projections for 1999 and 2000. The company's shares 
dropped more than 40 percent on the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Blaming lower than-expected revenue, Raytheon said its 1999  
earnings per share will be between $1.40 and $1.50 per share -- 
including a $638 million pretax charge for restructuring and 
project problems. Excluding the charges, this year's earnings per 
share will be $2.70 to $2.80, well below Wall Street expectations 
of $3.56 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	For 2000, the company estimates earnings per share will be in  
the range of $2.10 to $2.25, compared to estimates of $3.91 per 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon chairman and chief executive Daniel Burnham said the  
company lowered its revenue estimates by $600 million, to $20 
billion, due to increased competition and because it took longer 
for buyers to decide to buy defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition is lowering profit margins at Raytheon Systems Co.,  
its defense and electronics unit, from 15 percent to 12 percent, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What surprised us and shouldn't have,'' Burnham said, ``is how  
the business has shifted.'' He said aggressive bidding eliminated 
much of the company's gains from consolidation after its recent 
acquisitions, including General Motor's Hughes Defense Electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnham also defended Raytheon against a Wall Street Journal  
report Tuesday that the company is behind schedule or over budget 
on at least a dozen fixed-price Pentagon orders, including orders 
for Tomahawk cruise missiles and reconnaissance aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there are contract problems with only eight projects,  
resulting in $320 million in charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is not taking a charge on the Tomahawk, the RC-135  
or the Javelin program, none of which have cost problems, Burnham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pentagon spokesman said Tuesday that Raytheon should not be  
singled out for having problems in meeting conditions of its 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not consider Raytheon a troubled contractor,'' Pentagon  
spokesman Ken Bacon said. ``Like all defense contractors, there are 
some contracts that are not always on schedule or within cost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An industry analyst said Raytheon, like the rest of the defense  
industry, is seeing lower earnings growth because cost savings due 
to consolidations have already been realized. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Raytheon is going through is perfectly natural,'' said  
Jon Kutler, an analyst with Quarterdeck Investment Partners. 
``Historically it's been one of the best managed defense aerospace 
companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon, he said, is extremely well-positioned in the growth  
areas of electronics and missiles. ``Investors who truly understand 
this industry will look past this and at the very attractive 
opportunities handed Raytheon,'' Kutler added. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon is predicting annual revenue growth for 1999 and 2000  
of 3 percent, at least half of its earlier projections of 6 percent 
to 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Restructuring charges account for another $274 million and $74  
million in special charges will be taken, primarily to write down 
company assets to fair-market value such as the company's wireless 
networking inventory and its investment in troubled satellite 
mobile phone company Iridium. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon disclosed last month it was having difficulties in its  
defense electronics and construction units that would result in a 
third-quarter pretax charge of between $350 million and $450 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnham said there will be some more layoffs of the company's  
108,000 employees worldwide, though how many more is unclear. At 
least 2,380 positions will be eliminated, with possibly a couple 
hundred more, largely in California and New York state with some in 
Texas.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Profit Beats Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the largest brokerage firm  
in the United States, reported strong third-quarter earnings 
Tuesday of $572 million, easily beating analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's profits represent earnings of $1.34 a share, a  
nickel more than the $1.29 a share analysts had predicted, 
according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third quarter of 1998, Merrill Lynch reported a loss of  
$173 million, or 48 cents a share, due to a $430 million pretax 
write-off of costs related to staff reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch cited record revenues in both global stock  
underwriting and investment banking, which includes mergers and 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Total third-quarter revenues were $5.27 billion, up from $3.85  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investment banking revenues and asset management and portfolio  
service fees set records, and our global debt and equity businesses 
posted solid trading results despite a more difficult 
environment,'' said Merrill Lynch chairman David Komansky. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, Merrill Lynch posted earnings  
of $1.9 billion, or $4.36 a share, up from $900 million, or $2.14 a 
share, in 1998, when taking into account the $430 million loss 
related to layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine month revenues came to $16 billion, compared to $13.5  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Merrill Lynch fell 75 cents to $67 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Watch Calendar Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- There's more than parochial pride at  
stake in this year's political calendar fight, with presidential 
candidates like Al Gore and John McCain having a big stake in the 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential campaigns are largely staying out of the debate  
over the date of the leadoff caucuses and primary, fearing damage 
to local feelings. But that hasn't stopped them from trying to 
assess the impact of the fight between Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is the close proximity of the two contests. Iowa's  
caucuses are now set for Jan. 31. New Hampshire's primary is set 
for the following day, Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	If the schedule holds, there's no time for a ``bump'' from a  
strong showing to effect voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Political activists say McCain, an Arizona senator, has the most  
to gain, along with Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey senator who 
is challenging Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
Gore needs some distance between Iowa's leadoff caucuses and New 
Hampshire's opening primary, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bradley campaign would be the big beneficiary,'' said  
veteran activist Phil Roeder, a former communications director for 
the Iowa Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee said Tuesday that  
it was surveying members on whether New Hampshire and Iowa should 
keep their first-in-the-nation ritual when it comes to picking 
presidential candidates. The results are nonbinding but could be 
used to propose a new nominating process at an RNC meeting in San 
Jose, Calif., in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey is part of an effort to stop states from holding  
increasingly earlier presidential primaries. Previous incentives, 
like giving states more delegates if they push back their primary, 
have failed. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire and Iowa have been roiling around ever since New  
Hampshire set its primary date. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is ahead in Iowa, where his institutional strength in a  
caucus state gives him a clear edge. Bradley is even or maybe ahead 
in New Hampshire, depending on which poll is used. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's backers say the vice president needs a lift from Iowa  
because the recent poll news from New Hampshire has been 
unfavorable. Nothing could be better for his campaign than a strong 
early win giving him eight days of favorable attention before the 
next round of voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally Iowa's caucuses and New Hampshire's primary are  
eight days apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are an underdog, you probably would want a surprise of  
any kind to have chance to have an effect,'' said activist Jeff 
Link, who ran Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin's last campaign. ``One 
could argue that since the vice president could be considered an 
underdog, he would want the eight days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, on the other hand, has a strong interest in moving  
directly to New Hampshire, where his strength with independent 
voters has boosted his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	If the two events are a day apart, Gore would gain nothing,  
Roeder said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Assuming Gore wins, he'd have no time to get any mileage out  
of it,'' said Roeder. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has opted not to compete in Iowa's caucuses, and the last  
thing he needs is another candidate grabbing the spotlight with a 
strong Iowa showing, making it tougher for candidates like McCain 
to get attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes and Gary Bauer are working hard to coalesce social  
and religious conservatives in hope of emerging as the conservative 
alternative to front-runner Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan got some steam in the last campaign with a strong  
Iowa showing followed by a win in New Hampshire. Buchanan has said 
he is leaning toward abandoning his 2000 Republican bid to seek the 
Reform Party's presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody chasing George W. Bush would welcome and does welcome  
the effort to have an eight-day break,'' said Steve Roberts, a Des 
Moines lawyer who sits on the Republican National Committee and 
backs Elizabeth Dole. ``The only possibility to have any chance at 
all is to emerge as an alternative to him in Iowa and try to parlay 
that into something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roeder said the calendar matters less on the GOP side because  
the contest isn't close. 
</P>
<P>
	``That thing is so over,'' said Roeder. ``They may as well have  
their caucuses tomorrow and New Hampshire the day after.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack has said he's willing to look at a  
new caucus date. While his wife has endorsed Gore, Vilsack has 
argued he'll remain neutral. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't heard anybody doing any lobbying to stay or to  
move,'' said spokesman Joe Shannahan, a long-time Gore supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I have to answer that question?'' said Gore's Iowa campaign  
manager, Steve Hildebrand, when asked the campaign's view on the 
caucus date. 
</P>
<P>
	Monte Shaw, who runs Dole's Iowa campaign, said staffers just  
want an answer -- and soon. ``If you don't have your ducks in a row 
before Christmas, really before Thanksgiving, you don't have a 
chance,'' Shaw said.

<HEADLINE> FSU Halfway Home in Title Pursuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- In its pursuit of an unprecedented  
wire-to-wire run to a national championship, top-ranked Florida 
State is halfway there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we'd be pretty darned good and we are,'' coach  
Bobby Bowden said. ``(And) we're getting better each week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While its record is perfect at 6-0, Florida State's season  
hasn't gone as smoothly. Injuries and suspensions have plagued the 
Seminoles from the beginning of the season. They've already lost 
five starters on offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting fullback William McCray, tight end Nick Franklin and  
offensive tackle Ross Brannon were lost for the year with injuries 
and legal trouble has taken receivers Laveranues Coles and Peter 
Warrick off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was kicked off the team last week and Warrick was  
suspended after they were arrested on a felony grand theft charge 
for receiving more than $400 worth of designer clothing for 
slightly more than $20. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick's future is in the hands of the judicial system as  
Florida State rules don't allow athletes charged with a felony to 
represent the university. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's out of our hands,'' Bowden said. ``We're just waiting to  
see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Florida State proved in its 31-21 victory Saturday over  
Miami that's it still got enough horsepower to win big games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've showed we can play with or without Peter,'' said Bowden,  
who won his only national title in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Junior quarterback Chris Weinke came up with the strongest  
performance of his career, passing for 332 yards -- to 11 receivers 
-- and two touchdowns against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off a serious neck injury and four-hour spinal operation  
last November, Weinke has completed 62.8 percent of his passes for 
1,627 yards and 13 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	With Warrick and Coles gone, senior receiver Ron Dugans' is the  
only player with more than seven receptions going into Saturday's 
homecoming game against Wake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	In their first six games, the Seminoles have been tested just  
twice. They outscored Georgia Tech 41-35 in early September and 
then shut down Miami for the final 40 minutes last week. 
</P>
<P>
	In both games, Florida State's secondary -- particularly senior  
cornerback Mario Edwards -- struggled. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like we were playing cautious,'' Florida State  
defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews said. ``You can't play defense 
like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the defense has allowed an uncharacteristic 17.8 points  
and 330 yards a game, the Florida State offense has been remarkably 
consistent, averaging 41.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
	As in the past, it looks like Florida State's date with Florida  
will help determine who plays in the Sugar Bowl for the national 
title. Until then, Florida State must get past four ACC opponents 
as it bids for an unprecedented eighth straight conference title. 
</P>
<P>
	No team has gone wire-to-wire ranked No. 1 in The Associated  
Press' annual poll, but two teams -- Nebraska in 1983 and Florida 
State in 1993 -- came close. 
</P>
<P>
	The '83 Cornhuskers went 12-0 before losing to Miami 31-30 in  
the Orange Bowl. The '93 Seminoles were No. 1 for most of the 
season, lost to Notre Dame but beat Nebraska in the Orange Bowl to 
claim the title. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1999 preseason poll, Florida State received 48  
first-place votes and 1,720 points from the 70 sportswriters and 
broadcasters on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the Seminoles are No. 1 with their support increasing  
on a weekly basis, now holding 63 first-place votes and 1,743 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the hunt, like a few are'' said Bowden, who is going  
for his 299th career victory Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Big Farms Benefit From Farm Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of the largest, most profitable farms in  
the country would be among the biggest beneficiaries of Congress' 
$8.7 billion agricultural assistance package because it loosens 
rules that were intended to target government payments to 
family-size operations. 
</P>
<P>
	An individual farm could claim up to $460,000 in subsidies a  
year -- double the current restriction -- and the legislation creates 
a new way for producers to get around even that limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The new limit would be high enough to cover a giant, 6,000-acre  
corn farm in the Midwest or a 3,000-acre cotton operation in Texas. 
The average farm in the country is less than 500 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a terrible idea,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. ``I  
just think that's a sorry state of affairs when we're short of 
money to help family farms that you have some large producers 
getting $460,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But farm organizations that pushed for raising the subsidy  
limits say low commodity prices are hurting big farms as well as 
small ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Producers need to get their income from the marketplace (but)  
the marketplace simply isn't providing it right now,'' said Steve 
Pringle, legislative director of the Texas Farm Bureau, a farmer 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is expected to give final approval to the aid package  
this week and send it to President Clinton for his signature. The 
White House has made no threat of a veto. The House passed the 
legislation Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The payment limits apply to two different programs: crop  
subsidies that vary according to fluctuations in commodity prices; 
and annual ``market transition'' payments, which were guaranteed to 
producers under the 1996 farm law. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers are technically allowed to receive no more than $75,000  
in crop subsidies and $40,000 a year in market transition payments 
under current law. But many farms, especially in the South, legally 
claim twice that much because they are divided into different 
entities. A husband and a wife, for example, can claim separate 
payments on the same farm. 
</P>
<P>
	The aid package would double those caps, so farms could get up  
to $300,000 in crop subsidies and $160,000 in market transition 
payments this year. 
</P>
<P>
	With commodity prices at the levels they are, a cotton operation  
in west Texas would reach the $75,000 cap on crop subsidies at 
about 700 acres, while a corn grower in Iowa would reach it at 
about 1,500 acres. The subsidies vary by commodity and region. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, about 550 farmers nationwide claimed the maximum  
amount in crop subsidies, USDA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another provision in the legislation would allow farms to avoid  
the restriction on crop subsidies entirely. It would permit the 
Agriculture Department to issue certificates redeemable for 
government-held commodities in lieu of cash. The certificates would 
not be subject to any payment limitations. 
</P>
<P>
	The certificate program was written into the bill by Sen. Thad  
Cochran, R-Miss., chairman of the Senate Appropriations 
agricultural subcommittee, at the request of cotton producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates of the certificate program say farmers can already  
avoid the payment limits on crop subsidies by taking out a 
government loan on their crop and then forfeiting the cotton or 
grain to the government in lieu of repayment. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the looser payment rules fear they will encourage the  
consolidation of farms and hasten the demise of smaller-scale 
operations. Big farms will use the extra cash to buy up land from 
the neighbors, driving up land prices in the process, said Chuck 
Hassebrook, program director of the Center for Rural Affairs in 
Walthill, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is the purpose of these farm programs? Is it to help very  
wealthy, very large landowners get bigger and get richer? If it is 
then this all makes sense. ... I don't think that's what the public 
supports,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Limits on subsidies do ``retard the movement to larger farms and  
fewer farms,'' but raising them is unlikely to have much effect on 
farmers' expansion plans unless producers are convinced Congress 
won't lower them later, said Don Ethridge, an agricultural 
economist at Texas Tech University. 
</P>
<P>
	Pringle of the Texas Farm Bureau said it will take more than the  
prospect of bigger subsidies payments to get most farmers to buy or 
rent more land. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's face it. People in agriculture aren't going to expand  
their operations with prices where they are. The govenment payments 
aren't a good enough incentive,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Covenant House Founder Dies at 72 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Rev. Bruce Ritter, who founded the Covenant  
House shelters for homeless teen-agers but was forced to resign 
after several young men accused him of seducing them, is dead at 
72. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roman Catholic priest had suffered from Hodgkin's disease,  
cancer of the lymph nodes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritter had denied the accusations of sexual misconduct and was  
never formally charged. He resigned from Covenant House in 1990; in 
August 1991, Ritter left the Franciscan order. He lived the rest of 
his life out of the public eye. 
</P>
<P>
	He died Thursday, according to funeral director Benjamin L.  
Meyers, who also reported that a private memorial Mass was held at 
Ritter's farmhouse near Decatur, about 60 miles west of Albany, on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak, Covenant House was the largest private child care  
agency in the country. It sheltered 2,000 homeless teen-agers a 
night and took in $92 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	It operated shelters in six U.S. cities and in Toronto, Canada,  
four orphanages in Central America. Ritter was visited by Mother 
Teresa; President Reagan hailed him as a hero in his 1984 State of 
the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	Covenant House started in 1969, when Ritter was living in a  
shabby apartment in the East Village of Manhattan, an area teeming 
with flower children and drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Six homeless teen-agers asked if they could stay in his living  
room during a snowstorm. ``I didn't have the guts to throw them out 
so I kept them,'' he once said. 
</P>
<P>
	Word spread and he was soon deluged with runaways. He took over  
other apartments and enlisted college student volunteers to help. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1972, hundreds of youngsters were seeking shelter in Ritter's  
informal group homes. He obtained a license to run a child care 
agency and opened the Under 21 crisis shelter in Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety-five percent of Covenant House's money came from private  
donations, most of them made in response to mass mailings of 
letters in which Ritter graphically described the runaways' 
ordeals. 
</P>
<P>
	He once described his mission as helping children ``find a way  
out of the gutters and brothels and strip joints where their young 
bodies are in demand as objects of pleasure for lustful adults.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal that led to his downfall broke in December 1989,  
when Kevin Kite, a former prostitute, said he had had an affair 
with Ritter. Ritter denied it, but several other young men came 
forward with similar stories, saying he seduced them after they 
sought his help. 
</P>
<P>
	Questionable financial transactions surfaced. In February 1990,  
the Franciscans ordered Ritter to take a leave of absence. Later 
that month, he resigned from Covenant House. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report that August, the Covenant House board said it found  
extensive evidence of sexual misconduct, but no severe financial 
impropriety. The Manhattan district attorney decided not to 
prosecute Ritter. 
</P>
<P>
	Long before the scandal, Ritter had been the target of  
criticism. Covenant House got a reputation for being so large and 
unstructured that it merely gave homeless kids the food and bed 
rest they needed to go on living their dangerous lives. Ritter 
himself admitted that two-thirds of those who took shelter at 
Covenant House wound up back on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you can do is care about them, feed and clothe them and  
then bury them when they die,'' he once said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of the scandals, contributions plunged. The  
Covenant House governance was restructured, and the organization 
rebounded after it was placed under the leadership of Sister Mary 
Rose McGeady, a Catholic Charities official appointed to replace 
Ritter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritter was born Feb. 25, 1927, in Trenton, N.J., one of five  
children. He said his interest in the ministry began while serving 
in the U.S. Navy in 1945-46. In 1947, he began training for the 
priesthood at St. Francis Seminary on Staten Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritter spent a short time in a Trappist abbey in Kentucky but  
decided to return to the Franciscans. He was ordained in Rome in 
1956.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed lower Tuesday, with  
telecommunications shares dragging down Milan's market and the 
French market hurt by the performance of the specialty chemicals 
group Rhodia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris CAC-40 index closed down 1.4 percent to 4,658.4 and  
Milan's MIBtel index fell 1.6 percent to 33,195, making them among 
the day's worst performing bourses. 
</P>
<P>
	London's FTSE 100 index of leading blue-chip shares fell 1  
percent, to close at 6,174.8, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index fell 1 
percent to 5,358.46, and Amsterdam's AEX index fell 0.7 percent to 
556.12. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 614 European companies fell 3.53  
points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 309.62. The Dow Jones Euro 
Stoxx Index, which tracks 310 companies in countries that joined 
the single currency, closed down 3.10 points at 324.65. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell 33.45 points to 3,756.44,  
while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed down 38.31 points at 3,737.20. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, Rhodia closed with a loss of euros 1.45, or 6.8  
percent, at euros 19.93, on expectations of a low price for its 
coming public offer. On Wednesday, the company will set the price 
for parent company Rhone-Poulenc's public offering of a 67.3 
percent stake. 
</P>
<P>
	In Milan, Olivetti lost 7 cents to euros 1.87; Tecnost, which  
owns 52 percent of Telecom Italia, fell 5 cents to euros 1.94; 
Telecom Italia fell 22 cents to euros 8.27; and Telecom Italia 
Mobile fell 12 cents to euros 5.48. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders pointed to concern about the outlook for interest rates,  
adding that even though Olivetti and Tecnost bonds have fixed 
rates, worries that any refinancing move could soon become more 
burdensome helped send their shares lower. 
</P>
<P>
	U.K. telecommunications stocks continued to outperform, with  
TeleWest Communications up 4.25 pence at 238.25 pence, and Energis 
up 31 pence at 1,856 pence.

<HEADLINE> CBS Ekes Out Nielsen Victory / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS and NBC fought to the wire over last  
television season's ratings championship, and it appears they will 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, buoyed by its two new legal dramas, won last week's Nielsen  
Media Research competition by one-tenth of a ratings point. For the 
three-week-old season, NBC is in the lead by the same whisker-thin 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
	With summer's end, viewers are returning to ``ER'' in droves.  
NBC's Thursday night medical drama was the most-watched show by a 
wide margin, with nearly 7 million more viewers than second-place 
``Friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Frasier'' finished third, Nielsen said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	For the week, CBS had a 9.1 rating and 15 share. NBC was second  
with a 9.0 rating and 15 share, ABC had an 8.1 rating and 13 share 
and Fox was at 6.1 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's new ``Judging Amy'' cracked the top 10, the network's  
highest-rated entertainment show after ``Touched By an Angel.'' 
CBS's other new legal drama, ``Family Law,'' finished a solid 18th 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Two shows with identical 4.9 ratings last week have far  
different outlooks. Fox's ``Harsh Realm,'' produced by Chris 
Carter, was a disappointing fourth in its time slot for its 
premiere. Meanwhile, the WB's ``Roswell'' was extremely promising 
in its debut, finishing as the network's most-watched show after 
``7th Heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WB had a 3.4 rating and 6 share for the week, UPN had a 2.7  
rating and 4 share and Pax TV had a 0.7 rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``NBC Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings race with  
a 7.2 rating and 15 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was second 
with a 7.0 rating and 15 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had 
a 6.3 rating and 13 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Oct. 4-10, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``ER,'' NBC, 19.5; ``Friends,'' NBC, 14.9; 
``Frasier,'' NBC, 14.7; ``NFL Monday Night Football: Buffalo at 
Miami,'' ABC, 14.0; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 12.9; ``Law and Order,'' 
NBC 12.5; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 12.2; ``Stark Raving Mad,'' NBC, 12.2; 
``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 11.5; ``Judging Amy,'' CBS, 11.4.

<HEADLINE> T-Bill Interest Rates Rise / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Tuesday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $9 billion in three-month bills at  
a discount rate of 4.780 percent, up from 4.730 percent last week. 
An additional $8 billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 
4.930 percent, up from 4.870 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since Aug. 30 when the  
bills sold for 4.875 percent. The six-month rate was the highest 
since Sept. 7 when the rate was 4.950. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.918 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,879.20 and 5.139 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,750.80. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose sharply to 
5.34 percent last week from 5.24 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Braves 4, Mets 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Leave it to Greg Maddux to bring pitching back to  
this postseason. And leave it to the Atlanta Braves to remind the 
New York Mets who's boss in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux shut down Mike Piazza and the Mets for seven innings and  
John Rocker sprinted from the bullpen to finish them off, giving 
the Braves a 4-2 victory Tuesday night in Game 1 of the NL 
Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	After two days in which baseball fans across the country saw  
Boston and Cleveland combine for 50 runs in two AL playoff games, 
Maddux and the Braves showed what really wins in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need three more games. We're on the right track so far,''  
Maddux said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux, Mike Remlinger and Rocker combined on a six-hitter as  
the Braves beat New York for the 10th time in 13 meetings this 
year. Atlanta, which sent the Mets into a late tailspin that almost 
cost them the wild-card spot, has defeated them in 14 of the last 
15 matchups at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's Greg Maddux. He doesn't have all those trophies because  
he's lucky,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. ``He did a great 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine was left without much else to say. Instead, all the  
verbal sparring between the teams leading up to the series took a 
backseat to dominant pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza returned to the lineup after missing the final two games  
of the first-round win over Arizona because of a swollen left 
thumb. He drove in the Mets' first run with a groundout and 
finished 0-for-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza did not hit the ball out of the infield. The Braves also  
stole three bases against the All-Star catcher -- he made a poor 
throw on one attempt and didn't even make a throw on another. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 44,172 -- it was 6,000 short of capacity, perhaps held  
down by an all-day rain that caused a four-minute delay at the 
start -- saw Atlanta win the opening game of the NLCS at home. The 
previous two years, the Braves lost Game 1 at home and eventually 
lost the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year since 1991, the team that won Game 1 went on to win  
the NLCS. Atlanta has been in every one of those best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better to win the first game,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox  
said. ``You like to win the first one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 will be Wednesday afternoon with Kevin Millwood, who  
pitched a one-hitter against Houston in the opening round, starting 
for the Braves against Kenny Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux, a four-time Cy Young winner and a nine-time Gold Glover,  
gave an all-around performance in improving to 10-9 lifetime in the 
postseason. He beat the team that got eight straight hits off him 
Sept. 29 at Shea Stadium, put down a perfect sacrifice bunt and 
made several nice fielding plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Weiss, making his first start since the last day of the  
regular season, had three hits and stole a base for the Braves. He 
doubled and scored on Gerald Williams' single for a 2-1 lead in the 
fifth and, after Eddie Perez homered in the sixth, added an RBI 
single in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did a great job against their lineup,'' Weiss said of  
Maddux. ``Our pitchers have handled them for the most part. That's 
the difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker got four outs for a save. As is his custom, he ran in to  
relieve and, with a runner on second, threw fastballs of 97 mph, 94 
and 97 to strike out John Olerud. 
</P>
<P>
	He allowed an unearned run in the ninth on Todd Pratt's two-out  
single. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, Rocker was one of the most vocal Atlanta players,  
wondering aloud how Valentine ``can say a word'' about the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams singled home the tiebreaking run in the fifth, lining a  
shot past charging shortstop Rey Ordonez. Later in the inning, 
losing pitcher Masato Yoshii was pulled. After leaving the dugout, 
he broke a bat and smashed a couple of chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez homered off Pat Mahomes in the sixth, right after Ordonez  
and second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo turned a nifty double play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves took a 1-0 lead after two batters. Williams singled  
up the middle on the first pitch and quickly tested Piazza, 
stealing well ahead of the catcher's one-hop throw to the wrong 
side of the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Bret Boone followed with an RBI single and when Chipper Jones  
walked, pitching coach Dave Wallace marched to the mound and Orel 
Hershiser began warming up. Yoshii settled down right away, 
retiring 12 of the next 13 batters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets missed a chance to score in the third after Yoshii  
missed a bunt on a suicide-squeeze play. After Yoshii grounded out 
to end the inning, he was so upset that Valentine had to settle 
down his pitcher -- talking to him in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Mets took the field, Valentine spoke with bench coach  
Bruce Benedict, filling in as the third-base coach while Cookie 
Rojas began his five-game suspension for shoving umpire Charlie 
Williams last weekend. New York remembered Rojas by hanging his 
jersey in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets made it 1-all in the fourth on Piazza's RBI grounder.  
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Braves first baseman Andres Galarraga, sidelined all season  
by cancer, threw out the first ball. ... Benedict last coached 
third base on a regular basis in 1996 under Valentine at Triple-A 
Norfolk. ... Braves first baseman Ryan Klesko tried to trap Roger 
Cedeno with the hidden-ball trick in the seventh. No luck. ... 
Cedeno made a superb diving catch on Boone's liner to right in the 
fifth. ... The Mets' streak of 110 straight innings without an 
error ended on left fielder Rickey Henderson's miscue in the fifth.

<HEADLINE>  China, Romania Are Gymnast Champs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIANJIN, China (AP) -- China easily won its fourth consecutive  
men's world gymnastics championship Tuesday, while Romania narrowly 
defended its women's title when Russia's Svetlana Khorkina fell on 
her final routine. 
</P>
<P>
	China, hoping to win its first men's Olympic gymnastics team  
gold medal, finished with 230.395 points to 228.145 for Russia, the 
1996 Olympic winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Belarus was third with 227.631, followed by Japan with 225.908,  
South Korea with 225.870 and the United States with 225.196. 
</P>
<P>
	In women's competition, newcomers Maria Olaru had a 38.749 and  
Andreea Raducan finished with a 38.567 to lead Romania, which 
scored a total of 153.527 points to Russia's 153.209. 
</P>
<P>
	China was third with 152.423 in a repeat of the finish order at  
the last World Championships in 1997. Ukraine was fourth with 
152.338, next year's Olympic host Australia was fifth with 150.932 
and the United States sixth with 150.213. 
</P>
<P>
	In Russia's last routine of the day, 1997 individual champion  
Khorkina was in a position to give her team the gold medal with a 
stellar routine. She already had scored the meet's best score so 
far, a 9.825 on the uneven bars, and a 9.800 in the floor 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	But she went off the balance beam on a back flip and scored just  
9.075, after Anna Kovaleva had left the Russian team in a perilous 
position by fumbling her balance beam routine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Romanians had started on the balance beam, and also ran into  
trouble, including a fall by 1997 individual silver medalist Simona 
Amanar. 
</P>
<P>
	But they bounced right back in the floor exercises, where their  
lowest score was a 9.700. Amanar scored 9.812 and Raducan, a 
16-year-old who seems to float through her routines, had 9.800. 
</P>
<P>
	The top two finishers of 1997 -- Khorkina and Amanar -- were  
performing at the same time at the end. Amanar closed with a 9.700 
on the uneven bars, and came out ninth among individuals with 
38.155. Khorkina was 11th with 37.956. 
</P>
<P>
	China had two of the top five individuals -- Ling Jie, third with  
38.418 including a 9.787 on the uneven bars, and Liu Xuan, fifth 
with 38.275, including a 9.775 on the bars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans had few mistakes, although Vanessa Atler performed  
a wobbly balance beam routine. But they didn't come up with the 
extra points needed to win a medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Elise Ray led the U.S. team with 38.187, eighth best among  
individuals, and national champion Kristen Maloney stood 14th with 
37.848. Ray's best scores were 9.725's on the bars and the floor 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams in the final were the top six from qualifying rounds  
earlier in the meet. Atler had saved the Americans a place in the 
finals with a 9.762 in the team's final routine, in the floor 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	Consistency and depth were the keys to the Chinese men's  
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Top scorer for China was Huang Xu, with 57.049. But with the  
exception of Lu Yufu's high-bar fumble, the Chinese had no major 
mistakes. Lu still finished eighth, with 56.823. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese men just kept piling up points while their rivals  
struggled. The Russians started poorly on the rings, but captured 
the silver with a strong final round on the pommel horse, where 
Alexei Nemov scored 9.750, Nikolay Krukov 9.737 and Alexei 
Bondarenko 9.725. 
</P>
<P>
	They will have a chance to defend their 1997 medals when  
individual competition starts Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	American Blaine Wilson stood ninth with 56.798, but his  
teammates suffered costly problems in the floor exercises.

<HEADLINE> San Fran Cart Seizure Plan Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Mayor Willie Brown has postponed his plan  
to have police seize shopping carts from street people, saying 
advocates for the homeless have overreacted and misrepresented his 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no sweep. There's no confiscation of goods and  
services of people,'' Brown said Tuesday. ``It's not anything near 
the hysteria that I have read and heard surrounding this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown didn't say what he would do next, and his office did not  
respond to requests for further comment on how long the 
postponement would last. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's plan would require police and other city workers to  
seize the carts and cite the homeless for possessing stolen 
property, while directing them to shelters and other services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mayor Brown wants to turn the city into Disneyland, which  
would be great if we lived in a fairyland, but we don't,'' said 
Judy Appel, staff attorney for the Coalition on Homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for giving up their modern-day pack mules, street  
people would get a couple of plastic bags and space in a city-run 
storage unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where are you going to carry 40 pounds of bedding? In a  
plastic bag?'' complained Reuben G. Madrigal, 33, one of several 
men lounging near a long row of overloaded carts on United Nations 
Plaza, where hundreds of homeless people gather each day. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was scheduled to be enforced Tuesday morning, but after  
a long weekend of complaints and a meeting with police officials, 
Brown decided to postpone the seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	Solving the city's seemingly intractable homeless problem was a  
top priority for Brown when he took office four years ago. An 
estimated 15,000 people are homeless in San Francisco, 10 times the 
number of shelter beds.

	Asked who owns the cart holding his bedding and belongings,  
Darrell Sophy, 50, shrugged. ``Safeway,'' he said. And, ``If it's 
theirs, they're entitled to get it back.''

	Of course, then he'd have to deposit his stuff somewhere else.

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S. Runs $1B Budget Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Congressional Budget Office estimated  
today that excluding Social Security, the government ran a $1 
billion surplus for the fiscal year just ended, the first time that 
has happened in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	If the projection holds up -- and final figures should be  
available later this month -- the development could have an 
important political impact on the fight between President Clinton 
and congressional Republicans over the new year's spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides have been insisting they will not tap into Social  
Security surpluses to pay for the spending bills, which would 
reverse what has been standard procedure for decades. Many 
analysts, plus many lawmakers speaking privately, believe that a 
paucity of other politically feasible savings make it likely Social 
Security money will again be spent. 
</P>
<P>
	But since the new estimates show they did not spend any Social  
Security funds in fiscal 1999, it could be politically harder for 
them to backtrack in fiscal 2000 and resume spending some of the 
pension system's surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending some of Social Security's surpluses has no effect on  
the program's benefits, since the system converts its cash 
surpluses into Treasury bills before the Treasury Department uses 
the cash for spending, reducing the national debt or other 
purposes. But in a bid to cast themselves as protecting the popular 
pension program, politicians have promised to not touch the 
surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget office, Congress' nonpartisan, official fiscal  
scorekeeper, cautioned that the actual surplus could differ by $1 
billion to $3 billion. But if there was a non-Social Security 
surplus last year, it would be the first since fiscal 1960, when 
that portion of the budget ran a $510 million surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Including Social Security, the budget office projected a $125  
billion overall federal surplus for fiscal 1999, which ended on 
Sept. 30. That is more than $55 billion above the 1998 surplus, 
marking the first time since 1956 and 1957 that the government ran 
two consecutive surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the White House Office of Management and Budget  
estimated that the overall 1999 surplus would be at least $115 
billion. But the office declined to say what it believed the 
non-Social Security surplus would be. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the Congressional Budget Office projected a 1999  
surplus of $120 billion. The new forecast, based on data from 
Treasury, was higher largely because of bigger than expected 
corporate tax payments.

<HEADLINE> International Paper Posts Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- International Paper, the world's largest  
paper and forest products company, reported sharply higher 
third-quarter earnings Tuesday thanks to better pricing for its 
products and cost-cutting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Not counting one-time gains and losses, International Paper  
earned $192 million, or 46 cents a share, compared to $81 million, 
or 20 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings were well above the 40 cents per share expected by  
analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. The company's 
stock, which is one of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial 
average, rose 18 3/4 cents to $48.68 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	John Dillon, International Paper's chief executive, credited the  
improved performance to better prices for the company's products, 
cost-cutting measures and other benefits from the company's recent 
acquisition of Union Camp, another paper company. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 3 percent during the quarter to $6.25 billion from  
$6.05 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the overall rise in profits, International Paper took a  
hit from Hurricane Floyd in September when plants temporarily shut 
down in Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. A plant in 
Virginia resumed only partial production last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The special items for the third quarter included $47 million in  
expenses related to International Paper's merger with Union Camp, 
including severance costs. The company also paid $3 million during 
the quarter to refinance Union Camp's high-interest debt. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, International Paper  
earned $324 million, or 78 cents a share, compared to $287 million, 
or 71 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier, not 
counting one-time gains and losses. Nine-month revenues rose 2.3 
percent to $18.23 billion from $17.87 billion.

<HEADLINE> Army Reveals Changes in Land Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army will undergo a fundamental  
transformation to make America's land forces more responsive to 
short-notice crises and smaller-scale conflicts, such as the war 
over Kosovo, that have increasingly occupied the American military 
in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo conflict, almost entirely an air war, showed that the  
Army was unable to move sizable combat forces quickly. It took far 
longer than expected to deploy Apache attack helicopters to 
Albania, and they never saw combat, although the Army is heavily 
involved now as Kosovo peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	The transformation will take years but will begin immediately  
with the conversion of two combat brigades at Ft. Lewis, Wash., 
into more flexible, faster-moving units, Gen. Eric Shinseki, the 
Army chief of staff, said Tuesday. Eventually the entire Army will 
be changed, he said, but he gave no timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to an Army booster group, Shinseki spelled out  
ambitious goals: achieving capability to move a brigade-size force 
of about 5,000 soldiers from the United States anywhere in the 
world within four days, a division of about 15,000 soldiers within 
five days, five divisions within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is a stretch from our current capability,'' he said  
without being more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinseki, who took over as the top uniformed leader of the Army  
in June, raised the possibility of eventually doing away with 
today's tank by developing a family of wheeled vehicles less 
restricted by weight yet lethal and capable of providing troop 
protection against armored attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we, in time, go to an all-wheel vehicle fleet where even  
the follow-on to today's armored vehicles can come in at 50 percent 
to 70 percent less tonnage?'' he asked in his remarks. ``I think 
the answer is yes, and we're going to ask the questions and then go 
where the answers are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a later news conference with Army Secretary Louis Caldera,  
the top civilian official, Shinseki said it was too early to spell 
out what kinds of equipment, including armor, will be done away 
with. ``Everything's on the table,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army, like the other U.S. armed forces, has been struggling  
since the end of the Cold War to adjust to an increasing demand for 
mobile forces capable of responding to regional crises in remote 
areas like the Balkans-- while at the same time maintaining the 
capability of fighting an all-out land war. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinseki said the Army would not change its basic mission.  
``War-fighting remains Job One,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinseki said today's heavy armored forces are ``challenged'' to  
get to regional conflicts like the Balkans quickly enough, while 
today's lighter forces ``lack staying power, lethality and tactical 
mobility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the forces that deploy for combat are encumbered with  
large support forces, such as intelligence and communications, that 
have to be gathered, transported and protected once put in the 
field. Shinseki said the new combat forces would develop a 
capability to ``reach back'' from the field to intelligence centers 
back home rather than having to bring such support with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the right technological solutions, we intend to transform  
the Army -- all components -- into a standard design,'' the general 
said. ``This commitment to change will require a comprehensive 
transformation of the Army,'' he said, which will begin with 
changes to two brigades at Ft. Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Shinseki did not mention them specifically, other Army  
officials said the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division as well 
as the 1st Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division at Ft. Lewis would 
begin transitioning to new equipment and vehicles during the budget 
year that began Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinseki had no estimate when the two brigades at Ft. Lewis  
would be fully operational. He said Ft. Lewis, whose units are 
designated for operations in Asia, including on the Korean 
Peninsula, was chosen to begin the transformation because of its 
``maneuver space and gunnery ranges.'' He also mentioned the 
proximity of McChord Air Force Base, Wash., with its strategic 
airlift capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief of staff said it is too early to estimate the cost to  
the Army to make the changes and whether it will require more than 
the 480,000 active duty soldiers the Army is authorized. 
</P>
<P>
	Transforming the Army will inflict more than just financial  
pain, Shinseki said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect that moving this quickly will be unnerving to  
some,'' he said. ``But I've spent a little time in central Texas 
where they have a saying: `You can't wring your hands and roll up 
your sleeves at the same time.'''

<HEADLINE> Transplant Center Disparity Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Patients' chances of getting a new liver or  
heart and surviving at least a year differ vastly depending on what 
hospital treats them, according to a first-ever government study 
that found a ``striking'' disparity in the success of U.S. 
transplant centers. 
</P>
<P>
	At the University of Kansas Medical Center, 89 percent of people  
awaiting liver transplants got them in the mid-1990s; at the 
University of Maryland in Baltimore, it was just 21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is the first to examine survival rates of all  
patients who enter transplant waiting lists and presents the first 
analysis of a patient's chances of getting a liver or heart, of 
dying while waiting and of surviving after a year with or without a 
new organ. 
</P>
<P>
	``This answers the questions a transplant patient would have:  
Will I get a transplant? Will I be alive a year from now?'' 
explained Campbell Gardett, a spokesman for the Department of 
Health and Human Services, which did the analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he cautioned that a center's particular results may be  
the product of special circumstances. ``It should prompt questions 
rather than conclusions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several factors explain the national variation, experts say.  
They include policies for distributing scarce organs, a community's 
willingness to donate and the effectiveness of the local organ bank 
in collecting organs. They also include a transplant surgeon's 
medical skills -- both in keeping patients alive while awaiting 
organs and in operating on and treating those who get transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was obtained by The Associated Press a day before  
legislation remaking the nation's transplant policies is expected 
to pass the House Commerce Committee. That bill, strongly opposed 
by the Clinton administration, would severely curtail the 
administration's power over the transplant network. It would also 
allow the network to keep data like that in the new study secret 
from everyone but transplant patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which examined only livers and hearts, found large  
variations among more than 100 transplant programs across the 
country. It looked at patient chances in three distinct ways, 
adjusting for the severity of each transplant center's particular 
patients: 
</P>
<P>
	--Chance of getting a transplant, which relates primarily to  
policy questions but also involves doctors' medical judgment about 
which organs to accept. 
</P>
<P>
	On this score, patients at liver centers in the bottom 10  
percent got transplants just 24.9 percent of the time. Among the 
top 10 percent, it was 71.2 percent. For heart transplant programs, 
35.8 percent got transplants at the bottom compared with 71.8 
percent at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	--Chance of dying while waiting for a transplant, which involves  
the speed in which organs are procured and the ability to stay 
alive during the wait. 
</P>
<P>
	In the lowest-scoring liver programs, 22.3 percent of patients  
died, vs. 7.7 percent at the top programs. For heart transplant 
centers, 23.1 percent of patients at the bottom centers died, vs. 
9.4 percent at the top programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Chance of surviving a year after coming on the list, whether  
the patient gets a transplant or not. This involves a surgeon and a 
center's skill at transplantation and postoperative care, along 
with the ability to keep patients alive while waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	At the lowest liver programs, 65.3 percent of patients survived  
a year, vs. 85.9 percent at the top. At the lowest heart programs, 
67 percent of patients survived a year, vs. 84 percent at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond the variation at the top and the bottom, mixed results  
were recorded in the middle as well, noted the report's author, Dr. 
Henry Krakauer. Normally, statisticians expect a few low performers 
and a few high performers, with most clustered in the center. But 
this report found that on several measures, hospitals were all over 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
	``The range of probabilities is in all cases substantial, but  
the breadth of the distribution of the transplant rates, especially 
in the case of the liver, ... is striking,'' the report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The report includes data through early this year that cover all  
patients who came onto the transplant waiting list between April 
1994 through the end of 1997. It was reviewed by experts in the 
field, including officials from the United Network for Organ 
Sharing, which collects the wealth of raw data from transplant 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to use this with a combination of a whole host of  
information,'' cautioned network spokesman Bob Speilbruner. 
</P>
<P>
	The network also produces data on patient survival, but only  
among those patients who receive transplants. This is the first 
report to factor in a patient's chances of getting an organ in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Congress, who are considering major changes in  
transplant policy, requested the report from HHS. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., says the report provides the most  
up-to-date, complete information for patients seeking transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a patient, your chances of survival depend  
enormously on where you get your transplant,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But experts at HHS allow that they do not understand all the  
reasons for the disparity. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to take the next step and understand why,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Stars Extend Nieuwendyk's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Joe Nieuwendyk, the MVP of the Stanley Cup  
playoffs, signed a three-year contract extension Tuesday that will 
keep him with the Dallas Stars through the 2002-03 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Nieuwendyk, who would have been a free agent after this season,  
had rejected an offer over the summer. The night of the season 
opener, Stars general manager Bob Gainey said negotiations with 
Nieuwendyk would wait until next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased to have Joe under contract,'' Gainey said.  
``We look forward to his contributions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Nieuwendyk centers Dallas' second line, playing  
behind a unit headed by Mike Modano and Brett Hull. 
</P>
<P>
	Nieuwendyk led the Stars with 39 goals and 69 points in 1997-98,  
then suffered a severe knee injury early in the playoffs. His 
absence was felt when the Stars were eliminated in the Western 
Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned last season to score 28 goals and 27 assists, and  
added 11 goals and 10 assists in the playoffs. His record-tying six 
game-winning goals in the postseason helped lead Dallas to its 
first Stanley Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time All-Star was the rookie of the year in 1988 and  
played for Canada in the Olympics last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas acquired Nieuwendyk from Calgary in December 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	The contract extension gives Nieuwendyk an opportunity to reach  
the 500-goal plateau for his career. He currently has 426 goals, 
ninth among active NHL players.

<HEADLINE> Chamberlain Promiscuity Chronicled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The claim was so shocking as to be  
unbelievable: Wilt Chamberlain said he had sex with 20,000 women. 
The revelation made him fodder for comedians and turned the NBA 
Hall of Famer into a reference for sexual braggadocio. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain died Tuesday at 63. He had a history of heart  
problems, and a fire department spokesman said there were signs 
that Chamberlain might have had a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 1991 biography ``A View From Above,'' Chamberlain devoted  
an entire chapter to sex. He said that if he had to count his 
sexual encounters, he would be closing in on 20,000 women. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, that's correct, twenty thousand different ladies,'' he  
wrote. ``At my age, that equals out to having sex with 1.2 women a 
day, every day since I was fifteen years old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reaction was swift and severe.  
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain jokes abounded. But he also became a lightning rod  
for those disgusted by his promiscuity. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Ashe harshly criticized Chamberlain and Magic Johnson,  
the former Los Angeles Lakers star who announced that he had 
contracted the AIDS virus months after Chamberlain's revelation. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 1993 memoir, Ashe said he didn't believe Chamberlain's  
claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt more pity than sorrow for Wilt as his macho accounting  
backfired on him in the form of a wave of public criticism,'' Ashe 
wrote in ``Days of Grace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The behavior of Chamberlain and Johnson produced ``a certain  
amount of racial embarrassment,'' Ashe wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``African Americans have spent decades denying that we are  
sexual primitives by nature, as racists have argued since the days 
of slavery,'' Ashe wrote. ``These two college-trained black men of 
international fame and immense personal wealth do their best to 
reinforce the stereotype.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has said he believes he got the AIDS virus by having  
unprotected sex with a woman who was infected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before I was married, I truly lived the bachelor's life,'' he  
said. ``I'm no Wilt Chamberlain, but as I traveled around NBA 
cities, I was never at a loss for female companionship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain knew that many people didn't believe him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not boasting,'' he wrote, ``I don't see all this  
lovemaking as any kind of conquest; all I'm saying is that I like 
women, people are curious about my sex life, and to most people the 
number of women who have come and gone through my bedrooms (and 
various hotel rooms around the country) would boggle the mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain wondered how many men would be married if they had  
his opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure plenty who read the numbers will no doubt think my  
taste is not particularly high or that I am `easy,''' he wrote. ``I 
am a man of distinctive taste and most of the women I have 
encountered, the average Joe would have proposed marriage to on the 
first date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain was a lifelong bachelor and was never engaged. He  
also denied rumors that he was gay. He said that of the 20,000 
women, none was married at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I made a conscious effort to find out. Even as a single  
man, infidelity has no place in my life,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain said that he dated women of every nationality and  
color, which helped him become a self-described villain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whites didn't like it, and people of color wanted me to be  
more attentive to my own kind so they could be `proud' of me,'' he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he never meant to be disrespectful, insensitive or  
brazen by dating white women. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just doing what was natural -- chasing good-looking  
ladies, whoever they were and wherever they were available,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> New Laws Target Cosmetic Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis has signed into law three  
bills intended to protect Californians from deceptive physicians 
and misleading before-and-after photos for cosmetic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills include one that will ban inaccurate cosmetic surgery  
ads and those that make scientific claims that cannot be 
substantiated. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also signed a measure that will require physicians who say  
they are ``board certified'' to specify the source of that 
certification. That will prevent a gynecologist, for example, from 
implying in ads that he or she is a board-certified cosmetic 
surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
	The third bill will require that a physician carry malpractice  
insurance and have at least one staff member present when 
performing plastic surgery in an outpatient facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also vetoed a bill that would allow potential plastic  
surgery patients to check the backgrounds of their surgeons by 
logging onto the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic governor said Monday the bill would have been too  
costly and might have left consumers with inaccurate information. 
</P>
<P>
	The laws, signed Sunday, take effect Jan. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	The bills follow a sharp increase in the use of cosmetic surgery  
and in the number of doctors who perform the procedures in their 
offices or clinics, sometimes with little or no specialized 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	The death rate for liposuction, a fat-removal procedure, is as  
high as one in 5,000 nationwide, a state Senate analysis found.

<HEADLINE> WHO To Study Tobacco Cos.' Clout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA -- The health agency of the United Nations said today it  
is asking independent experts to investigate new evidence that the 
tobacco industry tried to influence and undermine U.N. efforts to 
control tobacco use. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Health Organization said newly available documents  
point to a ``systematic and global effort'' dating back at least 20 
years by tobacco companies to divert attention from the health 
risks of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	On several occasions, the agency said, experts serving on WHO  
committees were also receiving payments from tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence comes from some 30 million documents made public  
during a case by the state of Minnesota against the tobacco 
industry, a suit which resulted in the companies paying out a 
combined $6.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``In that information, there are many instances of how  
supposedly independent experts are actually funded by the tobacco 
industry,'' WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are also indications that front groups for the tobacco  
industry have tried consistently to turn WHO's interests away from 
tobacco into other areas.'' 
</P>
