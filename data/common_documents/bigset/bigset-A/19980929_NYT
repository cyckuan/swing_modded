IT'S NOT EASY, BUT THE CUBS FIND THEI WAY INTO THE POST-SEASON
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Sammy Sosa dd not hit four home runs to share the
record with Mark McGwire. Steve Trachsel did not pitch a no-hitter.
But the Chicago Cubs did gain a chance to win their first
post-season series since 1908.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, who last won the World Series in that post-season 90
years ago, advanced to the first round of this year's playoff by
defeating the San Francisco Giants, 5-3, Monday night and winning
the first playoff for the National League wild-card spot in the
four-year history of the wild-card format.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, who last played post-season games in 1989, will play
the Braves in Atlanta on Wednesday afternoon. They were put on the
plane to Atlanta chiefly by Trachsel, who did not allow a hit until
he had one out in the seventh inning; by Felix Heredia, who retired
Barry Bonds on an inning-ending grounder with the bases loaded in
the seventh; by Terry Mulholland, who held Bonds to a sacrifice fly
with the bases loaded and none out in the ninth; and by Gary Gaetti
and Matt Mieske, 1998 newcomers to the Cubs, who each drove in two
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa did not hit a home run, leaving him with 66 and officially
putting McGwire into the record book as the single-season
record-holder with 70 home runs. Sosa batted 15 times without
hitting a home run since he hit No. 66 last Friday night and
slipped ahead of McGwire for all of 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, however, continued his most valuable player contribution
to the Cubs, stroking a pair of singles and scoring the final two
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other seasons when the Cubs disappointed themselves
and their fans, pregame preparations did not become washed away in
the tears of another failure. Clubhouse workers had rolled up heavy
plastic covers on the tops of the players' lockers, waiting there
to be dropped over the fronts of the lockers to spare their
contents from a Champagne celebration. Jimmy Bank, the traveling
secretary, had prepared travel itineraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We leave tomorrow afternoon for Atlanta,'' Bank said before
the game to one player who had asked. ``I'm going to give out the
itinerary after the game tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was able to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel, a 27-year-old right-hander, had labored recently _ in
fact, since he threw the pitch that became the home run that broke
Roger Maris's record. In four starts beginning with that game on
Sept. 8, Trachsel had been battered for 19 earned runs in 212/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, on the other hand, had not lost a game since July 30,
winning 5 of his 10 subsequent starts. Yet it was Gardner whose
string of shutout innings ended first.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Rodriguez opened the Cubs' fifth inning with a single to
right-center field, and Gaetti followed with a home run, a fly ball
on an 0-2 fastball that sent Barry Bonds drifting back toward the
ivy-covered wall in front of the left-field bleachers. But when
Bonds reached the wall, the ball kept going.
</P>
<P>
   Gaetti, whom the Cubs signed on his 40th birthday, Aug. 19,
after St. Louis released him, thus produced the first runs in a
rare playoff game for the playoffs. Only three times since division
play began in 1969 had teams played an extra game for the right to
play post-season games.
</P>
<P>
   But this was the first time in the four-year history of the
baseball wild card that teams had to play an extra game to
determine the winner of that spot in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants reached this juncture even though they had not led in
the wild-card race since July 18. A six-game winning streak last
week catapulted them into position to win this trip to Wrigley
Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs had led most of the time since July 18, let the lead
slip away to the Mets with a week remaining in the season, then
rallied just enough to retain a chance to play October games.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel certainly was intent on getting an October start.
</P>
<P>
   The team leader in walks, he exhibited his customary wildness
with walks in the second, third, fourth and fifth innings. In the
fourth, in fact, he walked two batters and hit another, loading the
bases with two out. But with a chance to put the Giants ahead,
Brian Johnson, their catcher, took a third strike.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel did not allow the batters who walked in the other three
innings _ two with two out, one with one out _ to advance beyond
first base.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Cubs cracked through Gardner's shutout shell, they
widened the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Johnson led off the sixth inning with a single to left
field and, one out later, Sosa stroked a single to center, sending
Johnson scampering to third and Gardner trudging to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Rodriguez, a left-hander, replaced Gardner and walked the
left-handed-hitting Mark Grace, loading the bases. Jim Riggleman,
the Cubs' manager, then pulled Rodriguez, a left-handed hitter, and
used a right-hander, Matt Mieske, who had gone to the plate only
110 times in 76 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   But the rust did not impede Mieske's swing. A .292 hitter, he
lined a single to right, and Johnson and Sosa raced home with the
third and fourth runs. John Johnstone then relieved Rodriguez and
induced Gaetti to ground into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Fortified with a second pair of runs, Trachsel went out in the
seventh to extend his hitless pitching. He did so with the first
batter as Charlie Hayes lined to Mickey Morandini at second base.
But six and a third innings would be as far as he would take his
no-hit effort because Brent Mayne, batting for Johnson, swung at
the first pitch he saw and lined it to right for a single.
</P>
<P>
   When Trachsel, after receiving an ovation from the crowd of
39,556, walked another pinch-hitter, Armando Rios, Riggleman
decided six walks would be as far as he would go. He called for
Matt Karchner in a double switch that sent Orlando Merced to left
field in place of Mieske, who had replaced Henry Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   There was still no sign of Brant Brown, who was playing left
field last week in Milwaukee when he dropped a two-out,
bases-loaded fly ball that cost the Cubs a victory that might have
obviated the need for this playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Merced, however, turned out to be in the right place at the
right time because Stan Javier lofted a foul fly near the
left-field stands that Merced leaped against the wall to catch.
</P>
<P>
   After Shawon Dunston, the third pinch-hitter in the inning, got
an infield single with a grounder over second base, the left-handed
Felix Heredia replaced Karchner to pitch to the left-handed-hitting
Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds has had no success in four post-season series in his
career, and though this game was considered part of the regular
season, his difficulty continued. With no hits in his first three
at-bats, Bonds took a ball and a strike, then hit a grounder to
Grace at first for the third out.

SURVEY: SENIORS FINDING LIFE GOOD UNDER THE COVERS
</HEADLINE>

(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Grandma and grandpa might be mum about it, but if
they're sexually active, the odds are that after 60 they enjoy sex
as much or more than in their 40s, according to a national study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study goes against one of the myths that it's all downhill
after age 50,'' said Michael Reinemer, a spokesman for the National
Council on the Aging, which sponsored the senior sex survey
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Three out of four people surveyed who are 60 or older and are
sexually active said their sex life is as good or better than when
they were younger, Reinemer said. To be deemed sexually active, the
participants had to have sex at least once a month. Fewer than half
of all senior citizens are sexually active, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also shows that sex continues to be important in
relationships with people over 50,'' Reinemer said.
</P>
<P>
   Kess Kessler, 61, a resident of the L.A. suburb of Woodland
Hills, couldn't agree more. Married for 40 years, he believes sex
is even better than when he and his wife were in their 20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just better quality, two to three times a week. The
children are out of the house and I'm retired,'' he said, during a
break from shopping in Woodland Hills. ``It's true. It's better now
because we know each other better and physically I haven't
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Whitehead, 65, visiting her daughter in the L.A. suburb
of Tarzana on Monday, echoed Kessler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say sex is better when you're older because you don't
have all the worries about pregnancy and also about AIDS, if you
stay with the same person,'' Whitehead said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of all Americans age 60 or older engage in sexual
activity at least once a month, according to the random survey of
1,300 older Americans conducted by Roper Starch Worldwide, a market
research and public opinion firm.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer Inc., the manufacturer of the anti-impotence drug Viagra,
paid for the study.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which included respondents from the Los Angeles
area, also found that four in 10 desire sex more frequently,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland Hills resident Mike Gard, 76, said the frequency of sex
with his wife of 26 years might not be as high as in their 40s, but
``it's equally as good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's really important or not, but it's been
there. It's something you get used to, I guess,'' said Gard, who
said he still engages in sex with his wife about once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine percent of those surveyed said they are satisfied
with the amount of sex they currently engage in, while another 39
percent said they want more.
</P>
<P>
   Men were more than twice as likely as women to report wanting
more sex. And only 4 percent said they desire less sex.
</P>
<P>
   And 61 percent of men, as compared with 37 percent of women,
reported that they were sexually active, according to the study.
The gap partially results from a woman's longer life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   Those surveyed who said they had sex less than once a month also
said they have less emotional satisfaction in their sex lives
compared to when they were in their 40s.
</P>
<P>
   When older people were not sexually active, it was usually
because they lacked a partner or had a medical condition, said Neal
Cutler, the National Council on the Aging's director of survey
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study underscores the enduring importance of sex among
older men and women _ even among those who report infrequent sexual
activity,'' Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the qualities Americans look for in their partner in
their more seasoned years? Nine out of 10 pointed to a high moral
character, pleasant personality, sense of humor and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Widowed and over 55 years old, Jan Sayre of Woodland Hills said
she opts for the gentleman over the stud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if he's a dude. He can be bald,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The respondents were interviewed by mail from June 19 to Aug.
11, rather than by phone because of the sensitive nature of the
questions. The margin of error was 3.5 percentage points. &QL;

MINORU NIIZUMA, 67, SCULPTOR AND TEACHER
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minoru Niizuma, a sculptor and educator who taught at the
Brooklyn Museum Art School and Columbia University, died on Sept. 5
at the University Hospital and Medical Center at Stony Brook, N.Y.
He was 67 and lived in East Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, a family member said.
</P>
<P>
   Niizuma was born in Tokyo in 1930 and graduated from the
National Tokyo University of Fine Arts in 1955. He moved to New
York in 1959 and had his first solo show in New York City at the
Howard Wise Gallery in 1966. He had retrospectives at the Seibu
Museum of Art in Tokyo in 1976 and at the Gulbenkian Museum in
Lisbon in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Niizuma taught at the Brooklyn Museum Art School from 1964 to
1970, then at Columbia University for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   He worked predominantly in stone, especially marble, and was
known for his sensitive use of its textures and veins. His designs
ranged from the geometric to the organic and sometimes used
patterns reminiscent of folk art, fabrics and ritual vessels.
</P>
<P>
   His work is in public collections in the United States, Europe
and Japan, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture
Garden in Washington, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and
the National Museum of Modern Art in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Niizuma's two marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by
three sons: Ta Andre of Tokyo, and Ko Christopher and Arata Peter,
both of New York City, and one grandchild.

RACING NOTEBOOK: SKIP AWAY BACK AT WORK; LIL'S LAD FINISHES LAST;
NEW DIRECTIONS FOR BARTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine days after his sweeping score in the Woodward Stakes for
his ninth straight victory, Skip Away went back to work Monday
morning and was up to his old tricks. He breezed half a mile at
Belmont Park in a snappy 46 3/5 seconds in his first workout for
his next performance, in the Jockey Club Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-year-old gray superstar of racing had Jerry Bailey riding,
with his trainer, Sonny Hine, monitoring every move. He needs to
win $500,000 to pass Cigar's record total of $9.9 million in
earnings, and he can do it if he wins one of the last two races of
his career: the $1 million Gold Cup and the $4 million Breeders'
Cup Classic. The winner's share for the Gold Cup is $600,000; for
the Classic, about $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry thought he went in 47 or 48 seconds,'' Hine said later,
clearly impressed with his horse's fast time. ``You hate to breeze
a horse too much, but there's nothing else you can do with him. He
came out of the Woodward sharp, and he got too hard to gallop. He
is just an amazing horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jockey Club Gold Cup will be run one week from Saturday as
the centerpiece of Belmont's Breeders' Cup Preview Day. The
Breeders' Cup, with seven races and combined purses of $12 million,
will be run three weeks later at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Lil's Lad Flat Again
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey returned in the afternoon to ride Lil's Lad, who
was one of the favorites for the Kentucky Derby last spring before
being forced to withdraw because of bone chips in an ankle. When he
made his comeback one month ago, Lil's Lad ran fourth in an
allowance race at Saratoga. When he ran again Monday, he went off
as the 1-5 favorite in an allowance at Belmont, and finished fifth
and last. What is happening?
</P>
<P>
   His trainer, Neil Howard, seemed not only puzzled, but also
speechless. ``There's not much I can say,'' Howard said. Where will
he run next? ``I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said: ``He just couldn't keep up. It was a pretty flat
performance, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Flashing Tammany won the race, followed by Wouldn't We All.
</P>
<P>
   A Change of Pace for Barton
</P>
<P>
   Donna Barton, who rode 1,131 winners during her 11-year career
as one of the leading female jockeys, gave her farewell performance
Sunday at Turfway Park in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old rider from New Mexico said she would become a
student next spring at the University of Louisville. She also
announced that she would be married on Nov. 16 to Frank Brothers,
the trainer.
</P>
<P>
   She is the daughter of the pioneer female jockey Patti Barton,
and was the jockey for Hennessy and Boston Harbor as well as the
regular work rider for Thunder Gulch, Serena's Song and Timber
Country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became a jockey so that I could make money to go to
college,'' Barton said. ``This is one of the happiest and saddest
days of my life.''

IT'S ONE NIGHT TO CELEBRATE THE CUBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Half past three Monday afternoon, they pulled up the
gates at the intersection of Clark and Addison and rolled out the
old kiosks from which the Wrigley Field programs are hawked at a
modern-day miracle price of 75 cents. There was one last ball game
in a remarkable baseball season, and no team was more entitled to
this prime-time slot than the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   They deserved their mini-World Series, their wild-card victory
over the stubborn Giants, for Ernie Banks, for Billy Williams, for
all the proud Cubbies who never experienced the thrill of looking
up at the center field scoreboard to see no out-of-town results.
They deserved it for Harry Caray, for contributing to the season
young Kerry Wood, for the enthusiasm they showed as the competitive
bystanders when Mark McGwire clubbed his 62nd home run in St. Louis
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Trachsel, server of the most memorable of all 70 McGwire
blasts, deserved to have the Cubs' bullpen not blow _ barely _ his
six and one-third innings of one-hit shutout ball. Most of all,
Sammy Sosa deserved this night, this 5-3 victory, for 66 home runs,
for pushing McGwire to astonishing heights, for sharing his spirit
and saving McGwire from his sullen self of early summer.
</P>
<P>
   All this anticipation, all this anxiety, all this energy, for
the likelihood of being first-round fodder for the Braves. The
Yankees and the Red Sox fought for the genuine division
championship in 1978, not to be the best of those who also ran.
Good for them. Every team lives with its own history of success and
failure. Every team has its own unique set of expectations,
priorities and perspective. This was so much more than a playoff to
join the playoffs for the Cubs. It was a chance to win the race _
any race _ knowing that the snickering masses believed all along
they would collapse, drop out, simply because of who they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spring training, a lot of people were picking the Cubs to
be the first sixth-place team in a five-team division,'' said Mark
Grace. ``We persevered. This is the most fun I've ever had playing
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace, the only remaining Cub from the 1989 team that lost to
the Giants in the playoffs, claimed beforehand that he had
exorcised the horrific defeats of the past 10 days, pronounced the
glass half full. If the Cubs could win, then they could drink to
beating the prohibitive odds of having the Brant Brown-like
calamity that sure seemed possible when Michael Jordan fired the
ceremonial first pitch over the catcher's head. Imminent disaster
has always been the Cubs' companion, which is why Grace tried to
explain to Gary Gaetti and Rod Beck a few weeks ago that this was
no ordinary chase they had stepped into. ``I know you guys have
been in the post-season,'' he told them. ``But until you do it in
Chicago, you don't know what a great feeling it is.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, win or lose, last night belonged to Cub lore.
For this one game, it was easy to ignore the fact that beyond their
charming logo and timeless home, the Cubs are owned by a rich media
company, just like the Dodgers, and they have one of baseball's
highest payrolls. Only history, at this point, has the right to
define the Cubs as lovable losers trying to conquer all odds, but
this has been a historic season. On this occasion, the slipper fit.
</P>
<P>
   Gaetti gave the Cubs the lead by lofting a two-run homer to left
off the Giants' Mark Gardner in the fifth. Sosa, free of McGwire at
last, cut down on his swing and stroked a key single in another
two-run flurry in the sixth. When the Giants loaded the bases with
two out for Barry Bonds in the seventh, a November chill enveloped
the ball park. In came a southpaw, Felix Heredia. Bonds grounded to
Grace. Bill Murray grabbed Harry Caray's old microphone to sing
baseball's most famous song, but it was the late-inning Wrigley
crowd roars that were music to Billy Williams's ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been there, but when you make it to the World
Series, I know there has to be less pressure than trying to get
there,'' said the Cubs' bench coach and resident Hall of Famer.
``Not as much pressure as this.''
</P>
<P>
   This game, of course, was more about September than it was
October, a month that will belong to the Braves and the Astros and,
of course, the Yankees. There is a big, bad baseball world out
there, but for one night, its eyes were upon Sosa and his Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   No scoreboard to watch. One game left, sudden death, Cubs win,
Cubs win! Good for them.

RANGERS' DESTINY MIGHT BE TRACED TO 1997 SURRENDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ We've talked about ``The Play,'' when broken-toed
Will Clark beat out the slow roller to second base for the base hit
that crystallized this Texas Rangers season, with proper awe and
reverence.
</P>
<P>
   We've offered homage to ``The Home Run'' that followed Clark's
play, when Pudge Rodriguez smoked a two-run shot into the Baltimore
ether to complete the comeback that would fuel the run for the
title.
</P>
<P>
   We've analyzed and pinpointed Doug Melvin's flurry of
trading-deadline deals as the ultimate difference-makers down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   None of those, however, set off the chain of events that will
put the Rangers on the field Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium for
the first game of the Division Series against the American League
East champion Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set for the Rangers to capture the 1998 AL West
title not by some aggressive play, not by some mighty stroke of the
bat, not even by Melvin's July 31 blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers won the West in '98 when they raised the white flag
in '97.
</P>
<P>
   Surrender then led to victory now. Strange how history works,
isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   It was in July 1997, when Melvin began retooling his team for
this season and, ironically, it paid off in a champagne shower in
the stadium the Rangers hate most in the world Friday night at the
Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Would the Rangers be at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday if Melvin
hadn't decided to trade free agent-to-be third baseman Dean Palmer
for center fielder Tom Goodwin after the All-Star break in '97?
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's early departure cleared the way for young Fernando
Tatis to get major-league experience at third. Tatis became the
major piece in the deal that would bring pitcher Todd Stottlemyre
and shortstop Royce Clayton to the Rangers two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Or what if Melvin hadn't sent Ken Hill to the Angels for pitcher
Matt Perisho and catcher Jim Leyritz, who would then be packaged
off to Boston along with outfielder Damon Buford for future 19-game
winner Aaron Sele?
</P>
<P>
   Or if in August of '97, he hadn't made perhaps the deal of his
life by sending useful left-handed reliever Ed Vosburg to the
Marlins for young right-hander Rick Helling? Who knew that Helling
would blossom into an immediate 20-game winner?
</P>
<P>
   ``The alternative \Rin '97\S was to just sit back and play it
out,'' Melvin said the day after the Rangers had clinched their
second division title in three years. ``I don't know what we'd have
done then.''
</P>
<P>
   Safe to say, they wouldn't be where they are now, facing the
team that just broke the American League record for most victories
in a regular season.
</P>
<P>
   If this was a fairy tale, then this would have been a magical
season for the Rangers. It was not and there may not be an
``everyone lived happily ever after'' at the end of this story.
</P>
<P>
   Their starting rotation _ with the exception of Helling and Sele
_ was abysmal until the final month.
</P>
<P>
   Their defense was sloppy and mental errors drove manager Johnny
Oates up the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Offense carried this team this far. But to beat the Yankees _ or
anyone else in the playoffs _ the Rangers must pitch and play
defense.
</P>
<P>
   After his team had clinched, Oates made positioning his starting
rotation and resting his regulars his top priorities. For the
Rangers to win, Stottlemyre and Helling must repay that faith by
producing at least one victory in the first two games here Tuesday
and Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers cannot leave New York down 0-2 and expect to be
back.
</P>
<P>
   They must play this anticipating a full five-game series. Win
one of the first two here, win one of the two games at The Ballpark
in Arlington, then come back to Yankee Stadium for Game 5 and take
their chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience we gained from the playoffs against the Yankees
two years ago will be invaluable,'' Clark said. ``We've been
through this before. We know what it's going to be like. Let's play
some baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   No looking ahead. No thinking about tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into the last week of the season as if we were facing
seven one-game series,'' Oates said. ``Each game represented a
chance to be a step closer to where we wanted to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have to do the same thing in this series. We can't
worry about what's going to happen tomorrow night or when we get
back to Texas. We have to play this game right here, right now, and
play it as if it's the last one we'll ever play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will be perhaps the most decisive underdogs in
playoff history. The Yanks are the ones who have been magical this
season. The Rangers, according to most of the experts, should be
happy just to be on the same field with them.
</P>
<P>
   Fate, though, has a way of arranging these monumental collisions
when you least expect them. A lot of pieces have had to fall into
place over the last 18 months for the Rangers to be here.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of quirky, what-if path that historians often look
back on later and call destiny.

SHOTGUN NEW WEAPON IN USC ARSENAL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After having so much trouble protecting the
quarterback against Florida State, USC might consider including the
shotgun formation in its offense in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have to. Strategically that makes a lot of sense,'' USC
coach Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said it wasn't a good idea to try the shotgun when the
Trojans were forced to switch guard Jason Grain to center the past
two games because of injuries to Matt McShane and Eric Denmon.
McShane (sprained knee ligament) returned against Florida State in
a reserve role, however, and might be able to start Saturday
against Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to jump into that at this point,'' Hackett said.
``That's a whole other world. I'd like to get McShane and Denmon
back first.''
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Chad Morton, who re-strained his back against Florida
State, is not expected to practice today.
</P>
<P>
   __ Forgotten past: The confidence gained from USC's 3-0 start
has apparently evaporated thanks to the Trojans' 30-10 loss to
Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three games don't mean much,'' wide receiver Billy
Miller said. ``Whatever happened in the past doesn't matter.
(Florida State) was a test to say `How good are we?' ''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rough record: USC is only 2-3 at the Coliseum against Arizona
State, with the victories occurring in 1980 and 1995. Overall, the
Sun Devils lead the series 8-6, the only Pacific-10 Conference team
to have a winning record against USC.
</P>
<P>
   __ Cal game set: The starting time for USC's game with
California on Oct. 10 will be 3:30 p.m. at the Coliseum. The game
will be telecast on Fox Sports West 2.
</P>
<P>
   __ Check exchange: USC was paid $250,000 by Florida State for
its trip to Tallahassee. That help makes up for the $150,000
settlement USC paid Florida State last year when women's basketball
coach Chris Gobrecht left the Seminoles to come to USC.

STATE ATTORNEYS SAY TOBACCO INDUSTRY MISLED PUBLIC ON HEALTH
RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE MILETICH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The nation's largest cigarette makers embarked on a
45-year campaign to confuse and mislead the public about the health
dangers of their products, lawyers for Washington state said Monday
in joining 41 other states in their attack on the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   In five hours of remarks, the state combined old-fashioned
oratory with the most sophisticated technology ever used in a
Washington courtroom in outlining their multi-billion dollar case
to a King County Superior Court jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not tobacco companies. They are drug pharmaceutical
companies,'' attorney Steve Berman told the nine-women, three-men
jury in a trial that is being closely watched nationwide. ``And
they have lied about and hidden their true nature for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Displaying more than a dozen internal tobacco industry documents
on a ceiling-high screen, Berman and co-counsel Paul Luvera pulled
key paragraphs from the text with the help of a special computer
program previously used in the Oklahoma bombing trial of Timothy
McVeigh.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys will dispute the state's case Tuesday, denying
claims that major cigarette makers conspired to hide the dangers of
smoking, target minors with sophisticated advertising, manipulate
nicotine levels and suppress the development of a safer cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   They also will take the offensive, contending that the state has
effectively promoted the sale of tobacco products by licensing
cigarettes and collecting millions of dollars in taxes on them.
</P>
<P>
   The state's attorneys dismissed that argument Monday, saying the
state could never enforce its laws if that were true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our evidence will show that paying taxes is never an excuse
for breaking the law,'' Luvera said.
</P>
<P>
   Luvera and Berman, both private practitioners, were hired by the
state to help recover more than $2 billion in smoking-related
Medicaid costs from Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown &AMP;
Williamson, Lorillard and several other defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants have previously settled Medicaid cases with
Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota for sums totaling $38.5
billion and are facing similar suits brought by 37 other states.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are currently under way in New York between Philip
Morris and Lorillard to settle suits with Washington and the other
states. Brown &AMP; Williamson and R.J. Reynolds have declined to
participate but are closely watching the talks.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's opening remarks, Luvera and Berman described how the
top executives of the major tobacco companies secretly met at the
Plaza Hotel in New York in December 1953 to discuss their concerns
about a spate of new scientific reports linking cigarettes to
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   From that meeting, the companies agreed to hide the truth about
the health risks of their products, conceal damaging information
from government officials and restrict genuine research about the
effects of smoking, Luvera and Berman told the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state's position is that the tobacco defendants have
violated the civil laws by conspiring not to compete with each
other over issues like smoking and disease or by finding new ways
to reduce the risk of smoking,'' Luvera said.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, tobacco company officials acknowledged in internal
memorandums that they were actually in the business of selling
nicotine, a substance they described as addictive and ``a poison,''
Luvera said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are words they thought nobody else would see,'' Luvera
said, explaining that the documents weren't uncovered until several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the companies privately held those views, their
executives went before Congress in 1994 and publicly stated that
they didn't believe nicotine was addictive, Luvera said, playing a
videotape of their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also deliberately manipulated nicotine levels,
spraying ammonia on tobacco sheets to alter how cigarettes burned
and give them more of a ``kick,'' Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, cigarettes makers suppressed the manufacture
of safer products, in part because they had agreed in 1953 to share
all information on their research, thus removing any profit
incentive, Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy also led the tobacco industry to target minors,
largely because they knew most new smokers start when they are
young and rarely switch brands as they get older, Berman and Luvera
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before cigarette advertising was banned on television, cigarette
makers advertised on programs such as ``Gilligan's Island'' and the
``Beverly Hillbillies,'' knowing they were popular with children,
Luvera said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, R.J Reynolds developed the ``Joe Camel'' cartoon
character to directly appeal to minors and promote Camel
cigarettes, Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the tobacco industry's conduct, more people smoke
and suffer from diseases such as cancer, heart problems and
emphesema than would have if cigarette makers had been truthful,
Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   The state has paid about $2.2 billion in smoking-related
Medicaid costs, of which $1.4 billion are directly related to the
actions of the defendants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the companies are held liable for damages, the jury could
award either sum to the state, depending on whether it believes
responsibility can be precisely determined or whether it is too
confusing to allocate.
</P>
<P>
   The state also is seeking additional monetary penalties for
alleged violations of state consumer-protection and antitrust laws,
which would be fixed by the judge presiding over the case, George
Finkle, and could total billions of dollars.

CUB FANS SAVOR A RARITY: A GAME THAT IS DECISIVE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The red-brick temple at 1060 West Addison Street is
what baseball lost and has tried to get back. Wrigley Field is a
neighborhood ball park with green grass, green ivy and green seats,
every one filled with a baseball fan.
</P>
<P>
   Working the hand-operated scoreboard at the 84-year-old Wrigley
was an easy job Monday night, as only one game was played in the
baseball world: The Cubs beat the Giants, 5-3, for the National
League wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the old and the young were in old Weeghman
Park, all giddy with anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Dusty B., are you a gambling man?'' yelled Billy
Williams, the Cub coach and Hall of Famer, giving a hug to Giants
Manager Dusty Baker. ``Winner takes all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is incredible,'' said Jason Maxwell, a 26-year-old Cubs
infielder with a total of three career at-bats. ``I've never seen
anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley was rocking at 8:22 p.m., but not from the El rumbling
past right field. Gary Gaetti lofted a home run into the wire
basket, barely into the right-field bleachers. Brian Helmus, the
scoreboard operator, posted a yellow 2 on the Cubs' line for the
fifth inning, while the Giants still did not have a hit.
</P>
<P>
   A woman was thrown out of Wrigley for throwing her beer onto the
field during the celebration, but that wasn't the last baseball
memory of the evening for her 6-year-old son. Her husband made the
decision any Cubs fan and father would make, staying at the game
with their son and giving Mom cab fare home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody got extras?'' was the plaintive cry out on Sheffield
Avenue, Wrigleyville's Main Street, where all the 39,000 seats and
standing-room tickets were long gone. Brad Staab had his $12
bleacher ticket, waiting all day with his carefully lettered sign,
``Next Year Is Tonite.'' He knew the unwritten rules: keep the
souvenir of a lifetime if Sosa hits one; throw it back if the
Giants do.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan knew where Chicago's attention was focused. He
was here to throw out the ceremonial first pitch, wearing a Sammy
Sosa jersey. Jordan proved again that baseball is not his sport,
sailing the pitch over Sosa's head.
</P>
<P>
   In Section 118, Sosa's brothers were ready with their Dominican
flags. The steel girders shook when Sosa came to bat for the first
time, but he hit a checked-swing grounder to the pitcher for an
inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Sammy! Give me five,'' one sign read, pleading for Sosa
to surpass Mark McGwire's 70 home runs, despite the wind blowing
in.
</P>
<P>
   The joke of the day at Wrigley went this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, did you hear what happened?'' one fan says to another.
``McGwire hit two more.''
</P>
<P>
   A pith-helmeted fellow known as the Bleacher Preacher wandered
Waveland Avenue with a Giants voodoo doll, allowing fans to stick
in hundreds of pins.
</P>
<P>
   Long-suffering Cubs fans had hoped this game would help exorcise
the ghosts of a century of Cubs failure. ``'69 Mets,'' read Mike
Young's sign, ``'89 Giants, '84 Padres.'' He had marked through the
Mets and had his pen ready for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The Rolling Stones were blaring on the stadium speakers, with a
chorus that could be the Cubs' theme song: ``You make a grown man
cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Here baseball is no pastime, it's a religion. This is where Babe
Ruth hit his ``called shot'' in the 1932 World Series, where Ernie
Banks hit his 500th home run, where Sosa hit Nos. 61 and 62.
</P>
<P>
   The old pink house beyond the right-field bleachers at 1038 West
Waveland Avenue, where so many home runs have landed on the porch,
has its own yellow foul pole, 461 feet from home plate. ``To be
demolished Oct. '98,'' a sign on the house read. ``Thanks for the
memories.''

LIBERAL GROUP SAYS IT IS PREPARING AD CAMPAIGN DEFENDING CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A liberal political group plans to spend hundreds
of thousands of dollars on an advertising campaign that extols the
accomplishments of President Clinton and attacks Republicans for
neglecting everyday issues while chasing the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're planning an ad campaign that focuses on the fact that
Congress has not been working on issues that matter to the American
people,'' said Mike Lux, political director of the Washington-based
group, People for the American Way. ``They're obsessed with
scandal, cynicism and partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Lux said the group was working on scripts now and hoped to have
the television advertisements produced by the end of the week. He
said the group had not determined where the advertisements would be
broadcast, although it hoped to buy air time in national and local
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign would serve a dual mission _ trying to generate
support for the beleaguered president and trying to bolster
Democratic candidates' successes in the midterm elections. The
organization alerted the White House this week of its plans, which
were reported on Monday night in early editions of The Washington
Post.
</P>
<P>
   The group is scheduled to meet later this week with James
Carville, who was Clinton's campaign manager in 1992 and is one of
his most outspoken defenders. Carville declared on television on
Sunday that he was going to war with House Speaker Newt Gingrich _
a statement that worried some moderate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising strategy closely follows the course taken by
Clinton and other Democrats within the past week. They suddenly
emerged from a posture of contrition and apology to take a
combative stance against Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks during a three-day fund-raising trip over the
weekend, Clinton accused Congress of ignoring issues like
education, classroom size and Social Security to pursue scandal.
Hillary Rodham Clinton, on a separate trip for Democratic
candidates, echoed that theme.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans retorted that Clinton had left town on a political
junket while many legislative issues remained unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders and Clinton allies have been trying to
persuade Republicans in Congress to accept a deal in which Clinton
would be censured by Congress, and perhaps fined, rather than face
impeachment. Republicans have resisted any effort at compromise.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perhaps this will be the season when right-hander
John Wetteland becomes ``the final piece of the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin, whose Texas Rangers oppose New York
Tuesday night in Game 1 of their best-of-five, American League
Division Series, regrets introducing Wetteland in that manner in
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers signed Wetteland, the former Yankees closer, to a
four-year contract worth $23 million in an attempt ``to take us to
the next level,'' Melvin said then.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' executive laments those words to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair to say that about any one player,'' said Melvin,
who during 1997 witnessed the Rangers finish 13 games behind the AL
West champion Seattle Mariners. ``I guess I said that in the
excitement of signing a player as good as him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your club changes dramatically from year to year, so one
player doesn't have that kind of impact. It was probably a little
bit unfair to think that he was going to come over and make things
altogether different.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, though, the 32-year-old closer will make a difference
as the Rangers enter the postseason for the second time in three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``My expectations of myself far exceed anything anyone could
expect of me, and that's all I need to worry about,'' said
Wetteland, who was 3-1 with 42 saves and a 2.03 earned-run average
this season. ``If I don't get it done, I guarantee you that no one
will feel worse than me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers signed Wetteland before the 1997 season as a
response to their deficiencies in the bullpen. The Rangers lost
their 1996 Division Series to the world champion Yankees in four
games, and the respective strength of the bullpens played a
significant role in that outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no loss demonstrated that more than Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Darren Oliver, who allowed the Yankees only one run
through eight innings, went to the mound for the ninth inning with
a one-run lead. Manager Johnny Oates removed Oliver after
consecutive singles by shortstop Derek Jeter and left fielder Tim
Raines, but right-hander Mike Henneman could not protect that lead,
and the Rangers lost, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland likely would have begun that ninth inning had he been
the Rangers' closer then. The organization viewed his arrival as a
vehicle to augment their 90-victory team from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, though, never became a significant factor during a
disastrous 1997 season marred by injuries, poor defense and an
unreliable rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, who went 7-2 with 31 saves and a 1.94 ERA in 1997,
became so disillusioned by the turn of events that while in Chicago
in July he asked Oates if the Rangers would be better served with
him pitching in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My interests aren't my own,'' Wetteland said. ``My interest is
to try and help this team. I was starting to wonder if I was worth
anything as a closer. I was being paid well on a team that was
destined _ well, I don't even know where we finished _ not to win
anything. So, I was wondering how I could maximize my value to the
team. I felt bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers denied Wetteland's request, but it revealed his
unselfishness and competitive nature. One of baseball's dominant
closers sought to leave his comfort zone for an opportunity to make
a difference as a member of the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never played with a more competitive person in my life,''
Rangers left-hander Scott Bailes said. ``I think that season was
frustrating for him. He couldn't score runs. He couldn't field the
ball. All he could do was protect leads.''
</P>
<P>
   Those proved few and far between until this season, and the
Rangers will take their chances should their lineup be fortunate
enough to provide Wetteland three ninth-inning leads in this
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that I might not do my job, too,'' Wetteland
said. ``That's the wonderful thing about the game. Nothing is a
sure thing. You go out there and prepare to make it as close as you
can to a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone just figures that because you get this guy and that
guy that you're going to win, but it doesn't work that way. I'm
sorry, but play the game and find that out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers played that game without Wetteland during 1996
against the Yankees and did not enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said, ``we won't see
him.''

<P>
   In the most pessimistic projection yet of the NBA labor dispute,
commissioner David Stern said it is likely the league is headed for
its first shortened season in more than 50 years of existence.
</P>
<P>
   Stalled collective-bargaining negotiations between the league
and representatives of the players' union have left Stern doubtful
the 1998-99 season will start as scheduled Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such hope as there is (to start the season on time) seems to
be dwindling,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   The league already has canceled some exhibition games and pushed
back the opening of training camps indefinitely. One NBA insider
said late last week that the season will start about one month
after arbitrator John Feerick rules on the union's claim that
guaranteed contracts must be paid during a lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Owners have been told Feerick will not render a decision until
the Oct. 19 deadline. That means the earliest the season could
begin would be mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   During an exclusive weekend interview, Stern also said NBA
owners who were reluctant to lose regular-season games to a work
stoppage in 1995 now are willing to accept such an outcome, which
is certain to alienate some fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners need the ability to agree on what percentage (of
basketball revenue) is fair,'' Stern said. ``We thought we did that
last time (with the '95 agreement). We knew there was a potential
problem in that last deal, but on the heels of a hockey lockout and
a baseball strike, we felt it was prudent to make sure we reached
an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players have conveniently forgotten that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with perhaps as many as 14 of the league's 29 teams
expecting to sustain a financial loss next season under the current
agreement, the owners are more willing than ever to test the
players' resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about us thinking that the players will cave (in)
after missing a paycheck,'' Stern said. ``It's just about having a
certain situation where we can get to a point where all (current)
contracts will be honored, where we'll continue to pay rookies as
much as they have been earning and where veterans will no longer be
subject to making a minimum salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA owners as a group have not tried to take away every
last dollar from the players. In fact, this system has seen the
(leaguewide) salaries go from $60 million to $1 billion (since the
salary cap was instituted in 1984). And it promises to go up, but
at a rate that is fair for the owners as well as the players.''
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the owners' lockout of the players is that the
collective-bargaining agreement that was signed in '95 called for
48 percent of all ``basketball-related income'' to be returned to
the players in the form of salary. If that number increased beyond
51.8 percent of the BRI, the owners reserved the right to reopen
the collective-bargaining agreement, which they exercised this
summer after paying more than 56 percent of the BRI to players.
</P>
<P>
   The owners' major complaint is that too many contracts have been
signed in recent years under the ``Larry Bird exception.'' Those
players can be re-signed by their teams for any salary when a
contract expires, without regard to where the team stands on the
salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Because players like Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo ($56 million),
Cleveland's Shawn Kemp ($99.5 million), Miami's Alonzo Mourning
($105 million), Seattle's Gary Payton ($88 million), Washington's
Juwan Howard ($105 million), Minnesota's Kevin Garnett ($126
million) and Vancouver's Bryant Reeves ($63 million) have signed
such lucrative multiyear contracts, owners have seen their total
payrolls leap well beyond the salary cap, which was $26.9 million
per team last season. Players at the top of the pay scale are
chewing up too much of the payroll, owners claim.
</P>
<P>
   While it appears certain the start of the season will be
delayed, Stern would not comment on how much of the season the
league was prepared to lose, yet still play a season. One NBA
executive said recently that the league is not prepared to play a
50-game season. If that much time is lost at the beginning of the
schedule, the season would be scrapped altogether, the executive
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most estimations have the league missing the month of November,
which would mean about 15 games would be lopped off the normally
82-game schedule. That would leave around 67 games for a regular
season. That number still would be acceptable to owners, the
executive said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a point beyond which the season loses its
credibility,'' he said. ``There wouldn't be a 50-game season, for
instance.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners have given the players two proposals for a new
collective-bargaining agreement. The bottom line of both is that
the players would have at least $1 billion in salary for the coming
season, an average of about $2.5 million per player. That number
would go up at least 20 percent over the next four seasons, Stern
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about lowering salaries,'' Stern emphasized.
``We just want to see that the salaries don't grow quite as fast as
they have in recent years.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yankees manager Joe Torre has this problem every time
he faces the Rangers in a playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Cecil Fielder had to sit for Game 1 when the
Yankees met the Texas Rangers in the playoffs. Fielder, a
right-handed batter, didn't matchup as well against against
right-handed pitcher John Burkett.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Darryl Strawberry will be riding the bench when
the two teams begin their divisional playoff series at Yankee
Stadium with Todd Stottlemyre on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Torre's decision had nothing to do with Strawberry's infected
lower abdomen. He had already decided on using Chad Curtis in left
field and Chili Davis at designated hitter because Davis has career
numbers against Stottlemyre than Strawberry and Curtis is the
better fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Some problem. A player on the bench like Strawberry, who hit 24
home runs in 295 at-bats, speaks to the depth that Torre has
enjoyed this season and in the 1996 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry will sit with Tim Raines, Luis Sojo and Joe Girardi,
three other veterans who have played regularly at some point in
their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Torre is also sitting Homer Bush, a reserve infielder who hit
.380 this year, and outfielder Shane Spencer, the rookie who caused
a late-season sensation in New York when he hit 10 home runs in 67
at-bats, including three grand slams.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how you win 114 games,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   A $63 million payroll, not counting portions of salaries being
picked up for players traded to other teams, allows the Yankees to
command this kind of depth. It's how they survived the loss of
Davis for 118 games because of a broken ankle and Bernie Williams
for 31 games because of a sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   It has also forced Torre to make tough decisions on who plays
and who sits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough decision but it makes a tough decision easier
when you have those caliber of players,'' Torre said. ``That's the
fun part because it's tough to make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre also benefits from players who have willingly accepted
subordinate roles. Raines is a former base-stealing and batting
champion who played regularly in the 1996 postseason when the
Yankees won a World Series. Now his playing time could be limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to play,'' Raines said. ``But Joe is going with the
lineup he wants. I'm all for that. I'd love to play, but we've got
a good ballclub. We all do whatever it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Torre, ``It's nice when you have players who have taken the
attitude they have. They want to win and they understand it's not
an easy decision. They respect each other's abilities, so it makes
it easier when they understand only one guy can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Success has made it easier to accept. The Yankees not only won
114 games but also led the league with 965 runs scored. Torre can
afford to sacrifice offense for defense in left field and still
start a formidable lineup against Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a great lineup,'' Stottlemyre said. ``They're
unbelievable. They proved they're the best in the East to this
point by winning as many games as they did. They not only did it
offensively, they did it defensively. But one through nine, every
guy that steps to the plate has a chance to leave the ballpark at
any time.''

SHUTTERED GM PLANT REBORN AS SHOPPING MALL

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was more than the grand opening of a store.
</P>
<P>
   The first day of business for Party City on Monday was a sure
sign that the former General Motors plant where the store's located
would once again be an asset to the neighborhood, not an eyesore
and reminder of the 2,600 jobs lost.
</P>
<P>
   Six years after GM pulled out of its Van Nuys Boulevard site,
area residents said they are looking forward to having new places
to shop and work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally,'' declared Chris Batiste, a Van Nuys resident who
went to Party City to pick up a wedding ring pillow, bridal
invitations and a photo album for his upcoming nuptials.
</P>
<P>
   Party City is the first of 35 new businesses to open at what is
being called The Plant, a 370,000-square-foot commercial center
that will include an industrial section with two manufacturing
companies.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of the GM plant is being considered to house a Los
Angeles Police Department traffic division, a decision that hinges
in part on a bond measure the City Council is in the process of
approving to be placed on a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Party City, part of a national chain of party supply stores,
threw open its doors earlier than the other stores to catch the
Halloween season shoppers. It also caught its share of job
applicants, among them Fleurette Guerrero, who trekked from
Babies-R-Us to Ross Dress For Less to Party City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the site is doing good for the community because it's
offering a lot of job opportunities,'' Guerrero said as she stood
outside Party City. ``Hopefully there will be less poverty in the
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was she applying for herself, but sometimes Guerrero
took as many as three applications at a time for friends or
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Guerrero's aunt lost her job at the GM plant, but
today the new commercial site might hold possible employment for
Guerrero, a 21-year-old stay-at-home mother from Panorama City, a
Los Angeles-area suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The new commercial center is expected to economically revitalize
the area, bringing in a total of 2,000 new jobs _ 1,000 at the
industrial site, which will include Ricon Corp., a manufacturer of
wheelchair equipment, and an apparel manufacturer that has not yet
officially joined the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jobs that will be provided both on the retail side and on
the industrial side are competitive with jobs elsewhere in the (San
Fernando) Valley,'' said Councilman Richard Alarcon, who
spearheaded the effort to redevelop the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Although some have criticized the commercial center for offering
lower-paying jobs than those held by the former GM workers, Alarcon
said that, on average, jobs at the industrial site will pay from
$10 an hour to some as high as $100,000 a year for engineering
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who have ideas of what should be
there, but it takes an investment to make this development work,''
said Alarcon, who represents the section of Van Nuys including The
Plant. ``The jobs will be much better than the average jobs within
five miles of the site. I think it's a good match for the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Babies-R-Us store, manager Lessell Jackson has been
swamped with more than 700 applications over the past six weeks for
70 positions that he already has filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community is really hungry for jobs,'' Jackson said as
employees scurried about stocking shelves. ``The community is
excited about growth and jobs that become available.''
</P>
<P>
   The store, scheduled to open next Monday, will be the first
Babies-R-Us in the San Fernando Valley. The nearest California
stores are in West Covina and Oxnard.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners near the new commercial center also welcomed the
new center. Adam Choi, who owns Avila's Liquor Store directly
across from the center, said he lost 80 percent of his business
when the GM plant closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it. I think the new stores will bring in some more
business,'' said Choi, who expects business to increase by at least
40 percent. The new stores have also brightened the area, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said it's like Christmastime because before they
started construction, it was all dark,'' said Choi. ``Now we have
all kinds of lights from the store signs.''
</P>
<P>
   At nearby L&AMP;S Auto Radio and Collision, owner Lee Garbell said
the area has received a much-needed face lift thanks to the new
commercial center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Van Nuys area and Panorama City was really affected
by the closure of the plant, so hopefully this new center will
bring the economy back,'' said Garbell. ``If we get any added
business, it's just frosting on the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Garza, a resident of Blythe Street, which dead ends at
The Plant, said she's already noticed improvements in the area,
thanks to the construction of the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a lot of kids dressed like cholos who would
hang around these corners, but now you don't see that very often,''
said Garza as she stood on the corner of Van Nuys Boulevard and
Blythe Street. ``Thanks to the new stores, things are improving
here.'' &QL;

CONFIDENT ASTROS LOOK TO MAKE FRANCHISE HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Houston Astros have never won a playoff series in
their 37-year existence.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, they've never had an offensive lineup like
this year's. Or a pitcher like Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win, lose or draw, I really believe this is the best team this
franchise has ever put on the field,'' Astros general manager Gerry
Hunsicker said last week. ``We've got all the pieces in place to
win this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, a World Series in The Astrodome has seemed as
ridiculous as those hideous orange-and-yellow seats. But that's the
realistic goal of the Astros as they begin their National League
Division Series against the San Diego Padres on Tuesday at 3 p.m.
Games 1 and 2 of the best-of-five series are in Houston before the
series shifts to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year when the (Atlanta) Braves swept us (in the first
round of the playoffs), I said we had to make some changes to get
better,'' said manager Larry Dierker. ``Well, we've made the
changes and we've gotten better, much better. I'm not making
guarantees, but I like our chances as good as anyone else's.''
</P>
<P>
   With good reason. The Astros finished a franchise-best 102-60,
behind only the New York Yankees and Braves. Their offense led the
NL, setting club records with 868 runs and 165 home runs while
their pitching staff finished second in the league with a 3.53 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying they're the best team in baseball,'' said
Chicago Cubs manager Jim Riggleman. ``But the gap between them and
Braves is real, real small. If there is one at all. They can hit,
they can pitch, and they make very few mistakes. They're for
real.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense is again fueled by the Killer B's: Craig Biggio,
Derek Bell and Jeff Bagwell. But it's the addition of Moises Alou
that the Astros believe will provide the punch missing last year. A
member of the world champion Florida Marlins a year ago, Alou set a
club record with 337 total bases and hit .313 with 38 homers and
124 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   With his presence, the Astros became just the third NL team in
50 years to feature four players scoring 100 runs and all but
Biggio (88 RBI) also hit 20 homers and drove in 100 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't have any weak spots,'' said Biggio, the
scrappy second baseman who became only the second player this
century (along with Hall-of-Famer Tris Speaker in 1912) to record
50 doubles and 50 steals. ``If you go through the meat of our order
four times, chances are you're going to give up some runs.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's the big acquisition of the fireballing Johnson that has
the Astros confident, bordering on cocky.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining Houston an hour before the July 31 deadline,
Johnson has gone 10-1, including 7-0 with a 1.16 ERA in his past
seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my time of year and this is why Houston brought me
here, to win games in October,'' said Johnson, who struck out 329
with Seattle and Houston to lead the majors for the fifth time. ``I
know they're counting on me, but this was a great team before I got
here. I just hope I can be that missing piece to the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, who calls having the edge of throwing Johnson three
times in a seven-game series ``the luxury of luxuries,'' plans to
go with a three-man rotation including 19-game winner Shane
Reynolds and lefty Mike Hampton. The only mild concern entering
October is closer Billy Wagner, who blew five saves and struggled
with his aggressiveness after taking a line drive to the head in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Last year a Central Division title and a playoff appearance was
enough. But with the additions of Alou and Johnson and a
record-setting regular season, a trip to the NLCS is almost a
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the division again is a great step forward,'' owner
Drayton McLane Jr. said recently. ``But I think we're good enough
to be focusing on bigger things.''

<P>
   CHICAGO _ The second most exciting race of the season was
decided here on Monday night. That doesn't say much for the
competitive part of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The final spot in the post-season playoffs, the National League
wild-card berth, was filled by the Chicago Cubs, who beat the San
Franciso Giants, 5-3, in a playoff game that was the culmination of
a race that no team could win because no team was good enough to
win it.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets certainly weren't. With a week to go in the
season, with only five games to play, the Mets led the wild-card
race. They were one game ahead of the Cubs, four ahead of the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a doctorate in calculus to figure out that to be
bad enough to squander a four-game lead with five games to play,
the leading team has to lose just about every game. That's exactly
what the Mets did.
</P>
<P>
   If they had won just one of those five games, the Mets would
have played San Francisco at Shea Stadium on Monday. Then, if they
had won that game, they would have played the Cubs at Shea Stadium
on Tuesday. Then maybe they would have joined Atlanta, Houston and
San Diego in the post-season playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets had won two of those final five games, beating
Montreal last Tuesday and Wednesday, for example, the Giants and
the Chicago Cubs would not have played at Wrigley Field on Monday
night. There would have been no need for a playoff for the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets turned out to be too mediocre to alter the course
of October events.
</P>
<P>
   And what about those mighty Giants and Chicago Cubs, the teams
that benefited from the Mets' ultimate failure? In the final week,
they each squandered a 7-0 lead in a game. If either team had held
its hefty lead, it would have advanced as the wild-card team,
instead of meeting in a playoff game that automatically took on an
air of excitement because playoff games are supposed to be
exciting.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Jim Riggleman, the Cubs' manager, absolved the
Giants of their squandering while not taking his team off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their loss was different,'' he said before the playoff game.
``They lost their game in Colorado. Watching their score, when it
was 7-0, at that point in the game you figure they may score 14 or
Colorado may score 10 or 12. You just can't figure the score is
going to stay anything close to what it is in the fourth. You
figure it's going to be hugely different.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, on the other hand, blew their 7-0 lead in the seventh
inning in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our loss was probably more painful than theirs,'' Riggleman
said. ``We had a 7-0 lead in a normal atmosphere of a ball park. No
crazy conditions, light air, ball flying all over the place. We
should've been able to hold that lead. In Colorado you can never
really fault yourself for giving up a lead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs at least won two of their last five games to get to a
playoff game, though they could not win on the last day to avoid a
playoff. The Giants didn't win the last game either, but they won
their first six in the last week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Magowan, the Giants' proud owner, rejected any suggestion
that the playoff for the playoffs was a matchup born of mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won 9 out of 11, even with the loss yesterday,'' Magowan
said outside the visiting clubhouse, ``so don't tell me this is a
bunch of losers that are showing up to play this game. If we win
this game, we've won 90 games. What did the Indians win this
year?''
</P>
<P>
   Touche. The Indians won 89 and a division title. Not to mention
that a year ago the wild-card Florida Marlins were about to embark
on a course that would make them World Series champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wild card gives a lot of teams a chance for post-season
play that otherwise wouldn't have been able to be there because of
economics,'' Magowan said, casting a vote for the continued
existence of wild-card teams. He also cited the increased September
attendance of teams in the wild-card races.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean baseball should expand the wild-card format, the
way the National Football League did? No, Magowan said firmly. One
wild-card team in each league is enough. Riggleman didn't campaign
for any format, but he also didn't think any losses leading up to
the playoff for the playoffs, including those on the final day of
the season, detracted from the show at Wrigley Field on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is,'' the manager said, ``this game will be
remembered, not that both clubs lost yesterday. I certainly know if
we were going to play this game tonight, I'd want it to be because
both teams won, not because both teams lost.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the only real excitement of the season should
have been for Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. No one should have
become excited over a race of also-rans. &QL;

WESTCHESTER PASSES ON TAX-FREE SHOPPING WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ The Westchester County legislature voted
Monday night against participating in the state's next tax-free
shopping week, scheduled for January, concluding that although it
would help the county's merchants, it would do so at the cost of a
property tax increase for homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-6 vote to keep the county's sales tax in place sets
Westchester apart from most of the other counties and cities in the
state, which have so far embraced the state Legislature's plan to
eliminate the sales tax on some clothing purchases as a means of
persuading people not to leave New York state to shop.
</P>
<P>
   For a week before the vote, County Executive Andrew Spano, a
Democrat, warned the Democratic-controlled Legislature that a
recent report by a business group, the Westchester County
Association, said the reductions in tax revenue would necessitate
an increase in property tax. The report estimated that the county
would lose $27 million to $35 million in revenue a year if it
eliminated the sales tax permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad for the economy and it's bad for the residents,''
Spano said in a telephone interview. ``I made a promise to the
people that I would not raise their taxes, and I won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's vote addressed only the next tax-free week _ Jan.
17 to 24 _ which applies to clothing and shoes that sell for less
than $500. The vote, however, is considered an indicator of how
Westchester lawmakers will vote next year when they have to decide
on a permanent sales tax exemption for shoes and clothing selling
for less than $110. The permanent sales tax exemption was approved
by the state Legislature in August and is to go into effect on Dec.
1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The sales tax rate in Westchester municipalities, including the
4.25 percent levied by the state, varies from 6.75 percent to 8.25
percent. The four largest cities set their own sales tax rates and
the mayors of each of them have said they plan not to participate
in future sales tax exemptions. In White Plains, the state and
local sales tax rate is 7.75 percent, while in Yonkers, New
Rochelle and Mount Vernon it is 8.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the range of sales and property tax rates, each
Westchester community would feel the impact of the tax change
differently. The report estimated that an average homeowner in
White Plains, for example, would see an increase of at least $218
in property taxes to compensate for the loss of sales tax revenue.
That homeowner would have to spend at least $6,200 a year on
clothing or shoes that cost less than $110 to make up for the $218
in added property tax. An average Peekskill homeowner would have to
buy $1,146 worth of tax-free items and a Scarsdale homeowner would
have to buy $5,674 worth, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agreed with the report's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the numbers the administration is floating around are
a little inflated,'' said James Maisano, a legislator from New
Rochelle. ``They looked at the September tax-free shopping week
figures, but don't forget that was back-to-schools week, so people
were shopping more and buying more.''
</P>
<P>
   Maisano voted for the tax-free week and said he wanted to see a
study that examined the economic impact of not adopting the plan
when communities all around Westchester were planning to adopt it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the surrounding communities decide to opt in, what will
that do to the retail industry and jobs in Westchester?'' Maisano
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Spano said he did not think shoppers would leave Westchester to
shop in other counties because the difference between being charged
just the local sales tax and being charged no sales tax at all was
negligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state's going to eliminate its 4.25 percent anyway,''
Spano said. ``We don't feel that people are going to hop into their
cars and pay the toll to go to Rockland County or drive into the
Bronx to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers in the gleaming malls in White Plains may not notice
much of a difference in forthcoming tax-free periods, since that
city charged its normal 2 percent tax during the last two tax-free
weeks, in January and earlier this month.

VACCO ATTACKS CHALLENGER ON FINANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Attorney General Dennis Vacco's re-election campaign
sought Monday to put his Democratic challenger, Eliot Spitzer, on
the defensive about finances, saying Spitzer had failed to explain
how he was paying for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Vacco, a Republican, contended that public records do
not support the assertion by Spitzer, a wealthy real estate heir,
that he obtained millions of dollars for his current campaign and
one in 1994 by taking out loans against co-op apartments that he
owns.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer is either lying about the source of his money or has
failed to file the required disclosure documents, said Vacco's
campaign manager, Matthew Behrmann. Either way, Behrmann said, the
allegation raises questions about whether Spitzer is fit to be
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are substantial inconsistencies in what Spitzer has said
and what is in the documents that are available,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer brushed aside the charges. ``This is Dennis Vacco trying
to kick dirt on old news,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In making the charges, the Vacco campaign is following a
strategy adopted by Spitzer's Democratic rivals in the primary.
Spitzer, a former Manhattan prosecutor whose father is a real
estate magnate, has spent more than $6 million so far on the two
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, Spitzer can spend an unlimited amount of his
own money on his campaign, but can receive no more than roughly
$100,000 from his father. Spitzer's rivals have questioned whether
his father or other family members made illegal contributions to
his campaign. Monday, Spitzer asserted that his Democratic rivals
had been unable to prove a shred of wrongdoing on his part.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had used eight co-op apartments that he owns at 200
Central Park South in Manhattan as collateral on the loans,
explaining that the apartments were worth $7 million to $10
million. He said he was not sure whether the bank or his lawyers
had filed all the disclosure documents on the loans, but would tell
his lawyers to make sure that proper procedures were followed.
</P>
<P>
   He then fired back at Vacco, stepping up his attacks on the
incumbent's ethics. ``If this is what his campaign wants to do,
point the finger, then I can point it right back,'' Spitzer said.
``He has accepted contributions from people who work for him, from
companies that he has been investigating. I really don't think that
he is in a position to raise questions about me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spitzer campaign also tried to regain the offensive by
renewing its focus on Vacco's motives in hiring and firing lawyers.
Aides to Spitzer have said Vacco has a record of dismissing skilled
lawyers and replacing them with novices who have links to the
Republican and Conservative Parties.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's aides released several documents that were obtained
from lawsuits filed by some of the fired lawyers against Vacco and
his aides. Among the documents are copies of evaluations of some of
the new lawyers written by senior members in the office. One
lawyer, who is not identified, is criticized for ``lack of effort''
and for filing legal papers that are ``void of substantive input.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said Vacco's hiring practices had sent ``an unmistakable
signal: politics first, competence second and ethics dead last.''
</P>
<P>
   Behrmann called all of Spitzer's charges baseless. ``It's
logically inconsistent, given the reductions in crime that the
attorney general has been able to achieve, with the national awards
won by the staff,'' he said.

STOTTLEMYRES GET A SECOND REUNION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Right-hander Todd Stottlemyre, the Texas Rangers'
scheduled starter Tuesday night, will share Yankee Stadium with his
father for the second time this season. Stottlemyre's father, Mel,
is the Yankees' pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Stottlemyre pitched six innings during the Rangers'
16-5 victory Aug. 15 against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an emotional day,'' Stottlemyre recalled. ``That was
the first time we were able to share the same field professionally
together. It was emotional for my mom and my wife. I'm sure it was
for Dad, too, sitting in the Yankees' dugout. I'm glad this is not
the first time. I'm glad we've already jumped that hurdle.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Stottlemyre also expects Tuesday night's scenario to
be much more difficult for his father emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question about it,'' the pitcher said. ``I guess I would
look at it the same way if I had a son playing, yet he's very
competitive by nature. He has a true affection for his pitching
staff and their ballclub, so _ knowing how competitive he is _ I
expect that he wants the Yankees to win. At the same time, this has
to be really difficult when your son is in a different-colored
uniform pitching against you. I think it's obviously a lot tougher
for him.'' JUAN IS NOT ENOUGH
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander David Wells, the Yankees' scheduled starter Tuesday,
respects Rangers right fielder Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Wells also recognizes that Gonzalez alone can't beat the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, recall, hit .438 (7-for-16) with five home runs and
nine runs batted in during the Rangers' 1996 Division Series
against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers lost that best-of-five series after the remaining
members of the lineup hit only .190 with one home run and seven
RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't do it by himself,'' Wells said. ``He needs other guys
to be on base. You have to be careful with him, though. He hits the
ball all over, and he's very strong. If you were to pitch around
someone, he'd be the guy. You have to pitch to him, though. He's
not a super hero, but he's pretty damn close.'' WATCH OUT LEFTIES
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' .316 batting average against left-handers led the
major leagues, and left-handed starters went 12-23 with a 6.49
earned-run average in 48 starts against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   That does not bode well for Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to throw strikes, get ahead in the count and don't
make mistakes, because if you do, they have the kind of guys who
can capitalize,'' he said. ``You have to try and keep them on their
front foot and move the ball in and out. You have to pitch to their
weaknesses and your strengths and not be too fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells was 1-0 with a 6.11 ERA in three starts against the
Rangers this season, and they hit .311 against him. A STEP UP
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Todd Zeile, who normally hits eighth in the
Rangers' lineup, likely will bat seventh Tuesday against Wells,
manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile hit .433 (13-for-30) with three home runs and eight RBI in
his final 11 games and established a Rangers record Friday by
reaching base safely in 11 consecutive plate appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Oates' decision means that designated hitter Mike Simms likely
will bat eighth in front of shortstop Royce Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Zeile is swinging the bat pretty well right now,''
Oates said. ``Zeile is hot.''

A SEASON WITH SAMMY AND THE OVERACHIEVERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Harry Caray, the Cubs broadcaster who had a bit of a
problem with names, liked to call Sammy Sosa ``Salsa.'' Sosa didn't
mind. Since Caray died at the start of spring training, Sosa has
honored him with a ``V'' sign after every home run this season,
along with his heart thumps and kisses for the Sosa family.
</P>
<P>
   That's 66 ``V'' signs, more than Churchill and Nixon had in
their best years combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Harry Caray were alive today, I would be so happy,'' Sosa
said last week. ``The way he was every day, pulling for the Chicago
Cubs, this would have been the season he probably would have died
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hook a heart monitor up to any Cubs fan, and you will see the
effects of Sammy and the Overachievers, a group of oddballs and
castoffs. They provided ``holy cow!'' moments until the last day of
the regular season, and even the day after that, when the Cubs beat
the Giants, 5-3, to earn the National League wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   These Cubs were no thoroughbreds. The defense was shaky, the
bullpen untrustworthy. No lead was too large for them to lose, no
deficit too large to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most exciting year I've seen in baseball,'' said
Mr. Cub, Ernie Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Cubs were the dullest team in memory: few home runs,
few stolen bases and few victories.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, they didn't get along. The tension started with an
0-for-14 losing streak, and boiled over on the last weekend, when
Sosa ignored a hold sign and tried to steal second. He was thrown
out, then was chewed out by Manager Jim Riggleman in front of the
team. After the last game, Riggleman gave a ``me, me, me'' speech
against self-indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that speech should be in Cooperstown. Sosa said it did
the team good. ``We weren't all together last year,'' he said when
spring training began. ``People who know me know I don't play for
myself. I'm a team player.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Cubs' problem wasn't Sosa, who provided a quarter of the
team's runs last year. Tired of a century of failure, the Cubs
raised their payroll by 15 percent this season, hiring five former
All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought from day one we were a division-championship-caliber
team,'' said Ed Lynch, general manager of the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   With the 10th-highest payroll in baseball at the start of the
season, the Cubs have managed the sixth-best record. And they had
their best season in a decade, doing far better than anyone
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look back at the season, we've beaten probably every
No. 1 pitcher in the league,'' the Cubs' hitting coach, Jeff
Pentland, said. ``And there's times when we've kind of looked like
we're a last-place team.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs were streaky: The season has really been 12 seasons,
with six successful periods followed by six downers, including
losses in six of their last eight games as they staggered into
Monday night's showdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs were homer-dependent: This team set a club record for
home runs, with 211 long balls providing four out of every 10
scores.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cubs were scary: Brant Brown's dropped fly ball that
cost a game in the last week of the season was unusual for him, but
not for the Cubs. Nearly half the Cubs' games were won or lost in
late innings. The team won 35 games in which it led after five
innings, and lost 38 in which it had led.
</P>
<P>
   These were among the 1998 Cubs highlights in various categories
of overachievement:
</P>
<P>
   The starters: Kerry Wood was called up from the minors to pitch
for the minimum salary, struck out a record 20 batters in a single
game before his 20th birthday and then missed the last month
because of a sore elbow. Kevin Tapani had a better record than Greg
Maddux's.
</P>
<P>
   The closer: Rod Beck came from the Giants, a $3.5 million
All-Star gunslinger known as Shooter. He hit a career high with 50
saves.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers: All-Star Mickey Morandini came from the Phillies,
adding an on-base percentage just short of .400, and a nearly
errorless glove at second. Henry Rodriguez, from Montreal, added
left-handed power, with 31 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa: A category to himself. He had the best year for a Cub
since the Great Depression and Hack Wilson, whose photo hangs next
to Sosa's locker.
</P>
<P>
   The focus has been on homers, as Sosa hit 66 and still didn't
finish on top. But Sosa has been more patient, hitting .308, and
leading the world in RBIs and total bases.
</P>
<P>
   As Sosa said: ``It's a beautiful year. No one is going to forget
1998. Thank you, Harry.'' &QL;

WINS RECORD NOT ENOUGH FOR YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees enter the playoffs with 114 victories,
the most in American League history. They know it won't be enough,
though, if they don't win the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to separate it,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``It's been
a special year in and of itself. But when you get to postseason, it
would be a disappointment if you didn't get to the World Series and
win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said pitcher David Wells, ``I don't think it's the most
important thing in the world, but it would certainly add to the
great season we've put together so far. But you can't just make it
happen, you have to go out and work for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells said if the Yankees do win the World Series, ``It would
probably be the best ever on the field. There have been a lot of
great individuals, but this would probably be the best team.
Everyone has contributed. No one has gotten big heads about what's
happened this year. Winning the World Series, if it happens, would
be because everyone came together.'' RUNNING YANKEES
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have stolen 153 bases this year, third most in the
American League. Now they have to go against Rangers catcher Ivan
Rodriguez, who threw out 52.5 percent of base runners trying to
steal against him.
</P>
<P>
   It could be the pivotal matchup of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be ready for anybody,'' Rodriguez said. ``I'm an
aggressive catcher and I'm going to do the same things I've always
done: be aggressive and concentrate on every situation.'' BALANCED
ATTACK
</P>
<P>
   Here's why the Yankees impress teams with their balance of speed
and power:
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' 207 home runs are the highest total in major-league
history for a team without having a single player hit at least 30
home runs. Tino Martinez leads with 28.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees tied a major-league record for having the most
players in double figures in home runs and stolen bases. The six
were Scott Brosius (19/11), Chad Curtis (10/21), Derek Jeter
(19/30), Chuck Knoblauch (17/30), Paul O'Neill (24/15) and Bernie
Williams (26/15).
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had eight players with 15 or more home runs, tying a
record set by the Rangers in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, with Jeter and Knoblauch each stealing 30 bases,
became only the third pair of middle infielders to steal that many
in a single season. The others were shortstop Jack Barry (30) and
second baseman Eddie Collins (38) for the 1911 Philadelphia
Athletics and shortstop Bert Campaneris (54) and second baseman
Phil Garner (35) for the 1976 Oakland Athletics.

CUBS FANS ACROSS AMERICA EMBRACE UNDERDOG TRADITION

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On Monday night the Chicago Cubs made the playoffs
for the first time since 1989, but for longtime fan Christopher
Durbin it marked the beginning of a whole new level of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cubs are like a car wreck. I don't want to look, but I
can't help it,'' said Durbin, a 36-year-old art director at NBC in
Burbank, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   After so many years of letdowns, Durbin is hopeful that his team
will go all the way in 1998. But deep down, he knows the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, there is going to be a tragedy,'' Durbin said.
</P>
<P>
   Durbin, who grew up in the Rogers Park section of Chicago, was
one of about 40 die-hard Cubs fans who showed up at the Tin Horn
Flats Bar &AMP; Grill in Burbank, a local hangout where Chicago natives
go to cheer on their local teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everyone here is a displaced Chicagoan or a closeted
Chicago fan who can come here without getting hassled,'' said Bill
Ahern, a 36-year-old North Hollywood resident who grew up in a
Chicago suburb called Hanover Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs are of course the biggest losers in baseball,
not having won a World Series since 1908 and not having played in
the World Series since 1945. Fans say its all because of the Billy
Goat Curse which a bar owner placed on the team after security at
Wrigley Field refused to let his goat in for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Mik Scriba, a 50-year-old actor who lives in Sherman Oaks, an
L.A.-area suburb, grew up in the Wrigleyville section of Chicago,
which is basically made up of the five blocks that surround Wrigley
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go to 60 home games a year,'' said Scriba.
</P>
<P>
   Giving up on the Cubs would be sacrilegious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be like switching to new parents. It's
psychologically impossible,'' Scriba said.
</P>
<P>
   While fans of other teams already are convinced that their
favorites will win the World Series, the Cubs fans were very
conservative in their predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking this is the year,'' Scriba said. ``All we
want to do is get into the post-season.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ahern has already bought into the fantasy that the Cubs are
going to win the World Series this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to always win to enjoy the game. You just have
to believe in the team, and this is the year,'' Ahern said.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs fanatics, of course, are used to the abuse. They've heard
the derision from fans of luckier teams, better teams _ the
accusation that only people addicted to pain could love such a
club.
</P>
<P>
   The reputation, they say, is all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not masochists _ we're just filled with hope,'' said
veteran stand-up comedian Tom Dreesen, whose routines often reflect
the heartbreak of following the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old Sherman Oaks resident has been rooting for the
team since growing up on Chicago's south side _ serious White Sox
territory, he notes. Following the luckless Cubs, he said, gives
fans a reason to live, to see another year in the hope that this
time, the team might just make it to the World Series. Lord knows
how many suicides the Cubs may have prevented this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that on the morning after they finally win the World
Series, there will be 50,000 people jumping out of buildings,''
Dreesen said.
</P>
<P>
   As it has with other lifelong fans, this year's amazing, Sammy
Sosa-driven season has left Dreesen in a state of bliss. Just as
Babe Ruth helped save baseball after the 1919 Black Sox scandal,
Dreesen said the gracious sportsmanship of Sosa and Mark McGwire
has restored luster to a sport tarnished by the 1994 players
strike, which made players and owners seem greedy in the eyes of
many fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have done the same thing as Ruth,'' Dreesen said.
``These guys have brought baseball back.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the Cubs leading 5-0 on Monday night at the bottom of
the eighth inning, Durbin couldn't relax.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, in the ninth inning San Francisco came back scoring
three runs and turning the last moments of the game a nail-biter
for the crowd at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the Cubs fan, no lead is safe,'' Durbin said. ``No way am I
comfortable, no way.'' &QL;

RED SOX IGNORING BAMBINO'S CURSE, PAST PLAYOFF FLOPS
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By David A. Markiewicz 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Cleveland Indians and the Boston Red Sox each
have a 1,000-pound gorilla called baseball history weighing on them
as they begin their series this afternoon. It's just that Boston's
gorilla is leaning a little bit harder.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland hasn't won a World Series in 50 years. Amazingly,
Boston hasn't won it all in 80 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have also lost 13 consecutive postseason games. The
Indians, by contrast, have played in the World Series two of the
past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why Red Sox manager Jimy Williams spent part of
yesterday deflecting inquiries about Boston's playoff flops, while
Indians players suggested that last year's heartbreaking loss in
Game 7 of the World Series actually has served as this year's
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Red Sox won was 1918. Back then, the team's
pitching star was none other than Babe Ruth. The Bambino was dealt
to New York shortly after, however, commencing a streak of
misfortune that has continued throughout the century.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent slide prompted Red Sox loyalists to bemoan ``The
Curse of the Bambino.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the ``Curse of the Bambino'' would be a factor in the
series, Williams responded, ``What's that?''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when asked about the horrors of the past, including Bill
Buckner's error which cost Boston the 1986 World Series, Williams
replied, ``I wasn't there. I was somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams probably doesn't want to think about the last time the
Red Sox were in the postseason, either. That was 1995, the year
Boston was swept by Cleveland in the divisional series. BIG MOMENT
FOR MARTINEZ
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez, who starts Tuesday's game, isn't
downplaying the personal significance of his moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot more than you'd expect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez explained that when it became clear last season that he
was not long for the Montreal Expos, he made it known that he
wanted to play for a contender. When he was traded to the Red Sox,
he said, he was initially disappointed because the franchise had
fallen on hard times in recent years and a postseason berth in 1998
appeared unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent five long years in Montreal,'' he said. ``And I didn't
get a chance like this. I'm going to take full advantage of it and
appreciate it all.'' COOL STARTERS
</P>
<P>
   Neither starting pitcher expects to have any opening-game
jitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too old for that,'' Martinez said. ``I don't think I
should be scared.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not scared or anything,'' added Indians Game 1 starter
Jaret Wright, a playoff and World Series veteran at the age of 22.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said he learned how to ``savor'' the playoff experience
last season when, among other highlights, he started Game 7 of the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to help me,'' he said. ``I sort of have a
feel of what is going on.'' INDIANS ADMIT STRUGGLES
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove and Indians players have had to
deal with criticism that the team appeared lackadaisical most of
the season, then barely stumbled into the second seed of the
playoffs during the final weekend of play.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't avoiding the charge during yesterday's workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We scuffled the whole year,'' catcher Sandy Alomar admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not disagree that we have played lethargic the last
month and a half,'' Hargrove said. ``Sometimes when you run into
great pitching it makes you look a little lethargic.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Indians could, as they appeared to do last year,
turn it on and off, Hargrove said, ``The switch has been flipped,
it just isn't working.'' ONE-SIDED SEASON
</P>
<P>
   Both managers discounted the importance of the regular-season
series between the two clubs, which is just as well for the
Indians. Boston dominated, taking eight of 11 games. Martinez, Game
2 starter Tim Wakefield and Game 3 starter Bret Saberhagen each
beat the Indians twice this season. The only Cleveland starter to
win a game against the Red Sox was Charles Nagy on July 22.

NEW YORK OFFERS TAX BREAK FOR COLLEGE SAVINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joining a growing number of states that give tax
breaks for college savings, New York launched a program Monday that
allows parents to save thousands of dollars in state taxes as they
put aside money for a child's college education.
</P>
<P>
   The program offers some of the most generous terms and widest
flexibility in the country, state officials said. Besides parents
saving for children, contributors can save money for the education
of other relatives, friends or themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers who live or work in New York will be able to deduct a
total of $5,000 a year from their taxable state income for
contributions to one or more Family Tuition Accounts; couples can
deduct up to $10,000 a year. Money put in the accounts _ and the
interest earned on that money _ will not be subject to any New York
state taxes. The interest earnings will also be protected from
federal income taxes until the money is withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   A couple making $40,000 a year or more and contributing the
maximum of $10,000 would save $685 annually in state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The program allows for a maximum total contribution of $100,000
per student, which could grow substantially depending on how, and
how long, the account is invested.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike prepaid tuition programs that require savings be used at
a particular college or in a particular state, New York will allow
the money to be spent at any accredited college or university,
professional or trade school, in the United States or abroad. The
money can be used for tuition, books, room and board, and other
educational fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty substantial tax deduction,'' said Robert
Maurer, president of New York State Higher Education Services
Corp., which will jointly administer the program with the state
comptroller's office. Referring to the top state tax rate of 6.85
percent, he said, ``It's like having the state put up the first 7
cents of every dollar you save for college.''
</P>
<P>
   The law creating the savings program, which had bipartisan
support in Albany, was signed into law by Gov. George Pataki in
September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At a New York City news conference announcing the start of the
program Monday, Sharon Steinhoff, a freelance editor, opened
accounts for her 13-year-old twins, Sarah and Seth, who attend the
Simon Baruch Middle School (MS 104) on East 21st Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have twins, the first thing people say to you is,
`How are you going to pay for college?''' she told an audience
including state Comptroller H. Carl McCall and New York City
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew. ``As a parent you don't want to have
to put a cap, if you don't have to, on how much you're going to
spend for a child's education.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Ms. Steinhoff, who herself attended Brown
University, ``Up to this point, it didn't make sense to save. There
were no benefits to be gained from a tax perspective, or we had to
lock up the money for a certain period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, she and her husband would use the new accounts
because of the tax benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The average price last year for a four-year private institution
was $21,424 for tuition, room and board, books and other fees, and
$10,069 at a four-year public institution. Many students, however,
pay less than these amounts because of financial aid and
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   State officials estimate that New York has 5 million families
with children of school age or younger. They predict that in the
first year alone, more than $135 million will be put into more than
50,000 accounts, for a tax savings of more than $22 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is going to be really big,'' Maurer said.
``Everyone tells you you ought to save for college. People are
going to want to do it because they want to see something there for
their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Other states, including Connecticut and New Hampshire, have also
set up college savings plans recently, following the passage of
federal legislation last year that clearly established the federal
tax benefits for such programs. Not only are federal taxes
deferred, but when earnings are withdrawn, they will be taxed at
the student's federal tax rate, which is often lower than the
contributor's. The federal rules also call for penalties if the
money is not used as intended.
</P>
<P>
   Under the New York plan, withdrawals will be subject to state
and federal taxes and a 10 percent penalty if the money is not used
for qualified educational expenses. But any money not used by the
intended beneficiary can remain in the account indefinitely or the
contributor can shift it to another beneficiary in the same family.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum investment to open an account is $250, or enrollment
in a plan to deduct $25 a month from a checking account or an
employer's payroll. An account must be open at least 36 months
before money may be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   People who pay income taxes in New York City or Yonkers would
also see their city taxes reduced when they make contributions
because those taxes are based on the calculation of taxable income
they make for the state.
</P>
<P>
   The tuition accounts will be managed by TIAA-CREF, a
not-for-profit financial services organization that manages more
than $230 billion, including pension fund accounts for many
university professors. It will invest the accounts in a mix of
stocks, bonds and money market instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Information about how to open an account is available over the
Internet at www.nysaves.org or by calling 1-877-NYSAVES. A national
clearinghouse of state plans is also available at
www.collegesavings.org.

STATE ATTORNEYS SAY TOBACCO INDUSTRY MISLED PUBLIC ON HEALTH
RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE MILETICH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The nation's largest cigarette makers embarked on a
45-year campaign to confuse and mislead the public about the health
dangers of their products, lawyers for Washington state said Monday
in joining 41 other states in their attack on the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   In five hours of remarks, the state combined old-fashioned
oratory with the most sophisticated technology ever used in a
Washington courtroom in outlining their multi-billion dollar case
to a King County Superior Court jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not tobacco companies. They are drug pharmaceutical
companies,'' attorney Steve Berman told the nine-women, three-men
jury in a trial that is being closely watched nationwide. ``And
they have lied about and hidden their true nature for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Displaying more than a dozen internal tobacco industry documents
on a ceiling-high screen, Berman and co-counsel Paul Luvera pulled
key paragraphs from the text with the help of a special computer
program previously used in the Oklahoma bombing trial of Timothy
McVeigh.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys will dispute the state's case Tuesday, denying
claims that major cigarette makers conspired to hide the dangers of
smoking, target minors with sophisticated advertising, manipulate
nicotine levels and suppress the development of a safer cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   They also will take the offensive, contending that the state has
effectively promoted the sale of tobacco products by licensing
cigarettes and collecting millions of dollars in taxes on them.
</P>
<P>
   The state's attorneys dismissed that argument Monday, saying the
state could never enforce its laws if that were true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our evidence will show that paying taxes is never an excuse
for breaking the law,'' Luvera said.
</P>
<P>
   Luvera and Berman, both private practitioners, were hired by the
state to help recover more than $2 billion in smoking-related
Medicaid costs from Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown &AMP;
Williamson, Lorillard and several other defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants have previously settled Medicaid cases with
Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota for sums totaling $38.5
billion and are facing similar suits brought by 37 other states.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are currently under way in New York between Philip
Morris and Lorillard to settle suits with Washington and the other
states. Brown &AMP; Williamson and R.J. Reynolds have declined to
participate but are closely watching the talks.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's opening remarks, Luvera and Berman described how the
top executives of the major tobacco companies secretly met at the
Plaza Hotel in New York in December 1953 to discuss their concerns
about a spate of new scientific reports linking cigarettes to
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   From that meeting, the companies agreed to hide the truth about
the health risks of their products, conceal damaging information
from government officials and restrict genuine research about the
effects of smoking, Luvera and Berman told the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state's position is that the tobacco defendants have
violated the civil laws by conspiring not to compete with each
other over issues like smoking and disease or by finding new ways
to reduce the risk of smoking,'' Luvera said.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, tobacco company officials acknowledged in internal
memorandums that they were actually in the business of selling
nicotine, a substance they described as addictive and ``a poison,''
Luvera said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are words they thought nobody else would see,'' Luvera
said, explaining that the documents weren't uncovered until several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the companies privately held those views, their
executives went before Congress in 1994 and publicly stated that
they didn't believe nicotine was addictive, Luvera said, playing a
videotape of their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also deliberately manipulated nicotine levels,
spraying ammonia on tobacco sheets to alter how cigarettes burned
and give them more of a ``kick,'' Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, cigarettes makers suppressed the manufacture
of safer products, in part because they had agreed in 1953 to share
all information on their research, thus removing any profit
incentive, Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy also led the tobacco industry to target minors,
largely because they knew most new smokers start when they are
young and rarely switch brands as they get older, Berman and Luvera
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before cigarette advertising was banned on television, cigarette
makers advertised on programs such as ``Gilligan's Island'' and the
``Beverly Hillbillies,'' knowing they were popular with children,
Luvera said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, R.J Reynolds developed the ``Joe Camel'' cartoon
character to directly appeal to minors and promote Camel
cigarettes, Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the tobacco industry's conduct, more people smoke
and suffer from diseases such as cancer, heart problems and
emphesema than would have if cigarette makers had been truthful,
Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   The state has paid about $2.2 billion in smoking-related
Medicaid costs, of which $1.4 billion are directly related to the
actions of the defendants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the companies are held liable for damages, the jury could
award either sum to the state, depending on whether it believes
responsibility can be precisely determined or whether it is too
confusing to allocate.
</P>
<P>
   The state also is seeking additional monetary penalties for
alleged violations of state consumer-protection and antitrust laws,
which would be fixed by the judge presiding over the case, George
Finkle, and could total billions of dollars.

</P>
<P>
   LOBBY-I (Washington) _ This year has been a banner year for K
Street, the power corridor of law and lobbying firms that rims the
White House in downtown Washington. At a time when the Democratic
administration and the Republican Congress are often at loggerheads
and Washington's agenda, dominated by scandal, seems inert, K
Street's portfolio has never been more robust. The influence
industry grew through the 1980s, but in the last few years it has
exploded with the advent of a divided government, creating a new
power elite in Washington. First of two parts. A Special Report. By
Jill Abramson.

   HEDGEFUND-ASIA (Hong Kong) _ In Asia, which has been scolded by

its rescue by a team of banks and brokerage firms. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   HEDGEFUND-BAILOUT (Undated) _ As lawyers sought to put the
proposed rescue of Long-Term Capital on a firm footing, the
financial markets focused on other hedge funds that may be at risk
from the recent market turbulence. Rich investors also seem to be
pulling back from hedge funds generally, spooked by the huge losses
at Long-Term. By Joseph Kahn and Peter Truell.
</P>
<P>
   MANAGED-HEALTHCARE (Undated) _ The fastest-growing managed
health care plans have become the ones that are hardly managed at
all. Unlike health maintenance organizations that typically keep
tight control over their members, the minimal health plans try to
keep costs in check simply by persuading doctors and hospitals to
agree to reduced or discounted fees. The loosely managed plans,
called preferred provider organizations, are not new, but their
popularity is surging. By Milt Fruedenheim.

   AOL-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ It's upgrade time at America Online.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has ordered the online
service, and the rest of the technology industry, to improve the

   SCI-ALIEN-HUNTING (Arecibo, Puerto Rico) _ SETI, or the search
for extraterrestrial intelligence, is at a turning point after
nearly four decades of hard work. With the arrival here of a new
crew from the SETI Institute, the field has reached a high point in
terms of telescope sensitivity, a top goal of the alien hunters.
But it has found no extraterrestrials so far, despite forecasts
that they should have been discovered by now. Instead, it has

   SCI-ANTISENSE (Undated) _ Of all the emerging technologies in
the biotech firmament, few have been so controversial as antisense,
the concept that small snippets of DNA can serve as drugs by
blocking the action of specific genes. With the Food and Drug
Administration's approval last month of the world's first antisense

   SCI-PREDICTION (Undated) _ When predictions go wrong, serious
problems can result. Some scientists call it ``misplaced
concreteness.'' And whether the problem is climate change,
earthquakes, droughts or floods, they say the tendency to overlook
uncertainties, margins of error and ranges of probability can lead
to damaging misjudgments. William K. Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BIGHORN-SHEEP (Bishop, Calif.) _ Though some experts
estimate that as little as 2 percent of the vast numbers of
bighorns of the West remain today, wildlife agencies in almost
every Western state have stabilized those numbers in recent years.
But even in states where bighorns are considered to be doing well,
individual herds are prone to catastrophic die-offs, largely from
disease. Some herds may be more susceptible to disease because the
changing Western landscape has left them isolated from other herds.
By Martin Forstenzer.

<P>
   SCI-VIKING-ARCHEO (Hole, Norway) _ Something is moving inside a
Viking burial mound said to be the ninth century tomb of King
Halvdan the Black. But some archeologists are loath to enter,
warning that whatever is in there could dissolve the spell of
enchantment that helped make Norway a nation. A recent subsidence
in a large, manmade hillock 30 miles northwest of Oslo has set off
a debate over the urgency and propriety of excavating the site to
save what could be the richest archeological cache in Scandinavia.

   SCI-MATERNAL-GENE (Undated) _ Mice know how to take care of
their babies by instinct, meaning that their maternal behavior is
in some way programmed into their genes. Biologists have now
identified one of the genes involved _ one that is sculpted or
imprinted by the father in a way that gives male mice a role in
shaping the female's maternal behavior. Even though human behavior
is far more flexible, a mother's nurturing instincts may take place
within the framework of the same set of genes as exist in mice
because mice and humans are very similar on the genetic level.
Indeed the human version of the mouse gene is also known to be
imprinted by the father. By Nicholas Wade.

IT'S ONE NIGHT TO CELEBRATE THE CUBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS to add Sosa quotes, more from game, tighten.) 
 (nk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Half past three Monday afternoon, they pulled up the
gates at the intersection of Clark and Addison and rolled out the
old kiosks from which the Wrigley Field programs are hawked at a
modern-day miracle price of 75 cents. There was one last ball game
in a remarkable baseball season, and no team was more entitled to
this prime-time slot than the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   They deserved their mini-World Series, their wild-card victory
over the stubborn Giants, for Ernie Banks, for Billy Williams, for
all the proud Cubbies who never experienced the thrill of looking
up at the center field scoreboard to see no out-of-town results.
They deserved it for Harry Caray, for contributing to the season
young Kerry Wood, for the enthusiasm they showed as the competitive
bystanders when Mark McGwire clubbed his 62nd home run in St. Louis
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Trachsel, server of the most memorable of all 70 McGwire
blasts, deserved to have the Cubs' bullpen not blow _ barely _ his
six and one-third innings of one-hit shutout ball. Most of all,
Sammy Sosa deserved this night, this 5-3 victory, for 66 home runs,
for pushing McGwire to astonishing heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' Sosa said afterward, exactly what went through
the minds of millions when Barry Bonds came to bat as the tying
run, the bases loaded and no one out, in the ninth. Unbelievable,
when the Cubs' dead-armed closer, Rod Beck, got the last two outs
pitching on fumes.
</P>
<P>
   All this anticipation, all this anxiety, all this energy, for
the likelihood of being first-round fodder for the Braves. The
Yankees and the Red Sox fought for the genuine division
championship in 1978, not to be the best of those who also ran.
Good for them. Every team lives with its own history of success and
failure. Every team has its own unique set of expectations,
priorities and perspective. This was so much more than a playoff to
join the playoffs for the Cubs. It was a chance to win the race _
any race _ knowing that the snickering masses believed all along
they would collapse, drop out, simply because of who they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spring training, a lot of people were picking the Cubs to
be the first sixth-place team in a five-team division,'' said Mark
Grace. ``We persevered. This is the most fun I've ever had playing
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace, the only remaining Cub from the 1989 team that lost to
the Giants in the playoffs, claimed beforehand that he had
exorcised the horrific defeats of the past 10 days, pronounced the
glass half full. If the Cubs could win, then they could drink to
beating the prohibitive odds of having the Brant Brown-like
calamity that sure seemed possible when Michael Jordan fired the
ceremonial first pitch over the catcher's head. Imminent disaster
has always been the Cubs' companion, which is why Grace tried to
explain to Gary Gaetti and Rod Beck a few weeks ago that this was
no ordinary chase they had stepped into. ``I know you guys have
been in the post-season,'' he told them. ``But until you do it in
Chicago, you don't know what a great feeling it is.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, win or lose, last night belonged to Cub lore.
For this one game, it was easy to ignore the fact that beyond their
charming logo and timeless home, the Cubs are owned by a rich media
company, just like the Dodgers, and they have one of baseball's
highest payrolls. Only history, at this point, has the right to
define the Cubs as lovable losers trying to conquer all odds, but
this has been a historic season. On this occasion, the slipper fit.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-0 lead into the ninth turned into a near nightmare. Terry
Mullholland, Sunday's Cubs starter in Houston, had to be brought
in, had to get Bonds out with the bags loaded, just as the southpaw
Felix Heredia had in the seventh. Bill Murray had grabbed Caray's
old microphone to sing baseball's most famous song, but only the
last Wrigley roar was music to Billy Williams's ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been there, but when you make it to the World
Series, I know there has to be less pressure than trying to get
there,'' said Williams, the Cubs' bench coach and resident Hall of
Famer. ``Not as much pressure as this.''
</P>
<P>
   This game, of course, was more about September than it was about
October. Next month will belong to the Braves, the Yankees,
certainly not the Cubs and their battered pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Last night was their World Series. They poured and sprayed
Champagne as if they'd won Game 7. Outside Wrigley, their fans
danced in the streets. Cubs win! Cubs win! Good for them.

IT'S NOT EASY, BUT CUBS FIND THE WAY INTO THE POST-SEASON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Sammy Sosa did not hit four home runs to share the
record with Mark McGwire. Steve Trachsel did not pitch a no-hitter.
But the Chicago Cubs did gain a chance to win their first
post-season series since 1908.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, who last won the World Series in that post-season 90
years ago, advanced to the first round of this year's playoffs by
defeating the San Francisco Giants, 5-3, on Monday night and
winning the first playoff for the National League wild-card spot in
the four-year history of the wild-card format.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, who last played post-season games in 1989, will play
the Braves in Atlanta on Wednesday afternoon. They were put on the
plane to Atlanta chiefly by Trachsel, who did not allow a hit until
he had one out in the seventh inning; by Felix Heredia, who retired
Barry Bonds on an inning-ending grounder with the bases loaded in
the seventh; by Terry Mulholland, who held Bonds to a sacrifice fly
with the bases loaded and none out in the ninth; and by Gary Gaetti
and Matt Mieske, 1998 newcomers to the Cubs, who each drove in two
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa did not hit a home run, leaving him with 66 and officially
putting McGwire into the record book as the single-season
record-holder with 70 home runs. Sosa batted 15 times without
hitting a home run since he hit No. 66 last Friday night and
slipped ahead of McGwire for all of 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, however, continued his most valuable player contribution
to the Cubs, stroking a pair of singles and scoring the final two
runs, which became critical when the dormant Giants rallied for
three runs in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working hard all year,'' said Sosa, who had said
all along that his No. 1 priority was not home runs but the
playoffs. ``It's been an unbelievable 1998. I'll never forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other seasons when the Cubs disappointed themselves
and their fans, pre-game preparations did not become washed away in
the tears of another failure. Clubhouse workers had rolled up heavy
plastic covers on the tops of the players' lockers, waiting there
to be dropped over the fronts of the lockers to spare their
contents from a Champagne celebration. Jimmy Bank, the traveling
secretary, had prepared travel itineraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We leave tomorrow afternoon for Atlanta,'' Bank said before
the game to one player who had asked. ``I'm going to give out the
itinerary after the game tonight.'' And he was able to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel's was perhaps the most important contribution to
keeping failure away. The 27-year-old right-hander had labored
recently _ in fact, since he threw the pitch that became the
McGwire home run that broke Roger Maris' record. In four starts
beginning with that game on Sept. 8, Trachsel had been battered for
19 earned runs in 212/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants did not hit him on Monday night. Instead Trachsel
walked them, six in all, but he permitted none of them to score.
</P>
<P>
   He walked two batters and hit another batter in the fourth,
loading the bases with two out, then threw a third strike past
Brian Johnson. He held the Giants hitless until Brent Mayne lined a
one-out, pinch-hit single to right field in the seventh. After
Trachsel followed the hit by walking Armando Rios, another
pinch-hitter, Manager Jim Riggleman changed pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' Trachsel said of his playoff experience, the
first in his six seasons. ``The way the fans were going, the
adrenaline was flowing. I threw 120 pitches and it felt like I
threw 40.''
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel, Bonds said, was the best he had ever seen him.
``Trachsel pitched great,'' Bonds said. ``We never got any momentum
going with less than two outs. You tip your hat when a guy can
pitch like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Riggleman used six pitchers, including two starters as
relievers: Kevin Tapani in the eighth inning plus two batters in
the ninth, and Terry Mulholland, who as the starter Sunday's
pitched eight innings, for three batters in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Beck had pitched the previous two games, going two and
two-thirds innings on Sunday in a vain effort to put the Cubs in
the playoffs without the extra game. He entered on Monday night
with two runs in, one out and runners at first and third.
</P>
<P>
   First, he induced Jeff Kent, who led the Giants with 127 runs
batted in, to ground into a force play at second on which the third
run scored, then retired Joe Carter, batting most likely for the
last time in his 16-year career, on a foul pop to first.
</P>
<P>
   The final out sent the Cubs and their fans, inside Wrigley Field
and out on surrounding streets, into a frenzy. ``It's a lot of fun
playing in Chicago for the Cubs, but it's a lot more fun winning
for the Cubs,'' said Mark Grace, their 11th-year first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Gaetti has been playing for the Cubs only since they signed him
on his 40th birthday, Aug. 19, after St. Louis had released him.
After Henry Rodriguez led off the fifth inning with a single,
Gaetti drove a Mark Gardner pitch into the left-field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, who had not lost any of his 10 starts since July 30,
retired the next three batters, but Lance Johnson and Sosa singled
one out apart in the sixth. Manager Dusty Baker replaced Gardner
with Rich Rodriguez, who walked Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Riggleman then pulled Henry Rodriguez, a left-handed hitter, and
used a right-hander, Mieske, who had batted only 110 times this
season. But Mieske lined a single to right, and Johnson and Sosa
raced home. In the eighth Sosa singled with one out, raced to third
as Grace lined a double to right and scored on Jose Mesa's wild
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants finally scored in the ninth, and even threatened to
catch the Cubs. Singles by Mayne and Bill Mueller brought
Mulholland in for Tapani, and Stan Javier singled Mayne home. Ellis
Burks drew a walk as a pinch-hitter, loading the bases again for
Bonds. This time he hit a sacrifice fly to right field for the
second run and the first out.
</P>
<P>
   Beck relieved Mulholland, and Carter, after the force play, was
unable to duplicate the home run he hit to win the 1993 World
Series for Toronto over Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Did someone say World Series? The Cubs are one of only eight
teams that have a chance to win this year's World Series.

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ From the eastern reaches of New Orleans to
Pensacola, Fla., Hurricane Georges pounded the Gulf Coast on Monday
with destructive winds and even more destructive rains, then slowly
lost much of its punch as it drifted along the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Battering the beaches, towns and cities of Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with winds up to 100
miles an hour and more than a foot of rain, it left trees uprooted,
power lines down, roads washed out and hundreds of homes and
businesses badly knocked about or flooded.
</P>
<P>
   It spawned tornadoes, most harmless, though the winds of one
were clocked at 174 mph. The hurricane pounded a crippled ship and
the tug that was towing it so hard that Coast Guard officials
worried both might founder. And it was blamed for two deaths in New
Orleans, one occurring when an elderly woman suffered a heart
attack while being evacuated from her flooded home and the other
occurring when a man set his darkened house afire while trying to
light it with a candle.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was also blamed for the death of a Pensacola woman who
was killed Sunday in a house fire. Authorities believe she was
lighting a candle because there was no power.
</P>
<P>
   By later in the day, the winds had diminished, and the storm was
downgraded to a tropical storm. By late Monday night the winds had
fallen to 45 mph as the storm drifted slowly to the
south-southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters, along with public safety officials, warned that
because the storm was so saturated with rain after a slow meander
across the tropical waters of the Gulf, and because it was moving
inland so slowly, the Gulf Coast and the rest of the Deep South
should be on the lookout for heavy flooding over the next several
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not quite out of the water yet,'' Police Chief Ben
Morris told the residents of Slidell, La., on the Mississippi
border, as they began to emerge from shelters and boarded up homes
to take up the task of cleaning up behind Georges.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the misery and grief caused when Georges roared
ashore out of the Gulf before daybreak Monday morning, its eye
centered on Biloxi, Miss., the storm was not its old killer self.
</P>
<P>
   It could not sustain its 100-mile-an-hour-plus winds for long
once it began to drag over land, leading weather forecasters to
predict, cautiously, that it would probably blow itself out in the
next few days. Moreover, Gulf Coast residents, given plenty of
warning that Georges earlier had killed 300 people and left 100,000
more homeless down in the Caribbean, largely avoided its worst by
battening down ahead of time and fleeing, when they could, to
higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could have been a lot worse,'' Kenny Campo, a marina operator
said, as he surveyed his mostly unscathed place in low-lying St.
Bernard Parish, southeast of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Pensacola was awash in more than 20 inches of rain that fell
there in less than 24 hours. But for all that, flood damage was
relatively minor in most places.
</P>
<P>
   A few streets in downtown Mobile, Ala., were waist-deep in sea
water, and the causeway leading out of town was hit by a sea surge
that swept away some stores and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   One Mobile resident, Sandra Pettway, was less traumatized by
Georges than the 8-foot alligator it drove up into the housing
project in which she lives with her three children. ``Some people
were shooting at him,'' she said. ``But I didn't have a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   In Biloxi, there was also flooding. But the town's main
attraction, its casinos, largely escaped serious damage _ though
not a loss of revenue from having to shut down for several days. A
few miles further west, in Gulfport, the wind blew so hard that it
toppled over an 18-wheel tractor-trailer on Interstate 10.
</P>
<P>
   But most houses and businesses escaped with only a scratch or
two. And in New Orleans, where Georges potentially could have
caused a huge catastrophe _ the city has the Gulf Coast's largest
concentration of people and lies 6 feet below sea level behind its
levees _ there was hardly any damage except along the shores of
Lake Ponchartrain, where storm-driven waves smashed a line of
fishing shacks and cottages.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By late afternoon, with Georges beginning to slowly drift off
toward the northeast and winds and rains letting up a bit, New
Orleanians, especially those hunkered down in makeshift shelters
like the Superdome, began to chafe for their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A curfew was still in effect _ ``for your safety until we can
get things straightened out a bit,'' Mayor Marc Morial said _ but
with each passing hour it was ignored by more and more people. Down
in the old French Quarter, Chris LeBoeuf ventured forth and opened
his souvenir shop. And in no time customers were arriving,
especially tourists who had been trapped in their hotels for two
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come in, and they're just glad to have some place to go
for a change,'' LeBoeuf said. The police let it go.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the city's store owners, Frank Ordano, complained
that power company crews had not been fast enough getting power
restored. ''There's no bad weather here,'' he declared. ``Sunday
was a little bit rainy and wind, Monday even less so.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Mobile, by late in the day, the had-enough-of-all-this
story was much the same, though the wind there was still blowing up
to 60 miles an hour, and the rain was still coming down. Debbie
Stephens, hunkered down at home rather than in a shelter, said she
and her family were safe enough but the power was out and ``there's
just nothing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just about to die from boredom,'' she continued. ``There's
no power, no television, no stereo. You can't read. We've played
all the games. And now everybody's eating everything in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Kirk Fordice of Mississippi said after an early look at the
damage in his state that while Mississippians had been lucky,
foresight also had played a major role in limiting loss. ``The
preparation for this emergency,'' he said, ``is much better than in
years past.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather forecasters predicted that because Georges began to lose
some of its punch as soon as it came ashore early Monday morning,
it probably would lose still more power overnight as it inched
further inland _ barring an unexpected resurgence of energy. By
Tuesday, they said, its maximum sustained winds should be well
below 75 miles an hour, the hurricane force threshold.

DISMAL SEASON SHOULDN'T SURPRISE M'S OWNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Before they raced through the clubhouse door after
Sunday's final game _ where was this speed on the hit-and-run? _
some Mariner players offered up sports' trendiest oral fig leaf,
one that helps the speaker avoid any detailed accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season,'' said Jay Buhner, among others, ``was a wake-up
call for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   First, any athlete or sports figure who uses the ``wake-up
call'' cliche apparently has the alertness of a hibernating bear.
These guys, and their bosses, are compensated sufficiently to know
how much time is left on their careers. They would be hard-pressed
to justify the consequences of wasting a season.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, how is it possible to infer that the dismal
1998 results were a surprise, when the setup was plain in 1997?
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Mariners won a club-record 90 games in '97, they
were exposed in the Division Series when they hit .218 and had a
5.91 ERA against a Baltimore team that outscored them 23-11.
</P>
<P>
   For all the complaints this season about pitching and defense,
the Mariners had one less error (125) than they had in '97 and a
team ERA (4.93) that was just a little higher than the 4.78 of the
previous season _ one that had an attentive Randy Johnson and no
kid pitchers in September.
</P>
<P>
   Despite many preseason words to the contrary, Mariner bosses
never changed the home run-happy approach to offense, added no
quality position players except David Segui, failed to resolve
bullpen problems in time, and let Johnson flee, first emotionally,
then physically, for nothing that was helpful in '98.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, they threw away a season.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think this circumstance was new for manager Lou Piniella.
In 1991, he presided over a 17-game falloff with the Cincinnati
Reds, who won the 1990 World Series and then went 74-88. Until the
Florida Marlins were decimated this season by their owner, the
Reds' plunge was the worst in history for a Series winner.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain the demise of the '91 Reds, Piniella said
Sunday, ``We had a lot of injuries, and we didn't alter the
(championship) ballclub. We weren't deep. We couldn't afford for
things to go wrong and they did.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like the party line for the '98 Mariners, you
have been paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that for all the alleged sophistication of
the Mariner ownership, and for all the experience of Woody Woodward
(the longest-tenured GM in baseball), the Mariners' plan for this
season was copied from that paragon of baseball wisdom, Reds owner
Marge Schott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, Marge insisted on running the same (team) that won
the Series,'' Piniella said. ``She mentioned, `It won once, it can
win again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As Piniella and all baseball people know, it was a bad idea then
and a bad idea now.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking up a winning team ``is a hard thing to do,'' he said.
``But the problem is when you win, everybody else improves, so you
have to improve along with them. If you don't, there's no margin
for error when things don't go well.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the remarks so far from Mariner bosses, there is no
reason to believe there will be much change from the Schott plan
next season.
</P>
<P>
   CEO John Ellis has said ownership is happy with Woodward and
Piniella. Ellis and club president Chuck Armstrong have said on
multiple occasions there will be little change in the player
payroll despite the income from the new stadium, promising only to
make the club ``competitive,'' the vague term that is their minimum
legal obligation that secured public money for the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   While the owners, Woodward and Piniella will counter that
contention with the same vapid optimism of last winter, the fact is
that no one in Mariner ownership or leadership has evinced any
serious contempt over this season or the state of the franchise.
Nor has anyone articulated an aggressive vision for the future that
has any sense of dynamism.
</P>
<P>
   Bad as this season was, the Mariners have had, in winning
percentage, only seven seasons better (1987, '90, '91, '93, '95,
'96, '97). In fact, the Mariners have had just two outstanding
months in their history, 19-8 in September 1995 and 20-7 in June
1997, each of which was sufficient to create division titles.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the raw record, almost everything else has been
ordinary to awful.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the no-brainer drafts of Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex
Rodriguez and the 1989 trade that brought Johnson, the best thing
that happened to the Mariners was the creation of division play in
1994, putting Seattle in the smallest division in major sports, a
grouping exclusively of unsuccessful franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Yet instead of dominating this tiny principality, the Mariners
have squandered the opportunity, even with the assets of what has
proven to be one of baseball's best markets as well as two of the
greatest all-around players in history.
</P>
<P>
   Much of their talent has seeded the rest of baseball; a whopping
25 former Mariners are in the postseason, and together would
probably play the current club dead-even.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the advent of a new park and its high ticket prices,
complete with a roof that will be used less than 10 percent of the
time, Mariner ownership has quietly embarked on a campaign of
diminished expectations and lowered sights.
</P>
<P>
   After 22 mostly mediocre years, yet with a good group of veteran
players, a new ballpark and millions of new fans, when is it time
to stop acting small?

LOSING STREAK A BURIED MEMORY FOR PRAIRIE VIEW
</HEADLINE>
 VIEW-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The key play in Prairie View A&AMP;M's record-breaking
victory Saturday night came long before the final goal-line stand
that preserved a 14-12 defeat of Langston.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Panther players and coach Greg Johnson had one
final discussion about their NCAA Division I record losing streak
that would eventually reach 80 games. They talked about the
documentary HBO made on the streak last season, the one in which
players used reverse psychology and talked on television about
taking college football to a new low.
</P>
<P>
   They watched a tape of the documentary one last time, put it in
a plastic bag and buried it in the north end zone of Blackshear
Field in Prairie View.
</P>
<P>
   ``We left all of that ugliness, all of that misery and pain, all
of the hurts and injuries, and all of the excuses and buried them
in the end zone and we moved forward from there,'' Johnson said
Monday during a news conference at Dallas City Hall to promote the
Al Lipscomb Classic game against Grambling on Saturday at the
Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers are no longer college football's punch line. This
week, they have the last laugh. They have a longer winning streak
than the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   And Johnson is not hesitating to move forward. Monday he didn't
hesitate to request upgrades for his program. Since 1996, Prairie
View has survived on 15 football scholarships, supported by
students and alumni. Prairie View has not been able to offer any
school-funded scholarships since a financial scandal wiped out the
1990 season.
</P>
<P>
   But with some more financial support, Johnson said the program
can be totally resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get some more I feel like we can get a better
quality athlete,'' Johnson said. ``Give us something to really work
with if you want us to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't just stick us out there ... week-in and week-out, and
then complain about we're not doing this, or we're not doing that,
or we had Southern \RUniversity\S on the ropes. Give us something
to fight with.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, the Panthers displayed the fight that wins
football games. Langston didn't go quietly into the night, closing
Prairie View's lead to 14-12 with 34 seconds remaining when Archie
Craft threw a 51-yard touchdown pass to Ted Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Prairie View players held hands on the sideline as Langston
broke the huddle for its 2-point conversion attempt. Craft tried a
sneak up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   It took the officials about 15 seconds to get to the bottom of
the pile and make a call. Linebacker Steven ``Mighty'' Garner
managed to stop Craft just short.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that went through my mind was, it was over. It
was over,'' Garner said. ``All the blood, sweat and tears, and now
it was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Prairie View had its first victory since Oct. 28, 1989, when the
Panthers beat Mississippi Valley, 21-12. Johnson was the defensive
coordinator at Langston when it began Prairie View's losing streak
with a 19-18 beating the following week.
</P>
<P>
   So what about the new streak, the one that can hit two Saturday
with a victory against Grambling?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this week, football is going to be fun,'' Johnson said.
``For a long time it hasn't been fun. It's been a drudgery. It's
been like work. You hate to go to work sometimes, but you know
you've got to if you want to feed your family, and that's kind of
how it's been for the kids in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the Prairie View kids are hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``One isn't good enough for me,'' said running back Kevin Bell,
who had a 57-yard touchdown run in the second half Saturday night.
``I don't want people to think it's a fluke.''

PLENTY OF WORK AHEAD AFTER HUMBLING SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was a season of highlights and humility, of soaring
accomplishments and sinking hopes.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had gotten used to success in recent years,
finishing 40 games over .500 and winning two division titles
between 1995 and '97. This season _ spoiled by the four-month Randy
Johnson saga and a breakdown in defense and relief pitching _ was
humbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning can hide problems; losing exposes them,'' said manager
Lou Piniella, whose team finished 76-85, 11{ games behind
first-place Texas in the American League West. ``You win and you
overlook. When you lose, it's very hard to overlook.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a wake-up call,'' said shortstop Alex
Rodriguez, who had 42 homers, 46 steals and no trip to the
postseason. ``We got our (butt) kicked all year, and hopefully
we'll all think about this over the winter and use it as motivation
next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. had a different idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't think about it, because people are going to
constantly remind you,'' said Griffey, who led the AL with 56 home
runs. ``You've just got to let the front office handle it however
they want to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   The M's offseason will be busy, but it's unlikely to include
major shakeups. Griffey, Rodriguez, David Segui, Jay Buhner, Dan
Wilson, Edgar Martinez (whose $3.5 million option will be picked up
before Nov. 15), Jamie Moyer and Jeff Fassero all return.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners will have the same player payroll (about $52
million) this off-season to enhance that core. Their most important
off-season objectives: acquire an experienced starting pitcher to
join Moyer and Fassero atop the rotation; re-sign closer Mike
Timlin, who converted 19 of 20 save opportunities after the
All-Star break; acquire a leadoff hitter who plays left or right
field; and add a left-handed relief specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Two questions were answered in the season's final weeks, when
right-hander Jose Paniagua secured a spot as a setup reliever and
Carlos Guillen showed Piniella he can be the club's everyday second
baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Others who put themselves in position to make next year's team
are infielder David Bell and Raul Ibanez, who can play first base,
right field and catcher. Right-hander Paul Abbott, who went 3-1 in
September, will have a shot at the starting rotation, as will
right-hander Mac Suzuki, who might be better suited to relief.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers Freddy Garcia, Brett Hinchcliffe and John Halama (the
probable player to be named later from the Johnson trade with
Houston) also figure into next spring's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are further along as an organization compared to last year
after we won the division,'' Piniella said. ``None of our kids were
ready (then) for this type of exposure or competition. To me, that
is the biggest advantage we have derived from this year, the fact
that these kids have grown into the picture. It really defines what
you need, as opposed to having to do a massive job of
restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   The undertaking won't be massive, but will be critical. The M's
drew 2.6 million fans this year, but had the biggest drop in
attendance in the American League (nearly 550,000).
</P>
<P>
   Safeco Field opens next July, and Mariners CEO John Ellis
acknowledged that the novelty of a new ballpark will sell tickets
for a while. But, he added, ``that's apt to be a very short-lived
thing if there isn't a competitive team to go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Ellis said, ownership again is authorizing a
payroll it believes will allow the club to win. Cost overruns ($80
million) on Safeco Field, he said, do not affect the budget for
player salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never will be up in the range of the Yankees and Atlanta,''
Ellis said, ``but that doesn't mean we won't be competitive and
aren't willing to spend the dollars necessary. We will.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an ample budget to be competitive,'' said Woody
Woodward, the vice president of baseball operations. ``We just have
to make the right moves to fill in. ... We already have a fine
nucleus in place. If I can get about three young players to come
through _ like a Guillen, Suzuki and Paniagua _ we're almost there.
We'll look to supplement through a trade or a free agent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners will not re-sign free agent Heathcliff Slocumb, who
made $3 million this year, and some of those savings can be
expected to go to Timlin, who has said he wants to return but is
one of the few available free-agent closers, meaning he probably
will command a raise from this year's $3.025 million salary.
</P>
<P>
   The starters the M's pursue won't come from the top class of
free agents, which includes San Diego's Kevin Brown, Texas' Todd
Stottlemyre, the Mets' Al Leiter and, of course, Johnson. Heading
the second tier are San Francisco's Mark Gardner, Los Angeles'
Brian Bohanon, Kansas City's Tim Belcher and the Cubs' Mark Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus will be on getting a 2-3 starter who can give us
innings and win with some consistency,'' said Piniella, who will
accompany Woodward to the general managers' meetings this winter
and take a more active role in personnel decisions. ``If we have
three pitchers with experience who give you innings and keep you in
the ballgame and two of our young kids pitch the way we feel they
can, that will be sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent left-handed relievers include Boston's Greg Swindell,
the Mets' Dennis Cook and Los Angeles' Mark Guthrie. The Mariners'
own left-hander, Paul Spoljaric, struggled in '98 and might fit in
better as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   The leadoff question is more complicated. The best free agent
probably is Kansas City's Jose Offerman, who plays the same
position as Guillen. Although Guillen batted first this September,
the Mariners see him as a second- or ninth-place hitter.
</P>
<P>
   With Buhner likely to begin the year at first base because of
Sept. 9 elbow surgery, Segui will have to take his slick glove to
the outfield, probably in left because he does not have a
right-fielder's arm.
</P>
<P>
   So without Buhner's arm in right, at least initially, the M's
mystery leadoff man should ideally have a cannon on his shoulder.
That's a rare combination, but the Mariners must find a way to add
to both their speed and defense.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever a new leadoff man plays _ Oakland left fielder Rickey
Henderson is a free agent _ the Mariners know they can't afford
another year of shaky defense. Guillen, who made no errors with
Seattle, should be an improvement over Joey Cora at second, and
Russ Davis made strides at third base in the second half and will
concentrate on agility and footwork during workouts this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some guys who had huge years, and yet we weren't able
to overcome some of our other shortcomings,'' Woodward said. ``We
just have to do a better job on the field and not give the other
team as many outs. ... If we get back to a team that can do that _
and we are very close to getting back _ we'll be fine.''

GARRETT NOT ON TIGHT LEASH, COWBOYS COACH SAYS

<P>
   IRVING _ Jason Garrett's performance Sunday against the Oakland
Raiders could be one of his most memorable. For all the wrong
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The two untimely interceptions Garrett threw in a 13-12 loss
Sunday might even end his four-year run as the lovable overachiever
from Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   But as Troy Aikman continues to rehabilitate his broken
collarbone, Cowboys coaches aren't going to scale back the
offensive gameplan. Coach Chan Gailey, in fact, still expects
Garrett to be aggressive throwing the ball. Gailey just wants
Garrett to be smarter, and not repeat the same kinds of mistakes
that led to two end-zone interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who could be employed as an emergency quarterback
against the Redskins on Sunday, supported Gailey's plan to keep
from pulling back the reins on the Garrett-led attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't ever get yourself in position where you are
unwilling to take chances or unwilling to take your shots
(downfield),'' said Aikman of Garrett, who was unavailable for
comment Monday. ``If you ever get to that point then you are not
going to be very effective. Jason will still go out and be
aggressive and play within his abilities like he did the last
couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Raiders, Garrett threw mostly short in the flat or
deep over the top. Of his 18 completions, half were for less than
10 yards. Save for Michael Irvin's 30-yard reception on Garrett's
second pass of the game, no pass completion went further than 20
yards in the air. (Billy Davis' 55-yard reception was a five-yard
throw that turned into a big gain because the Raiders were
blitzing).
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders knocked down five Garrett passes. Cornerback Eric
Allen had three knockdowns, and one Allen breakup saved a Cowboys
touchdown. In the second quarter, tight end David LaFleur was open
with no one behind him at the Raiders' 10-yard line. Review of game
film indicated that Garrett could have completed the pass had he
released it a split second earlier, coaches said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to take a lot of the blame for what happened,''
quarterback coach Buddy Geis said of Garrett. ``We watched film,
and he kept saying, `I should have done this. I should have done
that.' That's just who he is. I told him he can't be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey tried to deflect some of the blame off of Garrett on the
first turnover, saying Monday that his play calling led to Charles
Woodson's second-quarter interception with the Cowboys on the
Raiders 7-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The play called for Irvin to run a curl route in the end zone.
Irvin ran it inside. Garrett threw it outside, where Woodson
intercepted. Gailey said the play usually has Davis or Ernie Mills
running the curl route. He said those players run the route
differently than Irvin runs it, and differently than what Garrett
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take responsibility for that because we'd run it with the
other wide receivers all year,'' Gailey said. ``Jason was used to
the other guys running it. I should call a different play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody else took the blame for Garrett's second interception,
which came with a little more than a minute remaining as he threw
deep from the Cowboys 43-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys sent three wide receivers into the pass pattern,
Davis deep, Irvin on a curl, and Deion Sanders on a crossing route.
Coaches said the game film showed that Garrett, despite needing
just another 15 yards or so to put the Cowboys in position for a
game-tying field goal, was looking at Davis deep all the way.
</P>
<P>
   So the goal for Garrett this week is to not get caught looking
the wrong way again.

NFL'S `GOOD OL' DAYS' DIDN'T OWN ALL OF THE GOOD GUYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's because I'm still one of those disrespectful,
irreverent young whippersnappers who doesn't properly honor ``the
good ol' days.'' But I'm always amused, and a bit troubled, when I
hear NFL stars of yesteryear dissing their modern-day counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   It comes again now in the wake of the death of Doak Walker,
cheered everywhere as the last of sport's good guys.
</P>
<P>
   But one good guy who came before Doak, and another who followed
him, say the breed lives on.
</P>
<P>
   To the credit of a legend of one bygone generation, Sammy Baugh,
and to the credit of one from a more recent period, Walter Payton,
there are at least two fellas in the Pro Football Hall of Fame who
recognize that some of their 1990s heirs are worthy representatives
of today's Golden Era.
</P>
<P>
   Slingin' Sammy Baugh, 84, is the last survivor of the original
class of 17 to enter the Hall of Fame, and he still likes his NFL
football _ and its QBs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have been the first one to realize that if you stayed in
the pocket waiting for a receiver to get open, you could get
killed,'' Baugh says. ``That's why I threw on the run so much. Give
me a quarterback who can move to avoid the rush any day.''
</P>
<P>
   And if that sounds like an endorsement of Troy Aikman's
newfound-but-dangerous mobility, well, you're not thinking the way
Sammy's thinking. That perfect QB's name, Sammy?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were picking one today,'' he says, ``it would be Steve
Young.'' And the perfect running back to play behind him? Payton,
the former Chicago Bears standout who owns the NFL rushing record
of 16,726 yards, feels good about the fact Detroit's Barry Sanders
is moving closer to contention for the honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy like Barry, you can't feel bad about it,'' Payton says.
``When the record is eclipsed _ and eventually he will surpass it _
I would like to be there to congratulate him and to shake his hand
and turn over the torch to him and let him take it a little farther
than I took it. ... He's an electric runner and a class guy,''
Payton says.
</P>
<P>
   Update on Young's quality: In Sunday's 31-20 victory over
Atlanta, Young was 28-of-39 for 387 yards. Oh, and he ran seven
times for 50 yards, too.
</P>
<P>
   Update on Sanders' quality: Despite the fact that he earns $5.7
million a year, he still lives in the house he bought as a rookie
for $175,000 near the Silverdome.
</P>
<P>
   See? The football world of today isn't totally populated by
disrespectful, irreverent young whippersnappers. NFL BUZZ Arizona's
victory over the Rams marked the Cardinals' first game back in St.
Louis, and after the visitors won, Arizona owner Bill Bidwill got
the game ball. No, I don't know why, either. ... How suddenly
secure is Denny Green in Minnesota? Owner Red McCombs is asked if
the coach's new $1.55 million-a-year contract is guaranteed.
``Guaranteed,'' McCombs says, ``as long as I have a pulse.'' ...
The Denver offensive line was planning to go mum for all 16 games
again this season. After listening as they were forced to speak at
last year's SB, their decision, frankly, would've been no great
loss. But when coach Mike Shanahan heard that other teams' lines
were considering following the Denver lead, he shut down the
silence club. Good for him, and for NFL fans. ... The 0-4 Bears
have led each of their games at halftime and have been outscored
44-0 in third quarters. ... Talk to people who know the unemployed
ex-Ram and ex-Dolphin Lawrence Phillips and they'll tell you how
concerned they are about his future as a human being without
football. The Packers may bring Phillips in for another look this
week. ... San Diego has four TDs in four games. ... Got time for
some nice NFL news? Jaguars owner Wayne Weaver donated $100,000 to
help Florida families whose homes were destroyed by fires. And the
NFL matched the donation. ... It was notable going into Sunday that
Jerry Rice had 26 TD catches against the Falcons. It's more notable
now that he added two more in San Francisco's victory over Atlanta,
making him the all-time leader in TDs by one player vs. one team.
... Cincinnati tackle Kevin Sargent has a new contract that pays
him a $3.5 million signing bonus. Sargent's buddies suggest he's on
the frugal side, a suggestion confirmed when Kevin explains that
he'll reward himself by splurging on a sprinkler system for his
yard.

STARS' GUSEV MAY RETURN TO MINORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Mike Heika 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Just when it seems Sergey Gusev's timing was
right, Darryl Sydor's timing couldn't have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   Gusev is a 23-year-old rookie defenseman who has been the bright
spot of the Dallas Stars preseason by combining with fellow
defenseman Sergei Zubov to score 10 points (three goals, seven
assists) in four exhibition games. But just when it looked as
though the enigmatic Gusev had earned his way into the lineup,
Zubov's regular defensive partner from last season _ Sydor _
returned from a contract holdout.
</P>
<P>
   With Sydor secured for the next four seasons at a cost of $10
million, it's almost certain that he and Zubov will be reunited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darryl has to earn his way back into the lineup,'' assistant
coach Rick Wilson said with a sly smile. ``We may not put him and
Zubie back together for at least 12 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the ``My Sergey'' headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gusev is proving this season that it will be much harder
to send him back to the Stars' International Hockey league
affiliate in Kalamazoo, Mich _ his address for the previous three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been here for three years already, so my goal is to
make NHL,'' said the native of Negniy Tagel, Russia. ``I feel more
comfortable here. I want to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Gusev is proving his comfort level is no fluke. He has
two goals and three assists and is a plus-1 in four exhibition
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two things that have kept him out of the NHL _
consistent play and ability to pay the physical price,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said of Gusev. ``Now what's happened is he's
gone in and paid the price for the most part and he's played at a
high level pretty much every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at that level right now where he smells it and feels like
that there's a spot open that can be his on a regular basis, and
not just the seventh (defenseman) spot,'' he added. ``He wants the
season, it looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   But earning a spot among the top six just got tougher. Sydor is
expected to return to practice today, and he and Zubov have been
one of the NHL's top scoring tandems among defensemen for the past
two seasons. Hitchcock let out more than a hint when he said Monday
that ``the player who plays with Zubov has to play more than 20
minutes a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gusev's offensive skills could make him a perfect fit as a sixth
defenseman who contributes heavily to the power play _ possibly
with Zubov _ but not as a regular logging in excess of 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And that could hurt Gusev's development. The wily Zubov has
taken Gusev ``under his wing,'' Hitchcock said. And Gusev also was
helped by a two-week visit from former Soviet Union coach Vladimir
Joursinov, who was able to accentuate some of the basics of the
game, Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His problem is he's always trying to find the perfect play,
not unlike his countryman on the right side (Zubov),'' the coach
said. ``He's now learned to play on the power play as a point guy
in North American hockey, which is get (the puck) on net as quickly
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, combined with Gusev's improved consistency, has the
coaching staff serious about keeping him around, whether he teams
with Zubov or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole other level that has to be obtained,''
Hitchcock said. ``But he seems to be playing with a lot of
composure.'' MATVICHUK IMPROVING
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Richard Matvichuk went through a full practice
Monday, including contact. The defenseman who had surgery June 23
to replace the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, said he
felt good.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some tendinitis in there that we have to work out,''
he said. ``But it's ahead of schedule and I'm not going to push it
too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk said he is hoping to return by Nov. 1. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Brett Hull, who was held out of Friday's exhibition game with
an abdominal strain, participated in a full practice Monday and is
expected to play with the Stars in their preseason game Tuesday in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hitchcock said Monday that his plans this season include using
Sydor as a forward on the penalty killing unit. With Hull also a
possible addition, Hitchcock said the team might use four penalty
killing pairs. Winger Pat Verbeek (sore elbow) went through full
practice Monday and was unsure if he would accompany the Stars to
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hitchcock said that with the postponement of last Saturday's
preseason game with Tampa Bay until Oct. 5, he likely will not make
further cuts until Sunday.

 12 NOTES-TEX 
McCOWN TO REPLACE STEWART AS AGGIES' STARTER 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Randy McCown will replace Branndon Stewart as the starting
quarterback when No. 18 Texas A&AMP;M meets Kansas on Saturday in
Lawrence, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum announced the change Monday, saying McCown
deserved the chance to start based on the spark he provided a
struggling offense in a 28-9 victory against North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   McCown, a junior, replaced Stewart with 2:39 remaining in the
first half and A&AMP;M clinging to a 7-3 lead. He completed 11 of 13
passes for a career-high 169 yards and two touchdowns. He also
rushed nine times for 39 yards, helping the Aggies improve to 3-1
heading into their Big 12 opener against Kansas (2-2, 0-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe it to Randy to give him a chance to start based on what
he did in that game,'' Slocum said. ``Things seemed to pick up a
little bit when he was in there. I'm not down on Branndon. But I
think this is what we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1997 season, McCown replaced a struggling Stewart in
the starting lineup for a game at Texas Tech. McCown completed 2 of
8 passes for 7 yards, was sacked three times and lost a fumble at
the A&AMP;M 17-yard line that set up Tech's lone touchdown. Tech won,
16-13.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, a fifth-year senior from Stephenville with a career
mark of 18-10 as the Aggies' starting quarterback, returned to the
lineup the next week. The contest remains McCown's lone collegiate
start.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M coaches are counting on different results this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a little frustrated with our inconsistencies on
offense,'' offensive coordinator Steve Kragthorpe said. ``I'm happy
we've won three in a row, but I'm not satisfied. The big thing with
Randy is that he lit a fire among our players with his scrambling.
He did a good job of improvising and making plays.''
</P>
<P>
   After averaging 35.2 points per game in 1997, A&AMP;M is scoring
23.5 a game this season despite the return of every skill-position
starter. McCown, in limited duty this season, has completed 73.7
percent of his passes (14-for-19), with two touchdowns and no
interceptions. Stewart's completion rating is 50.7 (35-for-69). He
has thrown one touchdown pass and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   Neither player could be reached for comment Monday. TEXAS-OU
STARTS EARLY
</P>
<P>
   Big 12 officials announced the Oct. 10 Texas-Oklahoma game would
kick off at 11:30 a.m. in the Cotton Bowl. It will be televised on
KXTX/Channel 39 as part of the league's syndicated television
package.
</P>
<P>
   No starting times for other Oct. 10 games were announced. League
officials said ABC executives have exercised their right to wait
until Sunday before deciding whether to show Nebraska-Texas A&AMP;M or
Colorado-Kansas State as the network's 2:30 p.m. game.
</P>
<P>
   The unselected contest, said associate commissioner Tim Allen,
will move to 6 p.m. and be televised by either Fox Sports Southwest
or FX. Also, the Texas Tech-Oklahoma State game will be a 6 p.m.
telecast on either Fox Sports Southwest or FX. JAMES WILL START
</P>
<P>
   Baylor coach Dave Roberts said quarterback Odell James will
remain the Bears' starter, although it was backup Jermaine Alfred
who drove the team to a go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter of
an 18-16 loss to No. 15 Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   James, a sophomore, has completed 16 of 37 passes (43.2
percent), with three interceptions and no touchdowns in the Bears'
first three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Odell's our quarterback, but Jermaine may play a little more
this week than he has been,'' said Roberts, who watched Alfred
complete 9 of 16 passes for 58 yards, including two third-down
connections on the fourth-quarter scoring drive. Roberts said
James, who suffered bruised ribs against Colorado, should not be
hampered by the injury in 6 p.m. game Saturday at Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to improve our quarterback play, but Odell's just a
puppy,'' Roberts said. ``He's going to make some mistakes, and
we'll live with it.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Texas coach Mack Brown sent a telegram Monday to Prairie View
A&AMP;M coach Greg Johnson, offering congratulations on a 14-12 victory
against Langston that broke an NCAA-record 80-game losing streak.
The text: ``Congratulations on getting a new start. Best of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Brown, on Sunday's death of Doak Walker, the 1948 Heisman
Trophy winner and namesake of the national running back award won
last season by Longhorns' tailback Ricky Williams: ``It will be
emotional this week for Ricky. He became close to the Walker family
after winning the award last year. For society and anyone who cares
about college football, this is an awful loss. Doak Walker was
``the'' role model for college football. All fathers wanted their
sons to grow up and be like Doak Walker.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Williams was selected the Big 12 offensive player of the week
after rushing for a career-high 318 yards and six touchdowns in a
59-21 victory against Rice.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DANNY ROBBINS  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
CHICAGO _ The first National League wild-card playoff game was a
celebration of all things Cub.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A throng of 39,556 under the lights at Wrigley Field. The masses
in the streets and on the rooftops. Michael Jordan throwing out the
first ball. Bill Murray belting out Take Me Out to the Ball Game.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's game had everything for those who worship at the shrine
of the beautiful little ballpark at Clark and Addison.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Rod Serling ending.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs beat the San Francisco Giants 5-3 after surviving a
ninth inning in which the Giants put up three runs against a trio
of Cubs pitchers running on empty.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, Cubs manager Jim Riggleman used two of his
starters, Kevin Tapani and Terry Mulholland, and closer Rod Beck.
Both Mulholland and Beck had pitched in the Cubs' 4-3 loss to the
Astros on Sunday, Mulholland going eight innings and 121 pitches
and Beck 2 and 36.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Giants, Beck got the final two outs, the game ending
when Joe Carter, whose home run won the 1993 World Series for
Toronto, popped to first baseman Mark Grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking people to do some extraordinary things,''
Riggleman said, ``but they keep coming up big for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with the victory, the Cubs avoided the kind of disaster
that colors the team's history while gaining a spot in the
playoffs, starting Wednesday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The victory also was built on a couple of hitting stars who
don't answer to ``Sammy,'' Gary Gaetti and Matt Mieske. Gaetti
broke open a scoreless game in the fifth with a two-run homer;
Mieske, pinch hitting in the sixth, came through with a two-run
single.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs starter Steve Trachsel went 6 innings and left with a line
of six walks, one hit batter _ and one hit.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel wobbled through the final month, going 0-1 in five
September starts and becoming a footnote to history by giving up
Mark McGwire's 62nd home run. He was on a similar course Monday as
he struggled with his control. But he did manage to squirm out of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel put the Giants down in order in the first and then
began pitching himself into tight spots, giving the Giants just
about everything except a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adrenalin was flowing,'' he said. ``I threw 120 pitches,
but it felt more like 40.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants starter Mark Gardner, who hadn't lost since July 30, gave
up a pair of singles in the first two innings but cruised through
the third and fourth before the Cubs came alive.
</P>
<P>
   Following a leadoff single by Henry Rodriguez in the fifth,
Gaetti cranked an 0-2 pitch into the left-field bleachers to make
it a 2-0 game.
</P>
<P>
   The home run was Gaetti's 19th of the season and eighth since he
signed with the Cubs as a free agent Aug. 19, his 40th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs made it 4-0 in the sixth on Mieske's two-run single off
reliever Rich Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching with a four-run lead in the seventh, Trachsel got one
out before giving up a single to pinch hitter Brent Mayne. After
Trachsel walked the next batter, pinch hitter Armando Rios,
Riggleman went to his bullpen, where danger always lurks.
</P>
<P>
   Riggleman's choice, Matt Karchner, got the second out when
Orlando Merced, who had just entered to play left field, made a
dazzling catch on Stan Javier's foul pop at the rail.
</P>
<P>
   When the Giants loaded the bases on Shawon Dunston's ground
single up the middle, Riggleman brought in Felix Heredia to pitch
to Barry Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The threat ended with Bonds grounding weakly to first.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs took a 5-0 lead to the ninth, with Kevin Tapani, in his
first relief role since 1993, on the mound. Tapani, who would have
started Game 1 against the Braves had he not pitched Monday, got
the Cubs through a scoreless eighth.
</P>
<P>
   But he gave up two singles to start the ninth. Next into the
fire came Mulholland, who allowed Javier's RBI single, walked Ellis
Burks and gave up a sacrifice fly to Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Beck, formerly of the Giants, then got Jeff Kent to ground to
short, bringing in San Francisco's third run. He then induced
Carter to hit his floater to Grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never faced Joe Carter,'' Beck said. ``After throwing him
a couple of soft pitches, I remembered something (Giants manager)
Dusty Baker once said: `Guys with long arms like the ball away,' so
I went inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dusty helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck said he was just happy to be part of something positive at
Wrigley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard all about the losing ways since I've been here,''
he said. ``I'm just happy to give Chicago and my employers
something big.''

THIS YEAR JUST ISN'T NEXT YEAR FOR BONDS

   CHICAGO _ As the Cubs took victory laps and sprayed Champagne on
Wrigley Field, former Cub Shawon Dunston stayed on the top step of
the San Francisco dugout, watching his former mates. Pitcher Julian
Tavarez slapped a photographer with his glove. Barry Bonds sat
quietly in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anything to be ashamed of,'' said Bonds, who was
0 for 4 and left six runners on base. ``We played hard to get
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The comeback Giants lost to the Cubs, 5-3, in Monday night's
one-game playoff for the National League wild card.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 20, the Giants were out of the hunt, four games behind
the Mets and three behind the Cubs, but down the stretch they won
nine of their last 11 games to pass the Mets and catch the Cubs and
force this playoff.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night the Giants managed only a handful of hits off
Steve Trachsel and a baling-wire Cubs bullpen. Even so, they missed
several chances to get back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded and two outs in the seventh inning, Bonds
hit a weak ground ball to first base.
</P>
<P>
   With a runner at third and two outs in the eighth, J.T. Snow hit
a grounder to second.
</P>
<P>
   Up again in the ninth as the tying run, Bonds hit a sacrifice
fly to Sammy Sosa in right field, making the score 5-2. When asked
how close he was to a home run, Bonds glared and said, ``Not close
enough.'' Then he smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit line drives right at some people,'' Bonds said.
``Trachsel was the best I've ever seen him. We never got any
momentum going with less than two outs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had their late chances, but never got the potential
game-winning run to bat.
</P>
<P>
   Each time the Giants failed, the standing-room-only Cubs crowd
went into full ``holy cow'' mode. ``I don't hear it,'' Bonds said.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants finished 89-74, the seventh-best record in baseball,
but one game short of October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go home and watch the playoffs on TV,'' Jeff Kent said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the crowd was still chanting, ``Sammy! Sammy!'' as Sosa
climbed on top of the dugout, where he was mobbed by fans. A
middle-aged man kissed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say enough about what a year Sammy had,'' Bonds
said. ``But Gary Gaetti, what a year he had, at his age.'' Gaetti
is 40, six years older than Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The Champagne started flowing in the clubhouse, but the Chicago
Cubs took the celebration to the field, the first time the Cubs
clinched a playoff spot at home since 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa made a final run, this time doused in Champagne by his
right field bleacher bums. Rod Beck's wife, Stacey, kissed Manager
Jim Riggleman. Matt Karchner cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through this six times in the 90s, losing at the
end,'' Bonds said. He sat shirtless by his locker, a No. 24 chain
around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep saying I'll be back. I'll be back next year.''

FEINSTEIN'S COMMENTS IRK HYDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ Underscoring the enormous pressure on lawmakers as
they move toward a congressional inquiry into President Clinton,
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., accused
California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein Monday of making
``wildly unfair and inaccurate comments'' regarding his committee's
investigation.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hyde said that Feinstein's comments on a Sunday talk show ``add
to a picture that is so distorted and unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just really resent it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde and Feinstein are both well-regarded for their sense of
diplomacy, and the exchange comes a week before the Judiciary
Committee is scheduled to vote on whether to begin a formal
impeachment inquiry against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein complained on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that while
Republican investigators have ``offices, computers and a whole
setup,'' their Democratic counterparts are working from a ``a file
folder and cell phone.'' She predicted that the impeachment process
that has begun in the House ``will be remembered for at least 100
years,'' and said ``it has to be fair, it has to be nonpartisan,
and it has to be sustainable. . . . As I see it unfolding, it is
none of the above.''
</P>
<P>
   The two have had a good working relationship, dating to
Feinstein's efforts to pass an assault weapon ban in 1994.
Nevertheless, after watching Feinstein on television, Hyde fired
off an angry letter to Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the Judiciary
Committee's ranking Democratic member.
</P>
<P>
   Labeling Feinstein as ``misinformed,'' Hyde said Democrats were
provided an office in a House office building last spring and said
Republicans have approved every request for space or supplies
since. There are seven Democratic attorneys and investigators
working on the Clinton matter, compared to 14 for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic staffers conceded Monday that Hyde was correct, but
said they had only on Friday been granted a suitable office. The
lead Democratic counsel had not had a desk and had told Feinstein
last week that he had been working from a file folder and cell
phone for months, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I understand it, this issue has now been resolved,''
Feinstein wrote in a letter to Hyde Monday. ``I do not want our
exchange to become an issue in your committee's all too important
work.''

CALIFORNIA FISHERMAN'S RARE CATCH _ 25-POUND SQUID 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM DOYLE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Bodega Bay, Calif., fisherman hauled in an
unusual catch Monday, netting a mysterious jumbo squid that was
rushed to a nearby marine lab to try to keep it alive.
</P>
<P>
   With its huge black eyes, the squid (species Dosidicus gigas)
measured more than four feet long and weighed 25 pounds. It was
extremely aggressive, lunging and spewing quarts of brown ink when
brought to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   It is among the first such creatures in captivity. ``So far,
none have survived,'' said John Grissim, publisher of the
ocean-news journal Marine Watch in Point Reyes Station, Calif.
``This is the largest ever captured alive.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, scientists and volunteers at the Bodega Marine
Laboratory have tried to catch a Dosidicus gigas for research and
testing, but each time the traumatized creatures have lasted only a
few days.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, the lab's new acquisition was swimming peacefully
in three feet of circulating sea water. The tank, 10 feet in
diameter, was covered with a tarp to provide shade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to be in beautiful condition,'' said Peter Connors,
reserve manager at the marine laboratory. ``It seems very healthy,
very lively and not injured. It's moving very slowly and
smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   The species is separate from the smaller squid from South
America that are sold locally as calamari, or the fabled giant
squids of up to 60 feet in length that have shown up in nets _ dead
_ or washed ashore off England and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's catch was the handiwork of Jim Hie, a volunteer at the
lab, which is run by the University of California at Davis. His
28-foot sportfishing boat, Anna II, was 20 miles off the coast near
Cordell Bank in roughly 500 feet of water when Hie felt a
tremendous tug on a jig line.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial lure and hook had apparently snagged one of the
squid's arms at a depth of 40 feet. The retired electrician and
former Navy jet fighter pilot said he battled the feisty mollusk
for almost 30 minutes, before finally putting a net around it.
</P>
<P>
   Hie immediately placed the squid in a 450 gallon tank on his
boat. Then he sped to shore on calm seas. Monday afternoon, lab
workers moved the squid by truck to the marine lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's huge,'' said Hie at the Spud Point Marina in Bodega Bay.
``He's six inches across between the eyes and he is mad right now.
He's brown, goes to red and goes back to brown. The whole side of
the boat is a mess from him. Myself and my boat are covered with
ink.''
</P>
<P>
   With their tentacles stretched out, an adult jumbo squid
measures about six feet long. Each tentacle has scores of suction
cups, and each ``sucker'' contains razor sharp teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists differ on how dangerous it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Squid, by their nature, run away. By and large, they're
harmless,'' said Christopher Mah, an invertebrate zoologist at the
California Academy of Sciences who specializes in starfish. ``It's
not dangerous in the way a shark or jellyfish would be. It's only
dangerous if you push it that way'' by provoking or trapping it.
</P>
<P>
   But Grissim said the enigmatic creatures are incredibly
ferocious.
</P>
<P>
   ``These squid have been known to attack people. They even attack
each other,'' Grissim said. ``They also have an amazing ability to
change color instantly. They are the fastest color-changing
creatures known to man. Waves of color flow through them.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists suspect that the mysterious squid may employ
different colors for courtship dances, camouflage and luring prey.
``We think they're very bright, but they are implacable _ totally
unrelenting and cold,'' Grissim said.
</P>
<P>
   The squid migrate in large schools, sometimes up to 10,000 in
number, and hover over fish populations.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as a result of El Nino's warmer waters, Dosidicus gigas
is being spotted much farther north than usual. The jumbo squid are
also known as Humboldt Squid because they are found more often in
the Humboldt Current off the coast of Chile and Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Hie netted a jumbo squid in February, but it was heavily
traumatized and died soon afterward. ``The chance of this guy
surviving are good,'' he said. ``I think we'll get at least several
days out of him for tests.''

<P>
   It's National Banned Books Week _ a good time to pick up a book
that has been banned and read it. It will undoubtedly be better
reading than Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's report on President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Try Ray Bradbury's ``Fahrenheit 451,'' or Ernest Hemingway's ``A
Farewell to Arms,''''or John Steinbeck's ``Of Mice and Men,'' or
Maya Angelou's ``I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,'' or J.D.
Salinger's ``Catcher in the Rye,'' or Kurt Vonnegut's
``Slaughterhouse Five,'' or Alice Walker's ``The Color Purple.''
They have all been banned somewhere in America at one time or
other.
</P>
<P>
   Lest we forget how precious a liberty we have in our ``freedom
to read,'' bookstores, libraries, civil liberties organizations,
colleges and universities around the nation will be hosting
numerous literary events this week to celebrate the importance of
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The dangers of censorship are ever with us _ as novelist Judy
Blume put it, ``The censors never sleep.'' There are always those
who would slap a book out of our hands because they consider it
sinful, trash or dangerous. Yes, even a masterpiece like Goethe's
``The Sorrows of Young Werther'' which was based on real events
surrounding the suicide of young Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem, was banned
because various government agencies in Germany, Denmark and Spain
thought the novel recommended suicide. It doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The multitude of rationales behind the censorship of great
literature is almost as fascinating as the works themselves. And
fortunately, the publishing house, Facts On File, Inc., has
provided a sweeping yet in-depth look at the history of book
censorship around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the company published ``Banned Books,'' a
four volume set edited by author Ken Wachsberger: ``Literature
Suppressed on Political Grounds'' by Nicholas J. Karolides,
``Literature Suppressed on Religious Grounds'' by Margaret Bald,
``Literature Suppressed on Sexual Grounds'' by Dawn B. Sova, and
``Literature Suppressed on Social Grounds'' also by Dawn B. Sova.
The entire set costs $112; each volume can be purchased separately
for $28.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to list 10 of your favorite books, chances are that
at least one was banned. The Bible? The Bible is one of the most
banned books in history. It was banned by the Catholic Church,
banned and burned in England, banned and burned by the Spanish
Inquisition, offending portions excised in expurgated editions, and
challenged in West Shore schools, Pa., in 1993, for containing
``language and stories that are inappropriate for children of any
age, including tales of incest and murder.''
</P>
<P>
   As Wachsberger points out in his introductions to the four
volume set: ``It is illuminating to discover in these histories
that such cultural landmarks as the Bible, the Koran, the Talmud
and the greatest classics of world literature have often been
suppressed or censored, from the same motives, and by similar
forces, as those we see today being used to censor such books as
`The Catcher in the Rye' or `Slaughterhouse Five.'''
</P>
<P>
   Example from ``Literature Suppressed on Political Grounds'':
</P>
<P>
   George Orwell's novel ``1984'' explores a totalitarian world of
the future. It was published in London and the United States in
1949 at the beginning of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   According to national surveys, ``1984'' has been one of the most
frequently challenged books in the America. Ironically, the novel
was often challenged on the grounds that it is pro-Communist
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Example from ``Literature Suppressed on Religious Grounds'':
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dickens' second novel ``Oliver Twist'' about an orphan
who falls into the hands of a gang of thieves was published in
monthly installments in a London magazine in 1837. The leader of
the gang is a sinister man named Fagin whom Dickens calls ``a very
old shriveled Jew.'' The anti-Semitic image of a gangster Jew
caused protests and attempts to censor the novel ever since its
publication.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens claimed that Fagin was based upon Ikey Solomons, a Jew
who dealt in stolen goods and was tried in 1830. However, upset
about the charge that he was anti-Semitic, Dickens began revising
``Oliver Twist'' in 1867 in order to eliminate most of the
references to Fagin as ``the Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, a group of Jewish parents in Brooklyn, N.Y., sued the
New York City Board of Education to have the book banned from the
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The parents lost.
</P>
<P>
   Example from ``Literature Suppressed on Sexual Grounds'':
</P>
<P>
   Leo Tolstoy's short novel of celibacy, ``The Kreutzer Sonata''
was banned in Russia by Czar Nicholas II for ``immoral content'' in
1889. The protagonist Posdnicheff confesses to killing his wife,
whom he suspected of committing adultery. Posdnicheff rants against
lust and sexuality and claims that marriage only hides the sins of
the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. postmaster general banned the novella from distribution
in the mail after an assistant attorney general declared the book
to be ``of an obscene character.'' The New York Society for the
Suppression of Vice called it pornographic because it spoke of lust
and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Example from ``Literature Suppressed on Social Grounds'':
</P>
<P>
   Bradbury's ``Fahrenheit 451'' portrays a future society in which
books are forbidden and the job of firemen is to burn all books
they find.
</P>
<P>
   Ballentine Books originally published the novel in 1953, but in
1967 brought out a special edition to be sold to high schools.
Without informing Bradbury or putting a note in the edition, the
publisher modified 75 passages in the novel in order to eliminate
words like ``hell,'' ``damn'' and ``abortion.'' The expurgated
edition was sold for 13 years before a friend of Bradbury's alerted
him to the problem. Bradbury demanded that Ballentine withdraw the
version and replace it with the original. Ballentine agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity generated by the expurgated version of
``Fahrenheit 451'' caused the American Library Association's
Intellectual Freedom Committee to investigate other school books
and to use its considerable economic clout to warn publishers about
expurgations and demand that any excised versions be clearly
identified.
</P>
<P>
   This four volume set on the history of book banning would be a
useful and informative addition to the collections of many public
libraries, colleges and universities. Anyone who wants to research
the nature of censorship would do well to begin here.
</P>
<P>
   (Charles Levendosky was recently re-elected to the Freedom to
Read Foundation Board, the litigating arm of the American Library
Association.)

JUST SAY SHEESH! 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I did not fuss when feminists succeeded in changing the word
``mailman'' to ``letter carrier,'' ``congressman'' to
``congressperson'' and ``stewardess'' to ``flight attendant.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this new, de-genderized language can be a little clunky
at times, it makes sense and certainly better reflects the modern,
diversified workplace.
</P>
<P>
   That having been said, I must object as strenuously as is
possible without getting out of my chair to a campaign being waged
by Varla Ventura of (where else?) San Francisco to start calling
powerful female role models ``sheroes'' instead of ``heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ventura gets her way _ she's urging people to write letters
to the editors of Merriam-Webster's Dictionary supporting the
change _ it will soon be politically incorrect to refer to Xena,
the Warrior Princess, or Wonder Woman as heroes. The proper term
would be ``sheroes.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a story carried by Wireless Flash News Service,
Ventura thinks the word ``hero'' reeks of masculine overtones while
the feminine form _ ``heroine'' _ sounds like the name of a
narcotic drug.
</P>
<P>
   (Speaking of narcotic drugs, count Oprah Winfrey among those who
not only approve of the word ``shero'' but can say it aloud without
laughing.)
</P>
<P>
   In my opinion, shero advocacy is simply phase one of a feminist
conspiracy to completely rid the English language of the
politically incorrect prefix, ``he.''
</P>
<P>
   Being gender-specific is one thing, but replacing ``he'' with
``she'' every time a word pertains to a female (another bad word)
is inviting linguistic lunacy, not to mention creating a whole new
criminal class in the eyes of the political correctness police.
</P>
<P>
   Take the word ``heap,'' for instance, a word that would be
transformed to ``sheap'' in the brave new world of Ventura's
lexicon. This would give rise to such hallucinogenic sentences as,
``Sally spooned a big sheap of mashed potatoes onto her plate'' or
``Betty Sue, put that Cosmo back on the rack or you gonna be in a
sheap o' trouble.''

<P>
   ``Hearsay'' would become ``shearsay'' as in, ``Monica's
involvement with the president turned out to be more than just
shearsay.''
</P>

   Readers of the sports pages will have to adjust to the new
grammar, too, as in the sentence, ``After running the marathon in

   Astronauts re-entering the Earth's atmosphere would be protected

   Jewish women would speak Shebrew to one another in the

anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   A corny TV show relying heavily on rural humor and featuring
female-only country-western singers would be called ``Shee-Haw''
and it would presumably be just as stupid as ``Hee-Haw'' was in its

   The gas used to inflate toy balloons would, in the future, be
called shelium, assuming the person doing the inflating was a she

<P>
   A more medically precise term for a black eye would be a
shematoma, depending on the gender of the person delivering or,
perhaps, receiving, the shiner.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is more than enough to give me the heebie-jeebies,
but not enough to give me the sheebie-jeebies.
</P>
<P>
   At least not yet.

   &UR; There's trouble in the food supply, both animal and vegetable.
With food-borne illnesses soaring, consumers are being warned that
eating too many raw or minimally processed fruits and vegetables is
risky. And genetic engineering, some say, is threatening to upset
nature's balance in many ways. In a three-part series, Globe

   CHESTERFIELD, Mo. _ Behind a door marked ``closed'' to the
thousands of visitors who tour the Monsanto Life Sciences Research
Center here each year, Cindy Clasen fires a DNA-loaded .22 &UR;  &LR; caliber
shell into corn tissue, changing its genetic makeup.
</P>
<P>
   The process, called genetic engineering, allows scientists to
transfer a single gene from any organism _ plant, animal, or
microbe _ into a food crop so it can withstand insects and
herbicides, as well as last longer before spoiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do is the same as Mother Nature,'' says Clasen, a
Monsanto Co. research technician. Genetically engineered, or
transgenic, crops look and taste the same as conventional crops,
and are not required to be labeled in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But some people think it's not nice to fool Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic engineering of plants has triggered a major
food-safety controversy in Europe, where Monsanto's transgenic
crops have been destroyed by activists in Britain, France, and
Ireland and banned by governments in Austria and Luxembourg.
Activists call the rapidly expanding list of genetically engineered
foods ``Frankenfood.''
</P>
<P>
   But slowly, like ketchup creeping from a bottle, the genetic
engineering debate is shifting to America.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's two extremes and the truth is somewhere in between,''
said Sheldon Krimsky, a professor of Urban and Environmental Policy
at Tufts University. ``The big question is, are we being adequately
protected? Years ago they decided air bags saved lives. But now
they know air bags also kill kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, scientists at the University of Nebraska proved that
soybeans modified with a gene from Brazil nuts to increase proteins
also caused a strong and potentially fatal reaction to people
sensitive to Brazil nuts. The transgenic soybean was never
marketed. The Food and Drug Administration has ruled that known
allergins must be labeled.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi Delta farmers were paid an estimated $5 million in
damages when some of Monsanto's genetically engineered Roundup
Ready cotton was found to have been deformed in 1997. And the
company had to recall Roundup Ready canola seeds in Canada after an
unapproved gene was found.
</P>
<P>
   In July, 250 activists from around the world gathered in St.
Louis, Monsanto's corporate headquarters, for what was billed as
this country's ``first grassroots gathering on bio-devastation.''
Then 150 demonstrators picketed Monsanto, demanding it stop
exporting genetically engineered corn and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   The protests have spread to other parts of the country. Shoppers
in western Massachusetts have been startled by moon-suited
activists storming through local supermarkets, labeling genetically
engineered products. And in early August, Diane Beeny, a member of
Pure Foods Campaign, an organic advocacy group, stood at a farmer's
market in New York City collecting signatures against genetic
engineering, wearing a monster mask on her head and a T-shirt
proclaiming ``Keep your genes out of our greens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on a reckless course,'' Beeny said, citing technology
that which allows genes from an Arctic flounder to be implanted in
a tomato to keep it from freezing. ``Entirely new life forms are
being created. This is an aberration of nature and a recipe for
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, a lawsuit was filed in Washington charging the FDA with
ignoring health risks by allowing genetically engineered food to be
sold without mandatory labeling. The suit, coordinated by the
Alliance for Bio-Integrity -- a coalition of scientists, religious
leaders, health professionals, consumers, and chefs _ also demands
safe testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This suit sends a clear message that government policy on
genetically engineered food poses a real risk to the public,'' said
Steven Drucker, president of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA says it sees no distinction between genetically altered
foods and conventional foods. But the lawsuit alleges that with
each gene insertion ``there is a possibility that a non-toxic
nontoxic element in the food could become toxic and create a human
health hazard.'' Some religious groups are also concerned that by
unknowingly eating genetically altered food, people may be
violating religious strictures on what they can eat.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also warns of health risks to people with allergies.
``We're running something of a roulette wheel as far as people that
could have allergic reactions,'' said Margaret Mellon, director of
the agriculture and biotechnology program at the Union of Concerned
Scientists. Allergists estimate that between 2.5 and 5 million
Americans have food allergies, including up to 8 percent of
children.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charge that gentically engineered foods get to market
far too easily because the FDA allows companies to test the product
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now companies don't even have to tell the FDA before
they put something on the market,'' said Mellon. ``If they decide
they don't have to do studies, they don't. It's a voluntary system.
They do their own testing.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said it relies on data provided by companies in a
``consultation'' process. It added that while the process is
voluntary, the company is still responsible for making sure the
product is safe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Monsanto genetically engineered its Roundup Ready
soybeans to withstand treatment from its weed-killing herbicide
Roundup (glyphosate). This process allows farmers to spray weeds
instead of plowing over fields and spraying a variety of
herbicides. The company says that Roundup, the world's best-selling
herbicide, has low toxicity and reduces the amount of pesticides
and soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has gone from having virtually no genetically
engineered crops three years ago to having more than 50 million
acres today, according to industry estimates. There are more than
20 varieties of genetically altered foods already on the market,
including one-third of all US soybeans. In 1996, the first year
Roundup Ready soybeans were introduced, one million acres were
planted. This year an estimated 25 million acres will be harvested.
Because 60 percent of processed consumer food products contain
soybean material, chances are most Americans have already eaten a
genetically engineered food.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto contends that its product is essentially the same as
regular soybeans in nutrition, composition, and taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could label, but it would be at a premium price,'' said
Monsanto spokesman Gary Barton. ``Soybeans are a commodity and they
get all stored together.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The biotechnology race is on
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chemical giants like Monsanto and Du Pont are betting the farm
that biotechnology will change the face of American agriculture.
They are gobbling up smaller seed companies, racing to file
patents, and investing billions in research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Bill Gates in his garage with a micro chip,'' says
said Dennis Edwards, an entomologist who manages Monsanto's
240-acre research farm in Jerseyville, Ill., where the first
genetically engineered tomato plant was grown in 1987. ``
``Biotechnology is something beneficial to mankind.''said Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto now calls itself a ``life sciences'' company. ``The
goals are to help people around the world lead longer, healthier
lives, at costs that they and their nations can afford, and without
environmental degradation,'' according to a letter to shareholders
by Monsanto chairman Bob Shapiro, the Monsanto chairman.

   TAKE-BOS  
 MILAN, Mo.: ... pig operation.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some neighbors have seen enough. ``The public wants cheap, lean
pork,'' said Lynn McKinley, who raises 56 pigs mostly for her
family and friends. ``But they wouldn't want to see what goes on
there. You got `em stuck in there in confinement, the sows are in
crates and can't even stand. The pigs are eating each other's ears,
eating the metal bars. The stink from the lagoons on a warm summer
night wakes you up gagging. My pigs, I can't say they're happy all
the time, but they like Mother Nature. I keep the radio on and they
like their country music.''
</P>
<P>
   To treat its animal waste, Premium Standard says it uses a
biological treatment called anaerobic digestion, a low-cost system
which under the best of conditions causes some solids to be turned
into liquids and gas. The EPA wants the farm factories, or
``concentrated feeding operations'' as they are also called, to
build waste - water facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Administration has proposed that by the year 2005,
huge factory farms be governed by EPA-issued discharge permits
similar to rules set for industrial factories.
</P>
<P>
   Manly says that Premium Standard has spent over $1 million to
try new techniques in waste management, and it has emergency
response teams in place to contain spills. ``I'm very proud of our
record,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's critics charge that Manly has a record as a
polluter. They note that from 1986 to 1994, he was executive vice
president of Virginia-based Smithfield Foods Inc., which in 1997
was fined $12.6 million for 7,000 violations of the Clean Water Act
from 1991-1996 _ -- the largest such penalty in US history.
</P>
<P>
   Premium Standard spokesman Charlie Arnot said during that time,
Manly was responsible for hog production, international sales and
genetics. ``It is important to note that at no time during his
tenure at Smithfield did the environmental function report to
him,'' said Arnot.
</P>
<P>
   Factory farms like Premium Standard use genetic engineering to
make a better pork chop. Since 1983, pork has gotten leaner,
slimmer with 31 percent less fat, 14 percent fewer lower calories
and 10 percent less cholesterol, according to the National Pork
Producer's Council.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Leanest, tastiest pork inthe world
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in pursuit of the perfect chop, Premium Standard has the
world's largest artificial insemination program of its kind. The
million-and-a-half pigs processed each year at the facility have
been bred to produce what the company claims is the leanest,
tastiest, lowest-cholesterol pork in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to produce an Arnold Schwarzenegger pig, and not
a Danny DeVito,'' said Premium Standard's Arnot.
</P>
<P>
   Premium Standard was the first company certified to export fresh
pork to the European Union. It has strict policies on cleanliness.
Employees must shower when they report to work and when they leave
to prevent disease. They wash their trucks daily. There are
temperature-controlled growing monitors with 30,000 sensors, second
only to the Pentagon. They test every carcass for trichina. There
have been no cases of E. coli bacteria and no part of the pig goes
to waste. Pig ears become pet treats and gelatin becomes part of
the Gummy Bears that are sold at movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   At Premium Standard's Genetic Improvement Facility, scientists
study sperm samples under microscopes and computers check genetic
backgrounds. One day recently, boar No. number 2067 was led from
his pen to a cylindrical rubber device that looks like it belongs
on a football practice field. Jana Lewis, assistant general
manager, establishes eye contact and makes a combination of
clucking, groaning, and moaning noises until the frothy-mouthed
boar mounts a rubber dummy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns them on,'' she says with a cheery smile. ``They get
to talking back to you.'' Then she dons rubber gloves and collects
the semen from the boar's orgasm. ``It doesn't bother me a bit. I
do it every day. It's like being a doctor or a gynecologist.''
</P>
<P>
   The semen is sent by pneumatic tube, chilled and analyzed under
a microscope. Pictures of flawed sperm cells are plastered on the
wall like FBI wanted posters at a post office. If the semen is
approved, a synthetic diluter is added so that one boar can
artificially inseminate 20 sows.
</P>
<P>
   Small hog farmers like Lynn McKinley can't produce hogs as
cheaply. ``When we're all out of business and it's just the biggest
two or three producers, well, it ain't gonna be cheap,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The time from birth to slaughter can be as short as 5 1/2
months. Premium Standard processes 7,000 hogs per a day using stun
guns to render them unconscious before they are bled to death.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors say the pigs are given drugs to fatten them up faster.
A May report in the New England Journal of Medicine said that 40
percent of all antibiotics are used in agriculture and 80 percent
of them are used to promote rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antibiotics are being used not to prevent or treat illness but
to promote rapid weight gain of animals and increased profits for
owners,'' said Margaret Mellon, director of the agriculture and
biotechnology program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ``We
are compromising our own future as our resistance to antibiotics
increases.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great concern and belief that antibiotic use in
animals is promoting a resistance for certain pathogens like
salmonella,'' said Mead, of the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the World Health organization recommended phasing out
the use of antibiotics to promote livestock growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farms are factories of drug resistance,'' said Dr. Stuart
Levy, director of the Center for Adaptation, Genetics and Drug
Resistance at the Tufts University School of Medicine. ``The
non-therapeutic misusage is just causing more multi-drug resistance
in human therapy. They can transfer resistance, whether it's
something we eat or touch or waste that's tilled into another
source.''
</P>
<P>
   Premium Standard's Manly responded that although the company's
hogs are given ``the absolute minimum'' amount of antibiotics as
growth additives, the drugs are stopped weeks before slaughter, and
the final product is ``antibiotic - residue free.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is pointing fingers at the medical centers that are
prescribing antibiotics for every ear infection and common cold,''
added Collette Schultz Kaster, Premium Standard's director of
technical services.
</P>
<P>
   Kaster gives a tour of the company's massive packing room. It is
immaculate. ``The public wants safe food and they want genetic
improvement of their food,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The processing plant is a high-tech, antiseptic operation, the
antithesis of the family farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came from family farms,'' says Kaster. ``I'd love to work on
a family farm like my grandpa. It's a little hurtful, but we look
for segments where we can make a living.''

 CHESTERFIELD, Mo.: ... Monsanto chairman.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But activists say that behind Monsanto's green mask is the same
company that sold the now-banned polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
developed and produced Agent Orange during the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have chemical companies making tremendous profits from
selling toxic chemicals that you pour on weeds,'' said Wendy
McGoodwin, executive director of the Council for Responsible
Genetics, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Cambridge. ``They can
make greater profits if they develop seeds genetically engineered
to withstand even higher doses of chemicals.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace says that Monsanto Roundup Ready soybeans are ``a
massive genetic experiment in which human beings and the
environment are the guinea pigs.'' It says long-term effects are
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   But Monsanto says Roundup Ready soybeans are ``safer than table
salt'' and part of a natural progression of farming that has
evolved since mankind started planting and selecting crops
thousands of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go through the toughest regulatory process in the world,''
said Barton, the company's spokesman. ``It's all done on our dime
and it costs billions. As for the labeling, we are following FDA
regulations. There's nothing to label. There is no substantial
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto says that transgenic plants are tested for years before
they come to market. ``We've done 25,000 field tests on transgenic
plants,'' said Roy Fuchs, Monsanto's director of regulatory
science. ``We've done 1,400 tests on Roundup Ready soybeans. The
food is as safe to eat as corresponding products. Nothing is
absolutely safe. The way the FDA and the regulatory process is set
up, we have the responsibility to test. They review our data. If
there is a problem, we have the liability.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics question the basic need for the product.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace says that Roundup Ready soybeans bring no benefit to
the consumer. ``They are not cheaper, tastier, or healthier.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds McGoodwin, of the Council for Responsible Genetics: ``Why
do we need genetically engineered foods? The producers and shippers
want the longer shelf life and crops that can tolerate herbicides.
The consumers don't need these things. The biotech companies are
depriving us of the ability to eat natural foods and forcing on us
a product we don't need.''
</P>
<P>
   Organic food is not the answer, according to Monsanto, whose
goals include sustainable development for the world's population,
now 5.8 billion, but projected to double by the year 2050.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't feed the world with organics,'' said Barton.
``Organics are a niche market, and not necessarily better. These
people call themselves environmentalists, but they are really
antis. They are against everything that's not organic. We are
trying to feed the world...To produce double the food with no more
land or new water, we have to be more productive.''''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring the Department of Agriculture was embarrassed when
it tried to lump genetically engineered foods into the organic
category along with irradiation and fertilizer containing sewage
sludge. Officials were swamped with more than 275,000, mostly
negative comments and reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   A new technique, nicknamed Terminator Technology, that renders
seeds sterile after one planting season is further infuriating
environmentalists who claim it would end the age-old practice of
saving seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by Delta and Pine Land Co., a firm Monsanto is in the
process of acquiring, the technique's patent is jointly held with
the USDA, which partially funded intitial research. Opponents of
genetically engineered foods say sterile seeds are inconsistent
with Monsanto's ``feed the world'' philosophy and would unfairly
burden Third World farmers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Biotechnology still in its infancy
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Monsanto's Life Sciences Research Center outside St. Louis,
1,900 scientists are doubling their ability to decode and identify
genetic information every 12 to 24 months. Prince Addae, one of the
scientists and a native of Ghana, grows genetically engineered corn
in a greenhouse at the facility. ``Our farmers would like to use
their own seeds over and over,'' says Addae. ``If there is a trait
we want _ --let's say insect-resistant so that the yield would be
better --_ then we can produce that in one plant. We are not
creating something new. We are using existing genes and
transferring them. Every gene has a job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest plant loss in the Third World is viruses,'' added
Barton. ``Think of the possibilities if you could end that.''
</P>
<P>
   But biotechnology is still in its infancy. ``Mother Nature was
very inventive,'' said Harry Harlow, Monsanto's director of
bioinformatics. ``There's four billion lines of code, but no
manual. Each plant has a genetic code of 50,000 genes. We are using
science to reduce the need for herbicides.''
</P>
<P>
   The Life Sciences complex includes 26 rooftop greenhouses and
176 laboratories. Each hallway has ropes dangling from emergency
showerheads in the ceiling in case of an accident, but no drains on
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Gene transfer is invisible. When the desired gene is identified,
it is placed in a solution and muzzle-loaded into a .22-caliber
shell. The shell is fired into a screen covering the plant tissue
in a petri dish, dispersing DNA. To the eye, it looks like a splash
of water. Through a microscope, it looks like needles being fired
into a basketball. The transgenic plant is then grown in the
traditional way.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents worry about the possibility of something going
very wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, the Alliance for Bio-Integrity lawsuit charges
that the genetically engineered food supplement L-tryptophan is
``the most probable explanation'' for dozens of deaths and
thousands of serious illnesses in 1988 in the United States and
Canada. The food supplement was manufactured by a Japanese company,
Showa Denko K.K.
</P>
<P>
   The company paid $1 billion to victims and their survivors,
while saying the cause of the accident is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocacy groups have raised scenarios that are particularly
distasteful, like the possibility of lamb chops going to market
with human genes originally introduced for pharmaceutical reasons
and then slaughtered with USDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty horrifying,'' said Joseph Mendelson III, legal
director of the International Center for Technology Assesement, a
Washington-based group that opposes genetic engineering. ``When are
we the cannibals, when we eat one human gene or two human genes?''
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto acknowledges using human genes in its pharmaceutical
products, but says it has no plans to use human genes in plants
used for foods. It dismissed critics' claims of genetically
engineered ``super weeds'' growing uncontrollably as ``science
fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   But researchers at Michigan State University have discovered
that a virus-resistant gene inserted into a plant has the potential
to recombine into a new, possibly more potent, virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do run that risk,'' said researcher Rebecca Grumet, who
worked on the Michigan State study, and still believes that the
benefits of genetic engineering far outweigh the risks. ``It's not
like in a laboratory. Once it's out, it's out.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto's Fuchs acknowledged that ``some of the virus can
recombine.''
</P>
<P>
   During a lunch and media tour of the research farm, entomologist
Dennis Edwards ate Monsanto's NewLeaf Plus potato that is
genetically engineered to be protected against the leaf roll virus
and the Colorado potato beetle. ``I'm a scientist, and I've got
kids,'' said Edwards. ``I have no problem letting them eat
genetically engineered food.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mellon, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, argues it's
not worth the risk. ``The benefits are miniscule,'' she said. ``The
biotech companies and the government have taken away the reasonable
choice people have not to take risks.''

   MILAN, Mo. _ We are in deep manure.
</P>
<P>
   Animal manure, that is.
</P>
<P>
   How deep? Roughly 1.3 billion tons of animal waste was produced
last year, or five tons of manure for each American, according to a
recent report by the US Senate Agriculture Committee. The report
said that animal waste from factory farms is an emerging national
problem and that federal regulations fail to adequately protect
water quality from animal waste.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri-based Premium Standard Farms, the nation's second
largest hog producer, guarantees safe pork from conception to
consumer. But it also produces five times more waste than the city
of St. Louis, without a sewage plant to treat it, according to the
Missouri Department of Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
   The manure stored in nearby lagoons _ sprayed on fields and
recycled to wash away solid waste in 1,000 temperature-controlled
barns _ has created leaks and spills that have polluted waterways,
killing more than 180,000 fish, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, pollution from factory farms has been increasing
dramatically, according to the Senate report issued last December.
In 1995 in North Carolina, a record hog waste spill of 35 million
gallons killed 10 million fish and closed 364,000 acres of coastal
wetlands to shellfish harvesting. Spills in Iowa, Minnesota, and
Missouri in 1996 killed more than a half-million fish. In Virginia,
Maryland, and North Carolina, waste from hog and chicken factories
is widely believed to have caused the pfiesteria, which has killed
more than a billion fish and caused human sickness, including
memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate report also warned of human health risks including
dangerous pathogens like Salmonella and Cryptosporidium, and the
pollution of drinking water with high levels of nitrates which are
potentially fatal to infants.
</P>
<P>
   Excess nutrients flowing down the Mississippi River are believed
to have resulted in a dead zone the size of New Jersey in the Gulf
of Mexico. Could a pig farm in the northwest corner of Missouri be
contributing to the dead zone 700 miles away?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can certainly blame them for part of it,'' said Scott Dye,
director of Citizens Legal Environmental Action Network or (CLEAN),
an environmental watchdog group comprised of 80 northern Missouri
families living near Premium Standard. ``Everything up here drains
into the Missouri and then the Mississippi. The large factory farms
are a big part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Premium Standard may contribute, it is not alone: water
and waste from 31 states flow into the Mississippi. Although
chemical fertilizer runoff from Corn Belt states is also blamed,
factory farm waste is increasingly finding its way into the water,
causing algae blooms and fish kills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were three stages of denial from these states,'' said
Don Anderson, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institute in Massachusetts. ``First was that the problem even
existed. Then that it was linked to excess nutrients, and finally
that it was their runoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, more animals are being produced on less land.
Concentrated factory farms, virtually non-existent 30 years ago,
are now proliferating, generating billions of dollars in big
business while creating cheaper, leaner food. In the case of
Premium Standard Farms, that means 97 percent fat-free meat, with
uniform color and weight and less cholesterol: the perfect pork
chop.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Premium Standard, which raises 1.7 million hogs a
year, represents a changing America, where big, high-tech
corporations are replacing mom and pop farms, and lawsuits
involving odors and pollution are being filed in little towns where
the only thing people used to worry about was putting too much
gravy on their mashed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agriculture is the most widespread source of pollution in the
nation's surveyed rivers,'' said Mike Cook, director of the Office
of Wastewater Management for the Environmental Protection Agency.
In 60 percent of rivers and streams that the EPA has identified as
``impaired,'' agricultural runoff, including nutrients from animal
waste, is the largest contributor to pollution, according to the
Senate Agriculture Committee report., entitled ``Animal Waste
Pollution in America: An Emerging National Problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Although human waste is sanitized, animal waste is not and it
contains parasites, bacteria, and viruses. There are no federal
regulations that address the handling, storage, land application,
or disposal of manure, the Senate report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a public emergency,'' said Ken Midkiff, director of
the Missouri Sierra Club. But he stressed that it's not just the
waste. ``It's also a food safety issue. The faster the production
lines go, the more likelihood you have of contaminants like fecal
coliform. If you have a processing plant that produces 7,000 hogs a
day, or 300,000 chickens a day, the USDA can't catch the problems
at the plant. We didn't use to have these problems with small
packing houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Big factory farms produce food safety problems simply because of
their volume, because of the sheer numbers they deal with,
according to one former US Department of Agriculture meat
inspector.
</P>
<P>
   ``Factory farms do their own testing of meats under USDA
supervision,'' said Albert Midoux, who worked as a meat inspector
for 28 years, retired a decade ago and joined the Sierra Club.
``It's like the wolf guarding the hen house. Our USDA stamp doesn't
mean that food is safe, it means `watch out.'
</P>
<P>
   ``With the pig farms, they put most of them in the middle of
nowhere and when the water is running high, some of them just dump
their lagoons. Then people wonder why all the streams are polluted.
It's disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, there were 600,000 hog farms in the United
States. Today there are 157,000, producing roughly the same number
of hogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessarily bad,'' said Dr. Paul Mead, an
epidemiologist for the US Centers for Disease Control. ``Bigger
plants in general have better quality. It's just that when
something goes wrong, it goes wrong in a very bad way. That's why
we have bigger outbreaks.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
`This has divided the community'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the rolling hills of northwest Missouri, Jeri McKinley sits
on the 500-acre farm his great-grandfather homesteaded in 1853 and
talks about the giant pig factory next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some mornings it wakes you up and you can barely
breathe,'' he said, referring to the huge lagoons that store pig
waste before it is sprayed over the fields. ``If this happened in
my grandfather's day, there would have been a war. This has divided
the community more than the Civil War.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is a war, but it will be fought in the courts. In a
suit filed last year in US District Court court by CLEAN, the group
charges that Premium Standard Farms is in violation of the Clean
Water Act and Clean Air Act. The suit cites 50 violations,
including waste spills, leaks from manure lagoons, and allegations
of illegal spraying of waste and illegal disposal pits for dead
hogs. The Sierra Club has also charged that Premium Standard is a
``habitual and chronic polluter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Waste from these facilities is leaching from their lagoons,''
said CLEAN's Dye. ``They are grossly saturating the soil with hog
feces and urine. It makes all the families mad. We have to live by
these facilities and our children have to live by these
facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   But Premium Standard strenuously denies being a polluter. ``We
are stewards of the environment,'' said company president Robert
``Bo'' Manly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hogwash,'' said Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon. ``In too
many instances their waste has spilled into State of Missouri
waters. They run a Jurassic pig operation.''

PUTTING POISONS IN THE FIELDS

<P>
   VALLE DEL YAQUI, Mexico _ Hoisting a red flag over his head, the
farm worker stands motionless as the crop duster comes roaring at
him, nose down, like a frothing bull charging a matador.
</P>
<P>
   At the last moment, he drops the flag and runs for safety. The
plane pulls upward as the man disappears into a cloud of
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Here in this breadbasket of Mexico, farm workers toil and
sometimes get sprayed with harmful pesticides for $7 a day so that
Americans can have cheap produce all winter long.
</P>
<P>
   Eleazar Villegas Baypoli, 27, of Buaysiacobe, has medical costs
he can't meet and three children he can't feed. The farm worker
can't even tell his own story. He's got a tube in his throat and
not enough energy to shoo away the flies that land on his face.
</P>
<P>
   Villegas was once a robust young man working in the fields of
tomatoes to be exported to the United States. That was until
February, when he was told to spray the tomatoes with a diluted
mixture of three pesticides, including the highly toxic chemical
parathion. According to his wife, Leticia Leyva Romero, Villegas
complained that the spray made him feel weak, and after three days
in the field he felt a ``fire'' in his chest and could barely
breathe. To save his life, doctors performed an emergency
tracheotomy.
</P>
<P>
   Today Villegas suffers from nerve damage and depression. He is
bedridden, has no health insurance, no income, and only meager food
supplies left in the pantry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agricultural workers are very much at risk,'' said Juan
Mathieu Veillard, president of the Ecologists Movement of Southern
Sonora, an environmental activist group. ``They don't use masks.
They are using dangerous pesticides.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to 25 million agricultural workers in the developing world
may suffer at least one incident of pesticide poisoning each year
because they don't use US-required protective clothing or
respirators and are inadequately trained, according to the World
Health Organization. In the United States, there are only a handful
of pesticide-related deaths recorded each year, but at least
100,000 farm workers are treated annually for pesticide-related
illnesses, according to the American Association of Poison Control
Centers, a Washington-based nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, 1 million children are exposed to unsafe
levels of pesticides in fruit, vegetables, or baby food, according
to a recent report by the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit
Washington-based research organization. The report urged a ban on
organophosphate pesticides, which are highly acute nerve toxins.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 and 1996, the United States exported 14 tons per day of
pesticides not approved for use in the nation. Most go to Third
World countries.
</P>
<P>
   Still used in the United States, however, are 58 chemicals that
are either known or probable human carcinogens, according to a
report released in July by the Environmental Protection Agency's
Office of Pesticide Programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knee-jerk reaction is to blame imported food, but in many
cases domestic food is loaded,'' said Kert Davies, a researcher at
Environmental Working Group. ``For example, Florida tomatoes are
very, very pesticide-intensive. They've got fungicides and
herbicides and insecticides.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida growers, however, say their tomatoes are safe and comply
with all state regulations. ``We meet all government standards,''
said Skip Jonas, field compliance officer for the Florida Tomato
Exchange, a cooperative of tomato handlers and growers based in
Orlando. ``It's true that to grow tomatoes in Florida you need more
chemicals than anyplace in the country. But we're so highly
regulated it's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the EPA says it sets tolerance levels for the amount
of pesticide residues that are hundreds, and sometimes even
thousands of times lower than minimum levels that have damaged the
health of animals in extensive tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are toxic chemicals designed to kill things,'' said
Brian Dementi, an EPA toxicologist. ``I'm not saying pesticides are
not safe. But pesticides can't be tested on humans, and animal
models may not be adequate. We wrestle with this all the time.
They've increased yields but there are uncertainties of safety. We
try to account for that, but in some cases that might be
inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   With pesticide use skyrocketing, the US Department of
Agriculture is encouraging farmers to use integrated pest
management, which encourages alternatives to pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   The US Food and Drug Administration, which enforces pesticide
tolerances set by the EPA, acknowledges it can only detect about
half of the approximately 400 pesticides in existence.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of the fruits and vegetables imported to the
United States pass through Nogales, Ariz., the largest
winter-produce port of entry in the country, according to customs
officials. That's 3.7 billion pounds of fruit and vegetables
annually, carried in up to 1,200 trucks per day.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA says that 30 percent of all shipments are randomly
inspected after a computer targets those shipments by growers with
past violations. But out of the 1,200 trucks, only 10 to 15 are
actually tested for pesticides, the agency acknowledges. About 3
percent are found in violation, the same rate as for produce grown
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to Nogales by a reporter, FDA consumer-safety
operators pulled samples of eggplant and yellow squash from Mexican
trucks at the border. They were sent overnight to a lab in Los
Angeles. The result: Both were within EPA tolerance levels but
showed traces of the highly toxic pesticide endosulfan.
</P>
<P>
   As samples are tested, trucks are allowed to proceed because of
their perishable contents. ``It's a total farce. By the time the
stuff is tested it's been sold in Connecticut,'' said Davies of the
Environmental Working Group.
</P>
<P>
   But Gil Meza, spokesman for the FDA in Phoenix, insisted produce
from Mexico is safe. ``You'd be surprised how much outreach we have
with farmers,'' Meza said. ``They are following EPA guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, which represents
the produce industry in Mexico, also says the fruits and vegetables
imported annually to the United States from Mexico are safe. They
are grown to meet US standards and inspected at a rate five times
higher than produce grown in the United States, the group says.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA says there is ``no significant difference'' between the
levels of pesticide residues found on domestic and imported food.
</P>
<P>
   But lost in the battle for food safety are the farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The management of pesticides, particularly the disposal of the
used bottles, is dangerous,'' said Veillard, the environmental
activist. ``You find them in the ditches, and sometimes the people
reuse them. This is dangerous for children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not afraid,'' said Jose Luis Rodriquez, whose protective
equipment consists of a baseball cap. ``I take care. I'm going to
take a shower after this spraying.''
</P>
<P>
   Instructions and warnings on pesticides are often written in
English, and workers are given little training or protection.
</P>
<P>
   There are also cultural problems. ``To spray pesticides you need
gloves and masks,'' said Margarita Morales, a Mexican sociologist.
``But here, it is the culture of machismo. If you even wear a shirt
in the field, then you're seen like a female.''
</P>
<P>
   Guadalupe Gocobachi, 30, makes about $4 a day spraying
pesticides. ``It's toxic, it's true. But when the toxicity is high,
we protect ourselves. I use my own clothes and double my shirt and
pants.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Eleazar Villegas Baypoli, every day is silent since he
underwent his tracheotomy. The village where he lives has piles of
carelessly discarded pesticide bottles, their skulls and crossbones
baking in the relentless sun.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting motionless in the shade with a mangy dog, Villegas
motions for pen and paper. He writes slowly, painstakingly so, in
Spanish: ``Protect yourself from chemicals and pesticides because
they are very harmful. I request financial support for my disease
because my kids are too young. I ask for support for every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he raises his arm, ever so slowly, and lowers it softly on
his young son's head.

NEW DANGERS ENTER THE US FOOD SUPPLY

 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Fifties, we were told that red meat was good for us. By
the cholesterol-clogged Nineties, the health mantra was to eat more
fresh fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   But a new Congressionally mandated report warns that eating too
many raw or minimimally processed fruits vegetables is risky.
Confused? Just ask Laura Biddle, a minister and mother of three
from Topsfield who loves fresh fruit and vegetables. After
contracting the parasite cyclospora in April 1997, however, she
looks at produce differently. ``I seriously thought I was dying,
that my insides were falling out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Biddle said she became nauseous after eating raspberries and
strawberries bought at a food stand in Boston. She was listless,
suffered cramps and diarrhea and lost 10 pounds. It took nearly
three months for doctors to figure out what was wrong with her, but
with the help of sulfur drugs, she has recovered fully.
</P>
<P>
   Others are not so lucky. At least 30 million cases of food-borne
illnesses cause up to 9,100 deaths annually in the United States,
mostly to children and the elderly, according to a 1996 report by
Congress' General Accounting Office. Pathogenic microorganisms,
toxic chemicals naturally present in food, pesticide residues, and
food additives, are the main causes of food illness.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent improvements, the US food safety system is
``inconsistent, uneven and at times archaic,'' according to a July
report, entitled ``Ensuring Safe Food,'' prepared for Congress by
the Institute of Medicine and National Research Council, a
Washington-based nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Of special recent concern have been cases of meat
contamination from E. coli bacteria, and the June outbreak of
salmonella from breakfast cereal that made 200 people in 11 states
sick. Medical costs and productivity losses have been estimated at
up to $37.1 billion a year, according to the US Department of
Agriculture's Economic Research Service.
</P>
<P>
   Despite improvements in food quality over the years, bacteria
are adapting and evolving into more virulent forms, according to
food saftey specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue is not what we know is on food, but what we
don't know is on food,'' said Caroline Smith De Waal, director of
the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest, a
health advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization of the food system brings food from all over the
world into the US marketplace, and with it the potential for
food-borne infection or other hazards not normally found in the
United States,'' according to the ``Ensuring Safe Food'' report.
</P>
<P>
   The US food safety system is facing ``tremendous pressures'' to
maintain adequate oversight of the imported food boom, especially
with regard to produce, the report, said. It also cited outdated
safety laws, a fragmented federal regulatory structure (12 federal
agencies are responsible for implementing 35 food safety statutes)
and the availability of new food choices as factors placing further
strains on food safety.
</P>
<P>
   And an April report by the General Accounting Office concluded
that federal regulatory efforts in food safety are inconsistent and
unreliable. The report warned that ``federal agencies cannot ensure
that the growing volume of imported foods is safe for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the GAO report, the number of imported food entries
into the United States more than doubled between 1992 and 1997,
from 1.1 million to 2.7 million. Yet Food and Drug Administration
inspections declined from 8 percent of the total imports to less
than 2 percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   In July, President Clinton, who has proclaimed the US food
supply ``the most bountiful and safest in the world,'' proposed a
$101 million food safety initiative to pay for 225 new FDA
adminstrators and inspectors, and to establish a new institute for
food safety research. But a food fight is brewing in Congress,
where the House has only approved $16.8 million of the amount
Clinton wants, while the Senate has approved $68 million. A
conference committee is scheduled to meet this month to forge a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The United States food supply has changed greatly in the last
generation, when 70 percent of foodstuffs were produced within 100
miles of home. Now supermarkets carry items from all around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we say we have the world's safest food supply when
what we have is food from all over the world,'' said Dr. Michael
Osterholm, epidemiologist of the Minnesota Health Department, and a
leading food-safety specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials warn that Americans have a false sense of
security when it comes to food. They travel to Mexico and refuse to
eat raw fruit and vegetables, then return home and buy the same
fruits and vegetables at their local supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, eating habits have changed. ``Half of the food
dollar is spent outside the home,'' said Osterholm. ``Food service
is the lowest-paid rung on the ladder. These people have no health
insurance. They may not speak the language, and if they have an
infectious disease and don't wash their hands, you've got a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Relying on port-of-entry inspections to detect unsafe food is
``ineffective,'' the GAO report said. ``This approach does not
ensure that foods are produced under adequate conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA admits that inspections don't detect some organisms,
such as the cyclospora outbreaks from Guatemalan raspberries that
sickened nearly 2,500 people in 20 states and Canada in 1997 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a 1997 outbreak of hepatitis A from frozen
strawberries imported from Mexico sickened 270 people in five
states, including 130 children in Michigan. And in 1987, an
outbreak of salmonella from cantaloupes imported from Mexico caused
more than 25,000 illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's spokesman in Phoenix, Gil Meza, said the agency also
does not routinely test for life-threatening microbial
contamination on fruits and vegetables. ``Historically, it hasn't
been an issue until all the various outbreaks we've had in the last
five years,'' Meza said. ``We're taking another look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite increased media and government awareness campaigns, most
Americans don't know a lot about common food-borne pathogens.
</P>
<P>
   For example, campylobacter jejuni, commonly found in chicken
intestines, is now considered the leading cause of food-borne
bacterial infection and the second biggest food-borne killer,
behind salmonella, according to the US Centers for Disease Control.
It infects 4 million Americans a year.
</P>
<P>
   Just call it a bachelor's disease. ``It affects a lot of young
men who go out into the world and end up infecting themselves,'' by
undercooking chicken, said Dr. Paul Mead an epidemiologist at the
CDC.
</P>
<P>
   Although far less known than its fellow pathogen E. coli,
campylobacter jejuni causes diarrhea and in rare instances
Guillain-Barre syndrome, a potentially fatal autoimmune disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``E. coli causes outbreaks and grabs headlines,'' said Mead.
``Campylobacter is more sporadic.''
</P>
<P>
   Illnesses caused by salmonella, found in eggs, poultry and fresh
produce, have doubled in the last 20 years, according to the CDC.
Several strains of salmonella are now resistant to antibiotics.
Neither campylobacter nor E. coli were even identified as human
health hazards until the late 1970s, the CDC said. Harmful bacteria
also are finding new modes of transmission. While E. coli is
normally linked to undercooked ground beef, it has also been traced
to raw milk, lettuce, and unpasteurized apple cider.
</P>
<P>
   After getting sick last year, the trust Laura Biddle had that
her food is safe is gone forever.

   ``I'm so much more concerned about what my children eat and
where the food comes from,'' she said. ``It's scary. You think
you're getting something fresh, but it's not labeled, and at the
downtown fruit stands you can't touch it. The CDC told me even if
the fruit was washed I still would have gotten cyclospora. Now,
when the kids tell me they want raspberries, I take them to one of
those pick-them-yourself places.''

 &HT;    ``Phantom menace'' title of new Star Wars
 &HT;    By Hank Stuever
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hold on to your hyperdrive, kiddies: Next
summer's new ``Star Wars'' movie has a title. But you might not
like it.
</P>
<P>
   How does ``The Phantom Menace'' grab you?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding,'' says Mark Farr-Nash, my favorite comic-book
store clerk in all the land, setting down his water bottle at
Austin Books Monday afternoon, adjusting his Incredible Hulk
t-shirt and scrunching up his face. ``Please note my ire. `The
Phantom Menace'!? Puh-lease. Maybe if the movie starred Commander
Cody or Buck Rogers or even Red Ryder, then it wouldn't be a bad
title. `The Phantom Menace'? Lord, give me strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange as it seems _ and as unhappy as it's making some
die-hard fans _ that appears to be the movie's title. It was
revealed quietly on an official ``Star Wars'' website last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fans have been waiting several months for creator George Lucas
to announce the title to the first of three ``prequel'' films that
will tell the story of life in the galaxy far, far away before Luke
Skywalker was born. The $115-million ``Episode 1'' has wrapped
filming in Tunisia, Italy and England. Computerized special effects
are being finished at Lucas' headquarters in Northern California;
composer John Williams is set to begin soundtrack recording this
fall with the London Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most eagerly awaited movie (and pop-cultural) event
in Generation X's lifetime, ``The Phantom Menace'' will be
releasedMay 21.
</P>
<P>
   The mysterious title, now working its way to logo designs for
everything from toy packaging to Pepsi cans, was also quickly
registered as a website address by the filmmaker. A Lucasfilm
spokeswoman confirmed Monday that ``Star Wars Episode I: The
Phantom Menace'' is the film's actual name _ although Lucas has
changed his mind in the past. Episode 6, originally titled
``Revenge of the Jedi,'' was changed to ``Return of the Jedi''
months before its 1983 release.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was `Huh?' '' said Scott Chitwood, a
25-year-old Houston civil engineer who in his spare time runs
TheForce.Net, a website where fans share leaked prequel information
and try to sniff out fact from rumor. ``The title came totally out
of left field. I'm glad they surprised us with it, but at the same
time it doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. I didn't care for it
at first, but I'm learning to live with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much choice,'' Chitwood added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' said a giggling Harry Knowles, 28, the
Austin-based showbiz Internet gossip king, who claimed several
weeks ago that he's read a copy of the film's script _ and likes
it. ``Nobody in their right mind would ever name a movie `The
Phantom Menace.' All the fans are going nuts because of it. It sort
of shows that Lucas will do anything, and I'm all for it. Remember,
it's a serial. He's having fun with it (and) it's a rollicking
adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone feels the Force flowing within them, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ugh. The more I hear it, the stranger it sounds. . . . I've
spent over half my life waiting for something that will be called
`The Phantom Menace'?'' said Carl Cunningham, 26, an Atlanta fan
who runs Prequel Watch, another unofficial website. ``I'm really
trying to be open-minded about it. . . . So far, no luck. I just
can't imagine walking up to a box office in eight months and saying
`Three (tickets) for ``The Phantom Menace'' please. . .' This is
the first time I've begun to have any doubts or worries about
whether or not this film will live up to any expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Savvy fans had batted around several rumored titles in past
months. Some front-runners were ``Balance of the Force,''
``Guardians of the Force'' and ``Knights of the Republic.'' Other
rumored titles seemed quirky, but interesting: ``First Hope,'' a
nod to the 1977 ``Star Wars'' original title, ``A New Hope,'' and
``First Droid,'' somehow suggesting it all starts with the robot
characters.
</P>
<P>
   The title seems in keeping with Lucas' original vision of the
``Star Wars'' movies as a melodramatic serial, modeled on the
matinee adventures of yesteryear. A peek at the new ``Star Wars''
movies shows a grander flourish than the original trilogy, filled
with post-modern architecture, galactic castles and senate
chambers, curvacious chrome spaceships, bug-eyed swampy things, and
vivid colors.
</P>
<P>
   Chitwood's website reported Monday that Lucas _ a chronic
borrower of everything from Greek myths, Zen aestheticism and the
wild west cowboy _ seems to be looking to old pulp novels for
titles. ``The Phantom'' book series in the '30s featured such
episodes as ``The Phantom Strikes Back,'' ``Torch of Doom'' and
``The Scarlet Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial prequel-related websites, which have been spying on
``Episode 1's'' progress since the movie went into production in
1997, are alive with ``Phantom Menace'' backlash. As of Monday,
more than 800 fans had weighed in on TheForce.Net _ ``Only a
quarter of them have said that they like (the title),'' Chitwood
said. ``Most of the fans either hate it, or say they can live with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   So just what is a phantom menace? Know-it-all Knowles says it
alludes to the movie's plot, where warring factions become allies,
once they realize they've been tricked by a common enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles also polled visitors at his Ain't It Cool News website
to see how ``The Phantom Menace'' flies with them. The results were
a tad more hopeful. Of 4,000 fans, about 1,000 said they loved it.
The rest showed varying degrees of acceptance, confusion and utter
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe George Lucas is just testing us,'' said Farr-Nash,
mulling over the title in the comic book store. ``On the other hand
he could call it `Voody Voody Klackto Vedastein' and people would
show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Voody what? Spell that, please.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can spell it how you want,'' Farr-Nash said. ``It's better
than, than . . . `The Phantom Menace.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace'' (the more you say it, the better it
sounds) takes place 40 years before the events in the first three
movies. It stars Ewan McGregor as a young, cocky Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Jake Lloyd plays Anakin Skywalker, a slave boy with a knack for
racing desert pod cars and building robots. Liam Neeson plays the
paternal Qui-Gon Jinn, a Jedi master; Natalie Portman plays a
teen-age queen of a planet being attacked by evil robots. The movie
will feature several familiar characters, including Yoda, R2-D2 and
Jabba the Hutt. ``Pulp Fiction's'' Samuel L. Jackson is in the
supporting cast as a Jedi knight named Mace Windu. For spoilers on

 &HT;    DuPont cutting jobs and salaries
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ DuPont Photomasks Inc., a Round Rock-based
supplier of a key semiconductor component, said recently that it
would cut jobs and salaries because of the global chip slump.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that it would eliminate 40 jobs, 35 in its
Round Rock operations, and cut the salaries of about 15 percent of
its workers starting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the job cuts are in manufacturing, administration and
support in the company's production plant. It will have about 300
workers in Round Rock after the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont Photomasks makes photomasks, precision plates that
contain the patterns of microelectronic circuits required to
manufacture semiconductor devices.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Austin, Steag Microtech, the U.S. subsidiary of a
German semiconductor equipment maker, laid off 26 of its U.S.
workers, including 12 in Austin, to cut expenses because of the
semiconductor slump. The company employed about 50 workers in
Austin prior to the cutback.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont and Steag are the latest Austin semiconductor-related
companies to make cutbacks because of lower chip sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   At DuPont, the six-month salary cuts will range from 5 percent
to 15 percent and will affect more than 200 managers, executives
and professional workers worldwide. DuPont Photomasks' senior
executives will take the largest salary cuts. Chief executive J.
Michael Hardinger could forgo more than $22,000 in salary over the
next six months.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont Photomasks expects to take a one-time restructuring
charge of about $500,000 to pay for the work force reductions and
other costs. The company wanted to cut costs without cutting deeply
into its work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``While our business has been soft, we need to be prepared for
when the industry comes back,'' said Ken Rygler, executive vice
president for worldwide marketing and strategic planning. Rygler
added that the timing of the industry's rebound remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, DuPont Photomasks had postponed construction of a
photomask plant in Gresham, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Some forecasters expect chip industry revenues to fall by 9
percent this year because of soft demand, overcapacity and falling
prices.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont Photomasks' stock closed at $24 a share, down $2 a share,
in Monday Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont Photomasks and rival Photronics Inc., based in Jupiter,
Fla., are the two largest companies in the photomask industry.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont earned $33.5 million on revenue of $271.6 million for the
year ended in June. Photronics, which began production at its Round
Rock plant early this year, reported a profit of $25.6 million on
revenue of $197.5 million for the year ended last October.
</P>
<P>
   The photomask industry could rebound within a few quarters as
chipmakers prepare for production of new products, said analyst
Cody Acree with Southwest Securities in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry has the ability to recover and grow in quick
fashion,'' Acree said.
</P>
<P>
   At Steag, the job cuts came in production and customer support.
The company makes automated equipment to clean semiconductors
during the manufacturing process.
</P>
<P>
   Steag will scale back its equipment production in Austin, but
will maintain sales, support and research and development
operations, said Johannes Brinkmann, president of Steag Microtech.
Some production work is being shifted to the company's larger
factories in Germany.

 &HT;    The deal behind Williams' 300-yard game
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ricky Williams claims he could have carried
another 15 times Saturday night against the Rice Owls, but a deal
is a deal, even if it's sealed with a wink and a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Coach Mack Brown, told late in the game that his senior
halfback was within striking distance of his first 300-yard game,
approached Williams with the offer of one more series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He winked at me and smiled,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams broke a 9-yarder, then a 41-yard touchdown, and then
retired to the bench with 318 yards and the roar of the crowd in
his ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been 5 yards, 4 yards, 5 yards, I don't know if I'd
have left him in,'' Brown said. ``I heard after the game the fans
were chanting Ricky, Ricky. I'm glad I kept on those headphones.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's 59-21 rout of Rice marked the third straight
one-sided game in which Brown has had to decide when to pull
Williams, but it was the first time mercy guided his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he had mixed emotions about whether to sit Ricky or
let him try for Roosevelt Leaks' single-game UT rushing record of
342 yards, set against SMU in 1973. ``I felt bad in some ways with
him having a chance to break the record,'' Brown said. ``I also
remember what it was like to stand on the sideline getting beat by
Kansas State.''
</P>
<P>
   Empathy for Rice was one of four major factors in Brown's
decision about when to pull Williams. The second was the risk of
injury, and Brown said he wanted to make sure he wasn't sending a
fatigued Williams into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed like he was more tired at the end of the first
quarter than at the end of the third,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence in the defense was the third factor. ``The thing is,
with our defense, 21 points is not much,'' he said. ``Until we got
the field goal (to go up 45-21 early in the fourth quarter), I
didn't feel good. Last year (as North Carolina's coach), there were
times when I felt I could have left the stadium, come back later,
and still be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   The final factor was fairness to the other Longhorns. Brown
wanted to make sure backup halfback Hodges Mitchell got some snaps
(he had 50 yards on eight carries) and didn't want Williams running
behind the second-team offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the big first half (187 yards), I saw that 300 was
within reach,'' said Williams, who was apprised of his yardage
total at halftime. ``I wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has averaged 184.0 yards through four games and will
need 170.3 over the last seven to break Tony Dorsett's career
rushing record of 6,082. Last spring Brown talked about how winning
games would take precedence over winning Williams the Heisman. Now,
it's clear that it's almost impossible to separate the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the Heisman is important to this
program,'' Brown said. ``You look at some of the people he's
outgained and they all won the Heisman.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of the nine running backs ahead of Williams on the all-time
rushing list won the Heisman _ Dorsett (1976), Charles White ('79),
Herschel Walker ('82), Archie Griffin ('74, '75) and George Rogers
('80).
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit me that Ricky is making history,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he began to have greater appreciation of the pressure
Williams faces when he heard a quote from a pitcher who had to face
Mark McGwire. The pitcher talked of every pitch being a ``record
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So you know they're going to give it all on every pitch to
him,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams that come in here don't talk about beating us, they all
talk about stopping Ricky. He's handled that well.''

 &HT;    Bengals' season over
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI, Ohio _ The end of September brings two certainties _
cold weather is about to begin and the Cincinnati Bengals' playoff
hopes are about to end.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati ended their all-too-familiar September swan song in
Baltimore Sunday night, losing 31-24 to the Ravens and dropping to
1-3.
</P>
<P>
   Since last making the playoffs in 1990, the Bengals are 7-25 at
this stage of the season. They've gone 0-4 three times, 1-3 three
times and 2-2 twice.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday night, coach Bruce Coslet referred to the loss in
Baltimore as ``demoralizing.'' The Bengals quickly fell behind
21-0, fought back to within 21-17 early in the second half and then
let the Ravens regain control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't hold me to anything I say right after a game,'' Coslet
said during a press conference on Monday. ``I'm not demoralized.
I'm probably frustrated. But you come back, you watch the films and
you try to fix the things that went wrong. And they are fixable. We
have players who are good enough to fix them.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be some extra time for fixing because the Bengals
have a bye this Sunday. They host 3-1 Pittsburgh on Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Coslet defended his decision of passing on fourth and one from
Baltimore's 32-yard line with 1:46 left. Jeff Blake, who played
much of the second half after Neil O'Donnell went out with bruised
ribs, tried to hit Darnay Scott, but Scott couldn't make the catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play was there and we blew it,'' Coslet said. ``It's all
execution. I stand up here every week and say the same damn thing
and it's still true. We execute in practice and for some reason we
do something different in the games.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss to the Ravens was a microcosm of the way the season has
unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals get Corey Dillon untracked for 116 yards, but allow
Baltimore's Priest Holmes to get 173 in his first NFL start.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals make a big play on special teams when Tremain Mack
returns the second-half kickoff 97 yards, then get burned for an
87-yard punt return TD by the Ravens' Jermaine Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals get a 67-yard touchdown pass from Blake to Carl
Pickens, but allow Eric Zeier to throw a 73-yarder to Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   After a strong showing in the previous week's 13-6 loss to Green
Bay, the young Cincinnati defense took a giant step backward,
allowing Baltimore to gain an average of 7.1 yards on 58 offensive
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the athletic ability and the play-making ability of the
young guys and in the recent past I haven't been able to stand up
here and say that,'' Coslet said. ``We'll be OK eventually, but it
hurts to go through these growing pains.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside linebacker Tom Tumulty is out for the season after
suffering a serious knee injury on Sunday. His replacement, rookie
Brian Simmons, made some plays, but he was more dazed than
dazzling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a rookie and he just came back after missing about 2
weeks of practice (following arthroscopic knee surgery), Coslet
said. ``He made some real good plays and he made some rookie-type
plays. That's what we're dealing with. We're very young and very
aggressive and we're not quite ready for prime time.''

 &HT;    Declining rushing game hurting Dallas
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Four weeks into the NFL season, the most
disturbing trend for the Dallas Cowboys has been the steady decline
of their once-overpowering running game.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure whether the blame belongs to Emmitt Smith, the
offensive line, a combination of both, or none of the above. But no
one can dispute the team's diminishing rushing totals from the
first four games:
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 6, Arizona: 42 carries, 183 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 13, Denver: 30 carries, 169 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 21, New York Giants: 29 carries, 80 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 27, Oakland: 25 carries, 68 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all share in the responsibility of not being able to run
the ball,'' Coach Chan Gailey said Monday, one day after his team
suffered a 13-12 setback to the Raiders at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of the running attack has put extra pressure on
quarterback Jason Garrett, who passed for 222 yards against
Oakland. But two interceptions, including one on the Cowboys' final
possession, robbed them of a chance to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett's inexperience contributed to both of his interceptions,
Gailey said. Both were thrown in the end zone _ directly at the
Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's first interception was caught by rookie Charles
Woodson. It shocked many at Texas Stadium because the pass,
intended for Michael Irvin, was thrown directly at Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they were thinking,'' Woodson said. ``He
threw the ball right to me. All I had to do was catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey blamed himself for the busted play.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday, he said, Garrett had practiced that particular
pass route with Billy Davis and Ernie Mills. The timing was wrong
Sunday because Irvin was not used to that play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my fault for putting (Garrett and Irvin) in that
position,'' Gailey said. ``Ernie and Billy are usually the guys who
run that play.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett's final interception was even more costly. He had three
options on his final pass of the fourth quarter, and elected to
throw to Davis, who was double-covered by the Raiders near the goal
line. Irvin and Deion Sanders were running short patterns and
appeared open.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland safety Eric Turner easily cradled Garrett's pass,
sealing the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came right to me,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey is concerned that the tough loss might discourage the 2-2
Cowboys, who have an NFC East game at Washington on October 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't let one loss cost you two,'' Gailey said. ``I told
the team I know it hurts to lose, and it's even harder when you
have opportunities to win. It's frustrating. But we can't let one
loss turn into two. This is a big division game we have to get
ready for.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman hopes to return for the Oct. 11 home
game against Carolina. Gailey said Aikman might be the No. 3
quarterback at Washington, but it's doubtful he'll be used in any
situation.

<P>
   If John Glenn's Space Shuttle ride into orbit next month fails
to enhance his image as a space hero, a new Hot Wheels toy from
Mattel might make Ohio's senior senator a collectible.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel will introduce the ``Action Pack John Glenn, Great
American Hero'' miniature toy collection next month in conjunction
with the Oct. 29 launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery for Mission
STS-95.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, 77, will be part of a seven-member crew that will study
the effects of space flight on aging. He will be the oldest human
to venture into the cosmos and also will serve as official
photographer.
</P>
<P>
   The Hot Wheels package includes a 3-inch miniature of the Space
Shuttle, a 2-inch model of Glenn's 1962 Friendship 7 space capsule
_ complete with window _ in which he was the first American to
orbit the Earth, and smaller miniatures of Glenn as a Mercury
astronaut, U.S. senator and 1998 Space Shuttle crew member.
Suggested retail price for the packaged set, which was made in
China, is $4.95.
</P>
<P>
   An aide said the senator will receive no compensation for the
use of his image.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this will benefit the space program by getting kids
excited about it,'' said spokesman Jack Sparks in Washington.
``It's designed for ages 6 to 10.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Glenn said he would approve of it so long as NASA
approved and there was an educational component,'' Sparks said. The
package describes Glenn's career as an astronaut and U.S. senator.
The first Ohioan to win four consecutive terms in the U.S. Senate,
Glenn leaves office this year.
</P>
<P>
   The toy has one minor flaw. The voyage is scheduled to last only
nine days, not 10, as stated on the package.

 &HT;    Jesse Jackson plans for Appalachia revitalization
 &HT;    By Charlise Lyles
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NELSONVILLE, Ohio _ The needs of Appalachia and Harlem should be
on the radar screens of Wall Street and Congress much like their
concerns about the economies of troubled countries overseas, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson said recently.
</P>
<P>
   To end Appalachia's relentless poverty, Jackson called for small
business development, public-private investment, philanthropy and
government incentive programs to aid businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street has 'red lined' Appalachia and Harlem,'' Jackson
said at an economic roundtable that ended the Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition's 10-day journey through Appalachia. Recalling slain
civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King's ``Poor People's
Campaign,'' Jackson drew attention to the region's economic,
education, employment and housing needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one speaks of the economic challenges of Appalachia, the
debate is de-racialized,'' he said. ``We could have the same debate
in Harlem. . . . Appalachia is not on Wall Street's mind. Harlem is
not on Wall Street's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not here fighting Wall Street,'' Jackson said.
``Appalachia needs Wall Street. We must put forth a deal where
Appalachia develops and Wall Street expands, and everybody wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson called the roundtable as part of the Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition's Wall Street Project. Launched in January 1997, the
project aims to steer investment capital into underserved areas.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he plans to urge his buddy, President Clinton, to
conduct a town hall meeting here to discuss investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been having town hall meetings on race to discuss how
we feel about each other,'' Jackson said. ``But there's no budget
attached to touchy, feely. There is no more access to capital from
touchy, feely.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after the coalition drew between 2,500 and 5,000 marchers
here, Jackson convened about 40 state and federal bureaucrats,
business people, and nonprofit managers to devise long-term
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Bischak of the Appalachian Regional Commission said the
area's main economic challenge is to replace with high-paying
service jobs nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs lost over the past
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   To boost private investment, Jackson urged residents to lobby
Congress for federal incentives similar to the export/import bank
and other U.S. foreign assistance programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come to Appalachia to say that we must at least do as much
for our people here as we do for foreign allies and even some
adversaries,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Developer D. Duane Jack of Envision Dayton urged renovation of
old abandoned buildings that can qualify for a 20 percent federal
tax credit if listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Jack is looking to restore an old brewery on Ohio
33, converting into a a center for shops or other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dayton has one of the largest urban Appalachian populations,
but what we have is everyone moving out of downtown. Whether it be
Nelsonville or Dayton, we are leaving valuable things behind,''
said Jack, whose company is developing the West Third Project in
West Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Attracting private investment to the region is tough because
``Wall Street wants a 15 to 35 percent return on investment''
within a certain amount of time, said Tom J. Anderle, of Bartlett &AMP;
Co. in Cincinnati. Entrepreneurs with little experience can not
deliver that. Investors would have to be willing to give a company
more time to succeed, Anderle said.
</P>
<P>
   In six to eight weeks, Jackson said, the coalition plans to
convene a meeting of Wall Street investors here to continue
discussing investment strategies.

 &HT;    Goodbye kiss to Kissimmee restoration fund
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not even Newt Gingrich could help as Florida lost out on $27
million needed to help the Everglades and begin restoring the
Kissimmee River.
</P>
<P>
   Some key congressmen are blaming the agency that asked for the
money: the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. They say a mid-level corps
official told Congress at the last minute that the agency doesn't
need the money, according to U.S. Rep. Mark Foley and environmental
lobbyists, who heard the reports second-hand.
</P>
<P>
   A top corps administrator adamantly denied it Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the House voted 389-25 for a $21 billion energy and
water bill. It gives the corps $14 million less than it says it
needs for first major fix of the Kissimmee.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists call the project crucial to restoring Lake Okeechobee
and the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The corps also fell $13 million short for a host of other
environmental projects in South and Central Florida. Those projects
could include restoration of Loxahatchee Slough or creation of a
pollution-filtering reservoir on 10-Mile Creek in St. Lucie County.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Gingrich recently wrote a letter endorsing the
corps' Kissimmee request, which earlier had fallen victim to a spat
between the White House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Foley and National Audubon Society lobbyist Tom Adams said they
hope to recover the money later this year, when Congress piles most
of the rest of the federal budget into a single bill.
</P>
<P>
   But they had no hope of fixing Monday's bill, which now goes to
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' Adams said. ``It's rare enough to get
that kind of letter from the speaker. Then to have it ignored, it
boggles my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley, R-West Palm Beach, said he wants to know if anyone from
the corps undermined the request. He voted for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   He said Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., a member of the House-Senate
conference committee that crafted the final spending numbers,
reported getting such a statement from a corps official. Reid could
not be reached for comment late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't make that up,'' Foley said. ``There's no reason
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Davis, deputy assistant secretary of the Army, insisted
that nobody at the corps made such a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't come from the corps,'' he said. In a letter last
week, he wrote that either the reported remark never occurred or
``a comment from the Corps was misinterpreted.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he's sure some communication mixup occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, Davis said the corps won't be able to begin
the first major step in the Kissimmee repair, the filling of nine
miles of canal.
</P>
<P>
   The project is part of a long-running effort to undo the damage
the corps did 30 years ago, when it straightened the curving river
into a stagnant canal.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration asked for $27 million to start the
work, and Davis said the corps needs at least $22 million to do any
of it. The bill the House passed Monday provides $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also had sought $20 million for the other
environmental projects. The bill provides $7 million. It's unclear
what specific projects will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said it's highly unlikely that the Senate will reopen the
bill at this late stage. He said President Clinton also would have
little leverage to demand changes, since both earlier versions of
the bill passed by veto-proof majorities.

 &HT;    Ceremony marks last tritium drum loading at Ohio's Mound Plant
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A fortress-like tunnel that burrows into a hill at the Mound
Plant in Ohio made a fitting backdrop for a ceremony marking the
end of the plant's work on nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Gathered at the concrete tunnel's mouth, government officials
and plant workers watched as a green forklift loaded a steel drum
into the back of a plain white truck. It was the symbolic loading
of the last drum of the Mound's radioactive tritium, a key element
in hydrogen bombs.
</P>
<P>
   When asked, Mound officials conceded the drum didn't really
contain tritium, a radioactive gas that is used to increase the
power of nuclear weapons. They said it was the closest they could
come to celebrating the real event because the details of actual
tritium shipments are secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still tritium on the site,'' said Mark Becker, a
spokesman for Babcock and Wilcox of Ohio, which operates the plant
under a Department of Energy contract.
</P>
<P>
   But sometime before Thursday, he said, Mound would load the last
drum of tritium and ship it to DOE's Savannah River plant in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In Mound's work with tritium, vessels containing the substance
would be removed from nuclear warheads and shipped to the site,
where technicians would remove the gas, purify it, and load it into
new vessels to be put back into the weapons. The work was done in
buried facilities surrounded by walls about 20 feet thick, hardened
against the possibility of nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The work was critical to maintaining America's nuclear stockpile
because tritium has a half-life _ the time it takes for half of it
to break down _ of 12 years. Mound's work replenished the warheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mission of great importance and it was very secret,''
said Leah Dever, DOE's Ohio Field Office manager.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody appeared to shed any tears over the end of this chapter
in Mound's history. And Miamisburg officials were all smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just think, seven years ago, we were fighting to keep this
here,'' Miamisburg Mayor Dick Church said.
</P>
<P>
   DOE decided to end Mound's weapons work in 1991 as part of a
major downsizing plan after the end of the Cold War and the
collapse of the Soviet Union. The site employed about 2,000 people
at the time, most of them scientists, engineers and highly skilled
technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Miamisburg and Ohio challenged DOE's claims that the move would
be cost-effective. Their efforts failed, but they won DOE's
cooperation in a plan to convert Mound into a high-tech business
park.
</P>
<P>
   The site now has about 860 people working for Babcock and Wilcox
or DOE. Most of their work involves decontamination and cleanup.
Michael Grauwelman, director of the Miamisburg Mound Community
Improvement Corp., said conversion efforts have created 28 private
companies employing about 270 people.
</P>
<P>
   With the last shipment, the only tritium left will be residual
material in pipes and other processing equipment, said Patrick
Burns, manager of the tritium disposal program. He said as much of
that will be recovered as possible. Once decontaminated, the
tritium facilities will be demolished or made available for
commercial use, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, a 22-year Mound employee, said one more ceremony is
planned to mark the secret final shipment: ``We're going to have a
pizza party after work.''

 &HT;    The man who wrote Clinton's plea for penitence
 &HT;    By Marcus Franklin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rabbi Jack Riemer understands President Clinton's public plea of
penitence.
</P>
<P>
   Riemer, formerly of Dayton, wrote the 204-word passage about
repentance and changing one's ways Clinton read Sept. 12 at a
national prayer breakfast attended by 106 clergy members.
</P>
<P>
   Riemer wrote Now Is The Time For Turning while serving as rabbi
at Beth Abraham synagogue in Dayton from 1964 to 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prayer is about how important it is for people to face up
to their mistakes and be willing to change even if it's
embarrassing and painful,'' Riemer said
</P>
<P>
   Riemer, now of Boca Raton, Fla., said he was moved and flattered
but surprised as he watched a live CNN broadcast of the president
reading the text. Hours later, the Starr report publicly detailed
Clinton's illicit relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly wasn't thinking of him when I wrote it but it fits
his situation,'' Riemer said from his home Monday. ``The temptation
to cover up and deny is so great in all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Jews around the world observe Yom Kippur, the holy day of
atonement, at sundown tonight, Riemer said the country is focusing
far too much on the misdeeds of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cop-out from dealing with our own sins,'' he said.
``Yom Kippur is about looking into the mirror and examining our own
lives. If we get caught up in what they're doing in Washington,
it's a projection away from our own sins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether his apology is sincere or not, that's God's
department.''
</P>
<P>
   During his delivery, Clinton honed in on the Jewish steps for
repentance; acknowledge wrongdoing, apologize to those you have
wronged and take steps to make sure you do not repeat the
transgression.
</P>
<P>
   Riemer said he wrote On Turning and other prayers because
``Judaism has to speak to the issues and the language of our
time.''
</P>
<P>
   It reads, in part, ``For leaves, birds and animals, turning
comes instinctively. But for us, turning does not come so easily..
. . It means breaking old habits. It means admitting that we have
been wrong; and this is never easy. It means losing face; it means
starting all over again; and this is always painful. It means
saying: I am sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   The prayer is contained in the Gates of Repentance, the Jewish
Reform movement's High Holy Days prayer book.
</P>
<P>
   More than 700,000 copies of Gates of Repentance are used in
about 90 percent of Reform congregations in the United States,
Reform Jewish officials estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Riemer said his prayers have also been set to music and
performed at Lincoln Center in New York.

 &HT;    My idea of television heaven would be....
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Have you ever wondered what channel you would
choose to watch if you were immobilized in a La-Z-Boy without a
remote control? I have. I'm always thinking of dumb stuff like
that.
</P>
<P>
   For me the decision would be easy. No sleaze talk shows, no
soaps, and definitely no home shopping. Just tune me in to the
channel that airs reruns of ``This Old House'' and other shows of
that ilk. Bob Vila, Norm and Steve, or even that husband and wife
team who are always digging footings and lifting toilets
(miraculously without argument). I love them all.
</P>
<P>
   Last night I was watching Bob Vila in Florida talking with two
guys on stilts who were installing a new ceiling in a remodel
somewhere in the old section of Miami _ probably new when I was
growing up there. These guys are really good, I'm thinking and
before I'm two potato chips into the action, one of them has marked
a piece of sheetrock, cut it, fastened it into place with a screw
gun, slathered goo on the seams and is taping them. What's really
surprising is they never screw up - as in, ``I cut it three times
and it's still too short.'' At the rate these fellows move, they
could re-hang the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel over their lunch
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Before I could see how they got down off of those stilts, Bob
had moved out into the carport (''porte-cochere'' we called it down
there and back then) with the general contractor and was discussing
what to do with a little outbuilding. They came up with the idea of
lattice work _ a very southern thing _ and turning it into an
old-style slathouse.
</P>
<P>
   Although I haven't seen one in a month of Sundays, slathouses
were a part of my growing up in south Florida. Plenty of my
friends' parents had them.
</P>
<P>
   A slathouse is less than a house and more than a shed. Its roof
and walls are just what the name implies - slats. They filter the
sun and let in rain and folks down south like to grow orchids in
them - so I'm told. All the ones I ever saw were growing junk and
broken lawnmowers.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Harris next door had one with lots of stuff in it, but never
any flowers. Mostly, it had spiders _ gigantic ones. Spiders so
big, I later imagined them picking up the breezy little building
and moving it around the yard at night.
</P>
<P>
   Slat houses were also home to scorpions _ and more, but I don't
want to talk about that.
</P>
<P>
   The months before I discovered that slat houses were inhabited
by more creepy crawlies than the Amazon rain forest, were happy
ones. Each evening after dinner, a group of neighborhood kids would
get together for a twilight game of hide 'n seek. I always won
because nobody ever came looking for me crouched in a dim corner of
Mr. Harris's slat house. I always had to give up and wander back on
my own. One night a bad-talking boy from down the street explained
why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell,'' he drawled, ``I ain't goin' in there to look for you,
not with all those rattlesnakes.'' The rest nodded in somber
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A week or two later, after I'd gotten over the heebie jeebies
and my hair had relaxed, I rejoined the game, but never again went
near the slathouse. My hiding places became safer after that, like
the back seat of the Harris's '46 Hudson or under an overturned
wheelbarrow. Once, in a frenzy of last minute desperation, I
slipped into the Harris's bathroom and hid behind the shower
curtain. I knew nobody would ever think to look for me in there. I
was right.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mr. Harris never thought of checking to be sure there
wasn't a 12-year-old in the tub before he settled in for his
evening paper read. I got grounded for that one. My mother declared
me out of the game and on the bench for a week.
</P>
<P>
   It's all gone now _ the slathouse that withstood the onslaught
of kids, floods, and hurricanes. New owners wiped out old memories
with a swimming pool. It's called ``progress'' but I don't think
too much of it. Kids can't play hide 'n seek in a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   But now, thanks to Bob and the boys, some new kids can play an
old game _ that is if somebody will ditch their remotes and pry
them out of their La-Z-Boys.

 &HT;    Deadbeat dad program improves child support but makes no impact
on their employment rates
 &HT;    By Wendy Hundley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Getting deadbeat dads to work and to support their children
requires intense effort and isn't always successful, according to a
national study to be released today.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton was one of seven cities involved in Parents' Fair Share -
the largest national demonstration program for unemployed,
noncustodial fathers of children on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The program - involving job training, assistance in seeking
employment and peer support - boosted child support payments by 4.5
to 7.5 percent but failed to improve fathers' rates of employment
or earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were disappointed with the findings on earnings and
employment,'' said Gordon Berlin, director of the Manpower
Demonstration Research Corporation study. ``It's a tough problem to
tackle. Some men have serious barriers to employment.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, courts have two options for deadbeat parents - send
them to jail or order them to find work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to ta3: the effectiveness of a third option
that would enhance their employment prospects, increase their child
support and help them become more involved, responsible parents,''
Berlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1994 and 1997, more than 5,000 fathers in Dayton, Grand
Rapids, Mich., Jacksonville, Fla., Los Angeles, Memphis,
Springfield, Mass. and Trenton, New Jersey participated in the
program.
</P>
<P>
   The increases in child support came largely from Dayton, Grand
Rapids and Los Angeles, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton also had highest number - 81 percent - of parents who
remained employed after the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Dayton they would follow up by knocking on doors,'' said
Fred Doolittle, lead author of the study. ``We think they put
together a strong partnership of agencies and services that helped
get men into jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Randolph, assistant director of the Montgomer9 Jounty
Department of Human Services, said the Dayton program increased
child support payments because it could ``smoke out'' fathers
trying to hide their employment.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the national demonstration project ended a year ago,
``we've duplicated it at The Job Center,'' Randolph said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than just order parents into jail or hand them ``seek
work'' orders, judges now send them to the center for help in
finding employment.

 &HT;    Buckeyes rest, retain number 1
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ It's good work if you can get it; to have the
week off and remain No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the Ohio State Buckeyes (3-0), who hold onto the top
spot in the college football polls this week despite their
inactivity. October 3, however, they'll have to work to hang on to
No. 1 when they face No. 7 and undefeated Penn State (3-0) at Ohio
Stadium in both teams' Big Ten opener.
</P>
<P>
   The match up brings back bad memories for OSU, whose defense got
steamrollered by the Nittany Lions running game last season in a
31-27 defeat at State College, Penn. The good news for the
Buckeyes: The PSU player who did the most damage, tailback Curtis
Enis (23 carries, 211 yards, 1 TD) is with the Chicago Bears. The
bad news: Fullback Aaron Harris, who had two touchdowns including
the go-ahead score, is back.
</P>
<P>
   Harris has rushed only three times for 13 yards this season as
he continues to recover from a knee injury. But Harris will be ripe
for action against Ohio State, Buckeye coach John Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he starts against us, I don't know,'' Cooper said.
``But I think you'll see a lot of him in the game. How effective
he's going to be, I can't answer that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, OSU let the Nittany Lions rush for 316 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We flat out didn't play,'' senior safety Damon Moore said.
``We didn't tackle worth anything. It kind of seemed like they
intimidated us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ahmed Plummer agreed. ``Basically, the defense lost
it for the team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Promising OSU freshman Jamar Martin will replace reserve
fullback Sean Penny and play behind starter Matt Keller. Penny is
out for the season with a neck iujury. Backup wide receiver Jerry
Redmond also is sidelined (leg fracture) but is expected to return
sometime this season.
</P>
<P>
   Since Penn State joined the Big Ten in 1993, the Buckeyes are
3-2 vs. the Nittany Lions and 2-0 in games played in Columbus. Each
team has been nationally ranked during each of their meetings and
the higher-ranked team always has won. The last time one of the
teams was No. 1 at the time of their meeting (Penn State in '94),
the Nittany Lions won 63-14.
</P>
<P>
   Former local standouts Joe Hartings of St. Henry and Lewe
Sessions of Troy return to their home state Saturday as Nittany
Lions. Cooper said he tried to recruit both.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough sell to Hartings, a reserve center whose brother,
Jeff, was a two-time All-America guard for PSU.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions, a backup defensive end, was sold on Penn State after
talking with defensive tackle David Fleischhauer, who was being
recruited the same year.

KOHL'S DEFEAT HEIGHTENS CLINTON'S INTERNATIONAL ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   A News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Helmut Kohl's ouster as German chancellor has left
Europe without a leader and, paradoxically, further strengthened
President Clinton's international role at a time when his domestic
position has been undermined by the White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Until his defeat in Sunday's German parliamentary elections,
Kohl was Europe's undisputed political powerhouse, the figure to
whom all, even the French, gave precedence. During his 16 years as
head of the Bonn government, he was widely credited with
spearheading most of the historic moves toward greater European
political and economic integration, among them the creation of the
single European currency, the euro, scheduled to be introduced next
year.
</P>
<P>
   As head of Europe's richest nation and the longest-serving
German leader this century, Kohl exercised influence well beyond
western Europe and on occasion seemed to contest the authority of
America's chief of state.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Russians, beginning with Mikhail Gorbachev and
then followed by Boris Yeltsin, often looked first to Bonn rather
Washington for major economic help and even for political support.
</P>
<P>
   More controversially, it was also Kohl who pressed the Western
Europeans in 1991 into backing the break-up of Yugoslavia into its
constituent republics, a step which the United States possessed
considerable misgivings about. It was the chancellor rather than
the Bush administration that won the argument.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's disappearance from active politics leaves a void that no
other European can fill.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac is too politically enfeebled at
home to render effective leadership outside his own country. Until
now, Chirac had meekly followed in Kohl's wake.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's young and dynamic Prime Minister Tony Blair might have
filled the gap except for the fact that the British are not fully
committed to European integration. Domestic hostility has, for
instance, compelled Blair to promise not to adopt the euro as a
replacement for the British pound for at least another four years.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kohl's victorious but untried rival, Social Democrat
Gerhard Schroeder, it is likely to be sometime before he attempts
to pick up the banner of international leadership. He recognizes _
as Kohl apparently now does also _ that his predecessor's defeat
was largely a result of him paying too much attention to global
issues and not enough to internal troubles, such as record postwar
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder also faces another problem. Kohl was in unquestioned
control of his own party, the Christian Democratic Union. But the
new chancellor's hold over the Social Democrats is much shakier.
Its real boss is party chairman Oscar Lafontaine, a leftwinger who
shows signs of expecting to share power with Schroeder. German
analysts predict Schroeder will have to spend a lot of his time
dealing with the Lafontaine problem.
</P>
<P>
   All of this leaves Clinton, already the paramount world figure,
likely to be more dominant still with no rival worthy of the name.

STEPHEN KING IS BACK FROM NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE IN THE BOOK WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Photo available through Wieck Photo Database)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The buzzards were circling, smelling the onset of a
slow death.
</P>
<P>
   The book sales of the world's best-selling novelist had
stagnated, he had been bloodied by critics for years and his
longtime publisher was balking at his request for an $18 million
advance for his next opus. And there were whispers in publishing
that his frightmeister skills were on the wane, so maybe it was
time to cue that funeral dirge.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen King felt wounded, all right, watching the rise of
competitors Tom Clancy and John Grisham, while also growing
incensed at what he saw as lazy efforts by his publisher on his
recent books. And then there was the approach of his 50th birthday,
which he viewed with decided uneasiness because, as he saw it,
``once you turn 50, baby, you're middle-aged and you better get
used to the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   But King also had just pounded out a new book, one that had
already earned strong accolades from his novelist wife of 27 years
(Tabitha King) who is never ``fulsome'' with praise, and he himself
had few doubts about what eight months of writing had produced in a
35th book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when I was working on it that it was better in a lot of
ways than a lot of my other stuff,'' King emphasized last Friday
afternoon in Seattle. ``You just get a white buffalo every now and
then that comes along and you say to yourself, `This is really
good!'
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have anything to do with stepping to the next level
or you're a better writer than you were. You just get a really good
idea, and it's like Mark McGwire stepping into a good pitch. It was
just into my wheelhouse and, to my credit, I think that I knocked
it out of the park. And I can say that because, a lot of times, I
know when I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Scribner, his new publisher, is also convinced that King is back
from the nearly pronounced dead, with a robust 1.46 million copies
in its first printing of his new novel, ``Bag of Bones'' (Scribner,
529 pages, $28). The book is backed by a highly focused $50,000
publicity campaign with stops in just five cities (New York, Los
Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Boston) and a few interviews of the
semi-reclusive author granted to selected media (The New Yorker,
USA Today, Newsweek).
</P>
<P>
   ``Bag of Bones'' may well repay the optimism of its author and
its publisher, who agreed to a highly unusual contract where King
received only a $2 million advance for the novel but will split the
profits 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bag of Bones'' is a Kingian tour de force, a Gothic romance
that slowly ensnares the reader in an intricately constructed web
of very human emotions (love, grief, desire, regret, frustration,
joy) amid a small-town setting.
</P>
<P>
   It tells the wrenching story of best-selling novelist Mike
Noonan, who has suffered a gut-churning case of writer's block
since the death of his wife from a brain aneurysm at age 34. Noonan
is paralyzed by his loss until he returns to their lakeside summer
home in Maine, where a chance encounter with a precocious
3-year-old and her beautiful 20-year-old mother, recently widowed
herself, ignites the first stirrings of his heart and at his
typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   But all is not well in this Maine small town, despite the
fairy-tale elements of the budding romance between the 40-year-old
popular novelist and the young Grace Kelly-look-alike in a
double-wide trailer. Mattie DeVore is fighting an evil stepfather
millionaire for the custody of her daughter, a bitter court battle
that Noonan soon helps finance. And the town's hushed-over sins of
the past have created a host of unquiet spirits, which Noonan must
also confront as ``Bag of Bones'' builds inexorably toward the sort
of bloody, violent cataclysm that King, for better or worse, cannot
resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where it goes _ there was never any question, I didn't
see that there was any choice,'' King said. ``I've got a real
problem with books that peter out into ambiguity; they're like
streams that turn into swamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to bring the reader along, at least do the
reader the courtesy of putting all your cards down face up on the
table at the end. If they want to laugh, or they think it's
ridiculous _ and sometimes the critics feel that way _ then let
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   This is King, as usual, unplugged. A quarter century of
phenomenal popular success at the writing trade seems to have left
him remarkably unaffected. He may have 300 million copies of his
books in print and an estimated annual salary of $40 million, but
the 51-year-old resident of Bangor, Maine, still is a blue-jeans
guy in a button-down world.
</P>
<P>
   King's opinions remain unfettered, his manner unpretentious. His
first glimpse of his huge two-bedroom suite in the Four Seasons
Olympic Hotel prompted him to stride from room-to-room with a
childlike delight reminiscent of Macaulay Culkin left ``Home
Alone'' in the Plaza Hotel. And when he ordered a room-service
lunch, which he ate at a vast table, King's main course was chicken
noodle soup.
</P>
<P>
   King can still readily recall the days when chicken noodle soup
seemed a luxury of sorts, that time when the aspiring writer had
taken a job as a high school English teacher at a salary of $6,400
that still seemed to promise much for King, his wife and their two
young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We somehow felt we had gotten a free pass into the middle
class when I got that teaching job,'' King recalled. ``So we took
on a new car and we got a gasoline credit card and, all at once, we
found out, whoa, we overspent our means. So Tabby had to get a job
at Dunkin' Donuts, but it was still the best times for me. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was: teaching school drains your brain. I was
having some success selling short stories, but if I hadn't and
things had gone on as they were, I think I would have given up. I
don't like to think that, but I might have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Carrie'' changed that, establishing a pattern that would soon
become familiar for King. There was the 1974 publication of his
first novel (after an advance of $2,500), and then there was the
1976 film version (a screamfest by Brian De Palma) that greatly
increased King's fame and audience.
</P>
<P>
   All the years of scaring people has brought King untold wealth,
with much of it donated in small towns around Maine to schools,
libraries, theaters, a $1 million Little League baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But all this money earned from blood and guts and ghosts also
caused King some pangs of conscience. ``There's a part of me that
is attracted to violent fiction, that really likes that violent
chaotic behavior,'' he admitted. ``There is an anti-social guy
inside me, but there's also a very moral guy.''
</P>
<P>
   This back-and-forth battle for the author's soul came to a head
over a novel called ``Rage,'' finished when King was barely out of
his teens, a novel filled with the fear and loathing rampant during
those raging hormone years. The plot of ``Rage'' once seemed a
far-fetched figment of King's vivid imagination, but it went on to
become all-too-familiar in the headlines: A high school student
shoots his teacher and holds his classmates hostage.
</P>
<P>
   And, to King's real horror, some of the real students involved
in real school murders turned out to have read ``Rage,'' may even
have been inspired by the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think the book had a certain involvement in things that
happened, although it was never my intent to cause any kid to go
out and shoot anybody,'' King stressed. ``But I also think _ and
I'm real firm about this _ it did not cause anybody to do that. In
other words, I don't think there are good kids who read `Rage' and
turn into bad kids, violent, homicidal kids who want to shoot
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do think that certain materials, books, films, can act
as accelerants, in the same way that an arsonist can use
accelerants to make a fire burn faster. And I don't want to be any
part of that. So I withdrew the book from publication. I can't
change what's already out there, but there will be no future
printings and it will disappear from the shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen King has learned that horror pays, but also extracts a
price.

FAITH FORD IS LIKEABLE IN OK NEW SITCOM, `MAGGIE WINTERS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Maggie Winters left Shelbyville, Ind., most likely to succeed
and eager to take a big bite from the Big Apple. She returns home
to Shelbyville, Ind., most likely to swallow some pride.
</P>
<P>
   Can Maggie go home again and handle the embarrassment of living
with her mother, of dealing with friends who haven't quite let go
of high school?
</P>
<P>
   Faith Ford gives it a go in a sometimes amusing, sometimes
trying comedy that nonetheless will play well with fans of the
former ``Murphy Brown'' co-star. Ford's likability carries the day
when the script falters. She finds a mother lode of help in Shirley
Knight, who plays Maggie's overbearing mom, Estelle, but only
spotty support from a cast of several friends who aren't entirely
convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie's return is prompted by her sudden divorce from a
philandering husband. Jobless and hapless, she arrives in
Shelbyville just in time for her 15th high school reunion _ and a
reintroduction to her old flame, Bobby Campanella (Vincent
Ventresca).
</P>

   Clea Lewis (``Ellen'') provides the most amusing moments as
Rachel Tomlinson, an insecure woman who blames Maggie for all her
own high school failures, and who now might become Maggie's new
boss. She also has eyes for Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the crisp writing and smooth ensemble work of better
comedies, ``Maggie Winters'' faces an uphill climb. It may
ultimately work better with less clutter.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``The Secret Lives of Men'' would work better
if maybe the cast members joined a large support group.
</P>
<P>
   While there may be a big audience for a show about three
divorced _ or soon-to-be-divorced _ guys complaining about how
their wives got the houses, the kids and the big alimony checks,
any show in which the laugh track stands out more prominently than
the jokes definitely needs help.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gallagher, Brad Whitford and Mitch Rouse play Michael,
Phil and Andy _ three thirtysomething men who spend an awful lot of
time together, usually golfing or eating.
</P>
<P>
   They are best friends, which is amazing, because they're quite
annoying. Well, Michael (Gallagher) isn't so bad. He's the
sensitive one, perhaps a little too sensitive because of his
family's alleged ties to the mob. Phil is a Type A whiner whose
motor never stops. Andy is a macho guy with a phobia about germs.
</P>
<P>
   To know more means you'll have to watch more. But why bother?
``NewsRadio'' is on at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In a word, ``To Have and To Hold'' is cute. Moira Kelly and
Jason Beghe make a cute couple. Their families are cute and quirky,
their house is cute and cozy, their dialogue is cute and cuddly.
</P>
<P>
   But mind candy can be dangerous. A cute case of sweetness, while
not always fatal, can cause severe decay. Adding fluoride to your
TV is advised.
</P>
<P>
   The series is one of several this season focusing on Irish
Americans, and it doesn't avoid the clich &UR; gfacute &LR; es. Beghe plays
Sean McGrail, a Boston police detective with three brothers, two of
them cops, one a fireman. The love of his life is public defender
Annie Cornell (Kelly), who rarely agrees with him on matters of
law, but who loves both his passion and his compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed among the arguing and the making up are words of
wisdom from Sean's parents, played by Fionnula Flanagan and John
Cullum, and Annie's mother (Mariette Hartley). After a while, the
blarney starts piling up.
</P>
<P>
   With a bit more edge and a lot less smarm, ``To Have and To
Hold'' might be the sort of lighthearted romantic drama that
captures the hearts of millions. Right now though, it's easy to let
go.
</P>

UNASSUMING ROLE BELIED KOHL'S STAYING POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Otto von Bismarck, the 19th-century chancellor who is
the only other German to serve as long as Helmut Kohl, once
observed there are two things people should not see being made:
sausage and legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has never been one for pithy quotes. As for sausages, he is
more likely to eat them than to use them as props for profound
statements. Though, truth be told, his real weakness is for pig's
stomach, his favorite dish.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Kohl's appetite for power that made him arguably the
greatest European leader of this century. He pursued power
relentlessly, and he surprised many not only by attaining
leadership of Europe's most populous and most economically
important country, but by holding onto it for 16 years before his
defeat Sunday. At 68, he was not only Europe's longest-serving
leader, but its oldest.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl is the antithesis of the modern political leader. Weighing
well over 300 pounds _ his aides brush off requests for an exact
figure _ he is overweight, if not obese. He is a dreadful public
speaker. And no one has ever accused him of being a big-picture
thinker.
</P>
<P>
   But it is precisely because he is so disarmingly unimpressive in
the areas that have come to be yardsticks for the modern politician
that so many people underestimated him. Kohl, who stammers and
whose girth makes it look as if he is always about to pop a button
on his jacket, seemed more like Sergeant Schultz, the bumbling
prison guard on Hogan's Heroes, than the most enduring democratic
leader in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Appearances aside, Kohl's impact on Germany, Europe, and the
world has been extraordinary because, unlike previous German
leaders who will be remembered for starting wars and the Holocaust,
Kohl put Europe's interests ahead of Germany's. He, more than any
other leader, brought about closer European integration and the
reunification of Germany. While history will remember him most for
presiding over reunification, it is that legacy which, combined
with his age, probably cost him his job.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl pumped more than $700 billion into the former East Germany,
but it pleased no one. West Germans think reunification has cost
them too much in taxes. East Germans complain it has cost them
jobs, housing and the security they had under a communist regime.
They also complain that the government has imposed its will on them
in a triumphalist way and allowed western speculators to buy up
property and price easterners out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kohl, unemployment has doubled. Reunification and the free
market that came with it has driven unemployment to a record 11
percent, nearly 20 percent in the former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he will probably be judged well by history. He forced
Germans to confront the ugliness of the Holocaust, and he staked
his political career on trying to unify his country.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's philosophy was shaped by his experiences during World War
II, which ended when he was 15. His older brother was killed
fighting for Germany. During the war, despite his membership in
Hitler Youth, Kohl attended seminars in his native Ludwigshafen,
where a priest taught him about democracy even as the Nazis were
making a mockery of it. Kohl emerged from these years convinced
that only a united Europe could avoid the cyclical nature of war.
He became the most dedicated and arguably the most successful
European integrationist.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a tax collector and a housewife, Kohl never forgot
where he came from. When he became leader of the Christian
Democrats in 1976, opponents derided him as a provincial hick. Kohl
endured the putdowns and quietly consolidated power. He also took
note of his enemies and dealt with them later. He knew that, unlike
his beloved pig's stomach, revenge was best served cold.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Germans, meanwhile, saw many of the attacks on Kohl as
attacks on them. He, after all, was the only prominent politician
who talked like them. Kohl was more likely to take advice from
ordinary people in the Rhineland where he always lived than the
smooth-talking, smart set he met in the Bundestag, Germany's
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   With Kohl, what you saw was what you got. Although calculating
and far from guileless, he was without airs. While many provincial
politicians cultivated accents they considered more appropriate for
the rarified air of the Bundestag, Kohl flouted his thick,
working-class Palatinate accent. While wealthy enough to go
anywhere in the world, Kohl takes his summer vacation every year at
the same modest Austrian resort.
</P>
<P>
   Many world leaders, including Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and
Bill Clinton, were won over by Kohl's earthy charm. Others,
including Margaret Thatcher, never warmed to it.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush appreciated Kohl's straightforwardness, and saw in
Kohl's old-fashioned, stay-at-home wife Hannelore something of a
mirror image of his own. While many cynics here snickered at the
Father Knows Best lifestyles of the Kohls and the Bushes, those
connections paid off. Bush helped Kohl pull off reunification,
trusting that a united Germany under a committed integrationist
like Kohl would never go the way of megalomaniacs like Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, trusted Kohl enough to
pull Russian troops from East Germany, paving the way for a
bloodless end to the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl was uncharacteristically emotional when the Berlin Wall
came down in 1989. He promised East Germans the bounty of the West,
and was moved when they cheered him unreservedly. But on Sunday,
eastern voters deserted him in droves. Even more humiliating for
Kohl was losing his home district in Ludwigshafen.
</P>
<P>
   Like an aging gunfighter or an over-the-hill athlete, it may be
that Kohl simply hung on too long. Even party loyalists privately
complain that his determintaion to run for an unprecedented fifth
four-year term was an egotistical exercise that was neither in the
best interest of the country or his party.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that most Germans would prefer that Kohl's deputy,
Wolfgang Schaeuble, ran for chancellor. Kohl calls Schaeuble his
crown prince, but he also made it abundantly clear that he, the
king, and no one else, would decide when it was time to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Like his heroes, Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle, Kohl
stayed too long and had to be pushed. But, like them, his place in
the history books is assured.

COLUMBUS TRIES A TEEN CURFEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Two hours into the school day, Chad was bored.
A fidgety, affable 13-year-old with a soft face and an attention
disorder, Chad decided to get some pizza or ``just walk around, for
the joy of it.''
</P>
<P>
   So off he went, slipping easily away from his seventh-grade math
class _ and right into the path of a police cruiser. ``If I ran, I
would've gotten away,'' Chad said sadly, his remorse reserved
solely for having been caught.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pizza, Chad got a ride to the Franklin County
Truancy/Curfew Intervention Center. First he was frisked. Then he
was screened for weapons by a metal detector. Then all his
possessions were taken from him. Then his record was checked for
outstanding warrants.
</P>
<P>
   And then, maybe worst of all, he had to endure the grim wait for
the spanking he suspected would arrive with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Chad violated this city's daytime curfew, an updated version of
the old truancy law, but with a lot more muscle. Anyone between the
ages of 6 and 18 who is found in a public place between 9 a.m. and
3:30 p.m. on a school day can be detained by police, then taken to
the curfew center. Exceptions are made for students with their
parents or guardians, and those with written permission from school
authorities. Repeat offenders and their parents can face charges of
delinquency or contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
</P>
<P>
   As schools across the country battle persistent truancy
problems, daytime curfews are growing in popularity. Already more
than 70 cities have adopted them in various forms, and each month
more are being proposed, according to the United States Conference
of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   Boston has yet to consider such a step, but it is hardly immune
to the pressures that have pushed other cities to do so. This
month, Boston officials launched a sweeping program to battle one
the nation's worst truancy problems: almost 30 percent of the
city's elementary students, and 45 percent of teenagers, missed
more than three weeks of the 1996-97 school year.
</P>
<P>
   One difference is that, while Boston has 12 truancy officers,
Columbus, in effect, has more than 1,500 _ every member of its
police force.
</P>
<P>
   But as more and more cities turn to daytime curfews, the
controversy over them grows as well. Civil libertarians say such
rules violate the rights of children and intrude on the freedoms of
young-looking adults who are subjected to unwarranted stops by
police. Some social scientists doubt the curfews can thwart truancy
or crime.
</P>
<P>
   Yet supporters of daytime curfews say the measures keep children
in school and out of trouble, and that far outweighs any potential
harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a solution by itself, but it's part of it,'' said
Columbus City Council member Les Wright, who in 1994 began the
process that led to the law's enactment a year later. ``We're
trying to catch problems early on, before behaviors get entrenched
and kids get lost. If children are not in school, that's where
problems start.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith Rice, the curfew center coordinator, said statistics
demonstrate its effectiveness. Last year, police brought 633
daytime curfew violators to the center, but fewer than 1 in 6 had a
second offense, and there were fewer than 40 instances of students
violating the curfew three or more times. There are 65,000 students
in the city's schools.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers do not, however, reflect the fact that many
students get a break from police. Earlier in the day, for instance,
Officer Don Hoar stopped two 16-year-old West High School students
en route to an unapproved lunch outing. ``You're juniors. You know
you need a pass, right?'' Hoar asked sternly. The teens nodded and
looked chastened, and Hoar sent them back to school.
</P>
<P>
   Still, supporters say the curfew teaches responsibility. ``Every
kid knows what's expected of them. They might tell you they don't
know the rules, but they know,'' said police Officer Terri Long, a
full-time presence at West High School. Long is known among fellow
officers for organizing what she calls ``Friday rodeos'' _ roundups
of truant teens with a police wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by such tactics and skeptical of claimed benefits, civil
libertarians and children's rights specialists say daytime curfews
rob juveniles of their constitutional freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stalin couldn't have thought of a better law,'' said Martin
Guggenheim, a law professor at New York University who has written
extensively on the rights of children. ``This is offensive to the
deepest values of American freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Guggenheim said the idea fails both in reducing truancy and
preventing crime. ``Adults should figure out how to make school an
inviting place that students want to be in, not a place they are
forced to be in at the risk of being arrested,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has never heard a juvenile curfew case,
Guggenheim said, having refused to hear the one challenge brought
to such rules. Lower court decisions have been mixed on similar
cases, most of them involving nighttime curfews.
</P>
<P>
   But a new challenge to daytime curfews might be brewing in Ohio.
The board that oversees the state office of the American Civil
Liberties Union has given staff lawyers a green light to seek a
curfew test case, said Christine Link, ACLU Ohio executive
director. Link has firsthand knowledge of the issue: Three years
ago, her then-12-year-old daughter was briefly detained by
Cleveland police while walking to synagogue on a Jewish holiday,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond constitutional issues is the question of whether the
curfews work.
</P>
<P>
   In Columbus, three years after the daytime curfew took effect,
overall attendance has changed little. Maurice Blake, director of
pupil services at the Columbus School Department, said attendance
was just under 87 percent last school year, a figure virtually
unchanged in the 1990s. Ohio intends to require 93 percent
attendance rates in all school districts by 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   No studies have proven the crime-prevention value of daytime
curfews, but they seem to make more sense than nighttime curfews,
said Jack Levin, professor of sociology and criminology at
Northeastern University. Nighttime curfews are ineffective because
most crimes committed by teenagers occur in the afternoon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any policy that strengthens the school bond for marginalized
and alienated youngers is a remarkably effective program,'' Levin
said. ``That includes any effort to keep youngsters from walking
the streets unsupervised when their peers are hard at work.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the idea behind Columbus's truancy-curfew center, a room
the size of a school cafeteria, with high ceilings and mauve walls,
located in the basement of a maximum-security juvenile detention
facility. With four full-time staff members, the center has a
$540,000 yearly budget and an admittedly difficult task.
</P>
<P>
   Once curfew violators are frisked and processed, they might get
a good talking-to from security specialist Alvin Hall, then a
meeting with social worker Lolita Love before their parents are
called to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Chad is a second-time violator, so his family will also be
scheduled for a mandatory counseling session. A third offense opens
the possibility of delinquency charges, but Chad is undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally I never get caught. I must be losing my touch,'' he
said, looking sideways at a visitor. He said he is proud that he
doesn't smoke or commit crimes. ``I just skip school,'' he said. To
keep him in school, Chad added, ``they'd have to pay me every hour
I'm there.''
</P>
<P>
   While Chad talked, a shirtless, tough-looking 17-year-old was
brought in. He is a study in angry nonchalance. Chad gave him
plenty of room.
</P>
<P>
   Love, the social worker, says her goal with Chad is to persuade
his mother to make sure he takes the medicine that helps to
diminish his attention disorder. But Chad makes no promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be in school tomorrow, and the next day, and the next
day, probably, but Friday is risky,'' he said. ``Friday is the best
day to skip.''

GOVERNOR CANDIDATES TAKE DISTINCT PATHS ON HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Health care reform, valiantly pushed locally and
nationwide by the likes of Michael Dukakis and Hillary Rodham
Clinton, used to be an issue for liberal Democrats whose proposals
died in the hands of Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But not so this year, particularly in the governor's race in
Massachusetts, where Republican Acting Governor Paul Cellucci and
his Democratic rival, Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, are in a
tug-of-war over the mantle of health care candidate. With 755,000
of the state's residents, or 12.6 percent, without health insurance
at last count, the public, in interviews and in polls, says
government ought to find a way to make health insurance affordable
to all.
</P>
<P>
   And the candidates are listening.
</P>
<P>
   Staking his claim on the issue, Cellucci has endorsed big
expansions in government insurance and proposed subsidies to
encourage small businesses to offer benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger, fighting for the middle ground, is pushing for even
larger expansions in government aid but steering clear of the
losing Democratic solutions of the past, such as mandates that
businesses offer insurance to all.
</P>
<P>
   Significant differences exist between the candidates' plans and
records. Some experts prefer Harshbarger's plan, but they and
others worry few people aside from policy wonks will be able to
distinguish between the candidates on this topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a risk to Democrats that (Cellucci's) stolen their
issue,'' said Catherine M. Dunham, director of The Access Project,
a nonprofit group that promotes health insurance access. ``It's
like Clinton stealing welfare reform from the Republicans. ...
(Cellucci's) been very progressive on health care, and he's got the
good political sense to take credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his predecessor, Governor William F. Weld, who vetoed the
Legislature's plan to use a cigarette tax to fund health insurance
for poor children, Cellucci has gone along with legislative
initiatives to expand coverage over the past year. He has supported
the Legislature in expanding the state's health care program,
called MassHealth, to serve another 150,000 people last year and
tens of thousands of children this year. The program is funded with
$336 million in federal Medicaid money, cigarette tax revenue, and
from the free-care pool that covers hospital care for the
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Further, using the traditional Republican strategy of offering
incentives, Cellucci got the Legislature last year to endorse
subsidies of up to $1,000 for small businesses that pay 50 percent
of the insurance premiums for lower-income employees. The law also
offers these employees help paying their share. The plan uses $41
million from the same sources of federal and state money to pay the
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye toward public concern about health maintenance
organizations denying needed medical care, Cellucci appointed an
ombudsman this year to help patients fight for their rights.
</P>
<P>
   Where Cellucci counts on his incentive plan for business to
widen the pool of people who have health insurance, Harshbarger
takes a more direct approach. He proposes to immediately cover
another 100,000 lower-income people who don't have insurance by
raising the income guidelines to qualify for government help. Where
adults can qualify for the insurance coverage only if their family
incomes fall within 133 percent of the federal poverty level,
Harshbarger would allow people to use the program if their annual
family incomes fall within 200 percent of the federal poverty
level, or $32,100 for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that he would not raise taxes to achieve his goal,
Harshbarger would pay for the program using $220 million from the
free-care pool, new Medicaid money, and small patient
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating that the state's lawsuit against tobacco companies
will be resolved soon, Harshbarger also calls for spending between
$150 million and $200 million of any future settlement to offer
state health insurance to another 100,000 people. If the money
becomes available, he said, he would raise the MassHealth income
guidelines still further to 300 percent of the federal poverty
level, or $48,000 for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cellucci, Harshbarger has a plan to regulate HMOs. He
proposes a so-called patient bill of rights that says HMOs can't
deny reasonable emergency care and makes doctors disclose to
patients all treatment options and financial arrangements they have
with HMOs. He would also appoint a board of specialists to oversee
health care decisions and a state office to make sure the HMOs
abide by the bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   Several health care policy specialists interviewed say that both
candidates' plans fall short of offering long-term solutions to the
crux of the problem: the exorbitant cost of health insurance. Only
some form of universal coverage will contain costs, these
specialists believe.
</P>
<P>
   But given the political realities, specifically the defeat of
the Clintons' plan four years ago, most of these specialists
praised the gubernatorial candidates, Harshbarger more so than
Cellucci, for trying to help people in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci won kudos for supporting the Legislature's expansion of
MassHealth but criticism for his business incentive plan.
</P>
<P>
   Because the cost of insurance is so high, businesses in other
states that have tried similar plans have not taken advantage of
subsidies in any big way, said Dunham of The Access Project. The
state plans to offer small companies subsidies of between $400 and
$1,000; family insurance coverage costs between $6,000 and $10,00 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other situations, it's not proven to be a powerful enough
incentive to get nervous business people to embrace an expensive
new benefit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The other problem, the specialists say, is that the subsidy plan
will be available to all small businesses that pay 50 percent of
the premiums for low-income employees. Since many of these
companies already provide insurance, they say, the state will be
wasting valuable resources on people already covered.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger faces some criticism that his plan could lead
lower-income people who already have private health insurance to
leave it and use the state's cheaper plan. He said he will counter
this so-called ``crowding'' effect by allowing only people who
haven't been insured for four months to sign on to his plan.
</P>
<P>
   If the goal is to insure the most people, Dunham and Robert
Restuccia, executive director of the advocacy group Health Care for
All, say they prefer Harshbarger's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's direct money, it's live money, it's not an indirect
subsidy like a tax credit,'' Restuccia said. ``A targeted,
incremental expansion strategy, which Harshbarger proposes, is the
best you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, neither plan addresses the high cost of health care,
said Alan Sager, a professor at the Boston University School of
Public Health. The cost in Massachusetts is expected this year to
reach $35 billion, 30 percent more than the national average. And
the United States already spends more than double any other
industrialized country on health care, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems clear that we are already spending enough,'' Sager
said. ``We in Massachusetts could cover everyone by using existing
spending without using new taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   If he were governor, Sager said, he would put all federal,
state, business, and employee contributions into one big trust
fund, print insurance cards for everyone in the state, and then let
them choose their own providers. Since all doctors would cost the
same, Sager said, patients could make their selections based upon
the best service, creating competition among providers to offer
better medical care in place of the financial incentives to offer
less.
</P>
<P>
   But even if spending more money made sense, Sager said, the
candidates' use of federal funds and cigarette tax revenues to
expand services are very short-term solutions. When the next
recession hits, Sager predicts, the federal government will reduce
its Medicaid funding and the state won't be able to continue its
program. And if cigarette taxes serve as disincentives to smokers,
this revenue can be expected to decrease in the face of soaring
health care costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He reserved his most stinging criticism for both candidates'
schemes to fund part of their health insurance expansions by
dipping into the state's free-care pool. The resources in the pool,
about $315 million a year, are already inadequate, in his view.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's stealing from the poor to give to the poor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Restuccia, of Health Care for All, said the candidates are
only trying to deal with political realities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sager is right, but that level of change will take a while,''
Restuccia said. ``Consumers who don't have insurance and their wife
and children are sick say, `Come on, get on with it. If you can
help me now, help me. If it's not making the problem worse, help me
faster.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although Dunham, of The Access Project, prefers Harshbarger's
plan because it would cover more people than Cellucci's, she said a
Republican may have a better chance of making the kind of sweeping
changes in the system in the long run that neither is proposing
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Nixon going to China,'' she said. In this case, ``it
has to be someone the public trusts not to blow the bank.''

A CAN-DO EPA HAS DEFIED THE SKEPTICS ON SMOG 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON -- To understand the latest political-policy trend
sweeping the industrial West, my favorite illustrative
over-simplification of the moment is the boring figure of $1,500
per ton of nitrogen oxide, the chief ingredient of a threat to
healthy lungs called smog.
</P>
<P>
   And for this, a deep bow of respect is in order to Carol
Browner, who runs the Environmental Protection Agency the right way
in a new era when solving problems is more important than fighting
ideological wars.
</P>
<P>
   This being an instinctively, rabidly partisan town, the locals
rebel loudly at the notion of synthesis, or Third Way, or Vital
Center, or New Democrat. They can handle occasional compromises
between the two parties, such as at budget time, but the notion of
a third dimension is more than this place is equipped to handle.
</P>
<P>
   But elsewhere, it's the wave: in the states where party label
can't sum up the policies of the vast majority of governors; and in
Europe where Third Wave surfers now run Britain, Germany, and,
technically, even France, where the actions of a nominally
Socialist government belie its name.
</P>
<P>
   Our friends on the left and the right remain in denial,
attributing the successive successes to political merchanidising
and not to substance.
</P>
<P>
   But an excellent retort is Browner's $1,500 per ton. This is the
estimate the geniuses in her agency have for the cost of cutting
the emissions that are smog by more than one-fourth. This takes
focusing on cleaning up the huge power plants concentrated in the
Midwest that send poison mostly south and east across state lines.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, less targeted and more invasively regulatory
methods could easily have doubled or even quadrupled the cost of
complying with the Clean Air Act. What's more, the $1,500 per ton
cost for the smog-belching entities called power companies, which
works out to roughly a buck a month on a typical electric bill, is
almost certain never to be actually experienced by consumers
because of yet another Third Wave trend gathering speed around the
country _ the deregulation of electricity rates and the spur to
competition that is providing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the EPA put out for comment its final plans to cut
nitrogen oxide emissions by 1.1 million tons a year in 22 Eastern
states plus here, or 28 percent. Some 138 million people live
there, and about one-fourth of them will over the next few years be
breathing air that for the first time meets the country's new,
tougher standards on smog. This is also the first time the EPA has
confronted the enormous public health challenge that smog causes in
states downwind from where it is produced.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, as Browner began to push for new rules, the power
industry and its allies in Congress, the smog-producing states, and
more than a few senior officials in the Clinton administration said
it couldn't be done, at least not cost effectively.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case through more than a generation of
environmental naysaying, they were wrong. Browner showed, moreover,
that a way of proceeding could be found that involved the states as
partners and that harnessed new technologies and emission-control
methods like the trading of credits among entities that are below
and above specific caps based on the new standards.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to emphasizing market strategies, Browner's plan is
also mandate-free for the governors, including those of the most
impacted states (West Virginia, Ohio, Missouri, Michigan, Kentucky,
Indiana, and Illinois). The attractiveness of large power plants as
a focal point is obvious, but not required. However, assuming this
is how states proceed, $1,500 per ton compares nicely with the
$3,400 per ton a focus on automobiles would cost; it also would
enable states to exempt nearly all emissions coming from smaller
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, the EPA still faces the need to help major cities
like New York, Baltimore, and Boston meet the standards, but the
experience to date is powerful evidence that an emphasis on
flexibility and emerging technology can do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Browner was warned that she'd be regulating backyard
barbecues and daily commuting patterns to meet these goals. Today,
except for pro forma complaints from Big Power, the naysayers are
quiet.
</P>
<P>
   This is Third Way-ism at its best. As Bill Clinton himself said
in an early campaign speech back in 1991, it's neither left nor
right, liberal nor conservative; it's both, it's neither, and it's
different.
</P>
<P>
   On a lot of issues, it's also smart, and it works.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Strobe lights shatter the darkness as DJ Bruno takes
the crowd at the Lansdowne Street Playhouse back in time. From the
stage, where he hovers over two turntables and a mixer, he spins
``Din Da Da,'' a hip-hop hit from 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd slowly ripples to the side, forming a circle. George
Lumpkins, 31, doesn't hesitate. He dives onto the wood floor and
spins like a windmill, the stripes on his Adidas pants a blazing
blur.
</P>
<P>
   In a gangsta rap world, Lumpkins is a throwback to the old days
when MCs rapped about partying and street kids took their anger out
on the dance floor. Now, in the dance caverns of Lansdowne Street,
a new generation is reclaiming early '80s rap and break dancing,
what they call ``old-school'' hip-hop. They reject gangsta rap, the
virulent strain of hip-hop that glorifies violence and misogyny.
They say they are sick of lyrics that talk of pulling out guns and
slapping women.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're talking about gang-banging, shooting people. We don't
want to hear that,'' said Paul ``Lefty Left'' Rosado, 29. ``That's
why I'm into old-school. The way we deal with our emotions is
hitting the floor or grabbing a mike.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just Boston kids who are turning to break dancing for
its cool mood as much as its cool moves. Break dancing ``reunions''
have been held in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. And break
dancing suddenly is visible everywhere from Coke commercials to new
music videos by Janet Jackson, Wyclef Jean, Madonna, Jay Z, Sonic
Empire, and The Propellerheads.
</P>
<P>
   But in Boston, where gangsta rap still commands wide attention
on the radio, hundreds of youths are voting with their feet for a
mellower hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night (Sept. 29), two local entrepreneurs _ Russell
Jackson, 28, who immigrated from England, and Chris Johnston, 33,
who immigrated from Belfast _ sponsored a break-dancing competition
at the Avalon. They expected 1,500 people to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Two big-name DJs, Cash Money from Philadelphia and Bad Boy Bill
from Chicago, spun records. The event, ``Unity and Respect, Part
2,'' is a sequel to their first competition, held in June.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a slim man with a shag of blond hair, said he and
Johnston had trouble persuading clubs to allow them to hold a
break-dancing competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is very anti-hip-hop because of its association with
gangsta rap,'' Jackson said. ``People don't understand old-school.
They just see MTV and think that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a majority of those buying gangsta rap music are white
suburban teens, not inner-city blacks and Latinos. But the racial
polarization presented in gangsta rap _ which draws on racial anger
for attitude _ isn't there in old-school hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't realize that hip-hop and gangsta rap are
two different things,'' said David Shallow, 30, a break dancer from
Everett. ``Hip-hop is about having fun. Nobody wants to hear about
how much money you have, how many guns you have, and how many
people you can kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop is the umbrella term for a style of music, fashion,
dance, and attitude born in the streets of the South Bronx and
South Central Los Angeles. It began in the early '70s when young
disc jockeys began experimenting with records played simultaneously
on two turntables. They would repeat beats and phrases several
times (``break beats''), and those dancing at parties invented new
dances to go with it.
</P>
<P>
   Locking, which makes dancers look like robots, and its more
fluid form of dancing, known as popping, grew out of southern
California. In the South Bronx and Harlem, young men began
``rocking'' or ``breaking'' _ spinning and contorting their bodies
on pieces of cardboard laid out on sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, DJs started buying microphones and handing
them to friends at parties, so they could rhyme over the break
beats. Such ``MCing'' and breaking spread through ghettos across
the country _ from Kalamazoo, Mich., to Bayamon, Puerto Rico. Then
Madison Avenue discovered it, gave it a new name _ break dancing _
and used it to sell everything from sneakers to soda pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``People got tired of it,'' said DJ Bruno. ``The media murdered
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though breaking died, rapping didn't. It could be mass-produced
and sold, unlike dancing.
</P>
<P>
   The late '80s saw rising poverty rates; alarming drop-out rates,
especially among Latino youth; and the drug trade swallowing
younger teens. When crack cocaine, a cheap and highly addictive
drug, exploded on the scene, even more young people got caught up
in the game. And with easier access to guns, city youths started
packing them for protection.
</P>
<P>
   MCs, who had begun rapping about ghetto strife, found they could
sell more records if they rapped about the gangster lifestyle,
glorifying it like ``The Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, some veteran rappers are going back to old-school. Keith
Murray, Redman, and Eric Sermon recently got together to put out an
album heavy with old-school flavor, including a remake of the
Sugarhill Gang's 1980 hit ``Rapper's Delite.'' Rappers who hadn't
been heard of in years are starting to make a comeback, too, like
Biz Markie, Slick Rick and Run-DMC.
</P>
<P>
   Several clubs here offer break-dancing nights, including the
Lansdowne Street Playhouse, which offers Electric Bugaloo night
every Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At the Playhouse on a recent Sunday, Kenny Chung, 19, stepped
out into the circle for the first time. He showed off a ``popping''
routine: He snapped each joint of his arm, jerking his head as if a
surge of power ripped through his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to release my negative energy,'' said Chung.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing younger people like Chung get into the old-school
lifestyle makes veteran breaker Alfredo ``Crazy Fred'' Rivera feel
like there's hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, 26, spends two afternoons each week teaching teenagers
how to break dance at the YMCA in Lynn, a nearby city. He said kids
are substituting dance ``battles'' for fistfights.
</P>
<P>
   To keep himself fluid, Rivera practices with The Floor Lords, a
nationally known group that has been featured in The Source, a
hip-hop magazine. Founded 18 years ago but disbanded in the late
1980s, The Floor Lords regrouped about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent practice, a large boom box blasted music from
the stage, while Lino ``Lean Ski'' Delgado, 31, the group's
president, took the troupe through the paces.
</P>
<P>
   They restarted the group mostly for fun, explained Delgado, but
with more and more Bostonians seeking the same kind of fun, The
Floor Lords suddenly are in great demand.
</P>
<P>
   A diverse team of mostly Latinos, several African-Americans, and
a few whites and Asians, they perform two or three gigs a week at
clubs, competitions, and fund-raisers, drawing fans with their
innocent exuberance and inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Crowed Delgado, ``We even did a bar mitzvah.''

A FINE DISTINCTION CAN GO TOO FAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joanne Fray, who clearly knows her Strunk and White, e-mailed a
question about my choice of words in a recent column about S&AMP;W's
classic handbook, ``The Elements of Style.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's roots, I had written, ``go much further back than the
'70s,'' and Fray wondered why I used further instead of farther.
She cited the entry from S&AMP;W: ``The two words are commonly
interchanged, but there is a distinction worth observing: farther
serves best as a distance word, further as a time or quantity word.
You chase a ball farther than the other fellow; you pursue a
subject further.'' Fray, apparently reading those decades as
distance, believes farther would have been the ``Strunk-and-Whitian
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't reviewed S&AMP;W's advice on the matter, but in fact I had
originally written farther; it was my editor who suggested further
was better, since we weren't measuring literal distance. I
countered that time was, after all, just another dimension, but I
was at a disadvantage _ that is, at a pay phone outside a Burger
King along the interstate near Erie, Pa. _ and it didn't seem worth
a debate. And though my ear wants to side with Fray, Strunk and
White seem to support my editor: Isn't further back than the '70s a
measure of time?
</P>
<P>
   In truth, though, this is a case where it's hard to be
absolutely wrong. Farther and further have been interchangeable in
many contexts for a long, long time, and there's never been any
solid etymological foundation for fine-tuning the usage. H.W.
Fowler, though he loved to split such hairs, did not even urge
preserving this distinction: He predicted in 1926 that further
would eventually crowd out farther.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Bernstein, in 1965, noted a ``general preference'' for
using ``farther for physical distance, further for everything
else.'' But he saw the same future as Fowler: ``Fifty years hence
writers probably will not have to worry about this distinction,
because it looks as if farther is going to be mowed down by Old
Further Time.'' Well, 33 years have passed since that guess, and
farther is still hanging on; perhaps because we have a far but no
fur in the lexicon, we aren't ready to abandon farther entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Most people tend to choose further when there's no question of
distance _ ``we need no further proof'' _ and few would try to say
farthermore. But in most cases between those extremes, the choice
is yours (and your editor's) to make; we've gone about as fur as we
can go.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Leaps and boundaries
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many citizens say they're overdosing on coverage of the White
House mess, but a Los Angeles Times reader has a more specific
gripe. ``Until (special prosecutor Kenneth) Starr submitted his
findings to the Judiciary Committee, I don't believe I'd ever heard
anyone actually use the word salacious,'' he wrote to the newspaper
last week. ``Now it seems the story can't be covered without the
word.'' Salacious, it's true, seems to have taken hold as the term
of choice for the sexual revelations in the Starr report; a
Lexis/Nexis search, admittedly not subtly calibrated, found it
running far ahead of prurient, the closest synonym in play.
</P>
<P>
   Salacious is derived from the Latin salax _ ``lecherous'' _
which is the root of salire, ``to leap.'' Saltimbocca, the Italian
dish that ``jumps in the mouth,'' is related, as is somersault. But
salire also had a sexual sense _ the Roman equivalent, more or
less, of today's ``I wanna jump your bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Prurient, from the word for ``itch,'' has essentially the same
range of meaning: Like salacious, it can describe people, behavior,
or depictions of people's behavior _ the prurient matter and
salacious details that account for most uses of the words.
</P>
<P>
   So why, with two equally good words to use, have we gravitated
toward salacious to characterize the Clinton-Lewinsky story?
</P>
<P>
   Could be that it's just a sexier-sounding word: It rolls off the
tongue with lip-smacking relish, its echo of delicious suggesting
the pleasure, guilty or otherwise, that the ``salacious material''
both exposes and inspires. Prurient, with its prim little pursing
of the lips, suggests something grimier _ guys in raincoats in
seedy theaters, say _ and less entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Salacious, which both concedes the audience's interest and
deplores the information, probably best sums up the attitude of
most people to the feast of unwelcome yet irresistible revelations
being served up to the nation.

SPIES HANG OUT ON BOTTOM OF THE DIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAC DANIEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the items confiscated during the FBI's recent
investigation of a major Cuba-sponsored spy ring, some of the most
effective and dangerous may have been a few simple shortwave
radios.
</P>
<P>
   Clandestine shortwave broadcasts _ also known as ``spy
stations'' or ``numbers stations'' _ have been hitting the airwaves
for years. Anyone with a shortwave radio can tune them in, but just
a few know what they're saying.
</P>
<P>
   They are faint broadcasts that use strange frequencies, with no
known schedule. During a broadcast, a listener is likely to hear
someone reading a series of numbers, along with anything from
yodeling or a repeated flute melody to electronic tones or sudden
bursts of information-filled noise.
</P>
<P>
   Those who monitor such broadcasts say they believe the
information transmitted could be a rendezvous point, a telephone
number, or any other instruction for spies &UR;  &LR; in the field.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of such numbers stations out there. Monitors
say this open, yet secret, method of communication is a virtually
foolproof means of sending messages or commands to operatives in
the field. Its beauty lies in its simplicity, combining a basic
form of impossible-to-break cryptography with the worldwide,
inconspicuous reach of the shortwave radio.
</P>
<P>
   Those who regularly follow these obscure broadcasts say the CIA,
Israel's Mossad, and British intelligence operate numbers stations,
though none of these organizations, nor America's National Security
Agency, has ever acknowledged their use. In the case of the Cuban
espionage suspects, Justice Department officials in Miami are
unwilling to say what the shortwaves were used for, or why they
were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   Because no one has ever confirmed that such stations even exist,
most of the information about them comes from shortwave hobbyists
known as ``numbers geeks'' or ``spooks'' who share their logs on
the Internet, speculate about a station's origin, and listen for
hours to something that makes absolutely no sense on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in brief form, is how these numbers stations
work, &UR;  &LR; according to monitors and histories of the broadcasts in
books and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers or letters read over the air are believed to be
code. Once received, they are decoded using a ``one-time pad,'' a
set of numbers or letters that is good only for that single
broadcast. If letters are used, experts say those letters usually
correspond with numbers or other letters.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes if numbers are used, the listener writes down the
numbers from the broadcast and subtracts those numbers from those
on the one-time pad. The results are usually numbers between 1 and
26 _ the number of letters in the alphabet, with 1 representing A,
2 representing B, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   The system is said to be absolutely unbreakable, with every
message decipherable only by the pad of the agent. After the code
is received, the one-time pad is destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   How does a spy know which frequency to listen to? This, monitors
say, remains a mystery. The next broadcast time and frequencies may
be part of a message. But until someone speaks publicly on these
broadcasts, no one knows.
</P>
<P>
   The history of numbers stations can be traced back more than 30
years. Interest in this phenomenon is lean but rising after the
recent release of a four-CD set called The Conet Project, the first
comprehensive collection of shortwave numbers stations recordings.
</P>
<P>
   It is the pet project of Akin Fernandez, a London-based owner of
the small record label Irdial Discs. He got interested in the weird
topic while pursuing another _ pulling coded weather satellite
information out of the air with his shortwave.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as I kept looking for these weather stations, I kept
coming across these stations of mostly women reading off sets of
numbers or sets of letters,'' said Fernandez. ``And normally a
radio station that's on shortwave announces what the schedule is,
and when it will be back on. These number stations, they never gave
any information about that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   After searching the world for people who record such stations, a
total of eight people responded to Fernandez's request. The results
are four compact discs of some of the strangest stuff ever heard.
</P>
<P>
   To give some substance to these mysteries, hobbyists have named
certain recurring broadcasts. There's the Lincolnshire Poacher, the
Cherry Picker, the Sexy Lady, and the Russian Man.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincolnshire Poacher is believed to originate in Britain and
broadcasts frequently throughout the world. Hobbyists familiar with
this broadcast have noted that the station is regularly jammed. The
name comes from the few notes played before the broadcast begins,
part of the song ``The Lincolnshire Poacher.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sexy Lady is a mechanized female voice that has the intended
or unintended quality of sounding seductive while reading her code.
</P>
<P>
   The Cherry Picker, believed to be the Asian cousin of the
Lincolnshire Poacher, got its name from the old English folk song
``Cherry Ripe'' played during broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggest the stations use music to set themselves apart.
Others suggest the music and voices are just a ruse, a means of
disguising the broadcasts' clandestine nature. No one, however,
really knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows about James Bond, everybody knows about
espionage in general,'' said Fernandez, ``but when it comes to the
tradecraft, nobody knows anything at all. And how can something be
kept a secret like this but be completely in the open? It's crazy.
It's just completely crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Van Horn, assistant editor for Monitoring Times, a
magazine specializing in shortwave and other forms of radio
listening, has written extensively on numbers stations. He said he
has heard it all when it comes to these clandestine broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Some theories say they are international bank accounting
numbers, stock market statistics, or even high-powered radio
beacons intended to guide passing UFOs to planet Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal favorite was first sent to me when I first came to
the company in 1992,'' wrote Van Horn. ``It was a guy in
Indianapolis, and he noticed that every &UR;  &LR; time a UPS airplane took
off, the signal strength of the numbers station he was monitoring
would increase. Therefore, he said, UPS was responsible for these
worldwide numbers station networks, which were used to pass
information on cargo arrival and departure.''
</P>
<P>
   For those sponsoring the broadcasts, silence is golden. Whenever
Van Horn tried to get confirmation of these broadcasts, officials
from the FCC or the CIA said they did not know what he's talking
about. Even after Monitoring Times published an article that traced
a certain numbers station broadcast to an Army facility in
Warrenton, Va., the authorities remained silent. No confirmation
was ever made. ``Nor a retraction,'' added Van Horn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better if they just remain quiet and keep on going,''
said Van Horn. ``There's no reason for them to say anything.''

CROW SPINS SOULFUL GOLD ON OPENHEARTED `GLOBE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Except for Alanis Morissette, no rock female in the last five
years can match the sales figures of Sheryl Crow, who sold 9
million copies of her first album (1993's ``Tuesday Night Music
Club'') and 6 million of 1996's ``Sheryl Crow.'' Crow has also won
multiple Grammy awards and toured with the Rolling Stones _ not a
shabby start for a former elementary school teacher from the tiny
heartland town of Kennett, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Crow, 36, has made some enemies because of the
perceived flippancy of early hits ``All I Wanna Do'' (with its tag
line ``is have some fun'') and ``Leaving Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   But love her or leave her, listeners have a new Crow to deal
with on ``The Globe Sessions,'' her third album, which is out
Tuesday. It shows a more confessional singer who this time is
boldly, and vulnerably, addressing her love life, which has
apparently been a lot less successful than her chart numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The album's honesty brings her closer to the open-hearted
approach of Bonnie Raitt, while offering musical substance (from
Middle Eastern drones to bluesy psychedelic touches) that should
win greater acceptance from critics who cast her as the get-lucky
woman who rode the right radio wave. Crow always had talent _ her
voice is more soulful than she's received credit for _ and the new
material is the best vehicle for it so far.
</P>
<P>
   The opening song, ``My Favorite Mistake,'' is a hit _ and sets
the lyrical tone. ``I woke up and called this morning/The tone of
your voice was a warning that you don't care for me anymore,'' Crow
sings above her own Hammond B3 organ and the tremolo guitar of Jeff
Trott. The song has a hooky chorus _ as hooky as the hit ``Every
Day Is a Winding Road'' from her last CD _ but its heightened
emotionalism is what makes it stand out. That, and the fact that
many listeners will wonder if it's about Eric Clapton, with whom
she was romantically linked.
</P>
<P>
   Crow has so far refused to name names regarding any of the new
songs; this is not a tabloid album. It's by far the most artful
record she's made, touching sensitivities that are universal. In
``It Don't Hurt,'' an organ-driven song that sounds like something
by the Band, Crow tries to squelch the memories of one relationship
by changing the wallpaper in her house, putting down new carpet,
adding a new wing, and finally bulldozing the house. Who can't
relate to her last line: ``It don't hurt like it did/It hurts
worse/Who do I kid?'' And the ending guitar solo by Todd Wolfe
borrows, aptly, from Lindsey Bucking-ham's ``Go Your Own Way.''
</P>
<P>
   While some lyrics have a downbeat edge (``You don't bring me
anything but down,'' she wails in one tune), the music has a
strength born of catharsis. Clearly, Crow needed to get these songs
out of her system. And a number of them still rock, such as
``Anything But Down,'' ``Maybe That's Something,'' and the Stonesy
``There Goes the Neighborhood,'' aided by saxophonist Bobby Keys
from the Stones' touring band.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't have a lyric sheet handy, you wouldn't know the
depth and anguish of some of these tracks, because the music is so
consistently beguiling. Crow plays a wealth of instruments, from
electric and acoustic guitars to clavinet, Wurlitzer, and
percussion. And though she sings that she's a ``loser in love,''
she stands up for herself elsewhere and does a romping version of
the CD's only non-original song, Bob Dylan's ``Mississippi,'' which
he never recorded and gave her specifically for this project. Its
bittersweet line ``Last night I knew you, tonight I don't,'' could
apply to Crow's tattered love history, too, yet it's a history that
Crow transcends with her finest album yet.

MEETING WATERLOO _ AND LOVING IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERLOO, Belgium _ Napoleon slipped here.
</P>
<P>
   But the former emperor, Monsieur Bonaparte, who schlepped here
with 125,000 comrades in arms, slept not at all during his final
nightmare of about nine hours. Napoleonic dreams of reestablishing
his and France's domination of Europe came crashing down around his
muddy boots, detonating in tune with British artillery. On June 18,
1815, this Belgian village became the all-time symbol and buzzword
for a disastrous fall by the mighty.
</P>
<P>
   Waterloo.
</P>
<P>
   That one word has said it all for ambition and its demolition
over the last 183 years. There are still Frenchmen like my Parisian
pal, Dominique Borde, who wince if you utter it in their presence.
Dom happens to understand Boston baseball, and if you want to talk
Waterloo, he will threaten to bring up Bucky Dent. Some wounds
don't heal.
</P>
<P>
   But Waterloo? How long has it been in my consciousness _ or
anybody else's? _ even before understanding what or where? As a boy
I often heard of somebody meeting -his/her/their Waterloo,
considerably before being aware of Napoleon and the battle that was
his, well, undeniable Waterloo. Fourth-grade history as taught by
Miss Leo Long brought me up to date.
</P>
<P>
   And my Belgian friend, Franz Verstockt, has brought me _ under
protest _ to the dateline, the place: this verdant, lumpy farmland
where Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington (a.k.a. the Iron
Duke, and likely thought of as the lucky Limey by contemptuous
Napoleon), made his victorious stand.
</P>
<P>
   Under kindly protest, I should say, because Franz, residing a
few miles away, feels (probably correctly) that his small country
offers a large assortment of architectural and artistic treasures
more deserving of the browser's time and attention than a few green
acres 12 miles from Brussels. He had never considered it worth
inspecting himself.
</P>
<P>
   But it's easy enough to find, outside the small town for which
the battle was named, and where today, along with the aged stone
inn that headquartered Wellington, you may partake of the cuisine
of a McDonald's, as well as Vietnamese and Mexican restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon, of course, said that an army travels on its stomach,
but Franz does not feel it advisable that his platoon of three
should beef up its journey here _ apprehensive perhaps of a
digestive Waterloo this far from his good wife's table. Still,
realizing my determination to meet The Waterloo, satisfying
curiosity about a plot that can't be forgot, he was pleased to act
as chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   For such a mammoth, historically resounding result, the scene is
almost a miniature: a battlefield not much more than a
mile-and-a-half square. But what took place there _ the carnage in
so brief a time, the intimate clash of 140,000 men, the ruin of one
of them, the feared and famous man who had pushed Europe around for
years _ is hard to grasp as you peer from an earthen height (since
raised as a lookout) across land yet farmed. This perch, 227 steps
up, called Lion Hill, is topped by a huge bronze British lion.
</P>
<P>
   Fields in geometric patterns liebefore you in a shallow, uneven
valley, splashed by copses and hedges amid the agricultural
spreads, and decorated by the stone and tile buildings of the
Hougoumont and La Haie Sainte farms, focal points of the fighting.
Sheep graze placidly where men slashed wildly, ferociously at one
another like cornered wolves and lions.
</P>
<P>
   Though pastoral now, the site _ well-preserved as it was _
degenerated on that distant day into a gruesome muddle in the rye,
a murderous, deafening mess that has been excellently bottled in
three audio-visual productions at the visitors' center. A diorama
depicting the movements of cavalry, infantry, and artillery
surrounds you _ a smorgasbord of gunsmoke, cannon and rifle fire,
clanging sabers, urgent bugles, whinnies, shouts of combatants,
cries of wounded and dying. Red-headed Marshal Ney leads a French
cavalry charge. Wellington supervises as best he can on horseback.
Napoleon in the rear, amid weeping willows, wonders what the hell's
going on. Soon enough he will weep himself in retreat, his comeback
from Elba scrambled, permanent exile looming.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else wondered, too. This is clear in the jumble of
morning-afternoon-evening chaos available in a slide show. Also a
movie of the reenactment by uniformed amateur actors, an annual
event such as occurs at Lexington and Concord. It was mostly
desperate and lethal blind-man's buff on dipping, unfamiliar
terrain, up-close and impersonal hand-to-hand slaughter of more
than 40,000 men and 10,000 horses.
</P>
<P>
   Whether there were any Private Ryans among Wellington's Brits is
not revealed, but Waterloo's longest day was bloodier, if not as
explosive, than that of the Normandy invaders 129 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was a complete heap of confusion,'' summed up
British Captain G.A. Barlow in a letter to his father after the
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Historian David Howarth writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``To make sense of formal maneuvers they used, one always has to
remember that none of their weapons could be accurately aimed ...
musket shot needed more luck than skill. Because the weapons were
so inaccurate, infantry officers, mounted and conspicuously
dressed, could lead their men to within a few yards of the enemy.
And Wellington himself could ride along the skyline all day in full
view of the French, always in danger from masses of aimless shot
flying everywhere but not in special danger from being deliberately
shot at. Attacking infantry held their fire until the last 50 paces
from the enemy. After firing (the one shot before having to reload
_ two shots a minute was considered rapid-fire) they charged with
bayonets.''
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon, the favorite, outnumbered the allies (British, Dutch,
Belgians, Prussians) with superior troops, but his hectic game plan
wasn't good enough to bust through Wellington and Prussian
counterpart, Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blucher, and swarm
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Howarth says, ``The French command was fooled by the gentle
folds in the ground that Wellington chose to defend ... they
believed, before each of their attacks, that Wellington's line had
broken and fled; and each time they only discovered it had not when
they were already in musket and grapeshot range and it was too late
to change their formations.''
</P>

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The NFL has caught up to Chad Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   The film, the scouting reports, all the intelligence data now
focus on the big man in the middle of the Patriots' defensive line.
That is the price of going from nomad to No. 1 in less than a
season.
</P>
<P>
   The success Eaton enjoyed starting at the end of last season
doesn't come quite as easily anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stink,'' he said Monday. ``I really do. I get on myself
because there's so much I want to do. I don't know what my deal is.
I got yelled at today (by the Patriots' defensive coaches). They're
telling me things I need to do better: `We want you to rush the
passer more'; `We want you to get upfield more'; `You did it in
preseason, so why can't you do it now?'''
</P>
<P>
   It's a question he asks himself a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton, one of the most ferocious Patriots linemen, is
discovering the price of proficiency. Drew Bledsoe's former
Washington State teammate has come far as a pro. He's gone from
undrafted free agent to practice squadder to backup to starter. He
beat out veteran Mark Wheeler for the starting nose tackle job
during this past preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``In preseason, nobody knew who I was,'' said Eaton. ``Now I
have two guys on me, so now they're telling me I need to be more
aggressive. When you come into the league, nobody knows who you
are. You're just some guy, and until you make plays, you're
nothing. When you start making some plays, teams say, `You've got
to double him and then deal with the linebacker.' That's what I'm
dealing with right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The old double team.
</P>
<P>
   It eats up many a star player. Ben Coates has been double-teamed
for years. Ted Johnson often gets that type of attention. Chris
Slade and Willie McGinest have experienced it. Veteran Henry Thomas
had to live with it during his heyday with the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of growing up as an NFL player. Those who can deal
with it and still perform are the ones who survive. They're the
ones who become All-Pros. The ones who can't return to backup
roles.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton is now at that crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're doing today (in practice),'' he said. ``It's
technique day for me, where they'll try to get me back to what I
was doing before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest challenge I've had. They expect more from
you now. (As) a backup, the guy in front of me would mess up and I
would see what the correction was _ what the coaches wanted me to
do _ and then I'd go in there and do it. Now you have to go in
there and do what the coaches want. You have to understand what
they're asking you to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The game is all about adjustments. Eaton says he can ask other
players about how they deal with it, but in the end, he must find
his own way of overcoming it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets kind of frustrating,'' said Eaton, who was asked if
he's gotten pointers from Thomas. ``As much as you want to get help
from somebody like Henry, he plays different than I do. He has
different techniques that work for him that wouldn't work for me,
so it wouldn't work for me to listen to him. He's quicker. I'm a
strong guy, so being a strong guy, how do I overcome being
tentative?''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the issues line coach Ray Hamilton and defensive
coordinator Steve Sidwell are trying to work out with Eaton because
the challenge doesn't get any easier this week. The Patriots are
playing the New Orleans Saints, and according to Eaton, ``There are
only four offensive lines that are back intact in the NFL, and
they're one of them, so it's a big challenge. They're doing a good
job over there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saints are indeed moving the pile for their running game,
and they're also protecting quarterback Danny Wuerffel quite
nicely. It's up to Eaton as the man in the middle to disrupt all
that.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that teams are not allowing great
penetration by the Patriots' defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all keeping maximum protection and keeping the running
back and tight end in and getting rid of the ball quickly,''
explained Eaton. ``It's frustrating because we hear that we don't
have the sacks we had last year. You have to take the good with the
bad. You have to go with it because teams are starting to get
frustrated with that because they want to throw the ball deep and
we're not allowing them to do that. Eventually, though, they'll
have to. But we're not going to change what we do best.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton, considered one of the best run stoppers on the team, is
also unhappy about the 100-yard rushing totals against the team the
past two games, but he knows why they were achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, we didn't have anyone rush over 100 yards
against us,'' he said, ``but now we've had two games in a row _
(Marshall) Faulk and (Eddie) George. They're getting their yards in
the fourth quarter when they're down. We had our nickel and dime in
against Indianapolis late in the game, so if they want to do draws
down by 29 points, we don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   What he does care about is making the adjustments necessary to
regain his effectiveness.

CHANGES AHEAD FOR ZENGA, REVOLUTION? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Revolution regained some credibility and concluded their
third season with momentum. They surpassed 1 million spectators,
including exhibitions, in three-year total attendance. And they
have discovered a coach/icon in Walter Zenga.
</P>
<P>
   There are positive signs for the Revolution and Major League
Soccer, which will receive an additional $100 million in
investments from owners.
</P>
<P>
   But not everything is perfect in Revolution Land. The team's
late-season success could have been illusory, a combination of
Zenga's influence and the fact that the pressure to qualify for the
playoffs had been relieved. In fact, the Revolution lost their
final two games.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it fair to judge Zenga on six games.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga is the charismatic figure the Revolution have needed. He
is also a pragmatist. Regular crowds of nearly 20,000 are not to be
placed at risk. Zenga will do whatever is necessary to produce
results.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an exceptional network of contacts, Zenga should be
able to find the players he wants, though he could be hampered by
the league's salary cap restrictions. His agent, Giovanni
Branchini, has provided players for MLS, but only as a long-range
investment since he is involved in much more immediate, high-stakes
representation in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Zenga might only have to do some more fine-tuning _ if four
shutouts in the final six games are an indication of the true
ability of this team.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation is not as copacetic as it appears. Zenga, or
whoever becomes coach, will have to confront some tricky problems.
The most basic determination will be the makeup of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga appears satisfied with keeping the status quo, ostensibly
a core of hardworking, low-profile types, along with a couple of
skillful performers like Edwin Gorter and Joe-Max Moore, and adding
some high-profile veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Besides that six-game run, plus a good stretch when Zenga was
playing in 1997, the players who form the foundation of the
Revolution have mostly failed as a group. They could probably
succeed if they are properly motivated, organized, and combined
with the right players. But they have also resisted perceived
``outsiders'' in the past. Only if Zenga brings in highly credible
foreigners will they be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquinho Conde, Alejandro Farias, David Nakhid, Alberto Naveda
_ all experienced, solid professionals _ struggled to find
acceptance with the Revolution. Their successors likewise will
struggle unless the core group's attitude changes.
</P>
<P>
   This season there were disputes, jealousies, petty and not so
petty grievances within the Revolution which were never effectively
resolved. Zenga arrived to replace Thomas Rongen and attempted to
wipe the slate clean, which is what most coaches would have done.
But the problems he inherited will not disappear, even if the
perceived troublemakers are eliminated or gagged. That solution has
been tried in the past, starting with Giuseppe Galderisi in the
first month of the first season, but many of the same difficulties
continue to arise.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Zenga would have a team with an all-for-one,
one-for-all attitude, with similar mentalities. This is possible in
Italy, where small teams often survive against all odds and
accomplish amazing feats. But in Italy, this occurs mainly because
of the concept of promotion/relegation. If the Revolution had been
playing in that system, they would have been relegated to the third
division by now.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga must also modify his attitude. In Italy, a coach can be
autocratic and even reclusive when dealing with the media. Zenga is
combative and cannot resist a confrontation. If he senses a
challenge, he fights back, a streetwise instinct that served him
well as a player and could as a coach, if he does so selectively.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga can charm audiences, and if he learns to charm the media
Bora Milutinovic-style, he will only increase his value.
</P>
<P>
   After the MetroStars and Revolution played to a 0-0 tie (the
MetroStars won the post-match shootout) Saturday, Milutinovic
entertained journalists and eventually had nearly everyone in the
press tent either laughing or speechless. Zenga arrived and
immediately became contentious, displaying a defensiveness which
left little room for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   But such seductive traits must be natural and sincere, as they
appear to be for Milutinovic.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga the player was contentious in dealing with the media, but
he usually had a high-profile coach with an equally strong
personality to provide balance and sagacity in times of crisis.
Someone will have to perform a similar function for Zenga the
coach.

SINCERITY TRANSCENDS FORMULA IN `FELICITY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
FELICITY 
Starring: Keri Russell, Scott Foley, Scott Speedman, Tangi Miller,
Amy Jo Johnson 
On: WB 
Time: Tuesday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people are pretty darned sensitive about the genre known as
``sensitive drama.'' They can still work up a good lather against
``thirtysomething,'' the grandaddy of TV's ``Big Chill''
self-absorption from the late 1980s, and they have been known to
whine on and on about its progeny, from ``My So-Called Life'' to
``Dawson's Creek.'' There's just something about all that halting
dialogue, weighted with confession and incomplete sentences that
trail off into significant ellipses ... And pretty people aren't
supposed to have inner conflict, are they?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I can't get enough of the stuff, as it blends
emotional insight and Woody Allen-esque neurosis with the
conventions of soap opera (Rule (NU)1: They must have a love
triangle. Rule (NU)2: They must have good hair). Tuesdays at 9, a
promising coming-of-age series named ``Felicity'' joins the family
tree of sensitive drama, after months of lavish advance praise from
critics across the country. Rightfully being referred to as ``My
So-Called Life'' Goes to College, it is a smartly written show that
truly does stand out in a season that's woefully weak in the
non-comedy department. Along with its refreshing cast, led by Keri
Russell, ``Felicity'' is blessed with a sweet realism that captures
the emotional roller coaster that is freshman year in college. It
also offers an appealingly non-gritty look at New York City, as
seen through the eyes of optimism and innocence.
</P>
<P>
   With a mop of wavy hair to rival that of the First Daughter,
Russell plays Felicity Porter, a not particularly blissful
California teen. Tired of her high-school role as wallflower, she
impulsively follows a boy she hardly knows to (the fictional)
University of New York after graduation. Her controlling yuppie
parents are disgusted _ they want her in Stanford University's
medical school _ but she has a passion for art, and a new hunger
for independence. The show chronicles Felicity's awkward and
angst-ridden baby steps into adulthood, with the assistance of a
voiceover comprised of Felicity's oral cassette-letters to a friend
in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Felicity'' were a theatrical movie, it would probably be
the product of Cameron Crowe, the writer-director of the similarly
themed ``Say Anything.'' The setups on ``Felicity'' aren't
particularly original, with no less than two possible love
triangles established tonight (dorm monitor Noel has feelings for
Felicity, but Felicity has pinned her hopes on the hunk she
followed East, Ben, until she learns Ben likes her new best friend,
Julie). It's a familiar equation. But the show transcends formula
by staying steadily focused on its characters' shifting emotional
realities, and by avoiding the issue-of-the-week plot twists of a
series like ``Beverly Hills 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   While so many treatments of young adulthood are tinged with
irony, ``Felicity'' appears to be unafraid to approach its
characters with sincerity and, yes, sensitivity. It's certainly not
groundbreaking TV, but its the sort of welcome show that is
respectful of its characters, and its viewers.

NEW YORK CITY, MINUS THE BIG BUCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To some, the words ``New York City'' bring visions of
hundred-dollar bills floating away on gossamer wings. But a trip to
the Apple doesn't have to be expensive. The Hampton Inn chain says
that a family of four can have a fine weekend for about $500 by
staying near Manhattan but not necessarily in it, avoiding costly
restaurants, taking advantage of free or low-cost attractions, and
walking or using public transit whenever possible. Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   _Enjoyable restaurants that won't bust the budget include the
Jekyl &AMP; Hyde Club (1409 Sixth Ave.) with its mad-scientist
waitstaff; the Stage Delicatessen (834 Seventh Ave.) with its
gigantic sandwiches; Hamburger Harry's (145 West 45th St.), where
the specialty is you-know-what; and the Film Center Cafe (635 Ninth
Ave.), featuring vintage Formica tables, old film reels, wall
murals of film studio logos, and a Sunday homestyle brunch. In all
of those restaurants, you should be able to get a meal for $10-$15
a person.
</P>
<P>
   _There are several low-cost attractions, including the
Children's Museum of the Arts, the American Museum of Natural
History, and that perennial favorite, the observation deck of the
Empire State Building.
</P>
<P>
   _Many of the city's free attractions are well-known.
Eight-hundred-forty-three-acre Central Park has unique features
such as the Alice in Wonderland statue and attractions such as the
Central Park Wildlife Conservation Center. The Statue of Liberty
National Monument and nearby Ellis Island Immigration Museum are
more than worthwhile. The four-story Sony Wonder Technology Lab
offers fun interactive exhibits. And you can't beat window shopping
along Fifth Avenue, with a stop at the world's largest toy store,
FAO Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   _And since Hampton Inns was nice enough to provide the preceding
tips, we'll be nice enough to add the chain's lodging
recommendation: the Carlstadt-At the Meadowlands Hampton Inn hotel
in New Jersey, five miles and a few minutes from Manhattan. The
rate for one room with two double beds is about $80 per weekend
night. (For more information, call 201-935-9000.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; And speaking of deals: &LR;  A mere $20 can buy you a tour of New York
City and afternoon tea at a Greenwich Village restaurant. Each
Saturday in October, raconteur Arthur Marks will conduct a two-hour
tour of the Village, followed by an afternoon tea of pastries,
finger sandwiches, and other savories at C3 Restaurant and Lounge
in the Washington Square Hotel. For reservations or more
information, call 212-254-1200.

 &UR; Travel Trivia: &LR;  What is the significance of the seven points in the
crown of the Statue of Liberty? (Answer at end of column.)

QUABBIN RESERVOIR: WATER, SCENERY, WILDLIFE EVERYWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELCHERTOWN, Mass. _ Sixty-five miles from Boston, the Quabbin
Reservoir is the watery heart of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Although one of the largest manmade bodies of water in the
world, the 18-mile-long Quabbin is strangely isolated, elusive, and
unobtrusive. Access to it is limited. And while major roadways
circle it, they generally offer only a few tantalizing, obstructed
glimpses.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the stunning panorama from the summit of the
observation tower in the Metropolitan District Commission's Quabbin
Park here is such a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Like an inland sea, the great lake stretches shimmeringly away
toward the misty blue wall of the Berkshire hills on the western
horizon. There is no other sight quite like it in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Quabbin (a Native American name meaning ``Land of Many Waters'')
is an engineering triumph, certainly, but it's also the centerpiece
of a rural area of remarkable, often haunting beauty. A fisherman's
paradise _ lake trout, bass, perch, and salmon abound _ the
reservoir is surrounded by a thickly forested 81,000-acre MDC
reservation teeming with deer and other wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Bald eagles nest on the shore and can often be seen swooping and
circling over the water. Wild turkeys, long extinct in
Massachusetts, were reintroduced in the Quabbin reserve, thrived,
and have spread into the surrounding countryside. Driving or
cycling around the area today, it's not unusual to see a turkey
scuttle across the road.
</P>
<P>
   The towns and villages of the Quabbin area are typically made up
of mostly Federal-era houses and churches clustered around
tree-shaded commons, and are some of the loveliest in the state.
Creation of the reservoir, which was completed in 1939, isolated
and back-roaded some once-bustling communities. In that sense,
towns such as New Salem, Hardwick, and Petersham give the
impression of being caught in a time warp, little changed in the
past 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Four towns drowned
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most famous towns in the area, however, are the four that no
one can see: Dana, Prescott, Enfield, and Greenwich. When the Swift
River was dammed to create the Quabbin, the valley's 2,500
residents were relocated and their towns sent the way of the
legendary lost city of Atlantis.
</P>
<P>
   They now lie under 50 or more feet of water, but the ``drowned
towns'' live on as poignant local memories. The subject of many
books, stories, and legends, the towns over time have acquired
almost mythic status, transmuted from pleasant but ordinary country
communities into symbolic rural Edens sacrificed to satisfy
big-city needs for water.
</P>
<P>
   Belchertown, on the other hand, because of its name has inspired
more laughter than sadness. Forget the jokes, though; it's an old,
attractive town with a large common dominated by an 18th-century
Congregational church. It also contains the gateway to Quabbin
Park, the 3,200-acre recreational preserve at the southern end of
the reservation, accessible from Route 9.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the summit tower at the park's highest point, there are
several other scenic lookout spots. There are also picnic areas, 20
miles of wide dirt hiking trails, and about 10 miles of paved road.
(Bicycling is permitted only on the paved roads.) You can drive to
all of the lookouts, and also across the Winsor Dam and beside its
spillway.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing is permitted from mid-April to mid-October. Boat access
to the water is from launching areas at marked gates around the
reservoir. A fishing license is required to launch a boat, even if
you aren't going to fish.
</P>
<P>
   The Quabbin Park Visitors Center (413-323-7221) is in the MDC
administration building beside Winsor Dam. Open daily, it provides
maps and brochures, as well as intriguing exhibits about the
construction of the reservoir and operation of the complex water
system. You may have never seen the reservoir, but chances are
you've had a drink from it: Quabbin provides water to 2.5 million
people in 46 communities, including Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Three miles east of the park entrance, on the south side of
Route 9, is the beautiful yet eerie Quabbin Cemetery, which
contains the collected dead of the four lost towns: 7,500 graves,
including headstones, markers, and memorials.
</P>
<P>
   Two old cannons that once decorated the Enfield Common face the
cemetery gate. Between them, a bronze statue of a Civil War soldier
stands at attention atop a granite monument, an eternal sentinel
guarding the citizenry of a vanished valley.
</P>
<P>
   Located between the Massachusetts Turnpike and Route 2, the
Quabbin is easily reached from either road. However, from Boston
the most scenic approach is from Route 2, along roads that pass
through a series of character-filled and quintessentially New
England towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hamlets out of time
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Templeton, on Route 110, is a classic hill town
with a large common that often hosts fairs and festivals. The
Narransett Historical Society, housed in a brick mansion facing the
common, serves tea in the garden on Saturdays. Country Mischief, an
antiques and crafts store, occupies another Federal mansion on the
common and has 20 themed rooms crammed with bric-a-brac and mostly
regionally made crafts. (The Christmas and Halloween rooms alone
are worth a visit.)
</P>
<P>
   Petersham, once a fashionable summer resort and also on Route
110, also has an elegant town center, with many handsome homes and
mansions. The general store, operating since 1842, is one of the
state's oldest.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the usual sundries, the store stocks a fine selection of
books and maps about the Quabbin area and the four towns. One of
the books, ``Marjorie's Secret,'' is a slim, privately printed
novella by Fay W. Butler, a 70-year-old man who runs a gas station
in nearby Hardwick, on Route 32A. ``It's about people who lived in
Dana and had to leave when it was flooded for the Quabbin,'' Butler
says. ``I wanted to get down some of the things the old people who
came into my station over the years told me about how it was
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Swift River Valley farm families were resettled in
Hardwick, which is still bucolic. Every summer since 1762 the town
has held an agricultural fair on its scenic common _ framed by
white steepled churches, the town hall, and a one-room schoolhouse
_ complete with sheep and cattle judging.
</P>
<P>
   An old textile manufacturing town, Ware, on Route 9, has a
number of imposing 19th-century mill buildings, many of which now
house factory outlets and antique dealers. Stonemill Marketplace on
East Main Street has a large and eclectic antique collection.
</P>
<P>
   The western side of Quabbin also has a number of interesting
communities such as Pelham and New Salem, both on Route 202. The
route is officially named the Daniel Shays Highway in honor of the
man who in 1786 led a rebellion by impoverished local farmers
against a state government controlled by wealthy Boston merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Pelham was the headquarters of Shays's ragtag force, and the
local historical society (open weekends) has exhibits devoted to
the rebellion. On a hilltop just north of Pelham Center is the
Pelham Overlook, which offers one of the few scenic views of the
reservoir to be had from a highway.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A quiet survivor
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Salem survived as a town after the Swift River was dammed,
but barely. Today about 80 percent of the original land is either
under water or within the MDC reservation. What's left is lovely,
but almost spookily quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The old town center, just off the highway, is a gem, with an
elliptical common and a striking lineup of structures that include
a granite assembly building that was once a private academy and a
church meetinghouse built in 1794 and now used as a concert hall.
The only commercial activity is The Common Reader, a notable
secondhand book and antique store. Main Street, a busy east-west
thoroughfare in pre-Quabbin days, abruptly dead-ends just beyond
the common at a chain-link fence marking the MDC boundary.
</P>
<P>
   On Elm Street in North New Salem (signposted from Route 202),
the Swift River Historical Society museum (978-544-6882) preserves
the collective memory of the four lost towns. The museum has a
large collection of photos, artifacts, genealogical records, and
memorabilia housed in three buildings, including a former church
moved to the site from the valley.
</P>
<P>
   One of the society's most treasured artifacts stands on the
grounds. A square wooden 19th-century ``guide post,'' it still
points the way to the drowned towns.

NEW, HELPFUL ATTRACTIONS IN NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no city like New York City.
</P>
<P>
   And in fall, it's a great place to visit. New shows are opening
on Broadway, there are new attractions, new hotels to check out.
</P>
<P>
   Among those new attractions is a new Times Square Visitors
Center. Times Square has shed its sleaze and has been restored,
bringing back its luster as the ``Crossroads of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   The new visitors' center, located within the restored historic
Embassy Theatre, is a good example of the area's restoration. It's
``a perfect example of building the new Times Square on the roots
of the old,'' said Gretchen Dykstra, president of the Times Square
Business Improvement District, which operates the center.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the center, you'll find ATMs for quick cash, a Broadway
ticket center for full-price tickets, tickets to popular tourist
attractions and sightseeing tours, Metrocards for public
transportation (seven days of unlimited subway rides for $17 and
free transfers from subway to bus) as well as transit memorabilia,
free access to the Internet, a City-Store featuring official NYC
souvenirs, a video wall featuring the history of the square
(complete with a simulated New Year's Eve ball drop), and hometown
newspapers from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The center is ideally located. It's surrounded by 37 Broadway
theaters (11.5 million people attend the shows every year, making
Broadway the city's number one tourist attractions), and 24 hotels,
which account for a fifth of all the hotel rooms in the city.
</P>
<P>
   And the center (at 1560 Broadway, between 46th and 47th streets)
is just across from the TKTS booth, which sells half-price tickets
to Broadway shows. That booth, which sold more than 2.3 million
tickets last year, celebrated its 25th anniversary earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Embassy Theatre, built in 1925, was the last vintage Times
Square cinema to present first-run movies. When it opened, it made
history as the first and only movie theater in the United States
managed and staffed solely by women, chosen for their age (17-21),
their height (less than 5 feet 4 inches), their intelligence, their
white teeth (no gold allowed), and their ``ability to wear clothes
with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   And the city also has an old attraction with a new reason to
visit. New York's answer to the great train stations of Europe is
Grand Central Station, which is being rededicated after a two-year,
$196 million restoration. It's grand again, and within its walls
you'll find trains, shops, restaurants _ a grand place to meet,
eat, and greet.
</P>
<P>
   Among new hotels is the Flatotel International (135 West 52nd
St. between Sixth and Seventh avenues). This conveniently located
46-story property has some of the largest rooms available in
Manhattan. The hotel is not to be confused with the Flatiron
building; in this case, ``flat'' is used as in the British word for
apartment. The hotel is part of a chain of European properties.
While not a bargain-priced hotel, a family of four can find a
luxurious room for under $300. The hotel's one- and two-bedroom
suites, slightly higher, feature oversized whirlpool tubs and a
full-size, fully equipped kitchen (grocery delivery can be
provided) right down to the serving utensils. The hotel also offers
a fitness and business center. For information, call 800-FLATOTEL
and ask about seasonal and weekend rates.
</P>
<P>
   New York lodgings come in every price, from about $20 a night at
the American Youth Hostel up to $15,000 to rest your head in the
opulent 7,802-square-foot Presidential Suite of The Plaza Hotel.
While just about every hotel has a presidential suite, only one NYC
property can claim that every president from Herbert Hoover to Bill
Clinton has stayed within its walls _ that's the boutique Waldorf
Towers that covers floors 26 through 42 of the Waldorf-Astoria. Its
Presidential Suite, where Queen Elizabeth II and presidents have
stayed, goes for a mere $7,000 a night.
</P>
<P>
   The main question for most visitors, though, is how to find a
room. With rooms at a premium, using a central reservation service
is your best bet. These services include a wide range of properties
from budget to luxury. Most offer better rates that the hotel
itself may quote, and can find you rooms when the city seems booked
solid. Most charge nothing for their service.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau is offering a Peak
Season Hotel Hotline at 800-846-7666. The service is also on the
Web at www.nycvisit.com.. Among tips the bureau offers for finding
rooms is to book early, be flexible, call a travel agent, and to
try hotels in all areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Among other services:
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Con-x-ions claims it has guaranteed availabilty; call
800-522-991 or 212-840-8686. The service is open daily 9 a.m. to
5:30 p.m.; Saturday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; and is closed Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Central Reservation Service says it specializes in last-second
bookings; call 800-548-3311, 6:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Reservation Service also claims it will have rooms
available, even if every hotel in the city is sold out; call
800-846-7666. Bob Diener, who operates the service, says the entire
month of October will be tight and a complete sellout Dec. 4-5 and
11-12.
</P>
<P>
   For sightseeing in New York, pick up a CityPass booklet that
cuts the cost of seeing major attractions from the Empire State
Building Observatories to the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Mueum. The
pass is available at any of the six attractions (other locations
are the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, American
Museum of Natural History, and the Top of the World Trade Center)
and sells for $26.75 for adults, $18 for seniors, and $21 for those
13-18.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on the city, call the New York Convention &AMP;
Visitors Bureau at 800-NYC-VISIT. For personal assistance from
multilingual information counselors, call 212-484-1222 from Monday
to Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

HURRICANE MISSED; SO DID HURRICANES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a washout weekend for the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College suffered its first loss of the season, a stunning
52-28 nonconference setback at Louisville. Temple remained winless,
dropping to 0-4 with a 30-20 loss at Maryland. And Miami's marquee
matchup against No. 3 UCLA was canceled because of the threat posed
by Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   While it landed only a glancing blow on South Florida last
weekend, instead striking the Florida Keys with all its fury,
Hurricane Georges did wreak havoc on Miami's plans to host UCLA in
a CBS game at the Orange Bowl. There have been no announcements
about a rescheduling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mutually agreed upon decision because of all the
things that were going on in South Florida at the time, and with
all the potential for major disaster, not to play the game at that
particular time,'' said Miami coach Butch Davis. ``Will it be
rescheduled? I think certainly from things I've read in the
newspaper, both coaching staffs and both teams would like to play
the game. I believe that television people are interested in
rebroadcasting at a later date. Now it's just a matter of whether
or not the athletic directors and administration can put the thing
back together.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do, great. If they don't, then we've got to move on.
We can't get too concerned about it. Only time will tell, but it's
pretty much in the administration's hands right now. I'm sure UCLA
is doing exactly the same thing we're doing today, and that's
getting ready (for the next game).''
</P>
<P>
   Next up for Miami: a conference game at Rutgers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we were very fortunate, because if you read the
newspapers or watch television, you can see what the hurricane has
done to the Florida Keys and the Gulf Coast,'' Davis said. ``I
guess we missed it by 50 or 60 miles, and fortunately, it didn't
hit Dade County, so we felt fortunate about that part of it. But we
just tried to address last weekend as a regularly scheduled open
date.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The drawing board
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After BC (3-1) absorbed its worst loss since a 52-20 drubbing at
Notre Dame last year, coach Tom O'Brien said he and his staff would
likely use this week's open date to reevaluate the team's overall
performance in the first four games. Could a personnel move or
alteration be in the offing? ``I wouldn't say that right now, but I
can't rule that out one way or another,'' said O'Brien, who used
Monday's day off to take 25-30 players on a visit to the cancer
ward at Children's Hospital. ``I think we have to take a good look
at the first four games and try to evaluate what we've done both
schematically and with our personnel and start practicing and then
later on in the week take a look at Virginia Tech and where we have
to go in the future.'' ... The Hokies, BC's next opponent Oct. 8,
sustained more casualties to their offense in a 27-7 victory over
Pittsburgh after losing three starters _ quarterback Al Clark
(sprained foot, ankle), offensive guard Josh Redding (knee), and
fullback Cullen Hawkins (foot) _ at Miami two weeks ago. After
running back Shyrone Stith suffered a severe ankle sprain,
sophomore backup quarterback Dave Meyer went down in the third
quarter against Pitt with a separated right shoulder, forcing the
Hokies to go with sophomore Nick Sorenson, who had been switched to
free safety this season after serving as Clark's backup last year.
Prized freshman recruit Jake Houseright, who came to Virginia Tech
as a linebacker, will be switched to fullback to help make up for
the loss of Hawkins ... After a Sept. 19 visit to the Big East
woodshed _ a k a the Carrier Dome, where Rutgers suffered a savage
70-14 pounding _ the Scarlet Knights rebounded Saturday by scoring
a 27-15 victory over visiting Army. That gave coach Terry Shea his
first win in 17 games against Division 1-A opponents. ``I really
believed our entire program was embarrassed about the way we played
at Syracuse, not that we could've beaten Syracuse,'' said Shea, who
must now get his team (2-2, 0-2) ready to host Miami (2-1, 0-1).
``But we just didn't play very well at all, and it was certainly
below our standard. We just made sure our guys understood how
important it was to start playing like a major college football
team and do things the right way and take care of the critical
plays of the game. I think that's what truly drove our team all
week in practice.'' ... Syracuse will have a chance to improve the
Big East's 3-1 record against Atlantic Coast Conference opponents
when the Orangemen travel to North Carolina State for an ESPN
Thursday night game. Syracuse is looking to snap a five-game losing
streak against the Wolfpack, who scored a 32-31 overtime victory at
the Carrier Dome last year.

BAFFERT CAMP HOPES THIS TIME THE CHARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Silver Charm is back. Well, almost.
</P>
<P>
   The charismatic winner of last year's Kentucky Derby and
Preakness and one of the most popular horses of recent times,
Silver Charm didn't beat all four of his foes in the $500,000
Kentucky Cup Classic at Turfway Park Saturday, finishing in a dead
heat with Wild Rush. But after two straight subpar performances,
his connections gladly took a tie. The question now is: Will Silver
Charm make the Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs Nov. 7 for
a showdown with Skip Away, who is undefeated this season at 7 for
7?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Rush was relentless and Silver Charm was flat out,'' said
Bob Baffert, who trains Silver Charm for Bob and Beverly Lewis.
``They say ties are like kissing your sister, but I really thought
he was second.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Silver Charm, who was giving Wild Rush 6 pounds
(123-117), made a lunge at the wire from the outside to gain the
draw after a stirring stretch battle. Off at 1-2 under Gary
Stevens, Silver Charm saved the grandstand by refusing to let Wild
Rush, the 2-1 second choice with Pat Day, keep his nostril in front
at the wire. The time for the 1 1/8 miles was fast _ 1:47 2/5 _
further buoying the Silver Charm camp after discouraging losses in
the Stephen Foster at Churchill Downs June 13, when he was second
to Awesome Again, and especially in the San Diego Handicap at Del
Mar, when he was fifth and last. The San Diego Handicap marked the
first time Silver Charm, who also won last year's Preakness and
this year's $4 million Dubai World Cup, had finished worse than
second in his career (16-9-6-0).
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we know he is headed in the right direction,'' said
Baffert. ``Off this race, he should really move forward. He's on a
comeback. Right now we've got a way to go before we could go
against Skip Away. I don't want to run against Skip Away unless I
think I can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm, a mere $16,500 yearling, was not nominated to the
Breeders' Cup program, so the Lewises would have to put up
$480,000, 12 percent of the purse, to make him eligible for the $4
million Classic. Baffert's plan is to run Silver Charm, who came
out of the Kentucky Cup in fine fettle, in either the Meadowlands
Cup Oct. 16 or the Goodwood Handicap at Santa Anita Oct. 17. If the
big gray runs well in his next assignment, it will likely be on to
the Breeders' Cup. Otherwise, he probably will be retired.
</P>
<P>
   If Silver Charm does not run in the Classic, it will be because
he is off form, not because the Lewises, who are very sporting,
won't pay the fee. After all, Siler Charm, who has won $4,950,430
in purses, has earned his way there, and the industry would still
love to see an encounter between the 1997 3-year-old champion and
Skip Away, the '97 handicap champion. It would be great for the
game.

No more dirty `Trick'

<P>
   Favorite Trick, the Horse of the Year in '97 when he went 8 for
8 as a 2-year-old, is officially headed for the grass. He will race
next in either the Kelso at Belmont or the Keeneland Breeders' Cup,
both run at 1 mile Oct. 17. Favorite Trick, who flopped in the
Kentucky Derby, finished fifth in the King's Bishop, a 7-furlong
sprint, at Saratoga Aug. 29 in what could have been his final race
on dirt. If he succeeds in his first turf try, trainer Bill Mott
may enter him next in the $1 million Breeders' Cup Mile, run on the
grass. If Favorite Trick does make the Mile, among his opponents
could be Wild Rush, who will start in either the Mile or the $1
million Sprint at 6 furlongs ... Victory Gallop, winner of the
Belmont Stakes and second to Coronado's Quest in both the Haskell
and Travers, might go up against Skip Away in the $1 million Jockey
Club Gold Cup at Belmont Oct. 10. However, after seeing Skip Away
crush Coronado'a Quest in the Wooward Sept. 19, trainer Elliott
Walden is keeping open other options for his 3-year-old, including
the Hawthorne Gold Cup, run the same day as the Jockey Club; the
Meadowlands Cup; and the Fayette at Keeneland Oct. 11. Victory
Gallop, who had been battling a virus, drilled 4 furlongs in :49
2/5, galloping out 5 furlongs in 1:02 3/5, at Churchill last
Wednesday, the first time he has had a workout since the Travers
Aug. 29. ``He was rolling late, which is patented for him,'' said
Walden ... Touch Gold, winner of last year's Belmont Stakes, is
heading for the Fayette, which trainer Pat Byrne hopes will be a
steppingstone for the Classic. Last Thursday, Touch Gold had a
serious move at Churchill, going 6 furlongs in 1:11 2/5 under Day.
``I wasn't looking for that kind of time, but I was looking for a
good work,'' said Byrne. ``You've got to be happy with the horse.''
Touch Gold, long plagued by bad hooves, is looking to rebound after
finishing up the track in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar Aug. 15
... Raffie's Majesty, beaten just two noses as a flying third in
the Travers, fractured his left front knee while working out at
Saratoga last Monday and may be retired.

   Donna Barton, who rode in New England for a time before going on

Brothers, one of the nation's best trainers, Nov. 15 and attend
college at the University of Louisville. Barton, who said her dream
always has been to earn a college degree, rode for 11 years and won
1,131 races. She did very well in Kentucky, where she teamed with
trainer D. Wayne Lukas, riding such outstanding Lukas charges as
Hennessy, with whom she finished second in the 1995 Breeders' Cup
Juvenile; and Boston Harbor, the 1996 2-year-old champion, whom she
rode to victory in the Kentucky Cup Juvenile and Bashford Manor.

CONVERGENCE? NOT EXACTLY! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In so many ways, he resembles Fidelity's Peter Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1946 in the pin-neat South Side neighborhood known as
Roseland, John Meriwether grew up Irish Catholic in the era of
Mayor Richard J. Daley: Chicago, The City That Worked.
</P>
<P>
   There were parochial schools until he went to college at
Northwestern University in Evanston, 10 miles across the city. He
caddied at Flossmor Country Club as a teenager, and grew to be an
excellent golfer. He hit a hole in one the first time he played
Augusta National. He even taught school for a time.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was on to the University of Chicago for an MBA, while he
worked as a financial analyst for CNA Financial Corp. (the one with
the ink-red building.) And finally in 1974 the job at Salomon
Brothers, trading new-fangled repurchase agreements, or repos.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, after building Salomon's famous fixed-income
arbitrage desk into one of Wall Street's high-tech wonders, after
fabulous successes, he remained a steady church-goer, attending
Mass in the little town where he lived near his Greenwich, Conn.,
offices.
</P>
<P>
   And when he sat for the profile by Kevin Muehring in
Institutional Investor from which most of these details are drawn,
it was clear that Meriwether was a man of parts. Like Lynch,
another down-to-earth kid made good in the high-flying markets, his
easy ways were not reserved for the rich and famous. He was
generous to Catholic charities and made pilgrimages to shrines such
as Lourdes and Fatima. He followed closely the peace talks in
Northern Ireland. He was happily married. And he still shot a
wonderful game of golf.
</P>
<P>
   So who would have thought that Meriwether would wind up as the
poster boy for a certain kind of bad financial behavior?
</P>
<P>
   The baby-faced bond trader first acquired lengendary status
when, in Michael Lewis's entertaining book ``Liar's Poker,'' he
faced down Salomon's chairman John Gutfreund by bumping him from $1
million to $10 million over a single hand of the bluffing game.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the celebrated two-year Treasury note squeeze at
Salomon Brothers in 1991, when a subordinate tried make a killing
by cornering the market in an auction. Meriwether reported the
lawbreaker, but was forced to leave the firm for a time in the wake
of its forced bailout by Warren Buffett.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is the forced sale of Meriwether's hedge fund, Long-Term
Capital Management LP, that has put the bond &UR;  &LR; trader back in the
headlines. A consortium of 15 big New York financial institutions
took over the faltering firm last week after ponying up more than
$3.5 billion to prevent its collapse. Meriwether and his partners
apparently were left with little more than their opulent houses and
the relatively small sums they had taken out of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Ironies abound in the story of Long-Term Capital, which
Meriwether formed in 1994 with other top Salomon traders, a handful
of finance professors (including a pair of Nobel laureates,) and a
prominent ex-regulator or two. But the greatest of these may be
that Meriwether is now seen by many as the ultimate plunger,
betting the world economy like a casino player with a hunch.
</P>
<P>
   The style of arbitrage that Meriwether pioneered is known as
``convergence'' or ``relative value'' trading. It depends on the
identification of relatively tiny mispricing of bonds of one type
or another relative to other investments _ and their purchase in
huge quantities.
</P>
<P>
   Other hedge fund operators bet the direction of interest rates.
Long-Term Capital hunted for unseen misalignments among instruments
that eventually would converge. Computers and powerful mathematics,
not intuition nor inside information, were its tools.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that the firm's exposure was almost entirely in
extremely conservative investments _ European and American
government bonds _ and not in currencies or the equities of
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Russia defaulted on its highly speculative bonds in
August, the resulting ``flight to quality'' bid up the prices of
the best government bonds _ and destroyed the intricate
correlations upon which Long-Term Capital's strategies depended.
The firm had no choice but to sell into markets that were going
against it.
</P>
<P>
   The financial wizard, whose vision was as orderly as the gardens
of Roseland, whose techniques emphasized obedience over resolution
at every turn, was undone by his passion for order. Other investors
simply were not as neat as he thought.

A CAN-DO EPA HAS DEFIED THE SKEPTICS ON SMOG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- To understand the latest political-policy trend
sweeping the industrial West, my favorite illustrative
over-simplification of the moment is the boring figure of $1,500
per ton of nitrogen oxide, the chief ingredient of a threat to
healthy lungs called smog.
</P>
<P>
   And for this, a deep bow of respect is in order to Carol
Browner, who runs the Environmental Protection Agency the right way
in a new era when solving problems is more important than fighting
ideological wars.
</P>
<P>
   This being an instinctively, rabidly partisan town, the locals
rebel loudly at the notion of synthesis, or Third Way, or Vital
Center, or New Democrat. They can handle occasional compromises
between the two parties, such as at budget time, but the notion of
a third dimension is more than this place is equipped to handle.
</P>
<P>
   But elsewhere, it's the wave: in the states where party label
can't sum up the policies of the vast majority of governors; and in
Europe where Third Wave surfers now run Britain, Germany, and,
technically, even France, where the actions of a nominally
Socialist government belie its name.
</P>
<P>
   Our friends on the left and the right remain in denial,
attributing the successive successes to political merchanidising
and not to substance.
</P>
<P>
   But an excellent retort is Browner's $1,500 per ton. This is the
estimate the geniuses in her agency have for the cost of cutting
the emissions that are smog by more than one-fourth. This takes
focusing on cleaning up the huge power plants concentrated in the
Midwest that send poison mostly south and east across state lines.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, less targeted and more invasively regulatory
methods could easily have doubled or even quadrupled the cost of
complying with the Clean Air Act. What's more, the $1,500 per ton
cost for the smog-belching entities called power companies, which
works out to roughly a buck a month on a typical electric bill, is
almost certain never to be actually experienced by consumers
because of yet another Third Wave trend gathering speed around the
country _ the deregulation of electricity rates and the spur to
competition that is providing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the EPA put out for comment its final plans to cut
nitrogen oxide emissions by 1.1 million tons a year in 22 Eastern
states plus here, or 28 percent. Some 138 million people live
there, and about one-fourth of them will over the next few years be
breathing air that for the first time meets the country's new,
tougher standards on smog. This is also the first time the EPA has
confronted the enormous public health challenge that smog causes in
states downwind from where it is produced.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, as Browner began to push for new rules, the power
industry and its allies in Congress, the smog-producing states, and
more than a few senior officials in the Clinton administration said
it couldn't be done, at least not cost effectively.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case through more than a generation of
environmental naysaying, they were wrong. Browner showed, moreover,
that a way of proceeding could be found that involved the states as
partners and that harnessed new technologies and emission-control
methods like the trading of credits among entities that are below
and above specific caps based on the new standards.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to emphasizing market strategies, Browner's plan is
also mandate-free for the governors, including those of the most
impacted states (West Virginia, Ohio, Missouri, Michigan, Kentucky,
Indiana, and Illinois). The attractiveness of large power plants as
a focal point is obvious, but not required. However, assuming this
is how states proceed, $1,500 per ton compares nicely with the
$3,400 per ton a focus on automobiles would cost; it also would
enable states to exempt nearly all emissions coming from smaller
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, the EPA still faces the need to help major cities
like New York, Baltimore, and Boston meet the standards, but the
experience to date is powerful evidence that an emphasis on
flexibility and emerging technology can do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Browner was warned that she'd be regulating backyard
barbecues and daily commuting patterns to meet these goals. Today,
except for pro forma complaints from Big Power, the naysayers are
quiet.
</P>
<P>
   This is Third Way-ism at its best. As Bill Clinton himself said
in an early campaign speech back in 1991, it's neither left nor
right, liberal nor conservative; it's both, it's neither, and it's
different.
</P>
<P>
   On a lot of issues, it's also smart, and it works.

NOW'S THE DAWN OF A WRITER SADLY NEGLECTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is light complaint that too many entries in this series
consider authors unknown to most readers. Here is another of these,
by name of Dawn Powell; but her low profile may begin to rise a
bit, prodded by Tim Page's new and appreciative critical biography
of her.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to grips with Dawn Powell, let's consider the
possible consequences of literary biography. It may damage
reputation, as in Mark Schorer's redoubtable biographical study of
Sinclair Lewis. Or it may redeem a declining figure, reclaim a lost
one.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Melville, for example. Following an early life of
maritime adventure, Melville won fame for his early romances _
``Typee,'' ``Omoo,'' ``Mardi,'' ``Redburn'' _ before he was 30.
Ironically, his popularity began to wane with the publication in
1851 of ``Moby-Dick,'' surely his most ambitious work and, some
would say, the greatest of all American novels.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Moby-Dick'' was not appreciated in its time, nor were the
later striking achievements of ``Israel Potter,'' ``Bartleby the
Scrivener,'' ``Benito Cereno'' and ``The Confidence Man;'' and
Melville drifted toward obscurity after his death in 1891.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected appearance of ``Billy Budd'' in 1924 attracted
little attention; but five years later, Lewis Mumford's biography
of Melville was an unanticipated bestseller that rehabilitated its
subject so thoroughly as to solemnize all of Melville's prose, and
his poetry too. Today, Herman Melville ranks one-two with his
friend and neighbor Nathaniel Hawthorne (to whom ``Moby-Dick'' was
dedicated) as 19th-century America's greatest novelists.
</P>
<P>
   And Stephen Crane. Although ``The Red Badge of Courage'' was
widely read following its 1895 publication, its author who died
five years later at age 28 was substantially forgotten soon after.
Little might have been known of Crane today but for Thomas Beer's
1923 biography of him.
</P>
<P>
   Crane's short life rivaled Melville's for its adventure
quotient; and again like Melville, as an author he was innovative
both thematically and stylistically. He was profoundly ambitious,
so great things might have been expected of him.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Beer who brought Crane's modest body of work into
appreciative light, including some of the finest short stories ever
crafted, several splendid novellas, and ``Maggie: A Girl of the
Streets,'' which preceded ``The Red Badge of Courage'' in
composition (Crane wrote it at age 21) and is the first vivid
bridge between the literary schools of realism and naturalism.
</P>
<P>
   A comparable Dawn Powell renaissance may not be in the offing,
but who knows? Besides its discerning positive assessment of
Powell's work, Page's study, just out as a $30 hardback from Holt,
illuminates a captivating woman, bright and witty and wise in life
as in her fiction. (These faculties are underscored by her diaries
(1931-65), published concurrently and also edited by Page.)
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Powell (1897-1965) peaked in the Great Depression years
that weren't kind to fiction sales, but her novels didn't get lost
and received ample and generally favorable critical attention. She
was almost a ``name'' writer then, but try finding her books today.
Even the public libraries seem to have discarded her.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, I read Powell's ``Turn, Magic Wheel'' (1936) and
remember it as one of those novels that could cause me to laugh out
of control. She was also a failed dramatist, whose ``Big Night''
was staged by the fabled Group Theater, and I've read the play
script with its crackerjack dialogue. Otherwise, I'm merely on the
hunt for more Powell, and Page has made it a more urgent search.
</P>
<P>
   Her best-known works seem to have been ``She Walks in Beauty,''
``The Bride's House,'' ``Dance Night,'' and ``Angels on Toast,''
and there are several others.
</P>
<P>
   What Tim Page and his book may do for Dawn Powell is difficult
to calculate, but the biography _ like its subject _ is grand
entertainment.

THE WILTED TULIP AND THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome, distinguished losers.
</P>
<P>
   It is time again to award the coveted Wilted Tulip. As many of
you know, being past recipients yourselves, the Wilted Tulip is
bestowed upon the individual who each year most convincingly shows
the world that to lose _ and lose big _ is beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilted Tulip Award derives its name from the frenzied tulip
speculation that swept Holland in the 17th century. For three
years, tulip prices couldn't climb high enough. The rich grew
richer and the poor grew rich as the world focused its investment
passion on these bulbs. Of course, the bubble burst, and everyone
learned that to lose _ and lose big _ is beautiful, especially when
you're left with a fistful of tulips.
</P>
<P>
   Before opening this year's sealed envelope, let's take a moment
to honor two esteemed past recipients of the Wilted Tulip Award:
Toshihide Iguchi and Nicholas Leeson. I regret that neither man can
join us today, as both were denied furloughs from prison. You will
recall that Mr. Iguchi, a Daiwa Bank trader, won his Wilted Tulip
for singlehandedly losing $1.1 billion. Please, ladies and
gentlemen, do sit down _ I'm sure Mr. Iguchi would be proud to
witness your ovation. As for Mr. Leeson, how can we forget the
young rogue trader in Singapore who brought down venerable Barings
investment bank by losing $1.3 billion?
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes, I see Robert Citron in the audience. Let's give a
hearty welcome to the former treasurer of Orange County, Calif.,
another distinguished Wilted Tulip winner. Mr. Citron, you will
recall, dropped $1.6 billion by betting the wrong way on the
direction of interest rates and now holds the honor of causing the
nation's largest municipal bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   These are the men who give the Wilted Tulip its prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Now allow me to enumerate a few of the many reasons the Wilted
Tulip executive committee has chosen our newest honoree:
</P>
<P>
   _For his hedge fund's loss of nearly $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   _For striking fear into the hearts of all investors worried that
his losses would precipitate a global meltdown. He was so
successful raising the alarm that the Federal Reserve cajoled
big-name banks and brokerage houses like Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan
and Goldman Sachs to pony up cash for a $3.5 billion bailout of his
fund.
</P>
<P>
   _For instigating possible regulation of the wild and wooly hedge
fund industry. The funds have long thrived as private clubs for the
wealthy, with admission fees in the millions of dollars and their
trading antics maintained as well-guarded secrets from the prying
eyes of regulators.
</P>
<P>
   _For proving that if you lose really big _ and really beautiful
_ then you must be really smart. Big-brain partners in our
recipient's fund include two Nobel Prize winners in economics,
Myron Scholes and Robert Merton. If any further proof of brilliance
were needed, the fund was guided by mathematical trading strategies
understood only by crazed geniuses.
</P>
<P>
   _For the year's most beautiful irony: that Scholes and Merton
were recognized by the Nobel committee in 1997 for their
understanding of financial risk.
</P>
<P>
   _For proving that the smartest investors really are those who
are luckiest the longest.
</P>
<P>
   _For taking one of the most spectacular dives from grace.
</P>
<P>
   _For restoring the original meaning of the word risk.
</P>
<P>
   The envelope, please. And the winner is: Mr. John Meriwether of
Long-Term Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, loser.

UAM MAY BE NEAR SALE OF TARNISHED JEWEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   United Asset Management Corp. of Boston may be close to selling
what had been considered one of the jewels in its collection of
money managers, mutual fund operator Pilgrim Baxter &AMP; Associates
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   UAM Monday confirmed it was negotiating the sale of Pilgrim
Baxter to Nationwide Financial Services Inc., an insurance company.
UAM is believed to be seeking as much as $600 million for the firm
that manages mutual funds under the name PBHG.
</P>
<P>
   The big question: are there more sales ahead? UAM doesn't rule
out the possibility but insists the Pilgrim Baxter negotiations
were sparked by strategic issues specific to that firm.
</P>
<P>
   A sale would be only the latest strategic twist at UAM, which
has struggled with persistent client cash flow problems. Though the
company remains quite profitable, customers have been removing more
money than they contribute to UAM's investment firms quarter after
quarter. Negative client cash flow amounted to $4.3 billion in the
last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   UAM sold Analytic-TSA International Inc., a small bond
investment firm, earlier this year. It was the first time United
Asset Management sold one of its investment subsidiaries in the
company's 18-year history. More recently, UAM decided to shut its
subsidiary that serviced retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Most of UAM's investment firms are institutional money managers
with names the average investor would never recognize. But Pilgrim
Baxter was a striking exception, an aggressive growth mutual fund
business widely known by individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrim Baxter has fallen on hard times of late, its money under
management declining in line with a weak investment performance.
The firm's assets under management have declined from $16.6 billion
to $12.4 billion over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Pilgrim Baxter hired former Fidelity Investments
executive Paul Hondros as its chief operating officer. Hondros, who
had run Fidelity's retail investment operations, was expected to
move aggressively to build a much larger base of retail business
around Pilgrim Baxter.
</P>
<P>
   UAM officials point to an expensive ``mass market retail
distribution'' organization Pilgrim Baxter had been building, even
before Hondros arrived, as the reason a sale was considered. It
didn't fit with most of the company's other businesses and but
could be attractive to buyers in a market paying handsomely for
mutual fund operations.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry consultants said UAM's interest in selling Pilgrim
Baxter, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, indicates the
company has grown frustrated with the retail investment business.
</P>
<P>
   ``UAM never successfully penetrated the retail marketplace to
any extent,'' said consultant Burton Greenwald. ``If they were
going to be players on the retail side of the business, their point
of departure was going to be Pilgrim Baxter.''
</P>
<P>
   But UAM would be selling off one of its most valauble companies.
That has industry observers speculating a more interesting story
lies behind the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrim Baxter's assets under management represent only 6
percent of the $210 billion invested for clients by all UAM's firms
combined. But the $600 million price tag, a figure doubted by some,
is equal to 40 percent of UAM's $1.5 billion total stock market
value.

Fidelity `redeploys' workers
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments said Monday it had no plans for layoffs or
a hiring freeze, but did confirm that it is ``redeploying'' about
30 people in its retail business, which deals mainly with
individual investors. Look for similar moves ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The world's biggest mutual fund company is rife with rumors
about cutbacks in the wake of a market correction, but Fidelity
says there are no such plans. It says it has added 2,700 jobs so
far this year and has ``hundreds'' of open jobs it is looking to
fill.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 or so Fidelity employees, mainly in retail marketing,
will be given until the end of the year to find another job in the
company before they are let go, Fidelity said. The company said it
was now hiring 240 people in the retail unit to support the firm's
new ad campaign built around investment guru Peter Lynch. But
Fidelity said it would continue to examine its needs in the retail
unit, now headed by vice chairman J. Gary Burkhead and a team of
new executives.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity watchers said they would not be surprised to see the
company cut some workers, as have other financial services
companies. ``But I don't think it will be anything dramatic,'' said
Eric Kobren, editor of Fidelity Insight, a newsletter.

The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John R. Ranelli, the number two man at Stride Rite Corp., has
resigned, giving a boost to the only other insider in the chase to
fill the seat of retiring chief executive Robert Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexington, Mass. shoe company confirmed that Ranelli, who
came to Stride Rite two years ago as executive vice president, had
resigned to pursue other opportunites. Insiders said the board had
made clear that it did not think Ranelli had the broad marketing
background it wanted in a new chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The only other inside candidate is Diane Sullivan, president of
Stride Rite's licensed brands division, who is seen as more of a
marketer. Outsiders are also being considered, but the shoe
business is not the kind of industry that usually brings star
candidates beating down the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Look the board to get final candidates by mid-November; Siegel's
contract runs to the end of the year.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Strobe lights shatter the darkness as DJ Bruno takes
the crowd at the Lansdowne Street Playhouse back in time. From the
stage, where he hovers over two turntables and a mixer, he spins
``Din Da Da,'' a hip-hop hit from 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd slowly ripples to the side, forming a circle. George
Lumpkins, 31, doesn't hesitate. He dives onto the wood floor and
spins like a windmill, the stripes on his Adidas pants a blazing
blur.
</P>
<P>
   In a gangsta rap world, Lumpkins is a throwback to the old days
when MCs rapped about partying and street kids took their anger out
on the dance floor. Now, in the dance caverns of Lansdowne Street,
a new generation is reclaiming early '80s rap and break dancing,
what they call ``old-school'' hip-hop. They reject gangsta rap, the
virulent strain of hip-hop that glorifies violence and misogyny.
They say they are sick of lyrics that talk of pulling out guns and
slapping women.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're talking about gang-banging, shooting people. We don't
want to hear that,'' said Paul ``Lefty Left'' Rosado, 29. ``That's
why I'm into old-school. The way we deal with our emotions is
hitting the floor or grabbing a mike.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just Boston kids who are turning to break dancing for
its cool mood as much as its cool moves. Break dancing ``reunions''
have been held in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. And break
dancing suddenly is visible everywhere from Coke commercials to new
music videos by Janet Jackson, Wyclef Jean, Madonna, Jay Z, Sonic
Empire, and The Propellerheads.
</P>
<P>
   But in Boston, where gangsta rap still commands wide attention
on the radio, hundreds of youths are voting with their feet for a
mellower hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night (Sept. 29), two local entrepreneurs _ Russell
Jackson, 28, who immigrated from England, and Chris Johnston, 33,
who immigrated from Belfast _ sponsored a break-dancing competition
at the Avalon. They expected 1,500 people to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Two big-name DJs, Cash Money from Philadelphia and Bad Boy Bill
from Chicago, spun records. The event, ``Unity and Respect, Part
2,'' is a sequel to their first competition, held in June.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a slim man with a shag of blond hair, said he and
Johnston had trouble persuading clubs to allow them to hold a
break-dancing competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is very anti-hip-hop because of its association with
gangsta rap,'' Jackson said. ``People don't understand old-school.
They just see MTV and think that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a majority of those buying gangsta rap music are white
suburban teens, not inner-city blacks and Latinos. But the racial
polarization presented in gangsta rap _ which draws on racial anger
for attitude _ isn't there in old-school hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't realize that hip-hop and gangsta rap are
two different things,'' said David Shallow, 30, a break dancer from
Everett. ``Hip-hop is about having fun. Nobody wants to hear about
how much money you have, how many guns you have, and how many
people you can kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop is the umbrella term for a style of music, fashion,
dance, and attitude born in the streets of the South Bronx and
South Central Los Angeles. It began in the early '70s when young
disc jockeys began experimenting with records played simultaneously
on two turntables. They would repeat beats and phrases several
times (``break beats''), and those dancing at parties invented new
dances to go with it.
</P>
<P>
   Locking, which makes dancers look like robots, and its more
fluid form of dancing, known as popping, grew out of southern
California. In the South Bronx and Harlem, young men began
``rocking'' or ``breaking'' _ spinning and contorting their bodies
on pieces of cardboard laid out on sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, DJs started buying microphones and handing
them to friends at parties, so they could rhyme over the break
beats. Such ``MCing'' and breaking spread through ghettos across
the country _ from Kalamazoo, Mich., to Bayamon, Puerto Rico. Then
Madison Avenue discovered it, gave it a new name _ break dancing _
and used it to sell everything from sneakers to soda pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``People got tired of it,'' said DJ Bruno. ``The media murdered
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though breaking died, rapping didn't. It could be mass-produced
and sold, unlike dancing.
</P>
<P>
   The late '80s saw rising poverty rates; alarming drop-out rates,
especially among Latino youth; and the drug trade swallowing
younger teens. When crack cocaine, a cheap and highly addictive
drug, exploded on the scene, even more young people got caught up
in the game. And with easier access to guns, city youths started
packing them for protection.
</P>
<P>
   MCs, who had begun rapping about ghetto strife, found they could
sell more records if they rapped about the gangster lifestyle,
glorifying it like ``The Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, some veteran rappers are going back to old-school. Keith
Murray, Redman, and Eric Sermon recently got together to put out an
album heavy with old-school flavor, including a remake of the
Sugarhill Gang's 1980 hit ``Rapper's Delite.'' Rappers who hadn't
been heard of in years are starting to make a comeback, too, like
Biz Markie, Slick Rick and Run-DMC.
</P>
<P>
   Several clubs here offer break-dancing nights, including the
Lansdowne Street Playhouse, which offers Electric Bugaloo night
every Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At the Playhouse on a recent Sunday, Kenny Chung, 19, stepped
out into the circle for the first time. He showed off a ``popping''
routine: He snapped each joint of his arm, jerking his head as if a
surge of power ripped through his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to release my negative energy,'' said Chung.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing younger people like Chung get into the old-school
lifestyle makes veteran breaker Alfredo ``Crazy Fred'' Rivera feel
like there's hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, 26, spends two afternoons each week teaching teenagers
how to break dance at the YMCA in Lynn, a nearby city. He said kids
are substituting dance ``battles'' for fistfights.
</P>
<P>
   To keep himself fluid, Rivera practices with The Floor Lords, a
nationally known group that has been featured in The Source, a
hip-hop magazine. Founded 18 years ago but disbanded in the late
1980s, The Floor Lords regrouped about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent practice, a large boom box blasted music from
the stage, while Lino ``Lean Ski'' Delgado, 31, the group's
president, took the troupe through the paces.
</P>
<P>
   They restarted the group mostly for fun, explained Delgado, but
with more and more Bostonians seeking the same kind of fun, The
Floor Lords suddenly are in great demand.
</P>
<P>
   A diverse team of mostly Latinos, several African-Americans, and
a few whites and Asians, they perform two or three gigs a week at
clubs, competitions, and fund-raisers, drawing fans with their
innocent exuberance and inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Crowed Delgado, ``We even did a bar mitzvah.''

   CAMP MCGOVERN, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ For U.S. Army Pvt. John
Wilbur, the difference between Fort Hood, Texas and his new station
here is simple. In Bosnia, he has to sleep on a cot.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect this 17-year-old Albany, Ga. native, who's been
in the Army all of six months, to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can sleep anywhere,'' Wilbur says in a Southern drawl, while
downing a pizza at the Rose Garden Cafe near the center of this
camp. ``I'm in the Army ma'am.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur is one of about 5,000 soldiers from the U.S. Army 1st
Cavalry Division at Fort Hood deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina last
month to relieve peacekeeping troops from a several U.S. bases in
Germany -- the majority of a total force of 6,900.
</P>
<P>
   While canvas folding cots may be the first thing Wilbur noticed
about his new assignment, bombed-out buildings and boredom may be
what he remembers most from his tour in this war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
   If he's lucky, he may get a break from radio duty once in a
while to go out on patrols of the area. The patrols roam villages
and towns along the Zone of Separation (ZOS), a narrow
three-mile-wide strip of land that winds through Bosnia and
separates the former combatants. Armed with M-16 and .50-caliber
machine guns mounted on Humvees, the patrols cover a 9,000-square
mile area about the size of Maine to reassure the masses that NATO
will not let a war start again here.
</P>
<P>
   Around Camp McGovern, there are reminders of the suffering that
was a way of life here when war gripped this country for years.
Entire neighborhoods in the ZOS still lie in ruins. And even
several miles away, in Brcko (pronounced ``Burch-Ko''), the nearest
city, the once thriving downtown is riddled with blown-out
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. soldiers are among 33,000 NATO peacekeeping troops in
Bosnia enforcing the military provisions of the Dayton Peace
Accords which, in 1995, ended the four-year ethnic war caused by
the break-up of Yugoslavia. Immediately following the U.S.-brokered
cease-fire in December 1995, the International Stabilization Force,
or SFOR, disarmed the three combatants -- the Bosniak Muslims,
Croat Catholics and Serbian Orthodox Christians -- and began
working to rebuild the war-torn country and re-establish peace in
the once multi-ethnic society.
</P>
<P>
   That job may have been made all the more difficult by the
elections in mid-September that resulted in anti-Western candidates
making significant gains in the Serbian state that surrounds the
40-acre Camp McGovern -- one of six in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- on
three sides.
</P>
<P>
   But if Wilbur doesn't get on a patrol now and then, he may spend
the next six months inside the camp, never even getting a peek at
the local politics or the fall-out from the elections.
</P>
<P>
   He, and his comrades from Fort Hood, also may not get a chance
to see how the locals feel about the presence of U.S. soldiers
here.
</P>
<P>
   The one group that seems to make the biggest impression on the
soldiers are the children. And like so many of the soldiers from
Fort Hood, Staff Sgt. Lonnie Radabaugh worries about the children
he sees when he's out on patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the children all wave to us,'' he said during a
recent patrol. ``You wonder what they've gone through, how they'll
grow up in all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Few soldiers here who've been on patrol are not stunned by the
level of devastation. At the same time, however, they are just as
heartened by the efforts to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really interesting to see how hard these people are
working to get their lives back together,'' Pfc. John Brumley,
originally of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, said during a break on a recent
patrol. ``Every day when we go out on patrol, that's all they're
doing, working to rebuild their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   While some in the U.S. Congress argue about how long American
forces should stay in Bosnia, U.S. soldiers who have been living in
tents here since 1995 began to build wood huts a few months ago in
camps like McGovern. By the end of the year, Army officials here
expect to have the approximately 1,000 soldiers at McGovern living
indoors, just in time for the worst of the usually wet Yugoslavian
winter. (The remaining 4,000 Fort Hood troops are also expected to
move into wood huts.)
</P>
<P>
   The new officer in charge of the camp sees his mission as a
long-term one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we just pull out, then general war starts again; and if
that happens and it starts spreading to other countries in Europe,
then we've got to come back in at great risk of loss of life,''
said Lt. Col. Mike Ryan, of New York City. ``It takes awhile. It's
not just cut and dried, 'OK, the war's over, now let's all get back
together.' It takes a long-term commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern isn't the only camp to get better accommodations for
soldiers in the past few months. Once President Clinton decided in
June to extend the troops' mission, the Army started improving
facilities all over Bosnia. A permanent dining facility is being
built at Camp Comanche, about 37 miles south of Camp McGovern, and
a larger and more permanent hospital facility at Eagle Base, the
main U.S. installation in Bosnia -- located in Tuzla, south of
Brcko.
</P>
<P>
   With the extension, Army officials said they're working hard to
keep the soldiers from getting too bored, or too homesick.
McGovern, for example, has a cafe, pool hall and gym. Soldiers,
also can take college courses and participate in basketball
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   There's no alcohol on the base, or at any of the U.S.
installations in Bosnia, however, so the soldiers have to settle
for the Army's idea of good clean fun. They can call home for 15
minutes every week for free and Ryan is having a computer room set
up so they can e-mail friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of young kids, separated from wives for first
time,'' said First Sgt. Kevin Kenneally, of Killeen, Texas, a
23-year Army veteran. ``Those are the ones you have to be careful
with. They will get bored if they don't do something.
</P>
<P>
   I've told my company, all staff sergeants and below will be
involved in correspondence courses,'' he said. ``It soaks up a lot
of their time, and it's good for their career advancement.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the limitations, most of the soldiers from Fort Hood
were surprised at how well they live at McGovern, compared to the
conditions for which they were trained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as bad as what we thought it would be,'' said Pfc.
Ernest Curtis, of Austin, Texas. He said the extra pay he gets for
being in a hazardous area, and the experience of serving in a
peacekeeping mission are probably the best aspects of being
stationed in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no bad things,'' he said, pausing to think for a
moment. ``Well, there are no dance floors, no country bars and no
beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said he plans to offer Curtis and the rest of the Fort Hood
soldiers a taste of home in the next few days by raising the Texas
flag under Old Glory.

 &HT;    MOSCOW LOSING ITS GRIP ON THE REGIONS
 &HT;    EDs: For the purposes of a locator map, the city of Saratov is
on the Volga River about 450 miles south of Moscow; it is the
capital of a region of the same name.
 &HT;    For Use Saturday, Oct. 3 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOV, Russia _ The political and financial disorder of Moscow
seems faraway and irrelevant in this city on the mighty Volga
River, in the heart of Russia's southern farming and industrial
district.
</P>
<P>
   When the current economic crisis seized the country two months
ago, the regional governor of Saratov overlooked concerns of
national unity and put his 2.7 million people first.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Dmitri Ayatskov instituted emergency measures that
encouraged growers to keep their produce at home. Farmers were
allowed to sell to local consumers free of middlemen mark-ups and
other trade tariffs. The steps kept prices low and prevented
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Ayatskov, 47, identified by President Boris Yeltsin himself as a
rising young star who may be president someday, warned that if the
national government cannot fix Russia's problems ``undoubtedly the
governors will unite their efforts to solve the problems
themselves,'' he told the Cox News Service in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   The central authority of Moscow has been undermined by the
economic turmoil in Russia, prompting governors across the
country's 89 regions to usurp the role of the federal government --
and in some cases to defy it in mutinous fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a presidential aspirant, last week
that Russia is heading for regional separatism.
</P>
<P>
   Could Russia break apart, as the Soviet Union did seven years
ago? The prospect seems unlikely, according to many political
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is a rhetorical question increasingly pondered in Moscow.
The power shift has forced the new government of Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov to give regional governors -- who comprise the
upper house of parliament -- a more formal role in national
policymaking.
</P>
<P>
   Rumblings from the regions began even before the shock of
mid-August and have been plentiful amid the uncertainty and
hardships since the ruble and banking system collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Russian consumers have been faced with massive price increases
and food shortages. The unstable ruble has plunged to half its
value since the crisis broke in mid-August. What's more, recent
government forecasts now show that inflation could reach 300
percent or more by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Lebed, the retired army general and governor of the
huge Krasnoyarsk region in Siberia, sent an open letter to Moscow
in late July demanding that servicemen at an intercontinental
ballistic missile base in his district be paid their back wages.
Lebed said he was ``seriously thinking'' of establishing
jurisdiction over the base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in Krasnoyarsk are not rich yet,'' he wrote, ``but in
exchange for the status of a nuclear territory we could feed the
formation and become a headache for the world community along with
India and Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebed's younger brother, who is governor of the adjoining region
of Khakassia, was among at least six regional leaders who
threatened to withhold tax payments to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Samara Governor Konstantin Titov is building his region's own
gold reserve by bartering with the gold-producing Siberian region
of Sakha (formerly known as Yakutia), which in return gets food
shipments.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Russia's regions are poor, not rich. The number of
``donor'' regions -- those that contribute more to the federal
coffers than they get back -- fell from 20 in 1994 to eight this
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the depressed Murmansk region of the far north, officials,
without consulting with Moscow, declared a state of emergency
earlier this month and appealed directly for international
humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Already there have been pledges of food aid due to be sent this
month from Norway, Finland and Sweden designated for orphanages and
pensioners. The area has relied on food aid, which have been
falling steadily, since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, said vice-governor Igor Chernyshenko, is that
Murmansk is in the far north with a short growing season. ``Besides
potatoes, there is little that can grow here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worry is that Moscow continues its politics as usual while
the financial situation grows worse,'' added a Western diplomat in
Moscow. ``Were that to happen, I think we will see regions,
particularly the strong regions, attempting to assert their de
facto independence and the poor regions following them, not
Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, Saratov has been a region of relative
prosperity thanks to Ayatskov's tireless pursuit of foreign
investment to revitalize decrepit Soviet-era factories.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Case, the Wisconsin-based manufacture of farm
machinery, has began negotiations in April with the regional
government in Saratov on a $140 million joint venture and, in the
first step, delivered 100 combines in June. But further progress on
using a factory
</P>
<P>
   in Saratov to assemble combines are on hold amid the economic
turmoil in Russia. ``We'd like to move forward as soon as we can.
The fit is right, but the economics are not,'' said Case spokesman
William Masterson.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Saratov is an attractive place for Western firms to do
business. But the economic crisis has for now forced Case to put
its plans on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Ayatskov complains that the current crisis has cost his region
$800 million in foreign investment that now will not come. Yet
Ayatskov claims no desire for independence or more economic
autonomy, only for a strong and unified Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Like any good politician, he seems to be reading his
constituency well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of animosity. There is even more despair,''
said Lilya Chudaeva, editor of a local Saratov newspaper, Pokrovski
Vesti. ``And a lot of it is aimed at Moscow.''

FOR TOUGH JOBS, USE PROFESSIONAL TOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Ever try to get a screw into a brick or concrete
wall and have your new battery-powered or plug-in screwdriver go
kaput? You may have been using a do-it-yourself model, which is
also known as a homeowners-grade tool, instead of a high-powered
professional model.
</P>
<P>
   While there can be a 50 percent or more difference in cost
between nonprofessional and professional models, the benefits of
the latter are well worth the price. That's especially true if you
are planning to complete one or more heavy-duty projects and wish
to avoid an inferior drill prone to breaking.
</P>
<P>
   Professional-grade tools have more power, featuring bigger
motors with four to five amps, unlike homeowner models, which are
lighter and have two to three amps.
</P>
<P>
   Inexpensive power tools often are made of low-grade plastic,
which can flex when heated from use or overheat when used on tough
jobs. Professional power tools tend to be encased in strong
plastics that are rarely affected by extreme temperatures or
chemicals. They also have minimum vibration and more balanced
armatures.
</P>
<P>
   Professional-grade tools not only have a longer life, but offer
other options such as a depth clutch, which automatically drives a
screw to any predetermined depth, speed control and reverse, for
removing stubborn screws.
</P>
<P>
   Professional electric drills cost around $60 to $200, while
homeowner models usually range from $30 to $80.
</P>
<P>
   Whether to choose a cordless or plug-in drill is mostly a matter
of personal taste _ except if you are working outdoors. In that
case, cordless may be the better option, since there's no need for
extension cords or exterior outlets. Cordless may also make sense
when using a ladder, so you can't become entangled in the cord or
be thrown off-balance by the weight.
</P>
<P>
   When choosing a cordless drill, select one with enough power to
do the job, such as one with an 18-volt power pack, as opposed to a
low-end 7.2-volt rating.
</P>
<P>
   Batteries have come a long way. They now last longer and
recharge quicker. Alkaline batteries last longer than
nickel-cadmium batteries, cost less and are better for the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   When investing in a quality drill, shop around and look for
sales _ drill sales are often very competitive.

WOMEN SEEK TO CREATE AWARENESS, RISKS OF LYMPHATIC CONDITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ After Barbara Smith had her right breast removed
two years ago, she hoped the worst of her battle with cancer was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Then in June, her right hand and arm swelled to twice their
normal size.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset,'' said Smith, a retired New York state worker.
``Very upset. It occurred to me it was related to the surgery and I
thought, `Oh dear, what do I have now?'''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who lives in suburban Albany, was diagnosed with
lymphedema, a chronic condition caused by damage to the lymphatic
system, sometimes as a result of breast cancer surgery, radiation,
infection or trauma. Other people are born with the problem because
of missing or impaired lymphatic vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us take these vessels for granted _ the waste removal
system for our body tissues. They remove excess proteins, fats,
water and cell debris.
</P>
<P>
   Lymphedema occurs because of a malfunction in this system. Fluid
collects in the problem area with no place to go. Left untreated,
it can lead to deformities in skin appearance, infection and even
another form of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it develops, it is, unfortunately, a frustrating thing to
handle,'' said Dr. David Mastrianni, an oncologist at Albany
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   There's no easy cure for a condition estimated to affect some
100 million people worldwide. The National Lymphedema Network, a
nonprofit organization based in San Francisco (415-921-3186),
estimates that it affects 15 percent to 25 percent of breast cancer
survivors who have had some of their lymph nodes removed or who
have undergone radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Mastrianni said progress is being made in reducing the incidence
and severity of lymphedema because surgeons typically remove fewer
lymph nodes than they used to.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say, however that too many women still aren't aware of
the risk of lymphedema or of ways to reduce that risk. For example,
women who have had breast cancer treatment should never allow an
injection, IV or blood pressure check on the at-risk arm.
</P>
<P>
   They should also avoid activities like raking or heavy lifting
and anything that can lead to an infection, including manicures.
While doing housework or gardening, the recommendation is to wear
gloves. The National Lymphedema Network sells a special bracelet
that women can wear to alert medical personnel to the potential
problem.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to live with lymphedema, with proper treatment.
The problem for many women is finding the approach that works best.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lymphatic system is so complicated,'' said Michele N.
Keleher, an Albany-area physical therapist who practices a manual
massage technique known as Vodder, after the Danish physician who
developed it. ``Every person is different.''
</P>
<P>
   Keleher believes too little attention has been paid to
lymphedema by health professionals and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a condition we cure. It's maintained. People need
to follow it for the rest of their lives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Keleher supports efforts by the National Lymphedema Network and
other groups to implement national standards for the certification
of therapists and to expand insurance coverage for lymphedema
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who do this need to know what they're doing,'' Keleher
said of the manual massage techniques. ``You have to know where to
move the fluid, it's just not moving against the tissue.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 61, said massage has helped keep her lymphedema under
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it first happened it was devastating. It kind of brought
back the impact of being diagnosed with breast cancer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we're going to get proper insurance coverage and
the proper attention of the medical community is if this nasty
little secret is out.''

QUITTING A JOB CAN MAKE SENSE, BUT DO SOME HOMEWORK FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This might well qualify as the last thing a
career counselor would ever tell you, but here goes. In an ideal
world, you ought to just up and quit a job at least once in your
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I've heard the horror stories about people who have quit or
gotten laid off and then have been out of work for months or even
years, but I'd bet there are a lot more who quietly struggle for
years because they're afraid to just quit. It's like plane crashes
and car crashes: Plane crashes make headlines, but car crashes kill
more people.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never lost a job, unemployment is your bogeyman; you
don't know what it looks like, but it scares you _ maybe even
leaves you paralyzed with fear. On the other hand, if you've
already lost a job and moved on, unemployment is a Stephen King
novel; you're scared, but you also might be exhilarated.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean you should take quitting lightly. Career
counselors are right: The best way to get a job is to already have
a job. But if you're miserable or even just plain bored out of your
gourd, plunging into unemployment might be the smartest move you
could ever make. Here are some questions to consider before you
make the move:
</P>
<P>
   WHAT EXACTLY IS WRONG WITH YOUR CURRENT JOB?
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you've at least tried to squeeze the most out of your
employer that you can. If your pay is too low, ask for a raise. If
traffic is killing you, ask about flex time or telecommuting. If
your supervisor is a jerk, ask to be transferred.
</P>
<P>
   These tips ought to be obvious, but people often are reluctant
to speak up. Sometimes they'll conclude that a job is a dead end,
for example, when a little skill and creativity could make it
better.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't pinpoint what's wrong, you won't be able to move
forward effectively. Take a week off to think about it if you need
to, but make sure you know exactly what is wrong and why it can't
be fixed before you quit. Otherwise you're liable to wind up in the
same situation in your next job.
</P>
<P>
   ARE YOU BEING REALISTIC?
</P>
<P>
   If your workload has increased because your company has
downsized, it could be because competition has gotten tougher in
your industry. If your competitors are struggling just as much and
you're not willing to change industries, you might not find
anything better.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the job prospects in your field. Do you have the skills
that are in demand? What parts of your resume make you stand out?
Are people your age being discriminated against?
</P>
<P>
   If you're unhappy with your life, make sure you're not unfairly
blaming all your problems on your job. Talk with friends or get
counseling if you need help sorting it out.
</P>
<P>
   WILL IT DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD IF YOU STAY?
</P>
<P>
   If the stress is killing you, of course, then get out. But you
also should leave if you find yourself lashing out at friends,
family members or colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The best tool any job hunter can have is a good network. If you
turn into a jerk and lose your biggest fans, your hunt will be a
lot more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Other damage can happen if you get lazy. If you start going
through the motions and stop building skills, your reputation at
work and your job hunting prospects could wither away.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have reputations, too, of course. If people in your
industry have started looking down at your company, find out
whether your reputation will suffer if you don't leave quickly.
</P>
<P>
   WILL QUITTING MAKE YOU A BETTER JOB HUNTER?
</P>
<P>
   This just in: People are not always hired on the basis of merit.
The energy you put into the job search makes a huge difference.
</P>
<P>
   If your job is so demanding that you don't have the time or
energy to network, research companies and aggressively pursue
openings, maybe your prospects will be better if you quit. If the
people who are moving up in your field have master's degrees and
you don't, quitting your job to go back to school could pay off in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT WILL YOU DO IF YOU'RE UNEMPLOYED FOR SIX MONTHS?
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dangerous things for any job hunter is a long
gap in your resume, past or present. And, of course, there's that
little thing called poverty.
</P>
<P>
   If you're living paycheck to paycheck, don't even think about
quitting unless you have something immediate to fall back on. You
don't want to take your next job out of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Assume that you will be unemployed for months. Do employers in
your industry use independent contractors? Do they hire temporary
employees and make the best ones permanent? Are there classes you
can take to expand your skills? Do you have the skill and desire to
start your own business?
</P>
<P>
   Know these things before you quit. Don't wait until you've been
out of work for two months to figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   Quitting a job can be one of the smartest career moves you'll
ever make _ or one of the dumbest. Like most aspects of job
hunting, it depends a lot on doing your homework.

WOMEN SPORTS REPORTERS CRASH AN ALL-BOYS CLUB _ AND EXCEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETE DOUGHERTY  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In their day, George Halas and Vince Lombardi
wouldn't have bought into it. There are women in the National
Football League. They aren't players, of course, but some of them
have become as well known as Bronco Nagurski and Paul Hornung ever
were.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of women sportscasters covering the NFL isn't a
novelty anymore. All four TV networks holding NFL rights have at
least one woman in a prominent broadcast role, and not a Phyllis
George- or Jayne Kennedy-type asking athletes how they met their
wives.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, most of them are credible sources of information.
The days when viewers cast a skeptical eye on any woman talking
sports, although not gone, are fading away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am still surprised when people say, `Boy, you're a woman
working in sports, in the NFL,''' said Michele Tafoya, a sideline
reporter for CBS. ``This is nothing new. As long as you go in that
you're no different from any other reporter, you're going to be
treated like you're not different from any other reporter. That's
what my goal has always been.''
</P>
<P>
   Women are closer to that goal than ever, but it has been a long
road.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and George, both of whom showed up on NFL pregame shows
as feature reporters, were among the first, but they weren't
necessarily role models.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody remembers Phyllis George, but it never occurred to
me I could do that better,'' ESPN's Andrea Kremer said. ``I never
viewed her as any more than window dressing. I don't mean that as a
putdown, but she was a female person. She was going to ask about
the recipes and do a lot of the soft stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Genuine credibility for women sportscasters didn't arrive until
reporters such as Gayle Gardner, a former ESPN ``SportsCenter''
anchor who is out of the business, and Lesley Visser, currently the
sideline reporter for ABC's ``Monday Night Football,'' filled major
roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lesley's going to kill me, but Lesley Visser had my dream
job,'' said Pam Oliver, 37, an NFL reporter for Fox. ``I remember
watching her, she did a lot of Final Fours, and CBS had the NFC at
that time. She was really one of the early people. I never really
got into Jayne Kennedy and Phyllis George.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started in 1974, there were only four woman sports
writers in the country,'' said Visser, 44, who broke in with the
Boston Globe. ``We were the pioneers, but when you're young you're
kind of protected by your innocence. You're not really aware of
what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the idea of a woman dispensing information about an
all-male activity is disturbing to portions of the audience, which
remains dominated by men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be the first person to admit,'' said Bonnie Bernstein,
recently lured away from ESPN by CBS, ``when I see a woman on the
air, I'm listening to what she says, to make sure her terminology
is correct, her pronunciation of the names is correct, that she's
hitting on the most important points of a particular game.''
</P>
<P>
   As their numbers and resumes grew, women became more accepted in
their sports roles. A lot of the credit goes to the foundation set
by people such as Gardner and Visser, but those in prominent roles,
like any good reporter, have worked at their craft.
</P>
<P>
   They would all like to be known as reporters who happen to be
women, not woman reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting there,'' Bernstein said. ``It's kind of hard at
times because I do stick out. My hair's a little longer than most
people's. Most guys don't wear skirts unless you're Dennis Rodman.
Aesthetically, at times, it's hard not to know the difference, but
if I'm in a locker room, I'd like to consider myself one of the
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be naive to say that there still is no double-standard,''
Tafoya said. ``Women are still much more highly scrutinized than
men in general. I don't think it's as much as it used to be. Now
it's a matter of how you do your job. It's not, `Hey, let's add a
little swivel to our telecast and put a woman on.'''

</P>
<P>
   Kremer, 39, began as a sports editor in suburban Philadelphia,
worked at NFL Films for six years before joining ESPN in 1989.
Bernstein, at 28 the youngest of the current women NFL reporters,
is a former University of Maryland gymnastics All-American who was
a sports anchor in Reno, Nev., before joining ESPN as a
``SportsCenter'' correspondent in 1995. CBS hired her in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best compliment I ever got was from someone I know who was
in the Packers' war room during the draft,'' Kremer said. ``He told
me that the TV was positioned so they could see it, but the only
time (general manager) Ron Wolff was paying attention was when I
came on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that's true, but if made me feel good. I've
had general managers and coaches come up to me and ask what's going
on. I always joke with them _ why are you asking me? _ but they say

   Tafoya, 33, has been host of a sports-talk show in Charlotte,
worked as an analyst for North Carolina-Charlotte men's basketball
games and called play-by-play on WNBA games for Lifetime. She once

fill-in when Sean McDonough became ill.

   Gender slowly is becoming less of a factor for network sports
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing really to do with being a woman,'' said Oliver,
whose pre-Fox assignments included 10 years of news and sports
reporting for six stations scattered across the country. ``I
decided early on to take that pressure off myself. If you get into
this contest of trying to prove to the next guy that you know more
than he does about sports, it's usually quite brutal, and I just
didn't want to go that route.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaining acceptance by the athletes they cover is a little more
begrudging.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they admit it or not, most players watch a lot of
``SportsCenter,'' and therefore have seen a lot of Kremer, Visser,
Bernstein and the like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect their knowledge,'' said Kent Graham, an NFL
quarterback for seven years. ``They know what they're talking
about. They have the inside scoop on a lot of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Other players cling to the motto that you had to have been an
athlete to understand one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them never played, so she (Kremer) knows about as much
as a guy knows,'' said Howard Cross, in his 10th season as a tight
end for the New York Giants. ``One of the greatest personalities
they have on their show is Boomer (Chris Berman). Boomer never
played. He's funny. He makes up his own stuff. Joe Theismann
played, (Sterling) Sharpe played, these guys might have a different
spin on things. As the games keep evolving, they'll be struggling
to study film and keep up on the game themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's how people feel, it's fine,'' Kremer said. ``Being
an ex-player sure doesn't teach you how to ask a question, how to
communicate, how to write. That's what I am, a reporter, a sports
journalist. Players making the transition find what we do
difficult.''

   The job was made more difficult in 1990, when Lisa Olson, a
sports writer for the Boston Herald was sexually harassed by
several members of the New England Patriots. Olson filed suit
against six members of the organization, including tight end Zeke
Mowatt, wide receiver Michael Timpson and running back Robert
Perryman, but settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it helped women,'' said Kremer, who prefers to
call it the ``Zeke Mowatt incident'' rather than attach Olson's
name to it. ``I would never second-guess anything she did. I
haven't stood in her shoes. My instinct is you try to defuse
everything with humor, but there was nothing humorous about this.''
</P>
<P>
   For a woman reporter covering the NFL, it can be difficult to
establish professional relationships with the players. In other
words, they do get ``hit on'' occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I said that hadn't happened,'' Oliver said.
``That's where you must establish yourself. You're in this as a
professional thing, you're not there to get dates or exchange phone
numbers. You're there to cover a story or do a feature or whatever
your job entails.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of them, the love of what they do makes no obstacle too
high to overcome.``I've known since I was little that this was what
I wanted to do, and I was always told that it's going to be tough
on the way up,'' Bernstein said. ``There are going to people who
look at you with that critical eye and people who doubt that you
know what you're talking about. I've always expected that. I thrive
on that.''

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE MICROSOFT FILE &QL; 
 &UR; Wendy Goldman Rohm (Times, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   There is evil in the world, and its name is Bill Gates. That's
Rohm's book in a nutshell. It's allegedly about Gates' domination
of the computer industry, but Rohm doesn't restrict her disdainful
eye to his skill at Monopoly. ``Gates was a trickster, Hermes
incarnate,'' she writes. ``He liked stealing the fire of others,
his detractors said. According to his foes, he had no boundaries.
He was a predator, said the CEOs of scores of competing software
companies: an ill-kempt, socially inept, scrawny, insecure,
ruthless Lex Luthor.'' He also was prone to fits of rage, slunk
rather than walked, had bad table manners and a nasal voice, and
although he was one of the richest men in the world, he still had
the heart of a nerd. Mixed with Rohm's reporting on Gates'
predatory business tactics are strange passages that sound as if
they were meant to create atmosphere. Here she describes Gates on a
flight to Australia: ``Sleeping, a low hum in the chest, skin
reddened by sun, head tight, seams of the skull traced like an
etching across the crown taut with the monotony of time. It seemed
he'd traveled farther than his 39 years. Feet crossed at the
ankles, lower lip slack as if having given up: all having been
spoken.'' Did you get that? If you hate Bill Gates and can stand
some literary emoting, this one's for you. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; HARVEST SON &QL; 
 &UR; David Mas Masumoto (Norton, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Masumoto, a farmer of peaches and grapes in
California's San Joaquin Valley, wrote a lovely book called
``Epitaph for a Peach.'' It was a record of a year on his family's
farm and a lament over his struggles to market his Sun Crest
peaches, which were juicy and wonderful _ just what peaches were
meant to be _ but didn't sell as well as the flawless-looking
variety that chain stores stocked. It wasn't a bestseller but got
lots of play in the California papers and a few magazines. Now
Masumoto has written a memoir of his experiences as a
third-generation Japanese-American on the family farm. It's a story
of struggle that breeds connection to the land, of the injustices
inflicted upon the Japanese during World War II, of family and the
pleasures of planting and growing. The figure on the cover is
``hito,'' which means person. A fellow farmer explains for
Masumoto: ``You know `hito,' written in two strokes. A long one
with the other holdin' it up. A farmer can't stand alone, has to
lean against someone. Today that's the way it is.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; FAMILY OUTING &QL; 
 &UR; Chastity Bono (Little, Brown, $24)
</P>
<P>
   When she was 17, Bono told her father that she was gay. Sonny
Bono was immediately supportive. The following year she told her
mother, and it wasn't so easy. Cher's reaction mirrored that of
many parents who are initially frantic with guilt and a deep sense
of responsibility. What followed was a long road to understanding
for mother and daughter. It goes without saying that Chastity Bono
could have written a flashier book full of recrimination and sales
potential. Instead she has written an evenhanded account of her
experience coming out as a lesbian and has included the stories of
others who faced similar problems in less limelight. Her book is
spare and straightforward, without ego or flamboyance. Her obvious
purpose is not to find some emotional turning point in her own life
_ she has done that already _ but to help others who are still in
turmoil. It's a generous gesture in a book that could have been far
less. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE MILLIONAIRE NEXT DOOR &QL; 
 &UR; Thomas J. Stanley, William D. Danko (Pocket, $14)
</P>
<P>
   New in paperback is the book that probably made its authors
millionaires after it landed on the New York Times bestseller list
and did not budge for more than two years. The authors spent two
decades studying how people become wealthy and came up with a
profile of the prototypical American millionaire. He is a
57-year-old male, married once, with three children. He is a
tightwad, and his wife is a meticulous budgeter who uses coupons at
the grocery story. He owns, seldom leases, an American-made car
that is not the current model. His neighbors make considerably less
than he does. He is self-made and vaguely sexist _ he did not
inherit money from his parents, and while he's willing to help his
daughters financially, he expects his sons to succeed without
subsidies from him. Sound like anyone you know? Start saving, and
their next book might be about you. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; COYOTE IN THE MAZE &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Peter Quigley (University of Utah, $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   If you are a self-respecting admirer of the late Ed Abbey, you
have to squirm over the proposition: This is an anthology of
literary criticism inspired, writes Quigley, ``by the wholesale
dismissal of Edward Abbey in the arena of `serious' scholarship.''
In other words, Abbey's environmental writings have been overlooked
by scholars of American literature, and Quigley intends to save the
day. Here then is a collection of essays with titles such as ``The
Politics of Leisure: `Industrial Tourism' in Edward Abbey's `Desert
Solitaire' ''; ``Nietzschean Themes in the Works of Edward Abbey'';
``Edward Abbey's Inadvertent Postmodernism: Theory, Autobiography
and Politics''; and Quigley's own contribution, ``The Politics and
Aesthetics of a Hopeful Anarchism: Edward Abbey's Postmodern
`Angelic Demonology.' '' We wish you luck and intellectual satiety.
Quigley teaches at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in
Prescott. Ariz. &QL;

D'AMATO-SCHUMER FIGHT THE ONE TO WATCH IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The day before, he'd been in Rochester, pointing
out that even though he's from Brooklyn he has an uncle who
practices medicine there. Then he was in Utica, bathed in
television lights, in front of the house where his father had once
lived.
</P>
<P>
   Before he moved to Brooklyn 49 years ago, that is.
</P>
<P>
   And Monday, Rep. Charles E. Schumer was standing at a microphone
a an Albany hotel, addressing the annual meeting of the New York
Democratic Party. Vigorously, with spirited gestures, he was saying
what he has been saying every day for two solid weeks, since he won
the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate, and what he plans to repeat
ceaselessly until the general election on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been there too long,'' Schumer was saying, ``and you
can't trust Al D'Amato to do the right thing for New York.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the message _ the heart of it, anyway. Schumer talks
about his desire to make tuition payments tax deductible. He talks
about his dream that every school be tethered to the Internet. He
talks about his role as a congressman in the federal crime bill. He
assails D'Amato for assailing teachers. But Schumer's essential
message is that Alfonse D'Amato is unworthy of trust and that his
three terms in the U.S. Senate are enough.
</P>
<P>
   Like all challengers for high public office, Schumer is well
aware of the value of boredom as a political ally. D'Amato has been
in for 18 years, and people eventually stopped watching ``MASH''
and ``Cheers,'' didn't they? It was only four years ago, after all,
that fickle New York voters decided that Mario's Cuomo's three
terms as governor were enough and threw him out because they were
tired of him. Schumer's attacks on D'Amato's trustworthiness grew
out of polling that shows high negative ratings for the senator,
which are nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely that no New York politician has ever been more
bitterly disliked by his opponents. D'Amato has a rare gift for
making enemies _ a talent shared by Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon and
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Love him or hate him, nobody will ever accuse D'Amato of
inspiring indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer was not supposed to be a problem. He wasn't even
supposed to win the primary election. Geraldine Ferraro started off
with a huge lead, and her best argument for her candidacy was that
the polls showed her stealing female and Italian-American votes
from the Republicans and beating D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, those same polls showed D'Amato whomping Schumer. A
Jewish guy from the five boroughs faces a built-in disadvantage in
New York when he takes on an Italian American from the suburbs.
That's the reality of ethnic voting in a state where one in three
voters has an Italian surname.
</P>
<P>
   Then a strange thing happened _ two strange things, actually.
One, Schumer beat Ferraro. And two, the first polls after the
primary showed him and D'Amato in a statistical dead heat. Most
significant, the undecided vote was minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   So, in a contest like that, you have to go after your opponent's
less committed supporters. You have to offer them a reason to
dislike the other guy more than they dislike you. That means
running not just on your record and your ideas but also on the
proposition that the other guy is a worthless bum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are on to his game,'' Schumer was saying into the mike
the other day. ``They've heard it all before.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this approach is that D'Amato has the fighting
instincts of a wolverine. This is the kind of race he always has
had to run. The governor's race looks like a formality for
incumbent George Pataki, but this U.S. Senate contest is close.
It's already mean and it'll get meaner yet.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that, in New York, this is where the show is in this
election year.
</P>
<P>

JOYCE CAROL OATES GIVES CHILDREN AN ODE TO BELOVED CAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BEVERLY MEDLYN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joyce Carol Oates, author of more than 30 novels, 20 short-story
collections and eight books of poetry, has penned her first
children's book, a tale about an adventurous cat named Muffin who
likes watermelon, lettuce, peanut butter and rye crackers.
</P>
<P>
   Based on her real-life cat and the 4-year-old daughter of the
book's editor, ``Come Meet Muffin!'' is a guaranteed hit for
families with cats. However, the underlying themes of friendship
and getting lost and returning home to the people who love you have
universal appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muffin is an animal friend,'' Oates says in a phone interview.
``We have emotional relationships with animals that are difficult
to write about in adult fiction. Animals have their own
personalities and emotions. The relationship between children and
animals is very beautiful. The two are almost on an equal plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a larger sense, this is a fairy tale in which a child
identifies with a lost animal who is not really lost. The cat says:
`I wasn't really lost, because my house is always there.' Then he
goes home and everybody is waiting for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The book begins with the Smith family discovering Muffin
abandoned on a country road _ just as Oates found her beloved cat.
The family takes him home, and Muffin soon proves to be a special
cat with unusual markings, peculiar culinary tastes and a gentle
but brave nature.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Muffin spots two fawns in the back yard. Remembering
what it was like to be without a mother, Muffin helps the fawns by
leading them back into the forest, where they are reunited with
their mother. Unfortunately, Muffin is so deep in the forest he
doesn't know how to find his way back.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-resourceful cat climbs a tall tree, spots his house,
then scampers down and runs back to his loving family. The family
is so glad to see him it lets him eat watermelon at the kitchen
table. Lily and Muffin snuggle together, and Muffin is the happiest
cat in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The naturalistic, soft oil paintings of illustrator Mark Graham
are true works of art, with warm scenes of the Smith household that
contrast with the snowy winter forest outside. Graham's drawings
perfectly capture the looks and spirits of Muffin and Lily, Oates
says.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a sweet story from Oates, the soft-spoken, ethereal
Princeton professor known for her painstaking exploration of dark
themes in adult literature?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very personal book,'' says Oates, 60. ``I would not
have written it except I was asked to by my friends, and I wanted
to do it for Lily, who loves cats. Muffin died a few years ago. He
was so sweet, just like the cat in the book. He sat on my lap and
helped me write for years. All these factors came together.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates' friends _ also known as Lily's parents _ are Daniel
Halpern, editor in chief of the Ecco Press, and his wife, attorney
Jeanne Wilmot Carter. The New Jersey publishing house plans to
launch a line of children's books. Oates' first offering costs $18
and is aimed at children ages 4 to 8.
</P>
<P>
   Oates, who doesn't have children, says she enjoys children's
literature because of its innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read so many books as a little girl,'' she says. ``I loved
looking at them again, reliving my childhood. They are natural
stories, often about friendship and love. They allow the child to
know he or she is loved and will be taken care of.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be a good idea for adults to go to a bookstore and
look at these books, take 10 minutes out of their day. It certainly
beats reading the latest news about President Clinton and Monica
Lewinsky.'' &QL;

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Wednesday, Sept. 30:

   &UR; WASHINGTON  &LR; (``w'' code) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   Lobby II &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LOBBY-II (Washington) _ Second of two articles on lobbying: From
the nondescript headquarters of his Houston construction firm, Leo
E. Linbeck Jr., is masterminding a crusade to overturn the nation's
tax system. Once, someone like him might have hired some of
Washington's ``Gucci Gulch'' lobbyists to prowl the marble
corridors outside Congress's tax committees. But Linbeck, with
Texas-style audaciousness, wants to engineer a populist uprising.
While he and his fellow investors in ``Americans for Fair
Taxation'' are unusual in the scale of their ambition, their
methods have become commonplace as lobbying has undergone a
revolution over the past decade. Rarely now does a well-connected
Washington lobbyist work alone to persuade power brokers in
Congress. Instead, the lobbyist has become just one of many players
running full-fledged national campaigns designed to create a
``grass-roots'' groundswell in support, or more often in
opposition, to legislation before Congress. By Alison Mitchell.

bellwether, a place that votes as America does for president, that
swung to the Republican presidents during the 1980s and to Clinton
in the 1990s, and from extensive interviewing here it is clear that
people still support the president. And while they are most
dramatically divided along party lines, they are also split in more
subtle ways. Just as there is a division between Americans living
inside and outside the Washington Beltway, there is a split here in
Stark County between community leaders and ordinary citizens. By

   DEECEE-RICHARD (Washington) _ One of the most admired chefs in
the country, Michel Richard has come East from Los Angeles where

Washington into a city known for its food. It's a tall order. But

   NY-MICHAEL-JORDAN (New York) _ A restaurant review: Michael

</P>
<P>
   LE-PEU-COGNAC (Undated) _ The name Le Peu means nothing to
cognac drinkers. Yet most cognac drinkers know it very well _ sort
of. This is not a paradox. For years, the dry, delicate cognac from
the Le Peu distillery has been an important part of Hennessey's
VSOP blend, but like all spirits sold by the distillers to the
cognac houses, it has labored in anonymity, lending its voice to
the chorus. But now, some of the cognac houses are now letting
their more talented singers perform solo. By William Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   NY-SHORT-RIBS (New York) _ Why is it that some of the fanciest
chefs in town positively dote on short ribs? Maybe it's because
this unglamorous cut brings out the Henry Higgins in them. In the

the ends of the prime ribs, which start out all toughness, show
their elegant and tender side. By Elaine Louie.

   WINE-TALK (Undated) _ The constant search for something new in
wine has brought us what? Domestic merlot, sangiovese and viognier,
all pale imitations of their European progenitors. There are
rieslings from California and Washington too, including a few
attractive ones. But might it be time for the real thing _ the
elegant, complex white wines from the Rheingau, the Mosel and the
Pfalz regions in Germany, and a few from Alsace, in France. These
rieslings are the best wines to have with food, more flexible than
any chardonnay or merlot. By Frank J. Prial.

it is something normally billed as a health food: alfalfa sprouts.

COMPANY OFFERS BICYCLISTS A JOLT OF ENERGY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner

   SEBASTOPOL, Calif. _ While auto companies struggle to create a
viable electric vehicle, electric bicycles and scooters are rolling
off the assembly lines of a California company trying hard to seize
the tiny but growing U.S. market for environmentally-friendly
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about the future of electric transportation,''
said Gary Starr, the co-founder and managing director of Zap Power
Systems. ``But we're here, right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr, a former electric car entrepreneur, began Zap in 1994
when he saw the first electric bicycle prototypes designed by James
McGreen, a self-described ``transportation inventor.'' McGreen, who
is now the president of Zap, designed the small gasoline-powered
motors for the first ultra-light aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The company, housed in two large warehouses, has been making
electric transportation since 1994, using a work force of more than
50 to churn out bicycles and a skateboard-like device called the
``Zappy.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of Zap's product line are small, tough electric
motors that grip and turn a bike's rear wheel. Powered by a
rechargeable lead-acid battery _ similar to an automobile battery _
a Zap bike can propel a rider for up to 20 miles. Range depends on
how often the motor, activated by a small switch on the handlebars,
is turned on. Costs for a Zap bike range from a $375 add-on kit to
the company's top-of-the-line, $999 three-wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Zap bikes have been the company's staple, Starr said,
the company's fastest-growing line has been its Zappy scooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a real surprise,'' Starr said. ``We put those out
there because we saw the popularity of gas-powered skateboards. Now
they're rivaling the electric bicycles.''
</P>
<P>
   A Zappy is basically a heavy-duty skateboard with a fold-down
handlebar. On the handlebar is a brake and a two-speed power switch
that controls the electric motor powering the rear wheel. The Zappy
is fast, no surprise when you consider it comes equipped with same
motor and battery system as a low-end Zap bike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't make enough of them,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said his electric bikes appeal to two basic consumer
instincts: the urge to help the environment and the desire to turn
back the aging process.
</P>
<P>
   ``About two-thirds of Americans will always tell pollsters that
they're environmentalists,'' Starr said. ``Our bikes have zero
emissions, so we cover that.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said the bikes also allow aging baby boomers to keep up
with younger, fitter bicyclists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our core buyer is 45 years old, with sore knees, who wants to
get outside again,'' Starr said. ``That's what a Zap can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The electric bikes also are showing up at police departments _
about 125 departments to date _ that are using them as an
alternative to foot patrols.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been a huge success,'' said Cpl. Bob Smith of the
Sebastopol Police Department. ``The Zap allows us to get to calls
without being winded, and lets us patrol hilly areas, which makes
us a lot more thorough.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Coffrin, a bicycle manufacturing analyst and consultant,
said Zap's foothold in the American market is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   According to Coffrin, worldwide electric bike sales totaled
381,000 in 1997. Zap has sold only 15,000 bikes in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there are something like 94 companies in Europe working on
these things, including BMW and Mercedes,'' Coffrin said. ``If
electric bikes take off here, Zap will have their work cut out for
them.''

   POLO, Dominican Republic _ As I trudged up a dusty street in
this impoverished town of ramshackle wooden houses -- where 30
people died, nearly one-fifth of Hurricane Georges' victims in this
small country -- I thought about my 9-year-old daughter, Margaret.
</P>
<P>
   For most of her life I have tried to impress upon her how
incredibly lucky she was to have been born an American. It's not
that I want her to feel superior, it's that I want her to realize
that when things seem difficult in her life -- if a meal is an hour
later than usual and she claims she's starving -- her minor
inconveniences pale against the sufferings of many in this world.
</P>
<P>
   In Polo, I gathered first-hand knowledge of that suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Following me up the hill were a score of children, many who
hadn't eaten a regular meal since Hurricane Georges paid its
howling late-night visit four days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In a small wooden house I sat with a woman who had lost a sister
and four members of her sister's family. The woman's 4-year-old
niece was still missing and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   The only furniture in the house was a table and a few chairs.
The floor was a concrete slab. Unpainted walls were bare save for
two brightly colored prints -- one of a landscape, another a
religious icon. Overhead, a light bulb dangled from two wires.
</P>
<P>
   As I and another reporter spoke with the woman, more than two
dozen people clustered into the tiny room, smaller than the
smallest bedroom in my house. A young girl, no more than 5 or 6,
peeked shyly at me from around an older girl's legs.
</P>
<P>
   There was deep sorrow in this room, and fear for the future.
There was no food, no clothing, nothing to sleep on. The nearest
water must be fetched in plastic jugs from a pipe that sticks out
of a hill about a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   To exist, they eat bananas and toronjas, a green-skinned fruit
about the size of a coconut, but with a similar look, feel and
taste to a not-quite-ripe orange.
</P>
<P>
   What concerned them most, however, was the loss of the local
coffee crop. Without it, their meager income appears doomed.
</P>
<P>
   What does the future hold for them, I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no future for this place,'' a woman said.
</P>
<P>
   A few yards outside the woman's house I stood at the edge of a
fresh ravine some 20 feet deep and about 100 yards wide. On the
other side of the ravine, what was left of a wooden house perched
precariously on the edge. Six houses once stood between me and the
shattered house -- the rushing floodwaters spawned by Georges swept
them away.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy for me to tell my daughter about the poverty,
the heartache, the misery I witnessed. But that would be only part
of what I experienced in Polo, a community so small it is not on
many maps of this nation -- which shares the island of Hispaniola
with Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   What I saw in Polo taught me something about humanity and hope.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone shared the sentiments of the woman in the house.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of Polo, small stores were open for business even
though they did not have electricity. The merchants apologized that
their drinks were warm.
</P>
<P>
   At the remains of a shattered wooden house nearly covered by
uprooted trees, I paused to watch three men hammering on its
twisted tin roof. What were they doing with the roof, I wondered?
</P>
<P>
   Taking it apart to re-use it to cover another house that had
lost its roof, I was told. Nearby, a man washed off a mattress.
Further on a woman was cooking beans over an outdoor fire.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of a street, boys wearing baseball gloves played
stickball with a rubber ball.
</P>
<P>
   There are some in this town who want to escape. They want the
government to move them some place else, an unrealistic hope born
of fear. But there are many more who plan to stay and rebuild their
lives. Fernando Feliz is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Feliz, 25, sought shelter with his wife and two children when
the hurricane swept through. They emerged to discover that his and
several other houses had disappeared, replaced by a gully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do whatever I have to,'' he said of his plan to rebuild
his life.
</P>
<P>
   I'll probably continue telling my daughter that the world is
full of hardships, and I've seen some of them. But I'll also
remember, when things look bleak in my life, the lesson Polo taught
me about the resilience of the human spirit.

SWITCHING IRAs CAN CUT TAX BURDEN

   HOUSTON _ Few investors can find anything good to say about the
recent carnage in the stock market.

Retirement Account to a Roth IRA have a chance to turn the market
swoon to your advantage.

   You do this by temporarily moving the money back to the
traditional IRA _ avoiding a potentially big capital gains tax bite
_ and then converting again to a Roth IRA.
</P>
<P>
   To understand what's going on, you have to remember two tax
rules that make the Roth IRA unique _ money pulled out of the
account is tax-free if you're at least age 59 1/2 and you've kept
the money in the account for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   You pay tax on the money moved from a traditional IRA to a Roth,
excluding nondeductible contributions you've made.
</P>
<P>
   But this tax on the transfer can be reduced with a little IRA
sleight of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how this works:
</P>
<P>
   Those who converted from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA earlier
this year would have had to pay capital gains on the profits earned
on the account before the day of the transfer. Chances are the
market's tumble has pushed down the value of your IRA investments.
This means you are facing the ironic prospect of paying taxes on
profits that have melted away.
</P>
<P>
   By moving the money back into a traditional IRA before year-end,
you are basically telling the IRS ``never mind, that first transfer
never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   This reversal can be done the same day.
</P>
<P>
   After you've switched back to a traditional IRA, you have until
the end of this year only to convert it again to a Roth IRA and
take advantage of a special tax opportunity. This time around, the
tax bill is likely to be lower since the market has sunk so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be paying tax on the smaller value that the account has
decreased to,''  &UR; s &LR; aid Paul Mueller, a partner and certified public
accountant at Mann Frankfort Stein &AMP; Lipp.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if you looked at a Roth IRA earlier and decided the tax
hit on the transfer was too steep, things might look brighter now
with stocks down.
</P>
<P>
   You have an extra incentive to move quickly. If you convert back
to a Roth IRA this year only, you can spread your taxes on 1998
conversions over four years by counting the money converted as
income during that period.
</P>
<P>
   If you wait until next year or later to convert, you'll have to
pay your entire tax bill upfront for the year you converted.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you converted a $100,000 traditional IRA in a stock
mutual fund this year to a Roth IRA. If you're in the 28 percent
tax bracket, you'd owe $7,000 (28 percent of $25,000, which is
one-fourth of $100,000) in taxes, which is the tax on one-fourth of
the converted amount.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the next three years, you'll have to include an
additional $25,000 in your taxable income and figure the additional
tax based on what your tax bracket is in those three years.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say the swoon in stocks has caused the value of your IRA
to drop to $80,000. You revert to a traditional IRA _ a move that
doesn't have a tax impact _ and then convert again to a Roth IRA.
</P>
<P>
   If you're in the 28 percent tax bracket, your tax for 1998 would
be $5,600 (28 percent of $20,000, which is one-fourth of $80,000)
and for each of the next three years, you would have to include an
additional $20,000 in income.
</P>
<P>
   The tax savings for 1998 would be $1,400 because you were going
to pay $7,000, but now you're paying $5,600. Similar savings would
also occur over the next three years, said Ralph Schroeder, a
certified financial planner and managing principal at Schroeder and
Associates in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to avoid all this confusion, the law now allows you
to choose to include the entire converted amount in your 1998
taxable income and pay the tax all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Internal Revenue Service doesn't have a rule
against using this tax-saving technique that it calls
``recharacterization,'' and there are no penalties to pay for doing
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no limits on how often you can do this and there are
no reasons you have to give to do this,'' said Steve Yost, IRS
spokesman in Houston. ``But if there's future guidance put in
place, it will not be retroactive.''
</P>
<P>
   While most investment companies say it's relatively simple to
undo a Roth IRA, don't ask them to do it over and over again. The
investment companies that handle IRA accounts don't savor the
paperwork and administrative costs created by repeated conversions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Vanguard Group of mutual funds limits investors to
one reversal and reconversion for each Roth IRA they have.

THE RUSH IS ON FOR MILLENNIUM PLANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, when cruise lines began accepting refundable
deposits for millennium sailings, tens of thousands of potential
passengers rushed to ensure their participation in the biggest
parties ever at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that folks had no idea where ships were destined. Or
how much the celebrations would cost.
</P>
<P>
   Now that some of cruising's highest-ever tariffs are confirmed _
along with some lines' demand for a nonrefundable down payment
almost 1 1/2 years before sailings _ many travelers are looking to
make alternative plans.
</P>
<P>
   And so I sense an obligation.
</P>
<P>
   Not to the cruise lines: Their waiting lists are so extensive
that even at escalated prices, most will have no trouble filling
ships stationed all over the world _ even straddling the
international date line _ on New Year's Eve 1999. Some large lines
already have reaped a windfall on interest collected while holding
deposits.
</P>
<P>
   My concern is with travelers who now worry that they'll have no
place to party.
</P>
<P>
   Not to fret.
</P>
<P>
   Care to join a camel caravan to the Great Pyramids of Egypt? Tip
a glass of bubbly to a pod of humpback whales in Antarctica? Rent a
castle in Scotland or an entire island in Fiji? Or sample a special
Roman ``millennium menu'' said to be blessed _ no joshing _ by the
Pope: medallions of beef a la cardinal, Sistine Chapel mushrooms
and pilgrims pudding?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps instead of sailing around the world to commemorate the
start of a new millennium _ albeit a year early _ you'd prefer
flying?
</P>
<P>
   Or _ gulp! _ biking through 46 countries?
</P>
<P>
   Literally thousands of choices can boggle any traveler's mind.
And we aren't even celebrating in the right year; the millennium
doesn't officially occur until 2000 gives way to 2001. But that
will just provide a good excuse for a second round of festivities,
right?
</P>
<P>
   We're obviously eager to advance the calendar. But where to
start in finding the best trip to satisfy our druthers?
</P>
<P>
   Bookstore shelves already are stocked with millennium-related
guides. Among the best: ``New Year's Eve 1999: Millennium Mania''
(Open Road Publishing, $16.95) by Susan Jones and Catherine Jones
Juvan; and ``The Millennium: A Rough Guide to the Year 2000''
(Rough Guides, $8.95) by Nick Hanna.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Internet sites also point the way to the best and most
outlandish planned activities. My favorite:
http://www.everything2000.com. It's comprehensive, fun to read, is
updated regularly and focuses on information rather than sales
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   All the major tour companies have planned myriad itineraries:
Through Abercrombie &AMP; Kent (Call 800-323-7308), we can welcome the
new millennium on safari in Kenya or waltzing in Vienna;
Butterfield &AMP; Robinson (800-678-1147) offers biking in India or
hiking in Provence; Country Walkers (800-464-9255) will arrange the
New Year's Eve companionship of elephants in Tanzania or giant
tortoises in the Galapagos Islands; Travcoa (800-992-2003) invites
us to dances in Istanbul, Rio de Janeiro or Monte Carlo; Maupintour
(800-255-4266) has scheduled 28 special millennium tours; and a
travel agent could spend all day detailing other options.
</P>
<P>
   Intrav (800-456-8100) will send us around the world by Concorde
jet. The price tag for its millennium bash: a measly $70,000. For
those on a tighter budget, TCS Expeditions (800-727-7477) offers a
three-week world tour aboard a Boeing 757 for $44,950.
</P>
<P>
   Or we could travel at a slightly slower pace. Indeed, my
favorite millennium travel offering _ discovered on the
``everything2000.com'' Web site _ is Odyssey 2000, sponsored by
Seattle-based Tim Kneeland &AMP; Associates. Beginning Jan. 1, 2000, in
Los Angeles, participants will pedal more than 20,000 miles in 366
days, visiting every continent except Antarctica The marathon
journey also will include 40,000 miles by airplane, up to 2,000
miles on trains and almost 800 miles aboard ferries.
</P>
<P>
   Each cycling day will average about 77 miles, with about two
days per week set aside for rest or other exploration. Cost is
$36,000. Promoters already have reached the 250-rider limit _ with
participants' ages ranging from 11 to 81 _ but, because of
anticipated attrition, are still accepting registrations; call
800-433-0528.
</P>
<P>
   I also learned from ``everything2000.com'' the distressing news
that the entire Pacific island of Tonga is sold out for the
millennium. Why? It boasts of being the first landfall west of the
dateline, thus the home of the ``first light'' of every new day.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be too disappointed, though. Several other islands,
especially Kiribati, are disputing Tonga's claim, arguing that the
dateline has moved. Maybe a determined travel agent can find a
grain of empty sand on Kiribati.
</P>
<P>
   At home time-wise _ or at least the home of Greenwich Mean Time
and the prime meridian just outside of London _ the world's largest
dome will open on New Year's Eve 1999 with a gala whose 35,000
attendees are expected to include Queen Elizabeth and Prince
Charles.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based Millennium Society is operating on an even
grander scale, promising the biggest global celebration ever. With
the Great Pyramids as a cornerstone, satellite links over a 24-hour
period also will include the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal,
the Acropolis, Red Square and the Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Or we could join that camel caravan _ an Abercrombie &AMP; Kent
offering at the Pyramids _ and proceed to dinner in a Bedouin tent,
savor entertainment provided by dancing Arabian horses, then allow
a palm reader to project our future in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   One tip: If you are accustomed to toasting the new year, take
water or soda to the Pyramids. No alcohol is allowed on site.
</P>
<P>
   Too worldly? We'll soon discuss some of the most intriguing
millennium celebrations planned in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we could go ahead and confirm that cruise. I
understand Tony Bennett will perform in a Bon Voyage concert at Los
Angeles exclusively for guests on Silversea's Silver Cloud
millennium sailing. And travel agents can provide the scoop on all
the seafaring itineraries now.
</P>
<P>
   By land or sea, it looms as one happy New Year.

 &HT;    WOMEN EARNING MORE, BUT SEEING CHILDREN LESS
 &HT;    With CENSUS-DATA.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The incomes of women have become an increasingly
important part of family budgets over the last quarter-century,
according to new Census Bureau data, but economic progress has come
at a cost: less time with children.
</P>
<P>
   Wives's incomes amounted to only 26.6 percent of their families'
household incomes in 1970, but made up 41.2 percent in 1996, the
latest year for which the Census Bureau has data.
</P>
<P>
   However, by 1996 more than 72 percent of women with children
under 18 were working in the paid labor force, compared to 47.4
percent in 1970. The increase was even sharper for women with
children under the age of 3, from 34.3 percent to 61.8 percent over
the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly appears to be a change in family dynamics,''
Katharine Abraham, Commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics, said at a news briefing Tuesday. The session was held
to release a new Commerce Department book on U.S. income,
``Measuring 50 Years of Economic Change.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, as well as the economists and statisticians assembled
for the briefing, agreed that women joining the work force was the
most important income trend in the past 50 years. They were ``a
major factor'' in a 150 percent increase in the real median income
of married-couple families between 1947 and 1997, said Shirley
Smith, co-author of the book.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, the median income of these families was $20,620 in 1997
dollars. But in 1997, with the number of women entering the paid
labor force having tripled, the median income of such families had
risen to $51,591.
</P>
<P>
   Although many women took part-time jobs in their initial forays
into the workplace, the new data show that since 1970, the
percentage of women working full time all year long has risen from
40.7 to 54.8.
</P>
<P>
   And since 1960, the earnings of these fully employed women has
risen 54 percent to $24,973. Though their incomes continue to lag
behind men's, the ratio of female to male earnings is currently at
an all-time high of 0.74, and nearly a quarter of wives now earn
more than their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Women of all educational levels have experienced increases in
income since 1963, with college-educated women receiving the
highest hike, 53 percent, for a median income of $29,781. During
the same period, incomes declined for all men with less than a
college education. But college-educated men experienced a 22
percent hike, producing a $47,126 median income.

 &HT;    With EMBASSIES-RUSSIA-$ADV04; EMBASSIES-DATA-$ADV04.
 &HT;    For Use Sunday, Oct. 4 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After terrorist bombs exploded at two U.S.
embassies in east Africa, killing more than 250 people late this
summer, they set off demands for tighter security at American
outposts around the world and something else, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy is raising questions about how American diplomacy
should be conducted in the age of faxes, e-mail and 24-hour news
broadcasts. Some experts are asking if the United States still
needs highly visible and vulnerable embassies in almost every
nation, regardless of size or influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the world's only superpower, the U.S. needs to have a
presence in every country, but that does not mean having
full-fledged, costly embassies everywhere,'' said John Schall, a
senior associate at the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The research center, with a steering committee that includes
several former cabinet officers and former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn,
is one of two groups expected to unveil proposals this fall on how
American diplomacy could jump from an embassy system rooted in the
horse-and-carriage era into the 21st-century of instant
communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have recommendations on what we call 'right-sizing'
embassy staffs'' and much greater use of communications technology,
said Schall.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, any attempt at a major overhaul is likely to meet
with resistance at the State Department, where the policy of having
an accredited embassy in every nation has long been treated as
sacrosanct when it comes to promoting U.S. interests abroad. In
addition, agency officials argue that it is not the
brick-and-mortar structure that is the true terrorist target, but
American ``ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the deadly Aug. 7 bombings of the embassies in Nigeria
and Tanzania suggest that changes could be crucial, Schall said.
``The question is not only, 'Is the building sufficiently secure?',
but secondly -- and Washington hasn't begun to grapple with this
yet -- 'Maybe we had too many people as a big target?'''
</P>
<P>
   The United States now operates embassies in 162 countries in
addition to about 100 consulate and other smaller overseas
missions, for a cost of more than $2 billion a year. Rebuilding the
demolished embassies and reinforcing security for others is
expected to add $1.8 billion more in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, an embassy requires at least one building, a
contingent of U.S. Marine Corps guards, and a staff of up to
several hundred Americans, usually including intelligence agents
working either tacitly in the open or undercover. That's in
addition to support staff, drivers, a motor pool, and a doctor or
nurse.
</P>
<P>
   The overseas presence has hardly been reduced in the past
decade, despite the end of the Cold War and its ideological
struggle against communism that once extended to the remote corners
of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Cold War we had to make a statement about who we were
so that we could win hearts and minds'' and the votes of every
possible nation in the United Nations, said Charles A. Schmitz, a
retired State Department diplomat. That meant providing Peace Corps
volunteers, scholarships to U.S. colleges, as well as aid and
advice on issues ranging from currency to education, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now an international business consultant and president of Global
Access Institute, Schmitz is among 63 experts who are developing a
blueprint for ``diplomacy in the information age'' to be issued
soon by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a
private Washington research group.
</P>
<P>
   Embassies are ``bloated with functions and personnel'' and still
relying on out-moded cables for official communications instead of
computer e-mail, according to Schmitz. He said that the United
States has resisted new information technology that could reduce
overseas postings.
</P>
<P>
   Budget cuts have, in fact, forced the State Department to cut
its overseas personnel by more than 2,500 over the past decade. But
the total number of U.S. personnel abroad has remained static
because domestic U.S. agencies have simultaneously increased their
overseas postings -- by 25 percent between 1988-1998.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement agents from the FBI and the Drug Enforcement
Agency are increasingly going abroad to investigate crime and
terrorism. The Agriculture Department is sending more workers
abroad to push credit sales of U.S. farm products, and Commerce
Department officials assist U.S. business interests overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, these disparate functions are housed at the U.S.
embassies, such as the one in Mexico City, which has so many U.S.
agencies that it is now a microcosm of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Schall defended some of the expansion abroad as necessary, but
added, ``Certainly a portion of this is some agencies ...
turf-grabbing. There's some over-staffing, no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the ideas that reformers say would improve the efficiency,
and perhaps the safety, for U.S. diplomats:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Regional hub'' embassies that could serve several countries.
The United States has experimented with that idea in Barbados,
where the ambassador has responsibility for seven nearby Caribbean
countries. Also, the British have ambassadors accredited to four
countries apiece in Africa. ``These could serve as models for a
U.S. diplomatic reorganization in other regions beyond the
Caribbean,'' said Benjamin F. Nelson of the U.S. General Accounting
Office, the investigating arm of Congress, in a report last year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A gradual shift from full-service embassies to much smaller
and less visible missions for many developing countries, including
several in Africa. ``By having a building and making it a big
symbol of ourselves with the flag and Marines, we're creating a
hostage for terrorists,'' Schmitz said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use of the latest communications technology to gather much of
the information that was once done by embassy staff.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats ``have only just scratched the surface of what
the information revolution makes possible,'' Schmitz said. The U.S.
government could hire private services to track developments in
smaller countries, rather than posting a highly paid foreign
service officer in an embassy to gather marginal information and
relay it to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A new mobile diplomatic team that could be sent to reinforce
small missions in times of emergency. That approach would mirror
the rapid deployment forces used by the U.S. military, Schall said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Scaling back big embassy staffs such as those in London and
Paris, now that the Cold War has ended some of the demand for
intelligence-gathering.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Leaving non-essential functions to private enterprise. For
example, the United States Information Agency and other government
news operations were part of the Cold War effort to ``sell'' the
American way of life. Now citizens of countries around the world
are buying Hollywood's movies and music, adopting American clothing
styles and tuning into American television programs and CNN's
international newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   Those studying such changes acknowledged that it would take a
major effort to enact them over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in an interview last week(CQ), Assistant Secretary of
State Patrick F. Kennedy rejected most of the ideas being examined,
starting with suggestions for reducing the overseas presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see that the State Department staff could be any
smaller than it is right now,'' said Kennedy, who oversees embassy
properties and security. ``These other agencies (with overseas
officials) have a mission which promotes U.S. national interests''
such as trade assistance for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said that the end of the Cold War meant adding more
embassies, 14 new ones for the countries that were in the old
Soviet empire. As for the suggestion that a lower profile for U.S.
outposts would be a reduced target for terrorists, Kennedy said,
``That's a ludicrous concept to say that size has anything to do
with it. Terrorists attack our ideals, and they will attack us
wherever we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy readily acknowledged that his department was
technologically backward, however. ``Over half of our computer
systems, our telephone systems, and our overseas radio systems are
antiquated,'' he said, adding that they would be updated as soon as
funding permitted.
</P>
<P>
   As a measure of this backwardness, when Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright visited Moscow last year, she participated in an
interactive conversation with students on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is bringing us closer together,'' she wrote on the
computer screen, according to a news release. ``This will make us
all wiser, quicker to understand each other, and better able to
work together on the world's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony was that she was typing her message on computers that
belonged to the U.S. Information Agency because the State
Department's Moscow embassy had no link to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Updating the information systems as well as other updates for
U.S. diplomacy could be slow coming. ``You're dealing with a
culture,'' said Schall, whose Stimson Center study will be released
before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' he said. ``The State Department needs to come
into the 21st century, and it's still in the 19th.''

STUDY SAYS COMPUTERS MAY HINDER STUDENT PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Students who spend too much time trying to learn
their lessons at computers may end up with lower scores on tests,
according to a study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by the Education Week magazine, indicated
that fourth- and eighth-grade students who spent too much class
time learning math at a computer screen generally had poorer
grades. The reason: some computer time is devoted to goofing
around, according to Craig Jerald, project coordinator for the
magazine's ``Technology Counts '98'' survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might be adding a lot of aimless activities that have
entertainment value but not education value,'' Jerald said. The
study noted a 20 percent drop in test scores for fourth-grade
students who used classroom computers more frequently. Frequent use
of home computers resulted in a 26 percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also found that some types of computer training
enhance test scores while others diminish those scores, Jerald
said. Generally, the better the teachers were trained, the better
more the students learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``What mattered in technology was whether teachers had training
in computers and the way they used computers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the study said the average American school has 17 students
per classroom computer. The highest rated state was Alaska, with 9
students per computer, while Louisiana had 25. And 44 percent of
the nation's schools had links to the Internet.

BOOK VIEWS BUGS ON THE WINDSHIELD 
</HEADLINE>
 BOOK-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - Splat!
</P>
<P>
   ``Yuck.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of us, it doesn't really matter what kind of bug just
hit the windshield. We're busy with other things, like being
grossed out by the gooey mess.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Hostetler is a scientist, and scientists see things a
bit differently. Where most see gunk, Hostetler sees opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Those bug splats drew him like a moth to a flame, or a horsefly
to a Chevy grille. It led him to spend endless hours at Greyhound
Bus stations all over the country, studying thousands of bits of
mortal ooze and trying to identify what each one was before
becoming bus-borne road kill.
</P>
<P>
   And he wrote a book about it. Called ``That Gunk on Your Car,''
it's both a guidebook to identify those streaks on your windshield
and a fun look into the lives of insects.
</P>
<P>
   For Hostetler, 32, a zoologist and urban ecologist recently
arrived at Arizona State University, the book is also a way of
spreading the word.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole idea was to get people who would never pick up a book
about insects to pick up this,'' he said. ``As a scientist, I'm
interested in teaching people about the environment and the world
around them and getting reconnected with nature.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to express his belief that people should stop such
anti-nature activities as mowing lawns, which deprive bugs, birds
and other critters of habitat.
</P>
<P>
   So what initially may look like a collection of gross-out jokes
turns out to be an interesting and well-researched book about bugs,
especially the ones that are likely to be encountered on the
highway.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetler set out to make his viewpoints accessible to the
average person, especially children, by making the squished-bug
premise an entry point.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the book is a color section with illustrations that
show in high detail what 24 different insects look like before and
after their meeting with a fast-moving windshield. The captions
that accompany them are couched in a pseudo-scientific format.
</P>
<P>
   Though not for the feint of heart or the queasy of stomach, the
book certainly is informative. Such as the honeybee page, with a
well-drawn picture of a living bee and a not-so-nice picture of a
familiar-looking smear. A description of the windshield remains
reads, ``The Splat: A big white round blotch (approximately 10
millimeters in diameter) with yellow on the edges.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not too appetizing, but yes, informative.
</P>
<P>
   So how did Hostetler derive such a complete and apparently
accurate link between living bugs and windshield splats? That's
where the Greyhound buses come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hung out at the Greyhound Bus stations, and as the buses
would come into the depot, I would have about five minutes to
inspect the splats on there,'' he said. ``You can imagine
passengers are getting off the bus and the bus driver's looking at
this guy with tweezers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the flat front surface of the bus, when the insect hits,
most of the insect parts remain, and I could identify them that
way. I also had a camera and drawing pad, and I would draw the
splats, their color and size, so I could take them back to my lab
and identify them that way or have some of my colleagues identify
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way he'd identify splats was to drive his own car with a
net attached to the roof to catch the bugs after they hit the
windshield.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the net, I would hit something and say, `What the heck
was that?' and pull over to the side of the road to check the net,
and I'd know what the splat was.''
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of the book, Hostetler writes about the lives and
habits of each of the bug-splat subjects. The biological material
is written in simple terms, with occasional bouts of dry humor. So
you wind up with such headings as, ``Fun things to do with black
flies.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no real scientific merit to his work, Hostetler
concedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strictly for educational purposes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He started researching bug splats while working on a doctoral
dissertation at the University of Florida in Gainesville. His
dissertation, which earned him a doctorate in zoology, was a study
of bird life in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summer of '92, I traveled about 12,000 miles collecting
data on birds and bugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetler approached a number of publishers with his
bug-splat-book idea, but with no luck. Finally, he published it
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Speed Press in Berkeley, Calif., agreed to publish
Hostetler's books after small stories about the book were printed
in newspapers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Helping him with the design and illustrations were Rebekah
McClean and Meryl Klein. McClean, then an undergraduate student in
biology illustration, drew the detailed pictures of the bugs and
their respective splats. Klein designed the book and drew
cartoon-bug graphics that appear throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetler and Klein are engaged to be married in October.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Hostetler appeared on ``The Tonight Show With Jay
Leno.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I was portrayed as an eccentric,'' Hostetler said.
``I brought live cockroaches onto the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's working on his next book, a follow-up to ``That Gunk
On Your Car'' and a little more to the point of his environmental
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``Why the Hell Should I Mow My Lawn?''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I now have 52 environmental, ecological and social reasons to
give up your lawn mower. Again, it's a humorous thing.'' &QL;

ARIZONA TOWN ADOPTS ROCK AMPHIBIAN  
 (ART ADV: PHOTO HAS BEEN SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS)

 ROCK-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM LOWE

<TEXT>
<P>
   CONGRESS, Ariz. _ Around these parts, Rose Mary Goodson has the
dubious distinction of being known as ``the lady who fell off the
frog.''
</P>
<P>
   She chuckles about the incident now, but it must have been
frightening at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Goodson fell more than 15 feet and landed on a rock pile.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't spill any of the paint,'' she said. ``Not a
drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, we're not talking about an ordinary frog here.
</P>
<P>
   No, indeedy, amphibian fans.
</P>
<P>
   This one weighs probably 60 tons and stands (or squats) more
than 16 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   And it's solid rock.
</P>
<P>
   The frog is a Congress landmark. It had existed in its natural
state from prehistoric times until about 1928, when it underwent a
wondrous metamorphosis from rock to art.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, it was nothing more than a huge boulder perched on a
hillside amid several other large rocks. Then along came Sara
Perkins, a homesteader's wife who observed that this particular
rock, when viewed from the proper angle, resembled a frog.
</P>
<P>
   She told her husband, Eli, about it, but he wasn't as much of a
visionary as his wife, so the story goes. He was also very busy
with his work as a newspaperman _ at various times, he owned both
``The Phoenix Gazette'' and ``The Wickenburg Sun'' _ and as a state
legislator. But he did suggest that a paint job would make the rock
look more like a frog. His wife and their two sons hauled three
large cans of paint and a ladder up the steep incline, and within
weeks:
</P>
<P>
   ``Voila!'' A rock became a frog.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Perkins and the boys gave the rock a coat of frog-green
paint on top, then added a white underbelly, black spots and such
other frog necessities as a mouth and eyes. It was an instant
tourist attraction. In those days, U.S. 89 was the main route
between Phoenix and Prescott, and the huge frog dominated the
skyline as the road passed through the desert community of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Sara kept the frog brightly painted for years, and when she grew
too old to take care of it, her son John took up the task. And when
the Perkins family left the area, the townspeople became the
unofficial Keepers of the Croaker.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Mary Goodson was acting in that capacity in 1994 when she
took the tumble that earned her a mild case of infamy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it was a terrible spill,'' she recalled during a recent
trek up to the frog. ``As you can see, you can't reach the top
without a ladder, so I had to drag one up here. I fell off one
evening and landed right here, on these rocks. But I only received
a small scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodson was 76 at the time. She had moved to Congress from South
Dakota in 1980 to expand her career as an artist. In 1995, she also
wrote and published ``The Story of Congress: Arizona's Premier Gold
Camp,'' an 80-page booklet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody else had ever written a history of Congress,'' she
explained, ``so I figured I'd better do it while I had the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The work has undergone two printings; Goodson says she has sold
more than 5,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   In her account of the frog's origins, she notes that there are
two graves nearby. William Miller, who lived in the area for many
years, often asked to be buried near the site. His wish was
fulfilled after his death on Jan. 19, 1940. The second grave is
occupied by his dog. The townspeople thought it fitting that the
two be buried next to each other. An unimposing white headstone
marks their joint grave.
</P>
<P>
   And now, there's a small metal plaque attached to the lower
extremities of the frog. It reads, ``Jerry (Frog) Owens 1995.''
Goodson said that Owens' ashes were scattered near the frog but
that nobody in Congress knows why.
</P>
<P>
   The frog has been painted twice since Goodson's tumble, both
times by George and Mavis Carter, who retired to Congress from the
Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it as a church project,'' George explained. ``The
Church of Latter-day Saints set aside a day for service hours.
Everybody else went to Wickenburg to clean up the cemetery, but we
decided to do something for Congress. That frog is important to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not an easy task, painting a 60-ton frog. First, there's
the barbed-wire fence that has to be scaled, a feat made even more
difficult when the scalers are lugging an extension ladder and
several buckets of paint. Then it's a rugged climb up to the
creature, and at the top, there are few places to anchor a ladder.
</P>
<P>
   The Carters had to accomplish the feat twice. Their first effort
was ruined by vandals who defaced the frog with spray paint. So
they painted it all over again.
</P>
<P>
   The frog is on the west side of U.S. 89 north of downtown
Congress. It's about a hoot 'n' a holler across the road from the
Arrowhead Cafe. &QL;

RIBS SHOW OFF THEIR TENDER SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ELAINE LOUIE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Why is it that some of the fanciest chefs in town
positively dote on short ribs?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because this unglamorous cut brings out the Henry
Higgins in them.
</P>
<P>
   In the right hands, and with enough care and patience, these
steer ribs, the ends of the prime ribs, which start out all
toughness, show their elegant and tender side.
</P>
<P>
   For Terrance Brennan, the chef and owner of Picholine, on West
64th Street, a braised short rib is a three-day affair. One day is
just for marinating, another is for braising and a third is for
rest, to allow the meat to wallow languorously in the sauce, all
the while becoming richer and deeper in flavor. With a last-minute
Provencal flourish, Brennan tosses in some nicoise olives and
anchovy fillets.
</P>
<P>
   For Brennan, short ribs have three big charms. ``There's
texture, richness, fattiness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Ah yes, the fattiness. This is no dieter's delight: It has
about twice the calories of a pot roast made with lean choice
round. But the high fat content is part of what makes short ribs so
delectable. A lovely alchemy takes place in the braising as the
fats and connective tissue, those great carriers of flavor, slowly
and imperceptibly dissolve into the sauce.)
</P>
<P>
   At the Lobster Club, on East 80th Street, Anne Rosenzweig, the
chef and owner, sears the ribs, braises them with onions, garlic,
brown sugar, veal stock and a dark ale like porter or stout.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few minutes, she brushes the ribs with a mustard and
white wine mixture, dredges them in bread crumbs and grills them
for two minutes until they become crusty.Then she stirs three
Moroccan ingredients _ bright orange dices of pumpkin, emerald
green kale and cream-colored chickpeas _ into the dark burnished
sauce and places the ribs on top.
</P>
<P>
   The sauce points up the inherent sweetness of the meat, while
the kale and mustard add a little bite. The dish looks like
gleaming mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   At Gertrude's, on East 61st Street, Laurent Manrique, the owner
and chef, makes short ribs exactly the way his grandmother Aurelie
Frayet made them for him when he was a little boy in the Gascogne
region of France. He marinates the ribs overnight in a mix of
carrots, celery, onions, garlic, herbs and a hefty red wine, like
Cahors or Madiran.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, he sears the ribs, sautees the vegetables and
braises the meat for three hours in wine and veal stock. To add
richness to richness, he makes a sauce of sauteed porcini
mushrooms, onions, garlic and prunes, which he mixes into the
earthy, soul-warming dish.
</P>
<P>
   But not all tasty recipes for short ribs require a dozen
ingredients. Rozanne Gold, the author of the new ``Recipes 1-2-3
Menu Cookbook'' (Little, Brown, 1998), uses only three: the ribs,
hoisin sauce and zinfandel. ``Water doesn't count,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Book publishers may guess and gamble as to which title will be a
best seller. But in the restaurant world, it seems, you can't go
wrong with short ribs, especially in cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosenzweig estimated that at her last restaurant, Arcadia,
which closed in June, half of the orders were for short ribs on any
cold night. Manrique of Gertrude's placed this figure at one-third.
</P>
<P>
   When Gray Kunz, the former executive chef at L'Espinasse, added
short ribs braised in a horseradish and Meaux mustard sauce to the
menu in 1995, nobody flinched at the $38 price.
</P>
<P>
   In winter, he estimated, one-quarter of the entrees would be
short ribs, making it the restaurant's most popular dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, I wanted to take it off the summer menu,'' Kunz
said. But popular demand won out.
</P>
<P>
   Several chefs said they preferred short ribs to filet mignon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filet lacks flavor,'' Marc Murphy, executive chef at La
Fourchette, said.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Gold said, ``Eating a steak is a
one-dimensional experience _ but with short ribs, you get this
gorgeous dark color, smell, sight, taste and texture.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan enjoys lifting up the cover to peek at the barely
bubbling surface, the browning of the meat, the caramelizing of the
sauce, and to take in the wine aroma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the cassoulet, the daube, the pot au feu _ you
constantly have to keep an eye on it,'' Brennan said. ``This is
real cooking.'' &QL;

A THREE-STAR PEASANT DISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chicken with vinegar is one of the great poultry dishes from the
area around Lyons, France, where the chickens are considered by
many to be the best in the world. The story is that the dish was
first popularized at La Mere Brazier, one of the Lyons restaurants
known as ``les bonnes meres.''
</P>
<P>
   There are not too many left, but those that remain continue two
traditions: They are run by women, and they are a step up from
bistros in ambiance, service and food.
</P>
<P>
   The great chef Paul Bocuse worked at La Mere Brazier in his
youth and learned how to prepare chicken with vinegar there. Some
years later, he showed considerable audacity by putting this
peasant dish on the menu of his Michelin three-star restaurant near
Lyons. Bocuse insisted that it was neither how much work nor the
cost of ingredients that determined the worthiness of a dish, but
how it tasted.
</P>
<P>
   He taught a generation of students how to prepare chicken in
vinegar, and one of them taught it to me. The variations are
numerous, but the piercing flavor of vinegar is so dominant that it
matters little whether you use shallots or garlic, thyme or
tarragon.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, chicken with vinegar is no longer on the menu at
either La Mere Brazier or the restaurant Paul Bocuse, perhaps
because it now seems too simple. But it remains notably good,
whether prepared with an embarrassment of butter, as taught by
Bocuse, or with contemporary restraint.
</P>
<P>
   I greatly reduce the quantity of fat, and while it is undeniable
that some of the sauce's silken texture is lost, so is the guilt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One technical note: Most wine vinegar sold in the United States
has an acidity level of 7 percent; many French vinegars are just 5
percent acidity. So it's best to cut strong vinegar with some
water, as I do here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHICKEN WITH VINEGAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 3-pound chicken, cut up for sauteing
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   \ cup minced shallots or scallions
</P>
<P>
   1 cup good red-wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter (optional). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Set a large ovenproof
skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil; when it is hot, place
chicken in the skillet, skin side down. Cook undisturbed for about
5 minutes, or until chicken is nicely browned. Turn and cook 3
minutes on the other side. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place skillet in the oven. Cook 15 to 20 minutes, or until
almost done (juices will run clear, and there will be just a trace
of pink near the bone). Remove chicken to an ovenproof platter.
Place it in the oven; turn off the heat, and leave the door
slightly ajar.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pour all but 2 tablespoons of the cooking juices out of the
skillet (discard them). Place skillet over medium-high heat, and
add shallots; sprinkle them with a little salt and pepper, and
cook, stirring, until tender, about 2 minutes. Add vinegar, and
raise the heat to high. Cook a minute or two, or until the powerful
acrid smell has subsided somewhat. Add { cup water, and cook for
another 2 minutes, stirring, until the mixture is slightly reduced
and somewhat thickened. Stir in butter, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   4. Return the chicken and any accumulated juices to the skillet,
and turn the chicken in the sauce. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bocuse's version: In Step 1, brown chicken in 7 tablespoons
butter. In Step 3, add 3 tablespoons butter to reduced sauce.  &QL;

   &UR;  &LR; A: Some of the best advice I've gotten on rooting rose
cuttings came from rosarian Margaret Sharpe. A cutting, she says,
is simply a piece of stem about the size and length of a pencil
used to start a new rose.
</P>
<P>
   A cutting should be taken from wood that's not too soft and
green (as the newest growth is) or too old and gray. Look for firm,
green stems. Fall, winter and spring are good times to take
cuttings.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe says that roses root more quickly in moist sand than in
any other medium. You can start cuttings in a container of good
potting soil and sand or in the ground. If you prefer the ground,
she suggests using a hoe handle to make the hole; then insert the
cutting and add sand.
</P>
<P>
   A cutting should have at least five growth eyes, or joints. Take
cuttings long enough that you can discard the soft stem tip. Remove
all the leaves but the top ones. Trim the cutting back at the top
end to within 1/4 inch of the top eye. Cut the bottom end 1/4 inch
below the bottom eye.
</P>
<P>
   Some gardeners soak the cuttings overnight in willow water, a
solution shown by research to encourage root development.
</P>
<P>
   To make willow water, take cuttings from this year's growth on a
willow. Remove the foliage, cut switches into 1-inch pieces and
place them in a container. Pour boiling water over the cuttings and
steep overnight. Strain the willow water and place rose cuttings in
it, re-cutting the stems underwater so they'll absorb the liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Other gardeners skip the willow water and dip the cuttings in
commercial rooting hormone. Some do both, some neither.
</P>
<P>
   Plant each cutting so that three eyes will be in the hole and
two above the soil. Pat the soil firmly around the cuttings.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the bottom off a large plastic pop bottle and cover the
cuttings with the remaining portion. Or use a jar to create a
mini-greenhouse. Leave the cap off the plastic bottle to let air in
on warm days, or slip a rock under the jar for air.
</P>
<P>
   Place the cuttings in bright light, not in the sun or shade,
Sharpe advises. She places cuttings started in pots in dishes so
that she can water from the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The first leaves you see growing will be from the strength in
the stem, Sharpe says. When you see the second ones, you can
carefully transplant in the garden. Or wait a year and transplant.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q: Because of lack of rain, my roses began to dry up even
though I watered every day. I also used rose food, compost manure
and, once in a while, Epsom salt. A smaller plot of hedge roses is
still there. Can I plant roses growing in pots and transplant them
into my garden? I was going to put compost manure in first and then
mulch after I plant them.
</P>
<P>
   A: Several gardeners did lose roses and other plants this
summer. I wonder if you, however, were actually giving your roses
too much water by doing so every day _ especially if you were
watering deeply. Roses like water _ 2 to 3 inches a week _ but not
wet feet.
</P>
<P>
   Or, on the other hand, if you only lightly sprinkled, the roots
were encouraged to rise to the top of the soil and were made more
susceptible to drying in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent watering will leach nutrients from the soil, but you
don't want to overfertilize. A monthly application of a granular
rose fertilizer during hot, dry times is adequate.
</P>
<P>
   I would suggest you have a soil test before adding any more
manure. You can get information on testing from your extension
office.
</P>
<P>
   You can plant container roses at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a plumeria about 7 feet tall. It has lots of branches
12 to 18 inches long, and I would like to take some cuttings and
replant them. How would I go about this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Late spring is an ideal time to propagate plumerias from tip
cuttings, but you could try it now. Tip cuttings can be at varying
lengths as long as there are 3 to 4 inches of firm, mature wood
that has turned gray. Cuts should be at 45-degree angles. Remove
the large leaves and let the cutting dry for three to five days.
Root in a pre-moistened, lightweight, porous medium.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have heard that some plants can clean indoor pollutants.
Can you name some?
</P>
<P>
   A: The gerbera daisy has proved in scientific tests to
effectively remove trichloroethylene from sources such as varnishes
and dry cleaning. The peace lily attacks those pollutants that
cause ``sick building syndrome.'' Spider plants absorb
formaldehyde, which is released from insulation, carpeting and
plywood.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do people paint tree trunks white?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only reason I was ever given was to discourage pests.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have seven large, heavily mulched flower beds. Every
morning I inspect them, and a week ago I noticed that the verbena
in two beds were not as vibrant as they had been. Upon close
inspection literally thousands of white gnatlike insects began to
swarm. I sprayed with a pesticide. Unfortunately, all of the
flowering plants in those two beds declined. I pulled all the
affected plants and disposed of them. There are no signs of the
pest today.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the deep, twice-a-week watering coupled with the fact
the flowering plants in those two beds were dense, are reasons
these creatures were attracted. I feel deep watering once a week in
very hot, dry conditions is sufficient, especially since the beds
are heavily mulched.
</P>
<P>
   A: The flying white insects could be whiteflies, an often
persistent pest that can be discouraged with repeated hard sprays
of water from the garden hose. Aim under the leaves. Other weapons
are insecticidal soap, pyrethrin and yellow sticky traps.
</P>
<P>
   These pests suck plant juices and can give foliage a mottled or
yellow look or can cause death. They also emit a sticky substance
on the leaves, and sometimes sooty mold will grow on this. But
whatever your problem, your treatment must have worked. It is
possible that the pests were attracted to plants weakened by
overwatering. Verbena plants do like a soil that drains well and
one that is allowed to dry some between waterings.
</P>
<P>
   Good drainage, good air circulation and the correct light
exposure go a long way in ensuring plant health. Healthy plants
stand a better chance against insects and diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are several factors that affect soil moisture
levels _ temperature, wind, soil type, amount of direct sunlight _
once-a-week deep watering may or may not be enough. And water
needs, of course, vary among plants. During the worst of this
summer's heat and drought, once a week was not enough in some areas
of my garden.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to tell if you're watering adequately is to use
your fingers to test soil moisture 6 inches down. An inch of water
will moisten a clay or loam soil 6 inches down. If your deep
watering moistens the soil to that depth, once a week may be
enough. Your plants will tell you if it's not.

APPLE TART WITH CIDER SORBET 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 This is the seventh of eight columns by Charlie Palmer, chef and
owner of Aureole in Manhattan. Judith Choate collaborated.  
 By CHARLIE PALMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My sister and her husband run an old-fashioned cider mill in Fly
Creek, N.Y., just outside Cooperstown. The mill's 1889 press,
powered by a thumping water wheel, makes a rich and delicious apple
cider that has become a fixture on our fall table.
</P>
<P>
   After a day at the mill, it always seems natural to use the
cider or just-picked apples in some part of the evening meal.
Frequently, it is a main course of apples with pork or game. But if
a vote were taken, an apple dessert would be my family's choice _
and this one would be the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   It is a simple tart made of razor-thin slices of apple and a
flat disk of traditional American pastry. No frangipane. No pastry
cream. No dense apple filling. Just a thin pastry paved with a
layer of tart apples.
</P>
<P>
   All this simplicity is a little deceptive. There are several
reasons the tart tastes so intensely _ almost overpoweringly _ of
apple. First, the thin slices dry a little as they brown, becoming
chewy and more concentrated in flavor.
</P>
<P>
   I spike them with another layer of apple flavor _ the cider _
and balance it with a bit of cinnamon. The crust has just the right
crunchy resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tart stands up well on its own, I like to give it
yet another zap of apple with a scoop of cider sorbet. Because the
sorbet is made with a puree of cooked apple rather than apple
juice, it is creamy, not icy, and has a more substantial texture.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm sure a scoop of premium vanilla ice cream would bring no
complaints. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RUSTIC APPLE TART WITH CIDER SORBET &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1{ hours &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 medium Granny Smith apples, peeled and cored
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons apple cider
</P>
<P>
   { cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons Wondra flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   Flaky pastry dough, chilled (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cinnamon sugar
</P>
<P>
   Cider sorbet (see recipe). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Halve apples lengthwise, and cut each half into almost
paper-thin slices. Place slices in a mixing bowl, and sprinkle with
lemon juice. Add cider, and toss to combine. Add sugar, flour and
cinnamon, and toss to coat well. Drizzle butter over the top, and
again toss to combine.
</P>
<P>
   2. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place dough on a lightly floured
surface, and roll it, from the center out, into a circle about 9
inches in diameter and \ inch thick. Carefully lift dough onto an
8-inch pizza pan or a pizza stone. There will be about an inch of
overhang. Fold the overhang under to give the pastry circle a
double thickness along the edge. Using fingertips, crimp a neat,
fluted rim on the edge.
</P>
<P>
   3. Working from the edge toward the center, make concentric
circles of slightly overlapping apple slices, keeping the outside
edge of the slices facing the crimped edge of the dough. At the
center of the tart, use a few apple slices to make a slightly
raised rosette shape. Sprinkle the top of the apples with cinnamon
sugar.
</P>
<P>
   4. Place tart in oven, and bake until crust is golden and apples
are barely tender, caramelized and beginning to brown on the edges,
about 40 minutes. Remove from oven, and allow to rest for 15
minutes. Cut into wedges, and serve with cider sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: one 8-inch tart (8 to 10 servings). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CIDER SORBET &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes plus freezing time &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds (about 4) Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and finely
chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fresh apple cider, or hard cider
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 3-inch cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fresh orange zest
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup fresh lemon juice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. In a medium saucepan, combine apples and one-third cup of
apple cider. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Simmer,
stirring frequently, until apples have softened, about 15 minutes.
Remove from heat and allow to cool. Stir to blend into a smooth
puree, or puree in a blender or food processor.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a medium saucepan, combine sugar, 1 cup cold water,
cinnamon stick, and orange zest. Bring to a boil over high heat;
boil for 1 minute. Remove from heat; add lemon juice. Allow to cool
(for faster cooling, in a bowl over ice water). Strain through a
very fine sieve, discarding solids.
</P>
<P>
   3. Measure out 2{ cups of the apple puree, and combine in a bowl
with the strained sugar syrup and the remaining two-thirds cup of
cider. Stir to blend well. Pour mixture into an ice cream maker and
freeze according to manufacturer's instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: about 5 cups.

<P>
   MAINE -- OUTLOK. A look at how the ongoing Clinton scandal has
dwarfed the agendas of Maine's congressional delegation, forcing
the lawmakers to go about their daily work realizing that almost
nothing matters as long as the scandal continues. ``When the news
is all Bill and Monica, and Ken and Linda, you can't save Social
Security,'' said Rep. Tom Allen, D-Portland. Kane

 By RICHARD ROEPER  
 c.1998 The Chicago Sun-Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It was 1988. Romaine Possedi, a young woman, was diligently
cleaning out the garage of the home she'd just bought in Calumet
City, Ill., when she unearthed a bundle of letters written by a
husband to his wife in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Possedi wasn't sure how the letters got in that garage. The
address on the envelopes wasn't that of her new place in Calumet
City, but a house on the southeast side of Chicago. Perhaps the
couple _ or just the wife _ had moved from that locale to Cal City,
taking the letters along.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the letters were written, the husband was in
Vietnam; by the tone of the letters, it was obvious he missed his
wife terribly.
</P>
<P>
   Possedi wanted to find the people and return the letters. She
contacted the American Legion, she talked to the post office, she
asked her new neighbors if they remembered such a young couple once
living in her house. No one could help.
</P>
<P>
   She forgot about the letters, put them back in a box in the
garage.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, in the summer of 1998, Possedi was packing up to
move to Las Vegas when she again came upon the letters _ nearly 30
years after they were penned. She telephoned me with her story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder,'' Possedi said. ``Who are they? Would either one of
them like to have these letters? Was he killed in action? Or maybe
they divorced. ... Can you please help?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not going to print the soldier's name _ it's a quite common
last name, undoubtedly shared by dozens if not hundreds of Vietnam
vets _ because I haven't yet been able to track the couple down.
For myriad reasons, one or both might not want their identities
revealed in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   However, I'm going to excerpt just a few passages from three of
the letters. Perhaps the author or his bride, or someone who once
read the letters, will recognize the words and contact the couple
to help clear up the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The handwriting was tough to read. Where I couldn't discern a
word, I indicated such with the term ``unclear word.''
</P>
<P>
   (ital) Dearest Darling:
</P>
<P>
   I love you more.
</P>
<P>
   I miss you more.
</P>
<P>
   I need you more.
</P>
<P>
   For darling I love you with all my heart.
</P>
<P>
   Boy was it hot today, about 112 degrees. It's hard to sleep at
night ... That night when we got off the (unclear word), about
three miles later it was hit, and nine guys were killed and four
hit bad...
</P>
<P>
   I hate this place. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Another letter, postmarked a few weeks later:
</P>
<P>
   (ital) Dearest Darling Queen:
</P>
<P>
   I just received my mail and was I happy, I received five letters
from you ... I feel so bad because I couldn't send you anything for
your birthday ...
</P>
<P>
   What do I need a winter jacket for, I got one, my good black
one. Why don't you take the money and not get me one but go and get
yourself a GOOD ONE, for you need one more than me. Please, for me.
</P>
<P>
   Well good night honey, I love you so very much.
</P>
<P>
   HURTS HURTS HURTS HURTS HURTS. XXX (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The letters also talk about mundane things, like when the
soldier's wife will be buying a new car. And intimate things, like
the things they'll do once he gets home.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't get into details of what he's experiencing, but he
tries to tell her he's in another world: (ital) ``Boy it will be
hard for me when I get back to the USA. For it's hell over here.''
(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   And there are times when his words almost ache with quiet,
simple sincerity: (ital) ``Can you think of anything to do when I
get home? You might have to work that day...knowing how you cry I
better not come home (and then visit you) when you are at
work.''(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The soldier and his wife are probably in their late 40s and
early 50s by now. If they've stayed together, they might have
children of their own who are about the age they were when these
letters were sent.
</P>
<P>
   Or they split up. Or he never came home. This could be evidence
of a great love story, or something that was shattered and
destroyed many years ago. No doubt it is a story reminiscent of
tens of thousands of others, in cases where people's lives were
interrupted by the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   One thing for certain: Once there was great love and yearning.
</P>
<P>
   Once a young soldier wrote letters to his ``Dearest Darling
Wife.''

City, Ill., when she unearthed a bundle of letters written by a
husband to his wife in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Possedi wasn't sure how the letters got in that garage. The
address on the envelopes wasn't that of her new place in Calumet
City, but a house on the southeast side of Chicago. Perhaps the
couple _ or just the wife _ had moved from that locale to Cal City,
taking the letters along.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the letters were written, the husband was in
Vietnam; by the tone of the letters, it was obvious he missed his
wife terribly.
</P>
<P>
   Possedi wanted to find the people and return the letters. She
contacted the American Legion, she talked to the post office, she
asked her new neighbors if they remembered such a young couple once
living in her house. No one could help.
</P>
<P>
   She forgot about the letters, put them back in a box in the
garage.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, in the summer of 1998, Possedi was packing up to
move to Las Vegas when she again came upon the letters _ nearly 30
years after they were penned. She telephoned me with her story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder,'' Possedi said. ``Who are they? Would either one of
them like to have these letters? Was he killed in action? Or maybe
they divorced. ... Can you please help?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not going to print the soldier's name _ it's a quite common
last name, undoubtedly shared by dozens if not hundreds of Vietnam
vets _ because I haven't yet been able to track the couple down.
For myriad reasons, one or both might not want their identities
revealed in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   However, I'm going to excerpt just a few passages from three of
the letters. Perhaps the author or his bride, or someone who once
read the letters, will recognize the words and contact the couple
to help clear up the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The handwriting was tough to read. Where I couldn't discern a
word, I indicated such with the term ``unclear word.''
</P>
<P>
   (ital) Dearest Darling:
</P>
<P>
   I love you more.
</P>
<P>
   I miss you more.
</P>
<P>
   I need you more.
</P>
<P>
   For darling I love you with all my heart.
</P>
<P>
   Boy was it hot today, about 112 degrees. It's hard to sleep at
night ... That night when we got off the (unclear word), about
three miles later it was hit, and nine guys were killed and four
hit bad...
</P>
<P>
   I hate this place. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Another letter, postmarked a few weeks later:
</P>
<P>
   (ital) Dearest Darling Queen:
</P>
<P>
   I just received my mail and was I happy, I received five letters
from you ... I feel so bad because I couldn't send you anything for
your birthday ...
</P>
<P>
   What do I need a winter jacket for, I got one, my good black
one. Why don't you take the money and not get me one but go and get
yourself a GOOD ONE, for you need one more than me. Please, for me.
</P>
<P>
   Well good night honey, I love you so very much.
</P>
<P>
   HURTS HURTS HURTS HURTS HURTS. XXX (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The letters also talk about mundane things, like when the
soldier's wife will be buying a new car. And intimate things, like
the things they'll do once he gets home.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't get into details of what he's experiencing, but he
tries to tell her he's in another world: (ital) ``Boy it will be
hard for me when I get back to the USA. For it's hell over here.''
(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   And there are times when his words almost ache with quiet,
simple sincerity: (ital) ``Can you think of anything to do when I
get home? You might have to work that day...knowing how you cry I
better not come home (and then visit you) when you are at
work.''(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The soldier and his wife are probably in their late 40s and
early 50s by now. If they've stayed together, they might have
children of their own who are about the age they were when these
letters were sent.
</P>
<P>
   Or they split up. Or he never came home. This could be evidence
of a great love story, or something that was shattered and
destroyed many years ago. No doubt it is a story reminiscent of
tens of thousands of others, in cases where people's lives were
interrupted by the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   One thing for certain: Once there was great love and yearning.
</P>
<P>
   Once a young soldier wrote letters to his ``Dearest Darling
Wife.''

<P>
   &UR; Abbondanza in a Jar: Pasta Sauces With a Twist &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pasta sauce in a jar has been a pantry staple for decades, and
there seems no end to the new ones that are introduced every year.
Some recent additions are well worth keeping on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Boscovivo, an Italian truffle company, has produced a line, Le
Ricette di Caterina, referring, of course, to that Renaissance food
maven Catherine de' Medici. These imports are meaty, tomato-based,
Tuscan-style sauces.
</P>
<P>
   They are not made with the mingy bits of meat one often finds in
so-called meat sauces but are thick with wild boar, hare, duck or
venison. The wild boar _ cinghiale _ is my hands-down favorite.
Agata &AMP; Valentina, 1505 First Avenue (79th Street) in New York
City, carries this brand for $6.99 for a small jar, about five
ounces. It's plenty of sauce to dress two portions of pappardelle.
</P>
<P>
   The well-made Patsy's brand, from the Manhattan restaurant, now
has an amatriciana sauce, with bacon, prosciutto, tomatoes and
onions, a classic that originated in the town of Amatrice, near
Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Stock up on bucatini, the thick spaghetti usually paired with
amatriciana. And you'll need pecorino, not Parmesan, for grating.
The sauce is at Food Emporiums for $4.99 for 16 ounces and $8.99
for 32 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Lidia's is a new line of sauces made according to the recipes of
Lidia Bastianich, the Manhattan chef and restaurateur. All are
tomato-based and well seasoned with a fresh, light taste, excellent
on ravioli or even to brush on fish.
</P>
<P>
   Simple tomato and basil, all'ortolana with vegetables, and
slightly sharper capricciosa are each $7.99 for 26 ounces at
Citarella, 2135 Broadway (75th Street) and 1313 Third Avenue (75th
Street). They are also sold at Kings Super Markets in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   From Spain comes Ferrer Catalonian-style fried-tomato sauce:
silken and ruddy, on the thin side but with great depth of complex,
nutty flavor, thanks to finely pulverized almonds and hazelnuts.
It's the perfect sauce for angel-hair pasta. At Fairway, 2127
Broadway (74th Street) and 2328 Twelfth Avenue (132nd Street), a
12-ounce jar is $2.49. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Luxe Italian Sandwiches &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Terramare, 152 East 79th Street, may have the look of a typical
sandwich shop and cafe, but this new branch of the original
Terramare, 22 East 65th Street, sells more than mozzarella and
tomatoes on focaccia.
</P>
<P>
   The menu includes luxurious combinations like truffled cheese
and ham; smoked tuna with tomatoes, and bresaola with arugula and
truffle oil, $5.50 to $7.75. And like its parent to the south, it
sells caviar, smoked fish and truffle products. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Ecce Panis Plans &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The original Ecce Panis bakery has closed and has been replaced
by a shop just a few doors north, at 1126 Third Avenue (66th
Street). There is also a new branch of Ecce Panis at 434 Avenue of
the Americas (10th Street), and in about a week another one is to
open at 5 World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   The chain has also introduced some new items, including a
decadent streusel-topped raisin bun ($1.75), dense low-fat spelt
bread ($8) and bread crumbs ($3 for 12 ounces) in three flavors:
rustic with salt and pepper, Tuscan with herbs and garlic, and
Provencal with garlic, herbs, salt and pepper. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Tasty Coffeecakes &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Buttery, moist, lightly spiced coffeecakes from My Grandma's
Coffee Cake of Boston are now being sold at several D'Agostino
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   And there are two new flavors: excellent New England blueberry
made with maple syrup, and banana walnut. At some D'Agostino
markets, the original cinnamon with or without walnuts is $13.95;
the new flavors and the Granny Smith apple and golden raspberry
flavors are $15.95.
</P>
<P>
   They are available in Manhattan at 1031 First Avenue (56th
Street), 966 First Avenue (53d Street), 1233 Lexington Avenue (83rd
Street), 1074 Lexington Avenue (75th Street) and 790 Greenwich
Street (Bethune Street), and in Westchester County, N.Y., in the
Rye Brook Plaza, Rye Brook. They are also sold in Manhattan at
Oppenheimer Meats, 2606 Broadway (99th Street). &QL;

   LOBBY-II (Washington) _ Second of two articles on lobbying: From
the nondescript headquarters of his Houston construction firm, Leo
E. Linbeck Jr., is masterminding a crusade to overturn the nation's
tax system. Once, someone like him might have hired some of
Washington's ``Gucci Gulch'' lobbyists to prowl the marble
corridors outside Congress's tax committees. But Linbeck, with
Texas-style audaciousness, wants to engineer a populist uprising.
While he and his fellow investors in ``Americans for Fair
Taxation'' are unusual in the scale of their ambition, their
methods have become commonplace as lobbying has undergone a
revolution over the past decade. Rarely now does a well-connected
Washington lobbyist work alone to persuade power brokers in
Congress. Instead, the lobbyist has become just one of many players
running full-fledged national campaigns designed to create a
``grass-roots'' groundswell in support, or more often in
opposition, to legislation before Congress. By Alison Mitchell.

SCIENTISTS DEVELOP TEST TO DETECT PROTEIN IN MAD COW DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A test for the renegade protein believed to
cause mad cow disease and its human counterpart has been developed
at the University of California at San Francisco, paving the way
for possible large-scale screening of blood, meat and other
products.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers, writing in the October issue of the journal Nature
Medicine, describe a relatively simple way to detect prions.
</P>
<P>
   Prions are the mutated proteins responsible for the outbreak of
the disease in the United Kingdom that led to panic and a ban on
exports of British beef. Prions also are believed to cause a human
illness, Cruetzfeldt-Jakob disease, in which holes like those in
sponges appear in the brain, leading to dementia and death.
</P>
<P>
   Prions can be infectious, but scientists believe they also can
arise spontaneously and from genetic mutations.
</P>
<P>
   Centeon Llc., a King of Prussia, Pa., company that helped
support the San Francisco research, owns the license for the
testing technology. A spokesman for the company said more
scientific work is needed before the test could become a commercial
product.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the company intends to use it only to screen its own
blood plasma products, but it might collaborate with a diagnostic
testing company on other uses, such as for slaughterhouses or blood
banks that may want to test for the protein.
</P>
<P>
   There are no known cases of someone being infected with a prion
disease from infected blood.
</P>
<P>
   However, two dozen cases of human disease in the United Kingdom
are believed to be linked to eating tainted beef. At least another
61 cases worldwide were traced to a bad batch of brain tissue that
formed the basis of a product used in neurosurgery.
</P>
<P>
   Detecting the deadly protein has been frustrating because the
body's immune system doesn't manufacture antibodies that recognize
the mutant forms, which are folded to hide the part of the
structure that the immune system recognizes. Antibodies are the
typical way to screen for infectious agents.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, testing for prions meant taking samples from
suspected victims, transplanting the material into the brains of
lab animals and waiting to see if they develop the disease _ a
process that takes two to six months.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California at San Francisco test shows results
in about eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   First, an antibody is used to determine how much of the harmless
form of the protein in a tissue. Then a salt is added to the
solution, causing both the prion and the harmless protein to
unfold. The amount of protein in that solution is then measured. If
it is significantly more than the original amount, scientists know
the mutant form is also present.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds pretty obvious, but it took us a long time'' to
figure out all the steps, said Fred E. Cohen, part of the research
team led by Jiri Safar and Stanley B. Prusiner, who won the Nobel
Prize last year for his discovery of prions.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists also say they have further proof that there are
at least eight different strains of prions, all with the same
chemical structure but slightly different folding patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The different forms may represent different incubation periods
for the disease. It is known that some forms don't show up for many
years after infection.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that the body's own clean-up system, which would
flush out the harmful protein, reacts in varying degrees to the
different forms. That suggests that scientists could develop
treatments for prion diseases by harnessing that natural cleaning
system, Cohen said.

A MODERN-DAY TALE OF HEAVEN AND HELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Computer graphics technology has been put to all
kinds of silly cinematic uses in recent years. Think last summer's
dueling space rock movies. Think ``Godzilla.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, creating multiple visions of heaven and hell
seems _ make that is _ a much more uplifting purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``What originally drew me in was the idea of using the
technology for making something other than an explosion, an alien
or a dinosaur,'' says Robin Williams, who plays a recently deceased
doctor wandering vivid afterlife environments in the
soul-searching, new feature film ``What Dreams May Come.'' ``That,
combined with the emotional journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was a challenge trying to keep emotionally alive in the
face of all these special effects,'' adds Williams, who had to play
heart-wrenching scenes against backdrops of floating cities and
battleship graveyards _ that were created months after his
performance by complicated, work-intensive computer programs.
``When you're standing in a field full of orange balls, it's hard
to be in a state of catharsis. It's some sort of Method hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as hard, though, as creating a hell, and its opposite, that
could credibly translate the ideas of Richard Matheson's source
novel to the screen. Since making a cult hit out of Matheson's
``Somewhere in Time'' two decades ago, producer Stephen Simon has
been trying to turn his friend's novel into a movie.
</P>
<P>
   But Simon and his producing partner Barnet Bain not only had to
wait for CG technology to advance to a point where it could realize
the story's celestial dreamscapes. They had to find a director who
had a persuasive inkling of what the afterlife should look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conceit of the movie is that you create your own
post-death reality,'' Simon says. ``And the script (by Ron Bass,
the superhot scripter of ``Waiting to Exhale'' and ``My Best
Friend's Wedding''), as wonderful as it was, did not distinguish
your picture from my picture, or anybody else's.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it was a question of whose paradise would define
a $75 million production that would obviously have to appeal to a
wide range of people. People who, inevitably, would have varying
views on life after death.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand director Vincent Ward didn't have a clue at first.
Trained as a painter and known for such visually striking,
metaphysically themed romances as ``Navigator'' and ``Map of the
Human Heart,'' he was initially flummoxed by the story _
essentially, a kind of contemporary ``Orpheus'' in which Williams'
spirit tries to retrieve that of his suicide wife's (Annabella
Sciorra) from a psychic purgatory of her own making.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in telling personal stories about individual
experiences, and I try to present them in an individual way,'' says
Ward. ``So I like to craft worlds for my central characters that
don't just relate to objective reality, but are also very much
emotional and psychological landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was faced, here, with a screenplay that I loved. But I
didn't know how you create heaven and hell in the 20th century. I
wanted to make it a visceral experience for people, and after about
a month of thinking about it, I came up with the idea of making
(Sciorra's character) a painter and art restorer.''
</P>
<P>
   That led fairly naturally _ as Williams' character passes
through various stages of death, then through other beings'
afterworlds _ to a digital display of art motifs.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor awakens from his coma, for example, in an
impressionist-inspired field of brightly colored flowers that
squish into oily swirls. When disorientation and panic grip him, he
finds himself atop awesome mountains that, according to Ward, evoke
``romantic German painting of the 19th century, a particular look
that was tempestuous, lonely, when man was smaller than nature. All
of that seemed to serve a story about a man who's in paradise, but
his paradise is hell without the woman he loves.''
</P>
<P>
   A younger spirit's heaven resembles the warmly colorful fantasy
paintings of magazine artist Maxfield Parrish. A stairway to heaven
was influenced by a John Martin engraving, while medieval woodcuts
and Gustave Dore's infernal etchings informed some of the film's
darker dimensions. The ship's graveyard, Ward admits, ``was just an
image I had in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of these fantastic realms required a year and a half's
worth of programming and virtual artistry _ Ward reckons it took
between nine and 20 man hours of post-production to create every
four seconds of CG footage. For many of the eye-popping sequences,
a process called Lidar was employed. Designed for military mapping
purposes, the laser range-finding technology supplied data that
could be used to reconstruct, in a computer, acres of footage (the
orange balls Williams mentioned were used as plotting points).
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the camerawork to be like a documentary in paradise
but look like a painting, so I could just move anywhere, be
hand-held, be shot from water, whatever,'' Ward explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer was to shoot (the live action) during the day, then
have the Lidar crew come in at night and map the area
three-dimensionally. The two shots would be married together
digitally later on, and then you could change all the elements you
liked. If you were adding computer-generated flowers or anything
like that, it gave you a terrain in three dimensions that you could
move through and change perspectives in.''
</P>
<P>
   All very high tech. But the digital wizardry also inspired some
very human, humorous moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every morning I'd come and take all my clothes off and these
two guys would put dots, like Band-Aids, all over my body,''
explains Cuba Gooding Jr., who plays a kind of celestial
orientation guide who initially appears as a kind of humanoid blur.
``Then I'd put a mesh around my waist and that's how I'd do the
scene. We did this scene where I had to walk into this Baptist
church full of people at 4 in the morning. They were going, `This
boy ain't got no clothes on!' That was pretty funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Less humorous for Gooding, who is a born-again Christian, were
the film's decidedly nontraditional concepts. But after insisting
on a dialogue change or two, he was able to reconcile the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the positive message that was coming from the movie, no
matter what your religious background,'' the Oscar-winning ``Jerry
Maguire'' actor says. ``I do believe there is a heaven, I do
believe there is a hell, they're both very real. But the Bible says
that `in my house there are many mansions,' and in essence I think
that means that heaven and hell are what we imagine them to be. A
movie making that statement is something that I supported.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon and Bain, whose company, Metafilmics, is dedicated to
producing films with spiritual themes, say they hope ``Dreams''
will spark debate among viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a test screening, we walked out to the parking lot and
five people who had seen the film were having a really heated
argument about aspects of the film, how it conflicted or conformed
to their belief systems,'' Simon recalls. ``They were really,
really going after each other. Barnet and I looked at each other
and said, `We did our job.' This film provides no answers. It asks
a lot of questions, which the audience can then determine for
themselves when they go home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Metafilmics was set up with a view to bringing to an audience
stories that inspire, that empower, that model relationships that
give folks greater insight into the choices they make and how they
behave,'' adds producer Bain, whose screenwriting credits range
from a British ``Carry On'' comedy to a film about Jesus.
``Metafilmics makes films about utopian futures. We have a history,
for a lot of years now, of making big, epic spectacles about
dystopias, about post-apocalyptic futures. Our company is really
about putting an end to this kind of existential, romantic,
tortured artist vision of life.''
</P>
<P>
   But will it sell?
</P>
<P>
   ``This genre has the best track record of commerciality that
there is,'' Simon says of positive fantasy films. ``They just don't
make enough of 'em. If you make `Ghost,' it's an extraordinary
success, but there's no follow-up to it. You make `Die Hard,'
you're gonna make 30 imitators. But the industry is starting to
recognize that there is a hunger in the audience for movies that
really look upon our humanity as being not debauched, but something
really beautiful and extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen to that. Of course, statements like these leave the
Metafilmics guys open to charges of excessive New Aginess. But
they're as serene as producers can get about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what? Maybe it's good, maybe it's not good, but we
are the New Age filmmakers,'' Barnet reckons. ``To have your work
reflect the biggest, most passionate questions of your life and
your relationships is terrific. To hide from it because somebody's
going to take a potshot? Look, they're going to take potshots
anyway. We might as well be out there and doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd add one word,'' Simon, always in touch with his inner
producer, says. ``If they're going to call us New Age filmmakers, I
hope they add the word `successful'.''

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ CBS will offer its best (``To Have &AMP; to Hold'')
and worst (``Maggie Winters'') new shows of the season tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ABC's newcomer, ``The Secret Lives of Men,'' is a
misnomer. If this is what these men are keeping secret, they must
lead pretty boring lives.
</P>
<P>
   The true battle of Wednesday nights on the new fall schedule is
yet to come. Next month, the WB and Fox duke it out for the
18-to-34-year-old audience.
</P>
<P>
   The WB is moving ``Dawson's Creek'' to take on ``Beverly Hills,
90210,'' which should have some renewed energy with the return of
Dylan McKay (Luke Perry) at 8 p.m. An hour later, classy drama
``Party of Five'' will be challenged by ``Charmed,'' a brand-new
show on the WB that features two former Fox stars _ Shannen Doherty
and Alyssa Milano.
</P>
<P>
   Those strong performances do not bode well for the weaker
offerings debuting tonight: &QL; 
TO HAVE &AMP; TO HOLD &QC;
</P>
<P>
   While the battle of the sexes is not exactly new ground on
television, it's the fresh take on the subject that makes ``To Have
&AMP; to Hold'' stand out.
</P>
<P>
   A romantic comedy about an Irish family in the Boston-area burg
of Dorchester, Mass., ``To Have &AMP; to Hold'' does a great job
exploring the dynamic of a close-knit family, the McGrails.
</P>
<P>
   The central characters in this Irish family are Annie Cornell
(Moira Kelly) and Sean McGrail (Jason Beghe). She is an earnest
public defender, and he is a Boston police detective. They agree on
nothing except their love for each other. But their arguments may
be the best part of the show, because, boy, do they know how to
make up.
</P>
<P>
   Sean has three brothers _ two cops and a firefighter, the latter
married to Annie's sister.
</P>
<P>
   These are not sanitized television types. They drink, they make
mistakes, they argue over who made the mistakes. The show, created
by promising television newcomer Joanne Waters, is well-written and
stocked with some extremely likable characters.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Annie wants to help free people who are arrested
and Sean wants them in jail is a major point of conflict. Their
differences promise to be fodder for plenty of head butting in the
weeks to come.
</P>
<P>
   Sean and Annie are married by the end of the first episode, and
they could be together _ fighting and making up _ for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The show: ``To Have &AMP; to Hold.''
</P>
<P>
   What: A romantic comedy focusing on a public defender and a cop
that gives keen insight into family life, blue-collar Boston and
the differences between the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   The stars: Moira Kelly, Jason Beghe, Jason Wiles, Stephen Lee,
Stephen Largay, Fionnula Flanagan.
</P>
<P>
   Where: CBS (Channel 2).
</P>
<P>
   When: 9 p.m. Wednesdays.
</P>
<P>
   Our rating: 4 Stars. &QL; 
MAGGIE WINTERS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Faith Ford should have taken some time off between ``Murphy
Brown'' and her next television project, or at least held out for
something better than ``Maggie Winters.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who played Corky on ``Murphy Brown,'' comes back as Maggie
Winters, once voted ``The Girl Most Likely to Succeed'' at
Shelbyville (Ind.) High School. Maggie fails. Her marriage ends
because her husband cheated on her with her own dental hygenist,
and she decides to leave the big city and return home.
</P>
<P>
   There she's reunited with old friends, whom we find out were
``Most Likely to Breed,'' ``Most Likely to Snap,'' ``Big Man on
Campus'' and ``Most Likely to Have Actual Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   All of these people are suspended in adolescence, and it doesn't
take long for Maggie to fall into their foolish, buffoonish ways _
leading the ``Walk Like an Egyptian'' dance, gossiping about who
like-likes who. Her character is too fragile, too excitable, too
shrill.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows if Tom Wolfe was right when he said, ``You can't go
home again.'' All this show proves is that, if you do go home
again, don't make a TV series about it.
</P>
<P>
   The show: ``Maggie Winters.''
</P>
<P>
   What: The girl voted ``Most Likely to Succeed'' didn't and comes
back home to rejoin her friends, who are still acting like
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The stars: Faith Ford, Shirley Knight, Jenny Robertson, Alex
Kapp Horner, Brian Haley, Clea Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Where: CBS (Channel 2).
</P>
<P>
   When: 8:30 p.m. Wednesdays.
</P>
<P>
   Our rating: 2 Stars. &QL; 
THE SECRET LIVES OF MEN &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Call me crazy, but I like my comedies to be funny. ``The Secret
Lives of Men'' isn't.
</P>
<P>
   The show is about three golfing buddies who are freshly divorced
and offer no more evidence why they would even be friends, let
alone spend seemingly every waking hour together. There is Andy
(Mitch Rouse), the goofy one; Phil (Brad Whitford), the bitterly
cynical one who claims he is nearly devoid of feelings; and Michael
(Peter Gallagher), the son of a mobster and one of the great
catches in New York who can't seem to find anyone he likes as much
as his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   If they have any secrets worth telling, we don't find them out
in the pilot episode. They also don't say many funny things.
</P>
<P>
   This is an utterly disappointing program, much like the
similarly named ``Men Behaving Badly,'' which couldn't live up to
its title, either.
</P>
<P>
   The show: ``The Secret Lives of Men.''
</P>
<P>
   What: A comedy short on comedy about three divorced golfing
buddies.
</P>
<P>
   The stars: Brad Whitford, Peter Gallagher, Mitch Rouse,
Christine Dunford.
</P>
<P>
   Where: ABC (Channel 7).
</P>
<P>
   When: 9:30 p.m. Wednesdays.
</P>
<P>
   Our rating: 1 Star.

CBS' `MAGGIE': PLEASANT, CUTE AND FORGETTABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wednesday night is the TV season in a pea pod. Three more new
series, none of them bad, all of them worthy of emphatic shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   The three are to be recorded as ``Maggie Winters'' (8:30 p.m. on
CBS), ``To Have and to Hold'' (9 p.m. on CBS) and ``The Secret
Lives of Men'' (9:30 p.m. on ABC).
</P>
<P>
   ``Maggie Winters'' is custom-built for Faith Ford, the former
Corky Sherwood of ``Murphy Brown.'' She's still button cute, and
she still has that flighty voice that wobbles like an amusement
park ride.
</P>
<P>
   (Wait. Still this, still that? What am I saying? Ford's been
gone from TV for, lo, these four months. She's supposed to be a
baritone now?)
</P>
<P>
   The show's premise is that her husband cheated with a dental
hygienist, so Maggie (Ford) bolts the city, returns to her Indiana
hometown and moves back in with her well-meaning but dim-bulbed
mother (Shirley Knight). Though she's 30-something, Maggie appears
destined to repeat the social life she knew in high school, and
mainly with the same people.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is peppy and likable almost to the endearing threshold,
Clea Lewis is a scene-stealer as a former classmate who's still
nursing a grudge against Maggie, and they have a sparkling scene
together Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, ``Maggie Winters'' seems ready to take its place as a
show that's as easy to forget as it is easy to watch. And when you
depend on ``The Nanny'' as a lead-in, well, there'll be a heap of
forgetting.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Have and to Hold'' is tethered even more perilously to
survival, with ``The Nanny'' (set ital)and(end ital) ``Maggie
Winters'' as lead-ins.
</P>
<P>
   It's a romantic comedic drama in which public defender Annie
Cornell (Moira Kelly) and Boston police detective Sean McGrail
(Jason Beghe) are headed to the altar after a fractious pit stop at
the bench. As in court, that is, because the two find themselves in
opposite corners of the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try not to violate any more constitutional rights while I'm
gone, or I'll slap you with a subpoena,'' she tells him, moments
after they were about to slap their bodies into something better
than a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Like several other series this fall _ it's a mini-trend _ ``To
Have and to Hold'' has something of an Irish Catholic flavor,
particularly in its neighborhood story lines and in Sean's
broad-brogued mother (Fionnula Flanagan). I'm not sure, but I'm
guessing Flanagan isn't Swedish.
</P>
<P>
   And like far too many shows this fall, ``To Have and to Hold''
consumes time painlessly but isn't quite all there. The script is
all right but not flashy, and the chemistry between Kelly and Beghe
is conspicuously active but not explosive.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly (``Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me'') is what's closest to
perfection about the show. She's alternately glamorous and earthy,
and all within the tight confines of one cohesive woman.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, this might have been a more interesting show with
Kelly's character alone. They'd have had to call it ``To Have.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first thing to know about ABC's ``The Secret Lives of Men''
is that it's conceived, written and produced by a woman, Susan
Harris (``Soap,'' ``The Golden Girls'').
</P>
<P>
   The next thing to know is that it's based on a fallacy _ that
men have secret lives.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Harris for the vote of confidence. But plug in to
men's thoughts and you pretty much get a dull parade of sports
stats, absurd sexual fantasies, vacant lots and, sometimes,
ill-founded political biases.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and that all-important trump thought: Is my car broke? Face
it, anything beyond the basics is a gift.
</P>
<P>
   The golf course and a Manhattan restaurant are the hangouts for
Michael (Peter Gallagher), Phil (Brad Whitford) and Andy (Mitch
Rouse), three divorced males who seem to be pushing 40. And who
talk a lot; Harris' shows are always talkative.
</P>
<P>
   I'll give ``The Secret Lives of Men'' credit for stepping
outside the respective sitcom hells of the domestic comedy and the
office comedy, and for at least purporting to be (set
ital)about(end ital) something.
</P>
<P>
   But I just watched an episode, next week's, I think, which opens
with Phil's open admission of impotence, followed by Michael's
confession that he, too, sometimes tails southwest when he's aiming
for northeast.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to say a word about this mirthful topic and the
conversation in the show. No, sorry, two words: Fat chance. Men
might keep a few secrets, after all.

<P>
   The hamburger is absurd.
</P>
<P>
   The massive round of chopped prime sirloin rides an enormous
bun, looking more like an inflated basketball than anything a sane
person would try to bite into. Even Michael Jordan would be hard
pressed to eat it in a single sitting.
</P>
<P>
   But big food is exactly what you expect, the obvious cliche in a
restaurant named for probably the world's most famous sports
celebrity. There is, however, a surprise: It is the only cliche.
Everything else about Michael Jordan's the Steak House N.Y.C. plays
against type.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and his partners, Penny and Peter Glazier, have done
something remarkable: They have invented a new kind of celebrity
restaurant. At first you find yourself wending your way through the
obligatory souvenir shop with its T-shirts and steak knives, and it
seems like all the rest.
</P>
<P>
   But then you enter the dining room and realize that there are no
photographs of Jordan, no basketballs, no memorabilia of any kind.
The waiters approach, and their old-fashioned solicitude is not
what you expect from a sports-themed restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The menu tells the rest of the story: it is a straightforward
document offering serious food that is a far cry from what you find
at the All-Star Cafe or Mickey Mantle's. The partners have found a
way to capitalize on Jordan's fame without jeopardizing his
dignity. And in the process they have created New York's
best-looking steakhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan's is the first among the many restaurants that
will open in the newly refurbished Grand Central Terminal.
Expectations are high: the Ciprianis will open one establishment,
Matthew Kenney another and the owners of City Bakery, Caviarteria
and Dawat have signed on for smaller spaces. But this will be a
hard act to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The designer, David Rockwell, who is currently creating a theme
restaurant in Times Square for the magician David Copperfield, is
not generally known for his restraint. But he was obviously awed by
one of New York's grandest buildings, and he allowed it to dictate
the design.
</P>
<P>
   The steakhouse, which sits snugly on the balcony overlooking the
main concourse, is entirely open to the magnificent space around
it. Seated in a splendor that recalls the great days of luxurious
trains, diners have the leisure to contemplate the starry ceiling
glowing 100 feet overhead while harried commuters dash madly
through the marble halls below.
</P>
<P>
   The seats are so comfortable, the appointments so majestic, that
you feel as if you were setting off on a wonderful journey.
</P>
<P>
   The food, for the most part, is equal to the space. David
Walzog, the chef at Tapika (which is also owned by the Glaziers),
reworked the standard steakhouse menu with energy and imagination.
Not every dish works, but he is constantly tinkering and with each
passing week the food improves.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, the onion rings. When the restaurant
opened in July they were heavily battered and overseasoned. Now,
they have been transformed into small, crisp little puffs of onion
air that seem to vaporize on contact with your mouth. The creamed
spinach, which was dark and heavy, is now bright green and utterly
irresistible. And mushy hash brown potatoes have turned into crisp
cakes that crackle before melting into tenderness.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Walzog works too hard. The smoked salmon is so
gussied up with dill cream and brioche toast and waving fronds of
herbs that it looks like something that escaped from last year's
Easter Parade. Would Michael mess with this? No way.
</P>
<P>
   Walzog, we are told, worked closely with Jordan on the menu.
Trying to second-guess Jordan's tastes is a good way to think about
ordering. The shrimp cocktail, for instance, is excellent (although
the ``23 herbs and seasonings'' are impossible to discern).
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, I am certain, would approve. And he must be pleased with
the big, crisp iceberg lettuce salad with its terrific choice of
dressings (I particularly liked the blue cheese).
</P>
<P>
   I suspect he would be less taken with the tomato and onion
salad, a bland, overdesigned dish of concentric rings and colors
that looks as if it is trying to imitate the Olympic symbol. The
corn soup with an island of crab cake in the middle is not a total
success either. And warm garlic bread with gorgonzola fondue needs
an energy injection; it is rich without being zesty.
</P>
<P>
   But the meat is suitably robust, prime, aged and old-fashioned.
All the standard cuts are available: a 16-ounce strip steak, a
12-ounce filet mignon and a double porterhouse for two that weighs
in at 44 ounces. But to my mind, the flavorful rib eye steak is
best; big, salty and charred on the outside, it is a tribute to the
American steer.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who are unafraid of fat, there is the deeply
greasy pleasure of braised short ribs, which arrive on a bed of
that wonderful creamed spinach.
</P>
<P>
   Walzog also does an impressive job with lobster; he somehow
manages to grill it without toughening, which is not an easy feat.
His lamb chops are less likable; when I had them they were small
and slightly dry. Perhaps Jordan is not a lamb fan.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by this menu, Jordan is not very interested in desserts,
either. Most are made by the admirable Payard Patisserie, but they
are not good travelers. The blueberry tart, the banana rum tart and
the lemon tart all arrive on soggy crusts.
</P>
<P>
   The mud cake is made on the premises, but it is so big, ugly and
messy that it makes you long for a wedge of devil's-food cake.
There is, however, one bright point in all of this: the hot fudge
sundae. An extravaganza of fruit, stewed nuts, whipped cream and
ice cream awash in excellent fudge, it is every bit as excessive as
the hamburger _ and every bit as good. &QL;

SALT'S KOSHER QUESTION  
 A CHICKPEA WAFER  
 THE HANDY DOUBLE BOILER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is there any kosher salt that supplies iodide?
</P>
<P>
   A: The answer is both no and yes. All iodized salt is kosher,
but there is no ``kosher'' salt that contains iodides. Confused?
</P>
<P>
   This seeming conundrum stems from the fact that all salt is
inherently kosher because it is a pure chemical compound. What
distinguishes kosher salt from common table salt is both the size
of the crystals and the lack of any additives that would render the
salt nonkosher for Passover.
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt has coarse crystals, which are necessary for the
koshering of meat. After an animal is ritually slaughtered, the
meat is covered with salt to draw out the blood. Coarse salt
crystals are more effective because they don't dissolve as readily
as fine salt (if the salt dissolves it can't draw out as much
blood).
</P>
<P>
   Salt that has an iodide compound added must also contain
dextrose to act as a stabilizer. Dextrose is a derivative of corn,
which is not considered kosher for Passover by Ashkenazi Jews.
</P>
<P>
   However, since salt is approved kosher pareve (acceptable for
use with meat and dairy products), you will find the kosher symbol
on most packages of table salt _ iodized or not. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a recipe using chickpea flour, water and
olive oil to make a flat wafer I saw on a French travelogue. Any
ideas?
</P>
<P>
   A: The flat wafer you are looking for is called socca. It is a
savory treat sold in the Cours Saleya open-air market in the old
city of Nice. Vendors set up little stands in the market stalls and
sell warm squares of the salty snack folded into brown paper cones.
</P>
<P>
   Socca is easy to make provided that you have a very hot oven,
which transforms the thin batter into a cake with a texture halfway
between a pancake and a fritter. Here is a recipe adapted from
Mireille Johnston's ``The Cuisine of the Sun.'' You can buy
chickpea flour in Italian and Middle Eastern markets as well as in
fancy gourmet shops. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there any other uses for a double boiler besides melting
chocolate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Since double boilers heat food slowly over steam instead of a
direct flame, they provide the best cooking environment for
delicate, finicky ingredients and preparations. Other than for
melting chocolate, double boilers are handy for stirring up
custards, curds, puddings and fillings, and are often used for
making sauces.
</P>
<P>
   Before microwaves took over the job, doubler boilers were a must
for reheating any dish that might separate or curdle, such as
something coated in a cream or egg-based sauce.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a double boiler, you can construct one out of
an ordinary saucepan and a metal bowl. Simply choose a bowl that is
wider in diameter than the saucepan, then fill the pan with about
an inch of water and place the bowl on top.
</P>
<P>
   The bowl should rest in the pan spended over _ but not touching
_ the water. Make sure to hold the bowl with a pot holder or towel
while mixing; it gets quite hot. &QL; 
 &QL;

THE MOST RELIABLE DINNER MATE: GERMAN RIESLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Burg Landshut, a ruined castle high above medieval
Bernkastel, the best known of the Mosel wine towns of Germany,
offers one of the most spectacular views of vines in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The vineyards sweep southward toward Brauneberg and west past
Graach and Wehlen to Zeltigen, all of them legendary German wine
villages, too. The view is never more stunning than a few weeks
from now when summer is truly past, the leaves are turning and the
river's steep banks are carpeted a bright yellow gold.
</P>
<P>
   I visit this magical place when I can, which is not often
enough, but always with mixed feelings of anticipation and guilt.
Anticipation because of the unmatchable wines, the beauty of the
area, the overwhelming sense of history it imparts. And guilt for
having failed, over the years, truly to convey the profound
pleasures these wines can give.
</P>
<P>
   The wines are rieslings, the elegant, complex, long-lived white
wines from the steep-sloped banks of the Rhine river and its
equally famous tributary, the Mosel; from the Pfalz region, and
from Alsace, in France.
</P>
<P>
   What has the unending search for something new in wine brought
us in the United States in recent years? Domestic merlot,
sangiovese and viognier, mostly pale imitations of their European
counterparts. Domestic rieslings have been around longer than those
three, but they, too, rarely approach the wines of Germany and
Alsace. Might it be time for the real thing?
</P>
<P>
   What prompt these ruminations are some recent observations by
David Rosengarten of the Food Network and by Willie Gluckstern, the
wine writer and consultant, in his new book, ``The Wine Avenger''
(Fireside, $11). Both agree: German rieslings are the best wines to
have with food, more flexible than any chardonnay or merlot.
</P>
<P>
   Rosengarten said: ``The white wine I select for food more than
any other is dry German riesling. This is no accident. I believe it
to be the most flexible white wine in the world for food.''
</P>
<P>
   Gluckstern writes: ``Nothing, I repeat, nothing, marries better
with more foods than riesling. Whereas other white wine varieties
might be generally serviceable with food, German rieslings fairly
sing at the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Gluckstern is not given to half measures. Of the pairing of red
meat with one of the richer German rieslings, he writes: ``What's
truly astounding is how perversely delicious they taste together.''
But he advises: ``Keep your eyes closed. The concept of white wine
with red meat might short-circuit your neural transmitters.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not so sure about red meat _ at least, not our steaks and
chops. But in northern climes, even in Scotland and Scandinavia,
great rieslings have always been paired with game: venison, wild
boar and the pungent flesh of game birds like pheasants and wild
ducks.
</P>
<P>
   With fine German wines so unfashionable in this country, it
might be a mistake to plunge directly into the most extreme
combinations. But there is no reason not to enjoy good Rhine wines
or Mosels with roast chicken and farm-bred ducks and turkeys. A
rich riesling could turn this year's Thanksgiving dinner into a
memorable event.
</P>
<P>
   Riesling is king in Germany, and there are not many princes.
Chardonnay is an interloper, and lesser white varieties like
sauvignon blanc, chenin blanc and the upstart viognier are
dismissed out of hand. What's more, in the best vineyards here and
along the Rhine, so are other German grapes, even though many of
them, like Kerner and Mueller-Thurgau, are related _ some closely,
some less so _ to the riesling.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to cater to the worldwide trend to dry wines, both
red and white, the German vintners have begun in recent years to
turn out trocken (dry) and halbtrocken (semidry) wines. Some of
them are quite good.
</P>
<P>
   But the glory of great riesling is the relationship between
sweetness and acid; they are the yin and the yang of the best
German white wines. Alcohol is less important in German wines; they
rarely exceed 11 percent and most range from 9 to 10. This makes
them easier to drink than most French wines and some of
California's alcoholic monsters.
</P>
<P>
   German wines are ranked by ripeness at the time the grapes are
picked. Ripeness is determined by the grape's sugar content. The
rules are complicated, and the language even more so. Suffice it to
say that the levels most often encountered in quality table wines,
in increasing levels of natural sugar, are kabinett, spaetlese and
auslese.
</P>
<P>
   These wines are usually fermented dry _ that is, until all the
sugar has been turned into alcohol and carbon dioxide. Then a small
quantity of unfermented grape juice called suesswein is added to
them. Some grapes with exceptionally high levels of sugar are
turned into sweet dessert wines known as beerenauslese and
trockenbeerenauslese.
</P>
<P>
   My own preference is for the traditionally made wines with a
touch of sweetness. When the sugar is perfectly balanced by the
wine's acidity, it doesn't seem sweet at all _ just extra rich and
complex.
</P>
<P>
   I recall a lunch a few years ago in a kitschy old Bernkastel
restaurant with the winemaker Karl-Heinz Lauerburg and his son
Patrick. We had spent the morning in the Lauerburg cellars,
sampling rieslings going back to 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch was a handsome trout, poached briefly with a few herbs,
accompanied by a riesling from the Sonnenuhr vineyard in nearby
Wehlen. Among Mosel vineyards, the Wehlener Sonnenuhr is almost as
famous as the Doctor vineyard in Bernkastel, the source of some of
Lauerburg's finest wines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonnenuhr'' means ``sundial'' in German and indeed, a huge
sundial graces the upper reaches of the vineyard that bears its
name. It was supposed to tell the vineyard workers when the day was
ended.
</P>
<P>
   Mosel wines _ you can tell them by their green bottles _ are
usually a bit more delicate and drier than wines from the Rhine
vineyards, which are identified by brown bottles. It is the richer,
more assertive Rhine wines, from communes like Hochheim, Eltville,
Johannisberg and Ruedesheim, that are most often associated with
heavier dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred years ago, German wines, called Hock by the English,
who were their best customers, were highly prized. And Thomas
Jefferson was particularly fond of the wines of Schloss
Johannisberg. As late as the 1920s, wines of the best German
estates, like Marcobrunn and Scharzhofberg on the Rhine and
Brauneberg on the Mosel, were even more expensive than the first
growths of Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few encouraging signs today. At Union Pacific, one
of New York's better new restaurants, Urs Kaufmannis, the
sommelier, has assembled a wine list that includes a good selection
of German wines to go with Rocco DeSpirito's inventive cooking.
</P>
<P>
   At Lutece, Eberhard Mueller has extended the wine list to
include attractive German wines. Lutece has a fine selection of
Alsatian wines, a legacy of its former owner. Andre Soltner,
himself an Alsatian.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has a long list of Michelin-starred restaurants, and in
them, German wines are once again associated with the finest food.
Perhaps, one day, it will happen here. &QL;

SCIENTISTS PROBE GEOLOGIC HISTORY DEEP BENEATH NEW YORK LAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOB GARDINIER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ Union College scientists are exploring the
muck of ages beneath two unusually deep lakes that hold a
12,000-year record of climatic changes and the effects of
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Using a missile-shaped sidescan sonar device along with a
sub-bottom digital profiler, a team of geologists, biologists,
chemists and civil engineers is mapping the depths inside sediment
of Collins and Ballston lakes in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   The lakes are two of only 100 meromictic lakes in the United
States, so named because the deep holes of ``dead water'' the color
of a strong cup of pekoe tea lack oxygen for decomposition and are
not stirred by currents. The water is under such pressure and so
bereft of oxygen that when it is brought to the surface it froths
over.
</P>
<P>
   Millenia of animal and plant-rich sediment remain in these
holes. The scientists have extracted yards of muck by pushing a
hollow four-inch plastic pipe down through the layers, in a process
called coring and similar to that used to probe polar ice.
</P>
<P>
   The sled-like digital profiler provides a glimpse inside the
layers of muck that have accumulated in the lake since the Ice Age.
The group had previously used the device to probe below Ballston
Lake with good results, but the researchers were a little
disappointed that even small pockets of methane gas in the sediment
blur the imaging, geologist John I. Garver said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers located a 30-foot-deep hole and guess there is
between 60 to 80 feet of undisturbed sediment beneath it in layers
resembling the growth rings on trees.
</P>
<P>
   Ballston Lake is 110 feet deep at its southern end and for now
the scientists can only guess how deep the sediment is there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cored down about 20 feet and thought we were half-way
through, but the carbon dating on a leaf we found went back to 400
A.D. So it turns out we only probed about one-tenth of the layer,''
geologist Donald Rodbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Periodic flooding of the Mohawk River, a stone's throw away,
left a clear imprint in the sediment of the Collins Lake hole that
is providing unprecedented insight into the meandering river's
history and a possible future.
</P>
<P>
   Seated behind his desk littered with sonar output data, Rodbell
produced spreadsheets on the chemical analysis of a recent Collins
Lake core sample of the sediment that clearly shows a steady
increase in the levels of charcoal, lead and zinc starting in the
early 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industry output from General Electric and American Locomotive
and other plants as well as people burning coal in their homes
became aerosoled dust and lies perfectly preserved in the
sediment,'' Rodbell said.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the chart reveals levels of the toxic
chemicals have steadily fallen off in the last about 20 years of
the core sample.
</P>
<P>
   They have parsed the core samples with microscopes, carbon
dating and magnetic and chemical analysis and found evidence of
past flooding, forest fires, climatic and geological changes lying
undisturbed in the quiet depths.
</P>
<P>
   The college professors and several of their undergraduate
students have been studying Collins Lake since 1994. Union's
geology department, one of a few undergraduate programs nationally
that runs a coring lab, recently received $160,000 grant from the
National Science Foundation and purchased the high-tech detection
equipment and a global positioning satellite system to pinpoint the
survey locations.
</P>
<P>
   Poking around with the side scan sonar _ the same technology
used to find the Titanic as well as wreckage from the recent Swiss
Air crash _ the Union team has found sunken cars, boats,
snowmobiles, all of which probably fell through the winter ice in
both locations, Garver said.

APROPOS OF THE FALL, THE MYSTERIOUS FIG  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA KAFKA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Whether a luscious purple or a pearly, light green,
figs are always a special treat. To me, they bring to mind pleasant
Mediterranean dinners, when figs, cut open to reveal their fleshy
pink insides, accompany salty slices of translucent ham at the
start of the meal. Often a basket lined with dark green, shiny fig
leaves and piled high with purple figs is served for dessert on a
warm night.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, nights can be crisp at this time of year, yet figs
still enter into our dinner plans _ especially in early October,
when they are in the peak of their season. Their somewhat
mysterious, deep taste can be emphasized by cooking and can add a
gentle, unexpected richness to meaty stews as well as desserts.
</P>
<P>
   The purple, brown or black figs you find in this country are
actually the same variety but in different states of ripeness.
Despite their unromantic name _ Brown Turkeys _ these figs are the
most like the Mediterranean variety and are particularly good with
rich meats and in desserts with creamy sauces. At their ripest _ in
the black stage _ they tend to be fragile but richer in flavor. Use
these in sauces, or with ham. The purple or brown figs hold their
shape better, so they are best for salads or eating out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The green figs here are likely to be Kadotas, which most of us
see dried. They are, however, excellent fresh, with lighter meats
and desserts.
</P>
<P>
   While experimenting in the kitchen with figs, I created this
duck stew, which has become a favorite. The black figs add to the
sauce, giving it much the density of a traditional French salmis,
which is typically a game stew. I used the small figs that come in
pint boxes and are quite inexpensive, but larger figs can be used.
</P>
<P>
   The duck in this dish is definitely not crisp, but all of the
fat is rendered out by preliminary cooking. This can be done in the
conventional way by browning the duck on top of the stove in a
large wide pot used for the braising. However, you can also do this
step in the oven at high heat, as outlined in the recipe, and I
have found this to be quicker and easier. Serve the duck with
polenta, noodles or mashed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The pork stew uses pale green figs, which give the dish a pale
color. Green apples add a welcome note of acidity and crispness.
The stew is finished with a little bit of cream to smooth it all
together. I serve it with white rice.
</P>
<P>
   As for dessert, figs poached in fruit juice can benefit from the
most conventional embellishment: simply serve them with a dollop of
whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   DUCK STEW WITH BLACK FIGS
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours
</P>
<P>
   2 4-pound ducks, each cut into 16 serving pieces (have the
butcher do this). Reserve necks, gizzards and wings for stock.
</P>
<P>
   8 medium cloves garlic, smashed, peeled and cut in half
lengthwise
</P>
<P>
   5 whole leaves sage
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups medium bodied red wine, like Rioja
</P>
<P>
   32 small or 24 medium fresh black figs (1{ pounds), stems
removed
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus additional to taste
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper, to taste.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place a rack in bottom third of oven and another in top
third. Heat oven to 500 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   2. With a pair of kitchen scissors, trim excess fat from duck
pieces. In two large heavy roasting pans, place duck, skin side
down, in one layer. Put one pan on each rack, and roast for 15
minutes. Carefully remove pans from oven, and pour off fat. Turn
duck, meat-side down, and return to oven, placing pan from bottom
rack on top rack, and vice versa. Roast for 15 minutes. Remove duck
pieces to a bowl. Pour or spoon fat from pan, reserving 2
tablespoons.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place one pan on top of stove. Pour { cup water into pan.
Bring liquid to boil, scraping any browned bits from bottom and
sides of pan with wooden spoon. Pour this liquid over duck in the
bowl. Repeat with second pan.
</P>
<P>
   4. In large wide pot, heat the 2 tablespoons of reserved fat
over medium heat. Stir in garlic, and cook, stirring, until golden,
about 4 minutes. With slotted spoon, remove garlic, and add to
browned duck. Pour off fat, and discard.
</P>
<P>
   5. Return duck with its liquid and garlic to the pot. Add sage,
bay leaf and 1 cup wine. Cover. Bring to boil. Lower heat, and
simmer gently for 45 minutes, turning duck every 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   6. Stir in figs, salt, pepper and remaining { cup wine. Cover.
Return to boil. Lower heat, and simmer for 10 minutes, for small
figs, or 10 to 15 minutes, for medium. The figs should maintain
their shape.
</P>
<P>
   7. Remove duck and figs to serving platter. Pour sauce into
measuring cup, let sit for 1 or 2 minutes, and then skim fat.
Season sauce with salt and pepper, pour some over duck and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
</P>
<P>
   PORK WITH GREEN FIGS AND APPLES
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds pork loin, cut into 1-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 medium yellow onion, cut into \-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Dijon-style mustard
</P>
<P>
   10 medium green figs (1 pound), stems removed
</P>
<P>
   2 medium tart green apples, like Granny Smith, peeled, cut into
\-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons kosher salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   { cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper, to taste.
</P>
<P>
   1. In medium saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat.
Working in batches, brown pork, about 1{ minutes a side. As each
batch is done, set it aside in a bowl. When last batch has browned
on one side, turn pork and stir in onions. Continue to cook,
stirring, until onions are slightly softened and brown, about 5
minutes. Stir in mustard, and then scrape mixture into bowl of
browned meat.
</P>
<P>
   2. Lower heat slightly, and place figs in bottom of saucepan.
Toss apples in lemon juice, and then sprinkle apples over figs.
Return pork and onions to pan.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add 1 cup water, and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt. Cover.
Bring to boil. Lower heat, and simmer for 30 minutes. Pork will be
cooked through, and figs and apples will be almost completely
disintegrated. Stir in remaining salt.
</P>
<P>
   4. Mix cornstarch with \ cup water until smooth. Add a few
ladles of hot fig sauce to cornstarch mixture, and then stir it
into the pot. Bring to boil. Lower heat, and simmer for 3 minutes.
Stir in heavy cream and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

   [ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 2-inch piece of vanilla bean, split lengthwise
</P>
<P>
   7 tablespoons orange juice
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lemon (about 3 tablespoons)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Marsala (optional). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Place figs upright in saucepan just large enough to hold them
comfortably in one layer. Sprinkle with sugar and pepper. Add
vanilla bean, and pour fruit juices over figs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Cover pan, and slowly bring to boil over medium heat. Lower
temperature, and simmer very gently for 10 to 15 minutes for medium
figs, 5 to 10 minutes for small, or until cooked through but not
falling apart. Add Marsala, if desired, and stir. Serve warm.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

STEPHEN KING IS BACK FROM NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE IN THE BOOK WORLD 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The buzzards were circling, smelling the onset of a
slow death.
</P>
<P>
   The book sales of the world's best-selling novelist had
stagnated, he had been bloodied by critics for years and his
longtime publisher was balking at his request for an $18 million
advance for his next opus. And there were whispers in publishing
that his frightmeister skills were on the wane, so maybe it was
time to cue that funeral dirge.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen King felt wounded, all right, watching the rise of
competitors Tom Clancy and John Grisham, while also growing
incensed at what he saw as lazy efforts by his publisher on his
recent books. And then there was the approach of his 50th birthday,
which he viewed with decided uneasiness because, as he saw it,
``once you turn 50, baby, you're middle-aged and you better get
used to the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   But King also had just pounded out a new book, one that had
already earned strong accolades from his novelist wife of 27 years
(Tabitha King) who is never ``fulsome'' with praise, and he himself
had few doubts about what eight months of writing had produced in a
35th book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when I was working on it that it was better in a lot of
ways than a lot of my other stuff,'' King emphasized last Friday
afternoon in Seattle. ``You just get a white buffalo every now and
then that comes along and you say to yourself, `This is really
good!'
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have anything to do with stepping to the next level
or you're a better writer than you were. You just get a really good
idea, and it's like Mark McGwire stepping into a good pitch. It was
just into my wheelhouse and, to my credit, I think that I knocked
it out of the park. And I can say that because, a lot of times, I
know when I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Scribner, his new publisher, is also convinced that King is back
from the nearly pronounced dead, with a robust 1.46 million copies
in its first printing of his new novel, ``Bag of Bones'' (Scribner,
529 pages, $28). The book is backed by a highly focused $50,000
publicity campaign with stops in just five cities (New York, Los
Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Boston) and a few interviews of the
semi-reclusive author granted to selected media (The New Yorker,
USA Today, Newsweek).
</P>
<P>
   ``Bag of Bones'' may well repay the optimism of its author and
its publisher, who agreed to a highly unusual contract where King
received only a $2 million advance for the novel but will split the
profits 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bag of Bones'' is a Kingian tour de force, a Gothic romance
that slowly ensnares the reader in an intricately constructed web
of very human emotions (love, grief, desire, regret, frustration,
joy) amid a small-town setting.
</P>
<P>
   It tells the wrenching story of best-selling novelist Mike
Noonan, who has suffered a gut-churning case of writer's block
since the death of his wife from a brain aneurysm at age 34. Noonan
is paralyzed by his loss until he returns to their lakeside summer
home in Maine, where a chance encounter with a precocious
3-year-old and her beautiful 20-year-old mother, recently widowed
herself, ignites the first stirrings of his heart and at his
typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   But all is not well in this Maine small town, despite the
fairy-tale elements of the budding romance between the 40-year-old
popular novelist and the young Grace Kelly-look-alike in a
double-wide trailer. Mattie DeVore is fighting an evil stepfather
millionaire for the custody of her daughter, a bitter court battle
that Noonan soon helps finance. And the town's hushed-over sins of
the past have created a host of unquiet spirits, which Noonan must
also confront as ``Bag of Bones'' builds inexorably toward the sort
of bloody, violent cataclysm that King, for better or worse, cannot
resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where it goes _ there was never any question, I didn't
see that there was any choice,'' King said. ``I've got a real
problem with books that peter out into ambiguity; they're like
streams that turn into swamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to bring the reader along, at least do the
reader the courtesy of putting all your cards down face up on the
table at the end. If they want to laugh, or they think it's
ridiculous _ and sometimes the critics feel that way _ then let
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   This is King, as usual, unplugged. A quarter century of
phenomenal popular success at the writing trade seems to have left
him remarkably unaffected. He may have 300 million copies of his
books in print and an estimated annual salary of $40 million, but
the 51-year-old resident of Bangor, Maine, still is a blue-jeans
guy in a button-down world.
</P>
<P>
   King's opinions remain unfettered, his manner unpretentious. His
first glimpse of his huge two-bedroom suite in the Four Seasons
Olympic Hotel prompted him to stride from room-to-room with a
childlike delight reminiscent of Macaulay Culkin left ``Home
Alone'' in the Plaza Hotel. And when he ordered a room-service
lunch, which he ate at a vast table, King's main course was chicken
noodle soup.
</P>
<P>
   King can still readily recall the days when chicken noodle soup
seemed a luxury of sorts, that time when the aspiring writer had
taken a job as a high school English teacher at a salary of $6,400
that still seemed to promise much for King, his wife and their two
young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We somehow felt we had gotten a free pass into the middle
class when I got that teaching job,'' King recalled. ``So we took
on a new car and we got a gasoline credit card and, all at once, we
found out, whoa, we overspent our means. So Tabby had to get a job
at Dunkin' Donuts, but it was still the best times for me. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was: teaching school drains your brain. I was
having some success selling short stories, but if I hadn't and
things had gone on as they were, I think I would have given up. I
don't like to think that, but I might have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Carrie'' changed that, establishing a pattern that would soon
become familiar for King. There was the 1974 publication of his
first novel (after an advance of $2,500), and then there was the
1976 film version (a screamfest by Brian De Palma) that greatly
increased King's fame and audience.
</P>
<P>
   All the years of scaring people has brought King untold wealth,
with much of it donated in small towns around Maine to schools,
libraries, theaters, a $1 million Little League baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But all this money earned from blood and guts and ghosts also
caused King some pangs of conscience. ``There's a part of me that
is attracted to violent fiction, that really likes that violent
chaotic behavior,'' he admitted. ``There is an anti-social guy
inside me, but there's also a very moral guy.''
</P>
<P>
   This back-and-forth battle for the author's soul came to a head
over a novel called ``Rage,'' finished when King was barely out of
his teens, a novel filled with the fear and loathing rampant during
those raging hormone years. The plot of ``Rage'' once seemed a
far-fetched figment of King's vivid imagination, but it went on to
become all-too-familiar in the headlines: A high school student
shoots his teacher and holds his classmates hostage.
</P>
<P>
   And, to King's real horror, some of the real students involved
in real school murders turned out to have read ``Rage,'' may even
have been inspired by the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think the book had a certain involvement in things that
happened, although it was never my intent to cause any kid to go
out and shoot anybody,'' King stressed. ``But I also think _ and
I'm real firm about this _ it did not cause anybody to do that. In
other words, I don't think there are good kids who read `Rage' and
turn into bad kids, violent, homicidal kids who want to shoot
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do think that certain materials, books, films, can act
as accelerants, in the same way that an arsonist can use
accelerants to make a fire burn faster. And I don't want to be any
part of that. So I withdrew the book from publication. I can't
change what's already out there, but there will be no future
printings and it will disappear from the shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen King has learned that horror pays, but also extracts a
price.

FDA ISSUES A WARNING ABOUT ALFALFA SPROUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   People with weakened or developing immune systems _ those for
whom food-borne diseases pose a severe health risk _ now have
something else to worry about. And it is something normally billed
as a health food: alfalfa sprouts.
</P>
<P>
   No, rabid alfalfa sprouts are not exactly running amok on the
streets and on avocado sandwiches. But enough sprouts have been
found to be contaminated with salmonella and E. coli 0157:H7 for
the Food and Drug Administration to issue a warning about special
dangers to children under 10, the elderly, pregnant women and those
with certain diseases like AIDS and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Even healthy adults can get sick from these food-borne
illnesses, but they are less likely to end up in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For years, sprouts have been sprinkled on salads and sandwiches
with a carefree abandon because they are supposed to be so
healthful. The popularity of sprouts came out of the hippie culture
of the 1960s, when natural and nutritious became synonymous. Until
1995, when the first outbreak occurred in this country, no one gave
the safety of these crunchy add-ons a second thought.
</P>
<P>
   Alfalfa sprouts are only the third food item in the FDA's recent
effort to single out the millions in the most vulnerable part of
the population as needing special warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
warned scientists and health professionals a year ago about alfalfa
sprouts, it was not until the end of last month that the FDA issued
its warning. ``I'm not saying we shouldn't have done it sooner,''
William Schultz, deputy director of the FDA for policy, said. He
added: ``A warning directed at special populations is a new tool
the FDA has started to use. It is a new concept for high-risk
food.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, raw oysters became the first food to carry an FDA
warning for those with weakened immune systems. No new foods were
added to this list until unpasteurized juices, which were
pinpointed as risks two years ago; warnings, however, did not go up
in supermarkets until just last month.
</P>
<P>
   Alfalfa sprouts are No. 3. Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of
food safety at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a
Washington-based advocacy group, agrees that such warnings are
necessary but she says the FDA takes too long to issue them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a big part of FDA's job to warn consumers,'' Ms.
DeWaal said, ``but no one is taking responsibility to alert them
about the changing food supply.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
since 1995, outbreaks of salmonella and E. coli 0157:H7 in alfalfa
sprouts in Kansas, Missouri, Michigan, Virginia and California have
resulted in 1,300 confirmed cases of food poisoning and the
likelihood of thousands more.
</P>
<P>
   There has been one death. ``I think it is a serious problem,''
Dr. Larry Slutsker, a medical epidemiologist with the centers,
said.
</P>
<P>
   The warning on the sprouts, issued on Aug. 31, came in an FDA
news release. But there is no telling when, if ever, consumers will
be informed in any systematic way: for example, with mandatory
warning labels in supermarkets. Doing that is a long bureaucratic
process involving everyone from growers and consumer groups to the
Office of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with sprouts, which are almost always eaten raw,
seems to be in the sprouts themselves, not in the way they are
served. The fact that the sprouting process takes place in water
may enhance the ability of hazardous bacteria to multiply.
</P>
<P>
   Three confirmed outbreaks this summer in California _ with a
fourth under investigation _ have prompted the California
Department of Health Services to issue a statewide advisory about
the potential risks. The FDA followed suit. Its warning is
considered an interim measure, the federal agency said, ``until
such time as intervention methods are in place to improve the
safety of these products.''
</P>
<P>
   Growers of sprouts are aware of the problem but not quite sure
how to fix it. One new decontamination procedure requires the
soaking of sprout seeds in a solution containing chlorine. The
method is still being evaluated by the Environmental Protection
Agency but in the interim, California has given its sprout industry
emergency permission to use the system for one year.
</P>
<P>
   As a follow-up to its Aug. 31 warning, the FDA held a two-day
public meeting this week to discuss possible solutions. Industry,
scientists and consumer groups were among the participants, and
they took up the possibility of the FDA reissuing its warning, the
improvement of growing practices, irradiation and the chlorine
solution.

 &HT;    OFFICIALS: CUBA HOPES FOR BETTER RELATIONS WITH U.S.
 &HT;    EDs: With optional trim.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Cuba is opening up its state-run economy, and is
reaching out to Americans in hopes of ending 40 years of tense
relations with the United States, Cuban diplomats told an audience
here this week.
</P>
<P>
   But the highest-ranking U.S. official in Cuba said that economic
reforms have been stalled, and that there will be no changes in
U.S. policy toward Cuba until there is real, systemic change on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban diplomats also said that work on two Soviet-style nuclear
reactors at Juragua, about 180 miles south of Key West, can't
proceed due to a lack of funding and resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practical terms, this cannot go forward,'' said Carlos
Fernandez de Cossio of the Foreign Relations Ministry in Havana.
``We wish we could work with Americans on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments were made at a two-day conference called ``Cuba in
Evolution,'' sponsored by The Dallas Morning News, that was marked
by emotional debate between Cubans, Cuban-Americans, and officials
from both nations on how to encourage change in Cuba, and to end a
political stalemate between Cuban leader Fidel Castro and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba is ready to discuss any issue with the United States, and
the only condition is respect,'' said Fernando Remirez, the
highest-ranking Cuban official in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Remirez heads the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, D.C.,
which is the closest thing Cuba has to an embassy due to the
absence of formal diplomatic ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Remirez said that the Cuban economy -- which he said grew 13.5
percent between 1994 and 1997 -- has recently undergone ``serious
adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to a government with 15 fewer cabinet ministries
today compared to five years ago, and a banking system that's been
restructured.
</P>
<P>
   He said that 1.4 million foreigners are expected to visit Cuba
in 1998, a number that would quickly jump to 3 or 4 million if U.S.
travel restrictions to Cuba were lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we are close to the day when the United States accepts
Cuba as an independent and sovereign nation, and then we will have
normal ties,'' Remirez said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomat Michael Kozak said the Cuban government
``literally lives from hand to mouth,'' adding that the United
States fears what might occur in a post-Castro Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the U.S. government's primary concern is stability,''
Kozak said. ``Our nightmare scenario is that we get a flood of
migrants.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Castro, 73, had only ``tinkered'' with his country's
economy reluctantly in order to avoid instability, and that
important, long-term economic reform is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Many at the conference felt that, in light of Pope John Paul
II's visit to Cuba last January, now is the best time to foster
communication and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five or six years ago, you might have seen Cuban-Americans
saying they would talk with the Cuban people but not with the
government,'' said Wayne Smith, a former U.S. diplomat to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's been changing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others contended that the U.S. government must continue its
efforts to isolate Cuba, the best policy for bringing about changes
in Castro's one-party state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. economic embargo against Cuba may not be perfect, but
neither is doing nothing,'' said Daniel Fisk, a former aide to Sen.
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) who helped write the Helms-Burton bill, which
strengthened the embargo in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. policy seeks an end to the repressive state structure of
Cuba,'' Fisk said. ``Ending the embargo without significant
political change remains the (Cuban) regime's No. 1 priority.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cuban government officials said work on their two
nuclear reactors is at a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Russia announced it would free up $350 million in
credits offered to Cuba in 1997, allowing work to continue on the
half-built reactors.
</P>
<P>
   The news alarmed hard-line Cuban-Americans who argue that Castro
is an unstable dictator with the ability to develop biological and
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuban officials said this week that Russia doesn't have the
resources to develop the project, and that the Cuban government
must have a third party, such as the United States, in order to
complete the reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Various U.S. studies have suggested that, if completed, the
reactors could pose a Chernobyl-type danger to Americans living as
far north as Washington, and as far west as Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress approved $3 million to build and maintain a
Caribbean Radiation Early Warning System, or a battery of sensors
on the Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials maintain that their country poses no threat to
the United States, and pointed to the Cuban government's
ratification of the international treaty banning chemical weapons
as one piece of proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States knows Cuba has no nuclear capability,''
Fernandez said. ``And we have no intention of obtaining chemical
weapons.''

`THE STILLEST DAY': TREADING A PATH OF SELF-INFLICTED RUIN
</HEADLINE>
   (th) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Josephine Hart, author of ``Sin,'' ``Oblivion'' and her first
novel, the much-acclaimed ``Damage,'' writes about emotional
disintegration, the collapse of the normal world into a kind of
fulfilled death wish.
</P>
<P>
   She will not disappoint her readers in her new novel, ``The
Stillest Day,'' which shows Ms. Hart ever the master of the lean
and aphoristic story of psychological horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Stillest Day'' is the tale of a woman living in England
before World War I who lovingly cultivates a hopeless erotic
addiction, thereby pitching her life into an abyss. The truth is
that this new book does not have quite the stark power of some of
Ms. Hart's earlier books, in part because even her subject, sexual
obsession, can begin to become familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hart seems to strain for effect in this book, which combines
the attributes of an elegant psychological thriller and a Gothic
horror story. Her ending in particular (postponed by several
somewhat formulaic chapters aimed at building up the suspense) is
so dramatically contorted as to veer into mannerism, evoking less a
shudder of tragic appreciation than a kind of prurient curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these faults, Ms. Hart's new effort remains
fundamentally intelligent and thematically compelling. As in her
best earlier work, she demonstrates a sure hand as she firmly
guides this latest excursion down the tormented path of
self-inflicted ruin. She writes with serene and spare narrative
power, early on creating the surface tension that foreshadows the
disaster to follow, the various pieces of her story falling as
neatly and inconspicuously into place as the tumblers of a safe.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the novel is the narrator, Bethesda Barnet, a
woman of 29 living in a quiet English village, where she takes care
of her invalid mother and experiences ``the comfort of custom and
the protection of prescribed procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bethesda is a schoolteacher and a part-time artist who paints
tame village scenes under the patronage of Lord Grantleigh, the
local aristocrat who is going to play an important role in the
denouement of Bethesda's story. When, abruptly, a young couple
expecting their first child move in next door, Bethesda constructs
a destructive obsession with the expectant father, Mathew Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   ``His rain-washed face was what I first saw,'' she recounts, and
then begins to paint that face on mirrors in her room upstairs,
mirrors that she wraps in silver-threaded shawls and conceals in
her cupboard drawers. ``A single vision had revealed to me my
life's destiny,'' she says. ``A natural worshiper, I had found my
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hart sets up her tale with her usual stylistic elegance, her
characters emerging from just a few strokes of her pen with sharply
individuated features. Bethesda's mother is calculating and
selfish. Mary, the pregnant wife of the beloved Mathew Pearson, has
a soft roundness that is spiritual as well as physical, and
loathsome to Bethesda. She sees the aging mother and the
mother-to-be as rebukes to herself, and she develops a
serpent's-tooth hatred for the two of them and their conspiratorial
contentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They laughed,'' Bethesda tells us, dripping with controlled
animosity. ``It was a kind of female laughter which I detested.
Lord Grantleigh and I had sometimes noted the veritable witchlike
quality of the consensual laughter of women.''
</P>
<P>
   Bethesda's hatred for the women has its counterpart in a fantasy
life with Mathew that reaches a point of religious ecstasy: ``What
is it that I wished for? An endless, silent idolatry. The image of
my Lord will fill my room and life and I will spend my time there
in adoration.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point midway in Ms. Hart's novels there is a kind of
plot point, an unexpected occurrence that allows the evil seed
already planted to go to full, noxious flower. In this book,
Bethesda has a suitor, a sturdy and prosperous farmer named Samuel
Keans, who, after a delay of years, proposes to her, thereby, it
would seem, rescuing her from the fearful village fate of
old-maidhood.
</P>
<P>
   Bethesda, after a punitive hesitation, agrees to the marriage,
but just then Mary comes for a visit. It would not be fair to
readers of ``The Stillest Day'' to reveal exactly what happens on
that visit, but it is an unanticipated and shocking event that
sends everything on a downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, Bethesda is a ruined woman, ruined, like
Flaubert's Emma Bovary, by her own yearning to escape the rigid
restraints of village life by substituting an erotic fantasy for
reality. Mathew, Samuel and even Lord Grantleigh turn against her.
Her abandonment is complete, and, in the end, she almost has no
choice but to complete the process of self-destruction begun when
she first stepped outside the bounds of rural propriety, even
though that step was taken mostly in her mind.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ms. Hart's theme concerns the terrible fragility of
things. Deep in most people is the terror that some secret wish
will be exposed and will set in motion their own destruction. When
that happens in Ms. Hart's stories, we respond with a frisson of
self-recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Stillest Day'' adds a strong religious undertone to the
theme of psychological disintegration. In it, the sinful wish of
Bethesda strangely becomes reality, and it is the wish itself more
than the act that leads her to doom.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the power and effectiveness of the themes, Ms. Hart's
ending remains contrived in its very horribleness. The reader
wonders: How is Ms. Hart going to get out of this one? And when the
answer is revealed, it comes across as more lurid than unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   One reads with the dread and fascination that one feels watching
an insect devour its prey. You know it is going to happen, and yet
it is almost impossible to look away.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey, a potential Democratic
presidential candidate, now says he was ``a bit rash and harsh''
three years ago when he said President Clinton was ``an unusually
good liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey didn't actually retract what he said, which stands as one
of the most perceptive observations about Clinton ever leveled by a
fellow Democrat, pre-Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Kerrey was angry because although he and other
Democrats had risked their jobs by raising taxes at the president's
insistence in 1993, the president told a group of rich Texas
contributors that Congress forced the tax hike on him and that he
really hadn't wanted to do it. Kerrey felt the betrayal personally;
he nearly lost re-election in 1994 to a Republican who berated him
for that vote to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is typical of the prickly relationship between the
two that has existed since Kerrey was defeated by Clinton in the
1992 presidential primaries. Kerrey, a Navy veteran and a Medal of
Honor winner who lost a leg in Vietnam, also attacked Clinton's
candor in that race, accusing Clinton of being deceitful about the
way he avoided the draft.
</P>
<P>
   These men have little in common, beyond roots in rural America,
their joint party affiliation and a tendency toward moderately
liberal policies. Although Kerrey is a bachelor who once dated
actress Debra Winger, his private life has remained private and
relatively scandal-free.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, in fact, is well-positioned to run for the White House
in a post-Clinton era reeling from the president's reckless bad
behavior and the threat of impeachment. Kerrey says he will decide
in December whether to run in 2000, after he digests the outcome of
the November congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Those elections are almost as psychologically important to
Kerrey's future as they are to Vice President Albert Gore, who is
still the likely frontrunner despite his close identification with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For two election cycles Kerrey has been chairman of the Senate
Democratic Campaign Committee, a crucial fund-raising role. Two
years ago, the Democrats lost two Senate seats, putting pressure on
Kerrey to demonstrate in November that he can produce some
victories to verify his national leadership credentials.
</P>
<P>
   The chairmanship, however, has given him the excuse to travel
the country meeting big contributors and making friends among those
who toil in the party vineyards. Although still popular back home,
he seldom shows up in Nebraska anymore, a conspicuous absence that
has convinced local residents that he has already decided to run
for president rather than for re-election to the Senate in 2000.
(State law forbids him from seeking both jobs simultaneously.)
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey has carved out a niche of individualism in the Senate,
separating himself from the Clinton administration on several major
issues. That includes leading the 1997 fight to defeat the
president's nominee to head the Central Intelligence Agency, Tony
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey is not known as much of a team-player inside the
Democratic party either, preferring to go his own way most of the
time. Typical of that attitude was his initial resistance to
supporting Clinton's first basic budget and tax package, which was
viewed as crucial not only to the president's ability to govern but
to the future of a party that had been frozen out of the White
House for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democratic senators were irritated by what seemed like his
dramatic grandstanding before finally capitulating.
</P>
<P>
   That could be a problem, as well as the fact that compared to
Gore, Kerrey is still not very well known nationally. In a New
Hampshire straw poll taken in July, Gore won 45 percent of the vote
and Kerrey only 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey has not been shy about taking advantage of the Monica
Mess, however. He is often on TV prodding Clinton to come clean. He
was the first to rush forward to speak in the Senate in support of
Sen. Joseph Lieberman's condemnation of Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   He has to be careful not to seem too opportunistic. Moving too
far too fast could turn off Democratic loyalists who do not want to
see Clinton brought down.
</P>
<P>
   But interest in Kerrey's ambitions has risen recently as the
president's fortunes have fallen. Gore remains the Democrat to beat
for the 2000 nomination. But the air of inevitability he once
enjoyed has vanished with a possible probe of his campaign finance
practices, national disgust with his mentor's behavior and the
party's low morale.
</P>
<P>
   At least two other Democrats also display an interest in taking
on Gore _ former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley and House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri. Like Kerrey, both have deplored
Clinton's conduct and distanced themselves from the
administration's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has made no secret of his ambitions for years. He will
go for it if he decides there is a reasonable chance of beating
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley is a more problematic figure; when he retired from
the Senate two years ago, he said politics was ``broken'' and
washed his hands of it. Although mentioned as possible presidential
timber for years, he has never before mustered the courage or
desire to actually make the race.
</P>
<P>
   In this, he is rather like Republican Jack Kemp, Bob Dole's
running mate: much admired for character and principle within his
party but always subject to cold feet at decision-making time.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Why is it that some of the fanciest chefs in town
positively dote on short ribs?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because this unglamorous cut brings out the Henry
Higgins in them.
</P>
<P>
   In the right hands, and with enough care and patience, these
steer ribs, the ends of the prime ribs, which start out all
toughness, show their elegant and tender side.
</P>
<P>
   For Terrance Brennan, the chef and owner of Picholine, on West
64th Street, a braised short rib is a three-day affair. One day is
just for marinating, another is for braising and a third is for
rest, to allow the meat to wallow languorously in the sauce, all
the while becoming richer and deeper in flavor. With a last-minute
Provencal flourish, Brennan tosses in some nicoise olives and
anchovy fillets.
</P>
<P>
   For Brennan, short ribs have three big charms. ``There's
texture, richness, fattiness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Ah yes, the fattiness. This is no dieter's delight: It has
about twice the calories of a pot roast made with lean choice
round. But the high fat content is part of what makes short ribs so
delectable. A lovely alchemy takes place in the braising as the
fats and connective tissue, those great carriers of flavor, slowly
and imperceptibly dissolve into the sauce.)
</P>
<P>
   At the Lobster Club, on East 80th Street, Anne Rosenzweig, the
chef and owner, sears the ribs, braises them with onions, garlic,
brown sugar, veal stock and a dark ale like porter or stout.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few minutes, she brushes the ribs with a mustard and
white wine mixture, dredges them in bread crumbs and grills them
for two minutes until they become crusty.Then she stirs three
Moroccan ingredients _ bright orange dices of pumpkin, emerald
green kale and cream-colored chickpeas _ into the dark burnished
sauce and places the ribs on top.
</P>
<P>
   The sauce points up the inherent sweetness of the meat, while
the kale and mustard add a little bite. The dish looks like
gleaming mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   At Gertrude's, on East 61st Street, Laurent Manrique, the owner
and chef, makes short ribs exactly the way his grandmother Aurelie
Frayet made them for him when he was a little boy in the Gascogne
region of France. He marinates the ribs overnight in a mix of
carrots, celery, onions, garlic, herbs and a hefty red wine, like
Cahors or Madiran.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, he sears the ribs, sautees the vegetables and
braises the meat for three hours in wine and veal stock. To add
richness to richness, he makes a sauce of sauteed porcini
mushrooms, onions, garlic and prunes, which he mixes into the
earthy, soul-warming dish.
</P>
<P>
   But not all tasty recipes for short ribs require a dozen
ingredients. Rozanne Gold, the author of the new ``Recipes 1-2-3
Menu Cookbook'' (Little, Brown, 1998), uses only three: the ribs,
hoisin sauce and zinfandel. ``Water doesn't count,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Book publishers may guess and gamble as to which title will be a
best seller. But in the restaurant world, it seems, you can't go
wrong with short ribs, especially in cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosenzweig estimated that at her last restaurant, Arcadia,
which closed in June, half of the orders were for short ribs on any
cold night. Manrique of Gertrude's placed this figure at one-third.
</P>
<P>
   When Gray Kunz, the former executive chef at L'Espinasse, added
short ribs braised in a horseradish and Meaux mustard sauce to the
menu in 1995, nobody flinched at the $38 price.
</P>
<P>
   In winter, he estimated, one-quarter of the entrees would be
short ribs, making it the restaurant's most popular dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, I wanted to take it off the summer menu,'' Kunz
said. But popular demand won out.
</P>
<P>
   Several chefs said they preferred short ribs to filet mignon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filet lacks flavor,'' Marc Murphy, executive chef at La
Fourchette, said.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Gold said, ``Eating a steak is a
one-dimensional experience _ but with short ribs, you get this
gorgeous dark color, smell, sight, taste and texture.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan enjoys lifting up the cover to peek at the barely
bubbling surface, the browning of the meat, the caramelizing of the
sauce, and to take in the wine aroma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the cassoulet, the daube, the pot au feu _ you
constantly have to keep an eye on it,'' Brennan said. ``This is
real cooking.'' &QL;

SEX ADDICTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday Oct 6)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm Bill and I'm a sexaholic,'' is something a number of
people hope to hear but expect they won't. Yet, there are groups of
people who gather regularly and who, since the first hint of
presidential scandal, have had no doubt that ``Clinton is one of
us,'' as I'm told by a man named George.
</P>
<P>
   A woman reader had the same idea. She called the newspaper to
wonder why she hasn't read much in the media about President
Clinton's sexual addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she isn't fed up with the scandal like most people and
disappointed in the president. ``I don't like him personally,'' she
said, ``but I have a lot of compassion for him.''
</P>
<P>
   She explained that she knows about addiction. Hers is alcohol.
But isn't it the same, she wondered, to risk family, friends, job,
all the good stuff, to satisfy a craving? Be it for a drink, a drug
or sex.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a rare affliction. There are sexaholic groups and sex
and love addicts groups. Here in Sonoma and Napa counties alone
there are seven 12-step meetings that focus on sex addiction.
</P>
<P>
   George said ``Clinton needs the literature'' and he even
fantasizes that he might ``catch up with the president jogging some
day and say, `Bill, you have a problem.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all been saying to each other we want him to come to a
meeting,'' said a woman named Mary. She thinks joining a program is
the best thing to happen when an addict hits bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if this ain't bottom,'' said Mary, ``I don't know what
is.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the obstacles to dealing with sex addiction, says George,
is that it's not as socially accepted as being hooked on booze or
drugs which these days can get you help and sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look how many CEOs have said this is my addiction, I'm an
alcoholic.''
</P>
<P>
   But mention someone who is preoccupied with sex and you get
mostly raunchy jokes. Or the person is dismissed as, at best, a
rogue, or at worst, a pervert.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, said George, the addict ``needs compassion and
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Read between the words'' of Clinton's explanations, said
George. ``It's thick with denial. He's not being honest even with
himself. He's weaseling with the words. Addicts do what we need to
do to cover up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the questions that people like George or Mary might slip
to the president or anyone else in question include:
</P>
<P>
   Do you take part in sexual behavior despite your will and better
judgment?
</P>
<P>
   Do you say this is the last time I'll ever do that and yet do
it?
</P>
<P>
   Do you have a history of negative consequences such as legal,
financial and social problems related to sexual behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Do you assume any act of kindness or friendship is a sexual
offer?
</P>
<P>
   Do you have to have someone around with whom to flirt?
</P>
<P>
   Do you feel entitled to sex?
</P>
<P>
   Sexual addicts, according to the literature, have a compulsive
need for sex at (here's a familiar word) ``inappropriate times in
inappropriate places with inappropriate people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very serious addiction,'' said George, and in his
opinion it comes from feeling unloved and insecure and a fear of
intimacy. George relates to each one of those and believes his
addiction also came from growing up with addicts. He describes his
parents as ``Olympian alcoholics.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, when George was very young he was sexually abused and
became a male prostitute, ``to get attention and imitation
affection.''
</P>
<P>
   He married but was unfaithful. ``There's always this obsession
to get your fix. You're thinking about it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows about taking stupid risks. ``You play the edge just to
feel more alive.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows about objectifying your sex partners, maybe not even
knowing or remembering their names. ``It's not about abusing a
person but using them to take your mind off your pain.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows that compulsively sexual people can be planning their
next sexual encounter while they're in the middle of the current
one.
</P>
<P>
   Mary said it rings true that a sex addict, in denial, would
redefine the meaning of sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, you could say it wasn't really sex because she was
offering and I was accepting.''
</P>
<P>
   Or she said, a person could rationalize that having random sex
in his office is less a violation toward his spouse than having sex
in their bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Mary knows how charming and friendly a sexaholic can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the ones who walk into the room and everyone looks. We
have chemistry. And we think we can have anyone who takes our
fancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary said the sexaholic is capable of hundreds of affairs.
George says ``a thousand.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary calls herself ``a straight up sex addict,'' and adds, ``We
could have a woman president and still have this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   George says, ``If Bill Clinton went on television and said `I've
got to come clean. I'm an addict and I'm going into a program,' the
world would be behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   You think so?

SAVEUR WITH A TRULY AMERICAN SAVOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SUZANNE HAMLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saveur magazine, now three years old, has had a notable impact,
helping to make grass-roots American cooking fashionable again.
It's stylish, knowledgeable, chatty, sometimes quirky and full of
gorgeous, you-are-there photographs of food and cooks. Most of all,
it explores the connections between people and places and the food
they produce.
</P>
<P>
   But even if you stockpile copies, ``Saveur Cooks Authentic
American'' (Chronicle Books, $40) is a good book to have. The same
infectious energy that runs through the magazine also animates the
150 recipes and numerous photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Appetizers through desserts, it's all Americana. There's a roast
turkey with corn-bread stuffing, a Maine blueberry pie, shrimp and
crab etouffee, iceberg wedge with blue cheese dressing (along with
a spirited defense of iceberg lettuce), smoked trout hash and
barbecued ribs.
</P>
<P>
   All the recipes have the voice of authenticity _ that is to say,
they are true to their regional roots. The Texas chili is made from
diced, not ground chuck; the corn-bread recipe contains no sugar
(heresy to purists), but properly has buttermilk and bacon fat; the
Mennonite borscht is all beef and cabbage, no beets, and the mint
julep, in chilled, preferably silver cups, is the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recipes originate not with chefs but with cooks at
home, who illuminate the ingredients with a story or two. And
they're a good bunch of people to mix with, as I found out in
several weeks of testing.
</P>
<P>
   Of the dozen recipes I tried, all worked _ one of the benefits,
no doubt, of a rigorous magazine test kitchen. The few that were
not memorable were at least the makings of a decent dinner.
</P>
<P>
   And the majority were terrific. Like Joe Delgado's polenta pie
with Gorgonzola. Delgado, of San Francisco, pours just-cooked
polenta into a cast-iron skillet, stirs in some butter and cheese
(asiago), crumbles Gorgonzola over the top and bakes it for 25
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Parsley salad with julienned sun-dried tomatoes and a basil
vinaigrette is a brilliant answer to the winter salad quandary.
Raddichio and fennel slaw, from a California grower, has earned a
place as another regular for winter.
</P>
<P>
   Layfayette gingerbread (made with orange juice and molasses) is
up there with the great ones. And Joe's special, from a legendary
old restaurant in San Francisco is both quick and lovable: a
scramble of eggs, onions, ground beef and fresh spinach.
</P>
<P>
   But the recipe for Monte's ham may alone be worth the price of
admission. Monte Mathews, an advertising executive, writes: ``When
I first came to New York, a friend gave me two pieces of advice:
first, if you wear an expensive watch, you can wear anything else
you want; second, when you have a lot of people over, buy a cheap
ham.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathews already had the watch, but he was flummoxed by the ham,
until he went to a party and saw hordes of guests tucking into a
giant, glistening specimen. Begging his hostess for the secret, she
disclosed: ``Buy the cheapest ham possible, glaze the hell out of
it and cook it for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathews said he has followed the advice several times a year for
more than 20 years, never paying more than 99 cents a pound for a
bone-in ham (not the canned kind). As a cheap-ham hunter, I was no
match for Mathews.
</P>
<P>
   I settled on an Esskay ``water added'' ham for $2.89 a pound.
Cooked to his instructions, it was served to a group of 10 with
professed discerning palates. (In truth, cut in half-inch slices,
the ham would serve 30 or more.)
</P>
<P>
   They went crazy for Monte's ham, clamoring for seconds and
thirds, grabbing nubbins from the platter and boldly demanding to
take home the leftovers. The big, deeply bronzed beauty was truly
delicious _ succulent and moist on the inside, sweetly glazed and
crisp on the outside _ although I can't help thinking how good it
might have been with a genuinely cheap ham. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MONTE'S HAM
</P>
<P>
   Time: 4 hours &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 15-pound smoked ham, on the bone
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups orange marmalade
</P>
<P>
   1 cup Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups firmly packed brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 rounded tablespoon whole cloves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Heat oven to 300 degrees. Cut off the ham's tough outer skin
and excess fat, and discard. Put ham in a large roasting pan. With
a long, sharp knife score it, making crosshatch incisions all over
the ham about { inch deep and 1 inch apart.
</P>
<P>
   2. Roast the ham on the lower middle level of the oven for two
hours. Remove it from oven, and increase heat to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   3. For the glaze, stir together the orange marmalade, mustard
and brown sugar in a medium-size bowl. Stud ham with cloves,
inserting one at the intersection of each crosshatch. Brush entire
surface of ham generously with glaze, and return to the oven.
Reserve some of the glaze.
</P>
<P>
   4. Cook ham 1{ hours more, brushing with glaze at least three
times. Transfer ham to a cutting board or platter, and allow it to
rest for about 30 minutes. Carve and serve warm or at room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 30 or more servings.

 &HT;    CLASSROOM COMPUTERS CAN RAISE MATH TEST SCORES, STUDY FINDS
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Students who use computers in the classroom score
higher on standardized math tests when they work with trained
teachers who use the technology productively, Education Week
magazine reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said the national study, sponsored by the magazine
and conducted by the Educational Testing Service, was the first to
link student computer use to higher test scores.
</P>
<P>
   The findings come at a time when states are spending millions
each year on education technology, and some parents and lawmakers
are questioning the effectiveness of computers in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Week study showed that students who used computers
for math learning games or for programs that applied math problems
to real-life situations _ activities generally associated with
higher-order thinking _ performed better on tests than students who
use computers for repetitious ``drill and practice'' exercises.
</P>
<P>
   About 54 percent of fourth graders use classroom computers for
higher-order thinking, while just 27 percent of eighth-graders do,
the study found.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference between having technology and using
it effectively,'' said Cheryl Lemke, executive director of the
Milken Exchange on Education Technology. ``Without policy changes
focused on increasing effectiveness, technology risks becoming
another lost educational opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found differences in achievement not only between
students who use computers at school and those who don't, but also
within the group of computer users. It said these differences were
largely due to the fact that some teachers used the computers less
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   African American students, poor students and students in the
West and Southeast were among those more likely to benefit less
from computers in their classrooms, it found.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth grade, about 31 percent of white students used
computer activities that developed higher-order thinking, compared
to 14 percent of black students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing disparity economically between our
students,'' said Kathleen Lyons, spokeswoman for the National
Education Association. ``We're concerned that all students get a
good solid education. In poor school districts, there are kids that
are being left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons said the NEA would use the report as a basis for asking
state legislatures to allocate more money toward teacher training.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that in schools where teachers had some training
in computers, students outperformed those whose teachers had none.
In addition, when trained teachers used computers for higher-order
skills, schools tended to enjoy higher staff morale and lower
absenteeism rates.
</P>
<P>
   About 76 percent of eighth graders had math teachers trained in
technology. However, in 1997, about 40 percent of teachers had no
formal training in using the internet.
</P>
<P>
   American Federation of Teachers spokesman Darrell Capwell said
the study reinforces a larger issue that all teachers should be
adequately trained in any subject they teach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers and their use is not going to be the magic bullet,''
Capwell said. ``It has to be in tandem with making sure teachers
have the professional development resources as well. Putting
teachers in classrooms who are not trained isn't productive.''

IN CLEVELAND, WHAT THE WELL-DRESSED KNIGHT WORE IS SHINING ANEW  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JO THOMAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Past the dead buildings and the smart new town
houses, past the sprawling Cleveland Clinic complex, in a court at
the Cleveland Museum of Art, one of the city's most beloved
attractions has come back to life.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-September, after a $1.25-million renovation and
reinstallation supported by the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund,
the Armor Court was reopened. The knights in shining armor who
introduced generations of children to the visual arts were back,
gleaming softly under a high-tech glass skylight that transmutes
even the noonday sun to dawn.
</P>
<P>
   An armored knight on horseback catches the eye. The visor on his
crested helmet is down, and even the reins on his steel-caparisoned
horse are plated for battle. But it is the other knights, posed as
naturally as if they had been momentarily interrupted, who draw the
visitor in.
</P>
<P>
   They are encased in nonreflective glass, a protection that
allows viewers to get close enough to really examine the armorer's
marks, the little buckles, the velvet linings, the intricacies of
etched designs, the flexible joints, the scars of combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the whack marks,'' said Robert P. Bergman, a medieval
scholar who came to the museum as its director from the Walters Art
Gallery in Baltimore in 1993. He pointed to the intricate etchings
on a suit of half armor for a foot tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to differentiate between the functional and the
artistic,'' he said. ``People need to be reminded that historically
this was not the case. Armor is a wonderful reminder of the
confluence of art and craft.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of this century, when Cleveland was one of
the nation's great iron and steel centers, the museum's first
director, Frederic Allen Whiting, believed that a collection of
armor _ annealed, hammered, assembled and decorated by hand _ would
inspire the city's craftsmen.
</P>
<P>
   Whiting found a donor, the philanthropist John L. Severance, and
then tried for several years to find a private collection that
could be purchased. Months before the museum opened on June 6,
1916, Whiting was able to purchase the armor collection of Frank G.
Macomber, a wealthy Bostonian.
</P>
<P>
   The entire shipment was lost in transit. Railroad officials
searched, but the collection had vanished. Whiting's own efforts
failed. Dejected, he took the train back to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   As he lay in his berth, unable to sleep, and looking out the
window, he noticed a boxcar sitting on a siding near Geneva, Ohio.
He ordered the railroad crew to inspect the car, and the arms and
armor were found. But to his chagrin, the collection had been
disassembled and packed helter-skelter.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the opening, Bradford Dean, the first professional
curator of arms and armor at an American museum, the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, arrived from New York to help. He took off his coat,
and, it is said, attacked the puzzle of hundreds of unconnected
pieces of iron strewn over the Armor Court's floor. The museum and
the exhibition opened on schedule, and Clevelanders jammed the
streets to see it.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, the regimental flags, damaged by ultraviolet light
from the skylight, had to be removed. In 1959, a re-examination of
pieces in the collection found 35 percent to be either forgeries or
of such poor quality that they had to be removed. These included
all three equestrian pieces, the children's favorites. But in 1964,
the Metropolitan Museum lent, and later sold, the Cleveland museum
the Italian armor for man and horse that is the focal point of the
newly refurbished exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The Armor Court, however, continued to deteriorate. Sentiment
against the Vietnam War was one reason, museum officials say.
Pieces were taken out of the display and put in storage. Unrelated
items were moved in. Clevelanders complained.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he arrived in 1993, Bergman asked Stephen N.
Fliegel, the museum's assistant curator of medieval art, to help
him restore the armor collection ``beyond its original glory.''
They went to the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund, which wanted to
help museums expand their audiences and create new programs
designed around their permanent collections. The Cleveland Museum
was one of 29 fine arts museums to receive a grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also thought it would be wonderful to invite a number of
the great armories of Europe to participate with a piece or two
from their collections,'' Bergman said. To his surprise and
delight, museums in Stockholm, Dresden, London, Leeds and Vienna
said yes.
</P>
<P>
   On loan from the Imperial Armories in Vienna is the massive
armor made in 1495 for the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I,
intended for a form of jousting practiced only in Germanic
countries that eliminated the wooden wall that normally separated
two mounted combatants. This raised the risk of a dangerous
collision.
</P>
<P>
   The headpiece, aptly known as a ``frog-mouthed'' helmet is
bolted to the body armor, and the eye slot is hidden behind the
huge mouthpiece. The wearer had to lean forward slightly to see,
then straighten up and strike blindly just before impact.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the scale, also from Vienna, is the
diminutive armor worn for dressing up by Karl von Burgau
(1560-1618), the son of Archduke Ferdinand of Tyrol, when he was
about 8 or 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something compelling about knights in shining armor,''
Fliegel said. ``It projects certain values that are eternal:
protecting the weak, courage, self-sacrifice.'' Armor is also one
of the few art forms, he said, ``that captures the physical form of
a historical individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Fliegel, who wrote the exhibition's catalog, ``Arms and Armor,''
said that early European armor was made of mail, small interlinked
rings of steel, and was extremely expensive. In 805, an edict of
Charlemagne linked the right to own land to an obligation to own a
mail shirt. At the time of the Norman Conquest in 1066, the price
of such a shirt was roughly the cost of a war horse.
</P>
<P>
   When the crossbow rendered mail ineffective, before 1400, it was
replaced by plate armor, ``as simple as sculpture,'' Bergman
observed, pointing to the body-fitting curves designed to ward off
blows. ``That is what is so powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Although armor is generally associated with the Middle Ages,
``most of the armor that survives comes from the Renaissance and
was made after 1480,'' Fliegel said. During the Renaissance,
``armor became male costume, the most expensive form ever
devised.'' Some was etched. Some was gilded with gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are presenting the material in the context of art,''
Fliegel added. ``Yes, it's about military history, but it's also
about art, fashion and taste.''
</P>
<P>
   The weight of a suit of armor here averages 70 to 80 pounds, and
many riders could actually vault onto their horses, Fliegel said.
Many suits of armor had flexible joints and were cushioned with
fabric so they did not clank. But armor could be very hot to wear,
and it rusted.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more beautiful pieces on display is a heavy suit of
cavalry armor made in 1650. ``Already they were using muskets,''
Fliegel said. ``Within 20 years, armor was abandoned on the
battlefield.''

 (ATTN: Ill.)   (For release Sunday, Oct. 4)  
 (Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.)  
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Being president,'' a wag said a generation ago, playing on a
dreamy definition of love, ``means never having to say you're
sorry.'' That truism no longer applies.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's ``campaign of  &UR; contrition &LR; '' began in his
ill-received Aug. 17 expression of  &UR; regret &LR; . That did not go down
well, because  &UR; regret &LR;  (though possibly rooted in the Old Norse
 &UR; grata &LR; , ``to weep,'' also the curious source of  &UR; greet &LR; ) has
become the mildest form of sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Regret &LR;  is what we express, often insincerely, in turning down
an invitation. In diplomacy, it is the cool acknowledgment of
error; in the acceptance of resignations, it is usually married to
the adjective  &UR; deep &LR;  in a formal wave of farewell.
</P>
<P>
   Deeper than  &UR; deep &LR;  is  &UR; profound &LR; . In Moscow two weeks later,
Clinton said, ``I was expressing my  &UR; profound regret &LR;  to all who
were hurt,'' adding that he had asked to be forgiven, though nobody
could find that direct request in his previous remarks. That was
not accepted widely as sufficient to express sorrow, either,
perhaps because of its formal or bookish quality.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in Ireland, came ``I am very  &UR; sorry &LR; .'' That made
front-page headlines.  &UR; Sorrow &LR;  is stronger than  &UR; regret &LR; , though
not as wrenching as  &UR; grief &LR;  or as tortured as  &UR; anguish &LR; . In its
adjectival form,  &UR; sorry &LR;  (from the 725 ``Beowulf'' as Old English
 &UR; sarig &LR; , ``distressed, sore'') can denote a general state of
sadness and, in this case, was combined with an implied admission
of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Though not as formal as an  &UR; apology &LR; , the expression ``being
 &UR; sorry &LR; '' is considered synonymous with ``being  &UR; apologetic &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this was not considered a sufficient expression of
 &UR; contrition &LR; . That word, from the Latin  &UR; conterere &LR; , ``to grind,
bruise,'' has a theological connotation, as a realization of a
failure to respond to God's grace. To be  &UR; contrite &LR;  is a necessary
state before the absolution of sin.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his advisers saw the need to differentiate
between  &UR; remorse &LR; , the prolonged self-reproach often expressed in
hopes of shortening the sentence after commission of a crime, and
 &UR; contrition &LR;  and  &UR; penitence &LR; , which deal with forgiveness after
confessing a sin.
</P>
<P>
   Immorality is forgivable, illegality punishable; it was in
Clinton's interest to focus attention on the sins of lying and
adultery, which can be forgiven after confession and repentance,
rather than crimes of perjury or obstruction of justice, which can
result in impeachment and prosecution. That was why he adopted
 &UR; wrong &LR;  rather than  &UR; unlawful &LR; , accepting  &UR; indefensible &LR;  and
rejecting  &UR; perjurious &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Hence, ``I don't think there is a fancy way to say I have
 &UR; sinned &LR; ,'' he told the national prayer breakfast, and ``I have
 &UR; repented &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   And so we reach full linguistic circle. Both  &UR; penitence &LR;  and
 &UR; repentance &LR; , like  &UR; penance &LR;  and  &UR; penitentiary &LR; , are rooted in the
Latin  &UR; paenitere &LR; , ``to cause or feel regret.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's defenders came roaring back to attack the Starr
report as  &UR; salacious &LR; . This means ``lustful, lecherous,'' from the
Latin  &UR; salire &LR; , to jump or spurt,'' and originated in ``Familiar
Letters,'' by James Howell, who noted in 1645 that Venus, goddess
of pleasure, ``was ingendred in the froth of the sea,'' which
``makes fish more  &UR; salacious &LR;  commonly than flesh.'' (And I always
though it was brain food.)
</P>
<P>
   Synonyms like  &UR; lewd &LR; ,  &UR; lecherous &LR; ,  &UR; lustful &LR; ,  &UR; libidinous &LR; 
(words disapproving of sex often begin with  &UR; l &LR; ) were rarely flung
at the independent counsel's report; the chosen terms were
 &UR; pornographic &LR;  (from the Greek  &UR; porne &LR; , ``whore'') and  &UR; salacious &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   REPREHENDING
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the president's behavior was  &UR; reprehensible &LR; ,'' said
Rep. James Maloney, D-Conn. Feeling the need to save his
constituents the time it takes to look up unfamiliar words, he
added, `` &UR; Reprehensible &LR;  means `deserving of rebuke.'''
</P>
<P>
   He uses the Random House Unabridged, which defines the word as
``deserving of reproof, rebuke, or censure; blameworthy.'' The
synonym is  &UR; culpable &LR; .  &UR; Reproof &LR;  is criticism administered gently;
 &UR; rebuke &LR;  is sterner stuff, and  &UR; censure &LR;  is official condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   TOPSY
</P>
<P>
   ``As the only African-American in the United States Senate,''
writes Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, ``I hope I am not overly
sensitive to notice a tendency by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
in statements on the Senate floor to allude to a fictional slave
girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Moseley-Braun notes with disapproval the majority leader's
frequent use of the phrase ``grown like Topsy'' about the number of
amendments added to bills. She points out that Topsy is a character
in Harriet Beecher Stowe's 1852 novel, ``Uncle Tom's Cabin.'' When
asked by Miss Ophelia, ``Have you heard anything about God, Topsy?
... Do you know who made you?'' the child with twinkling eyes
replies: ``Nobody, as I knows on. I spect I grow'd. Don't think
nobody never made me.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the widely used Americanism  &UR; grown like Topsy &LR;  to be marked
off-limits as offensive, a racial slur to be expunged from the
national discourse?
</P>
<P>
   The word  &UR; topsy &LR;  entered the English language in 1528 as part of
the assonant adverb  &UR; topsy-turvy &LR; . At first it meant ``in an
inverted position,'' or ``upside down'' (originally  &UR; up-so-down &LR; )
and came to mean ``confused or disordered.'' The novelist, Mrs.
Stowe, may or may not have had that in mind when naming her
character; the passage makes the point of an innocent child's lack
of religious direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' with its character of Simon Legree as the
cruel white overseer, was the most passionate abolitionist book of
its era. No less an authority than Abraham Lincoln, when greeting
Mrs. Stowe at the White House, said, ``So you're the little woman
who wrote the book that made this great war!''
</P>
<P>
   An Americanism that arose from that anti-slavery source, now
used with the source almost forgotten, cannot be twisted into a
racial slur, even in an election year. Even the dialect has been
removed:  &UR; grow'd &LR;  has been changed to the Standard English  &UR; grown &LR; 
in  &UR; grown like Topsy &LR; . The Oxford English Dictionary's definition
is the clear meaning today: ``something that seems to have grown of
itself without anyone's intention or direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as  &UR; rule of thumb &LR;  was mistakenly seized on by feminists
looking for controversy, Sen. Moseley-Braun's concern is misplaced.
She is indeed overly sensitive to this usage, and I spect she knows
it.

   GEORGES-MAIN _ Assessing damages, continuing problems, cleanup,
etc. No longer a hurricane, Tropical Storm Georges remained a
menace to the Gulf Coast today, bringing rain, more rain and
uncertainty about the full magnitude of the damage the
well-traveled tempest had wrought. The rain continued, and along
with it the threat of floods and tornadoes. More than 678,000
customers were without power across the coast. Tornados have been
reported in Alabama but no major damage. Days will pass before some
of the multitudes of evacuees return to their homes. (Williams,

   NASA-UT-RADIATION _ NASA annnounced Tuesday in Washington that
one night last month _ confirming a UT researcher's 6-year- old

hitting the Earth collided with part of the upper atmosphere
(including over the western U.S.) It was invisible gamma rays from
a supermagnetic star 20,000 light years away called a magnetar. The
event lasted five minutes, set off scientific sensors and is
believed to have significantly reduced the range of high-powered
radio stations. Scientists say the radiation never reached the
ground and would have had no more health effect than a dental X-ray
if it had but it was dramatic evidence of Earth's pontential
vulnerability. (Stanley, Austin American-Statesman)

is at about the national average or better than average in putting
computers to use in classrooms. But the nation as a whole _ and
this seems to apply to Georgia too _ is approaching a place where
it now must face questions of what it is trying to accomplish with
this expensive enthusiasm and whether those goals are being met.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Michel Richard strode into his kitchen at
Citronelle one morning last week and announced, ``I want to make
French toast.'' Just French toast?
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Richard and his playful way with food could only
imagine what he had in store for these two slices of ordinary white
bread. He stuffed them with a slice of creme brulee, welded them
together with a paste of confectioners' sugar and water, then
dipped the ``sandwich'' in beaten egg and sauteed it in butter.
Finally he dusted it with confectioners' sugar and browned it with
a blowtorch.
</P>
<P>
   But he was not pleased. He blamed the quality of the bread: too
thick and soggy. He tried again, without soaking the bread. Still
not up to his standards. ``I want to try it with apple,'' he said.
``Next time when you come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning he was at it again, this time with caramelized
apples in between two very thin slices of bread and no egg dip.
Finally, it was coming together. Richard was onto something.
</P>
<P>
   Moving from one experiment to another, he soon had his chef de
cuisine, Stephan Beauvallet, poaching fish in olive oil. Then he
was spooning lemon olive oil over vanilla ice cream. Impossible to
explain why, but it tasted superb. That's Michel Richard.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most admired chefs in the country, Richard (the name
is pronounced ree-SHAR) has come east from Los Angeles, where his
restaurant Citrus is still very popular. His dream is to turn
Washington into a city known for its food. It's a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   But with his remarkable creativity and pure, clean flavors, he
may succeed where all others have failed. The brilliance of the
food has already marked it for success. George Sape, lawyer,
serious wine collector and board member of the James Beard House,
goes to Citronelle whenever he stays here overnight. ``It is as
good as my favorite restaurants in New York,'' he said. ``His
knowledge, his experience, his attention to quality are the equal
of Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Daniel Boulud.''
</P>
<P>
   Washingtonians seem enthusiastic, too _ as enthusiastic as they
get about any restaurant that isn't a steakhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and his wife, Joan, had dinner at
Citronelle last week. ``I'm a big roast beef man,'' the senator
said. ``I like the Prime Rib and the Capital Grille,'' he added,
referring to two Washington steakhouses. ``Aside from roast beef,
this is as good as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard is undaunted. ``You have to understand the market,'' he
said. ``You have to give them what they want, but you don't have to
give them bad food. My dream is that Washington will become a
national destination for food.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, he says, he'll move to New York. But it is clear that
Richard would be content to become king of the hill right here.
</P>
<P>
   From olive oil with ice cream to foie gras in a black bean mole
sauce, he is always pushing the boundaries of his cooking. He
carries a large artist's sketchbook that he fills with hundreds of
ideas: He thinks about new dishes while he is driving, on vacation,
even while he is still working on another creation at his
restaurant. Some of his imaginings are accompanied by full-color
sketches.
</P>
<P>
   His creativity is matched by his demand for perfection. Each
plate of food, casual though it may look, reflects the rigor of the
pastry chef that Richard once was.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he is making jokes, even when he is in the middle of
an interview, he will stop in his tracks to get a closer look at
something he has spotted from afar that doesn't meet his standards.
For a man of his girth _ he works out daily with a trainer _ he is
amazingly fleet of foot as he race-walks to the stove to check on a
piece of fish one of his cooks is tending or hurries to the front
of the kitchen because he notices that the needle-thin strips of
apple on top of a dish have not been peeled.
</P>
<P>
   Then he's off to tell another cook that the mushroom dressing on
the truffled chicken rolls is too thick, before reaching up to
straighten a slightly crooked light fixture. He switches from
French to English and from full alert to parade rest in
milliseconds.
</P>
<P>
   Late one morning last week, Richard was sitting in the kitchen,
looking quite relaxed with the top of his chef's jacket unbuttoned.
As he exuded his usual energy and enthusiasm, describing the way he
cooks and creates, his body suddenly snapped to attention:
``Something's burning,'' he said. ``What's burning? Ca brule?''
</P>
<P>
   Only when he got the answer _ no _ did he relax and return to an
exploration of how he comes up with ideas like scrambled eggs with
lobster and caviar served in an eggshell _ ideas that are at once
playful and serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with food,'' he said. ``It's like a
painter. You have to have the flavor in your head and want to
translate it to the pot.'' Much of his cooking is based on a stable
of sauces. But none of the expected ones; instead, they are made of
porcini with walnuts, calamari, endive, horseradish or saffron.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who has lighted up the New York sky
with his four restaurants, is a great fan. ``He's fantastic,'' he
said. ``He knows how to combine things _ the look, the flavor. His
food is very layered, but it is simple and precise. He's very
technical because he was a pastry chef.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard, 50, takes his inspiration not only from books but also
from his childhood, from the passing remarks of customers, from
things he has eaten and, of course, from his fertile imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two loves,'' he said. ``My wife and my profession. I'm
not sure which is my mistress.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever restless and curious, Richard came to the United States
from France to open a New York branch of the famous Parisian bakery
Le Notre in 1974. (``A few years too soon,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   At Citronelle, he is never content with the menu. He changes it
daily. And now that he has moved permanently from California to
Washington, his food, he says, is in transition.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The East Coast is different,'' he said. ``They're not scared
about butter. They still love French food. I can use more game.
There is a better and greater variety of fish. People in California
are scared of food. People are more excited about food here. If I
try new recipes here, we sell it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Really? In Washington? The most buttoned-down city on the East
Coast, where most people go out to expensive restaurants for
business, not to savor the food?
</P>
<P>
   Richard shrugged. ``I love this town,'' he said. ``Maybe it's
because I'm French. It's gorgeous here. It reminds me of my youth.
It rains and there are green trees over the road. There is a little
fog. I love the change of seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard opened Citronelle in the Latham Hotel in Georgetown five
years ago, to great acclaim. It was part of a small chain he hoped
would bring security for his family _ the kind that owning a single
restaurant could not. But he spent most of his time traveling, and
as chef after chef moved through the Washington Citronelle, it went
down, down, down.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last year, he sold half his interest in Citrus to Meristar
Corp., his partner in the Washington and Santa Barbara Citronelles,
and decided to make the restaurant here his flagship and give it
his full-time attention. After a $2 million renovation, it reopened
seven months ago. With his constant presence, its fortunes have
revived.
</P>
<P>
   Even steak fanciers could learn to love Richard's simplicity.
``I don't want too many flavors in my mouth,'' he said. ``Three or
four. After that, it is too complicated for me to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   His small salad of yellow and red tomatoes and tips of asparagus
dressed with a vinaigrette that has been mixed with the juice of
French peas epitomizes his philosophy. Each ingredient is pristine;
the flavors blend, but none overwhelm. The sweetness of the peas
adds a delightful foil to the acidity of the vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   Steak-and-potatoes types will certainly understand the sauce,
still unnamed, that he based on his memory of the taste of the
scrapings from the bottom of a pan of roasted potatoes. On this
morning, he was experimenting with potatoes, onions, garlic and
thyme, roasting them in the oven until the mixture was deeply
caramelized. Then the mixture was cooked in chicken stock on top of
the stove. ``I think the potatoes will thicken the sauce,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   When it was finished he lovingly dipped his spoon into it and
decided it needed a bit more acidity. ``I made it five or six times
already,'' he said. ``This is the first time I like it _ I like the
country taste.'' Served with sauteed sea bass on a plate with a
ribbon of mashed potatoes and a small pile of all the sauce's
vegetables, it would make anyone who ever loved a Sunday dinner of
potatoes, roasted meat and gravy remember that final savory bite,
when everything is mashed together. Now Richard has to think up a
name that sounds a bit more enticing than potato sauce.
</P>
<P>
   He had hardly finished his bass and potato sauce before he was
back at the stove to work on his version of Chicken McNuggets:
chicken fillets breaded with flour, egg and then kataifi _ shreds
of phyllo dough, which he had seasoned with grated orange peel. He
fried some in clarified butter and some in duck fat, but the duck
fat version masked the other flavors. He was not quite satisfied
and tried the fried chicken with several of the sauces he keeps on
hand. Finally the orange sauce tasted about right but needed
ginger. The next night he had also added some hot sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Richard began his career as pastry chef only because he was told
that before he could become a regular chef he had to be a pastry
chef. He was born in Brittany and raised in Champagne, and he
cooked for his mother and four brothers and sisters from age 7.
When he was 9, he participated in the French equivalent of the
Fresh Air Fund: He spent two weeks with a wealthy family. One day
he was taken to see the father's restaurant. ``When he opened the
kitchen door and I saw chefs with white hats, oh my God, it was
gorgeous,'' he said. ``I fell in love with it.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 14, he was an apprentice baker, and after a
stint in the French army he found a job at Le Notre in Paris. He
was sent to New York to open the bakery's short-lived branch, but
he left before it closed, lured to Santa Fe, N.M., by a hotel owner
who wanted him to take over the pastry shop. ``I didn't want to go
back to Paris,'' he said. ``It was a matter of pride. I wanted to
try this country. There is so much opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1977 he was in Los Angeles, where he opened another pastry
shop that also served meals. With the money he had earned, he
fulfilled a lifelong dream, to eat in France's three-star
restaurants. But that trip only solidified his desire to move
beyond pastry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tired of using dead ingredients _ sugar, flour,
butter,'' he said. ``I was in love with fresh vegetables, fresh
fish. So I trained and trained myself to be a chef _ for 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 he opened Citrus, which was hot for about five years and
is still highly rated. ``I knew Citrus would not be a success
forever,'' he said. ``It would not succeed like Wolfgang,'' he
added, in a reference to the chef Wolfgang Puck. But last year he
decided it was time to try something new, and he moved to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   What about Washington's reputation as a city that judges a
restaurant more on who's eating than what they're eating?
</P>
<P>
   Well ... last Wednesday night, when Richard entered the dining
room at the end of the evening, the patrons greeted him with a
round of applause.

   LAMB WITH EGGPLANT CAVIAR
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Michel Richard
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes, plus at least 4 hours' refrigeration, for
marinating
</P>
<P>
   6 large cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 lamb loins, 8 to 10 ounces each (see note) or rib eyes from
two lamb racks, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 pounds total, trimmed of all fat and
membranes
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for sprinkling
</P>
<P>
   2 fresh rosemary sprigs, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 fresh thyme sprigs, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Nonstick vegetable oil spray, or vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds eggplant, peeled and minced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced fresh lemon grass
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar.
</P>
<P>
   1. Peel and mince 2 cloves of the garlic. In a medium bowl,
combine the minced garlic, lamb loins, 1/4 cup of the olive oil,
the rosemary and the thyme. Turn the lamb to coat well with the oil
and herbs. Cover, and refrigerate at least 4 hours, or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   2. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Remove the herb sprigs and most
of the garlic from the lamb. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Place a heavy nonstick ovenproof skillet (large enough to hold the
lamb without crowding) over medium-high heat, and coat surface with
vegetable oil. Add the lamb and brown well on all sides, about 10
minutes. Transfer the skillet to the oven, and roast until
medium-rare, 25 to 30 minutes. While the lamb is roasting, prepare
the eggplant caviar.
</P>
<P>
   3. Peel and mince the remaining 4 cloves of garlic, and set
aside. Place the minced eggplant onto the top rack of a prepared
steamer, and steam over high heat just a few minutes, until tender.
Remove from the heat, and transfer to a bowl. Add the minced
garlic, 1/2 cup olive oil, cumin, lemon grass, lime juice and
sugar. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and mix well. Set
aside and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   4. To serve, divide the eggplant caviar equally among 4 serving
plates. Slice each loin into 4 pieces. Top each plate with 2 slices
of lamb loin, and sprinkle with the extra virgin olive oil. Serve
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Note: If using loins, ask the butcher to make 3 equally spaced
cuts through the large bone of each loin, so the loins can be
sliced into chops after roasting.
</P>
<P>
   SEA BASS WITH MASHED POTATOES
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Michel Richard
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 1/2 hours
</P>
<P>
   8 large russet potatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 large onions, peeled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   6 garlic cloves, with peel
</P>
<P>
   2 fresh thyme sprigs
</P>
<P>
   4 cups, approximately, chicken stock or canned broth
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon red-wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 black sea bass fillets, 6 to 8 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons unsalted butter, coarsely chopped.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Thinly slice 4 potatoes with the
skin on, and set aside. In a medium casserole over medium-low heat,
melt the butter, and add the onion and garlic. Saute until the
onions are browned, about 10 minutes. Add the sliced potatoes and
thyme, and saute 5 minutes more. Cover, and transfer to oven. Bake,
stirring twice during cooking, until potatoes are well browned,
about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   2. Prepare the sauce: Remove potatoes from oven, and cover
generously with chicken stock. Place casserole over medium heat,
and simmer until the stock is brown and slightly thickened. Pour
the sauce through a strainer into a heatproof bowl. Reserve about 1
cup of the cooked sliced potatoes for garnish, and discard the
remainder or reserve for another use. Add the vinegar to the sauce,
and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   3. Peel and quarter the 4 remaining potatoes. Place them in a
medium saucepan, and cover with cold water. Add 1 teaspoon of salt.
Bring to a boil over high heat; then reduce heat and simmer until
the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. While the potatoes are
simmering, prepare the sea bass fillets.
</P>
<P>
   4. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a large skillet, heat olive
oil until sizzling. Add the fillets, skin side down, to crisp the
skin, 1 or 2 minutes. Transfer the fillets to a baking sheet, and
finish cooking in the oven until they are white and flaky, about 8
minutes. Remove from oven, and cover with foil to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   5. In a small saucepan, heat the cream just until steaming;
remove from heat. Drain the simmered potatoes, and place a
large-holed sieve over the saucepan. Using a wooden mallet with an
up-and-down motion, mash the potatoes through the sieve. Stir in
the butter a few pieces at a time. Add the warm cream in a thin
stream, and mix well. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   6. To serve: on each of four plates, position a sea bass fillet
next to a mound of mashed potatoes. Garnish the fillet with a small
mound of reserved sliced potatoes. Top the fillet and potatoes with
potato sauce, and serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

 &HT;    Living history village of Brattonsville is window into
plantation life
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCCONNELLS, S.C. _ Authenticity is the key word at Historic
Brattonsville, a living history village that straddles a quiet
two-lane country road in the red clay hills upstate. Even the farm
animals are rare breeds descended from 19th-century livestock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hogs are half Ossabaw Island, half Arkansas razorback,
which is as close to the old-style breed as you can get,'' says
straw-hatted interpreter Duane Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the hogs, there are 16 Cotswold sheep, 11 khaki Campbell
sheep, six gray Toulouse geese, four Devon milking cows, three
Dominque chickens and two mules _ but no partridge is a pear tree.
</P>
<P>
   Historic Brattonsville offers a glimpse of 18th- and
19th-century rural life through its 28 historic buildings on 150
acres in rural York County. The area is part of the state's Old
English District, a name that refers to the region's early
settlement by the English in the mid-1700s and to the Revolutionary
War battles fought here, including the Battle of Huck's Defeat
waged less than a half mile away from the Bratton homestead.
</P>
<P>
   Brattonsville is not a resort _ there's no hotel or restaurants.
It is a working plantation: a window to the past and a testament to
a way of life that has long since been supplanted by supermarkets,
highways and the Internet. The day-to-day work on the plantation
demonstrates the self-sufficiency of farm life. Crops are planted
each spring, tended through the summer and harvested in the fall.
Sheep are shorn. Wool is spun and woven into blankets.
</P>
<P>
   A stroll through the restored village and interpretive area
takes visitors on a journey through the past _ from a rustic,
dirt-floor backwoods cabin in the woods built by pioneers in the
1750s and the slightly more upscale McConnell Cabin to the circa
1780 Col. John Bratton Home and finally to the circa 1823 Homestead
House built by Col. Bratton's son, J.S., a medical doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding the white clapboard antebellum house with its
unusual detached brick dining hall are outbuildings including a
slave cabin, brick kitchen and Bratton's medical office, filled
with herbal remedies plucked from the gardens outside the building.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, things were fairly slow at Historic
Brattonsville. Between farm chores, Smith was using period tools to
craft a wooden harrow for plowing. Pat Veasey, in the role of the
plantation mistress, was spinning wool at a wheel in the kitchen _
``keeping occupied while waiting for the pot to boil.''
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen, she says, is ``the heartbeat of the plantation.''
</P>
<P>
   The costumed interpreters are so in tune with the past, it's
easy to understand how children might imagine them to be actual
relics of a bygone age.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really surprised to find out we don't live here,''
says Sarah O'Rourke, a home-schooled 16-year-old who weaves and
sometimes portrays a teacher in the one-room school.
</P>
<P>
   We found Brattonsville volunteers Kitty Wilson-Evans and Mozell
Robinson, both retired schoolteachers, in the reconstructed brick
slave cabin. They portray two of the 138 slaves that worked on
Bratton's plantation.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson-Evans was stringing seed pods _ also called Job's tears.
``What I am making is jewelry,'' explains Wilson-Evans in the
persona of Kessie, the plantation seamstress. The necklace she wore
was strung chestnut. Such natural jewelry had an important role.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a slave on the plantation liked a girl, he would give it to
her to let her know he had feelings for her,'' Wilson-Evans
informs.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson as Paulina the cook was threading green beans to make
``leather britches,'' beans that are dried and used an ingredient
in soup or cooked with fatback as a side dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to make do with what they had,'' says Robinson.
``This is one creative way of preserving your green beans.''
</P>
<P>
   They explained how rag dolls were sewn from scraps of cloth and
toes of old socks would be stuffed to make balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like what we do,'' says Robinson. ``It's history and it
brings back things I remember from when I was a child. My
grandfather used to make white oak baskets. It makes us think of
things that made us happy when we were young. It all comes
together.'' Neither woman apologizes for portraying slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of our history,'' Wilson-Evans says, ``and it's a
part of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson adds: ``It's not just African-American history, it's
American history.''

 &HT;    Theatrical thriller follows formula of Stine's Goosebumps
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ His name is Slappy. He's a dummy. An evil dummy, in
fact, but that's not what strikes fear nightly in Rupert Holmes'
heart.
</P>
<P>
   It's Slappy's sudden growth spurt that does it. The one that
sees him more than double in size, to a height of about 14 feet,
his 20-pound head and 10-pound (each) hands somehow supported by a
stilt-walking circus clown inside the costume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hold my breath every night at that moment,'' confesses
Holmes, the writer and director of ``Goosebumps Live on Stage,''
which has its world premiere Thursday at the Fox Theatre in
Atlanta. ``It's a wonderful moment, but to pull it off successfully
_ I don't think anybody understands how difficult it is.''
</P>
<P>
   He is still talking about Slappy, right? After all, what Holmes
and company are attempting to do here _ pumping more air into the
already monster-size franchise of ``Goosebumps'' kids books _ is
fraught with as much peril as possibility.
</P>
<P>
   As caretakers of the best-selling children's book series of all
time (vanquishing, among others, Nancy Drew and the not so Hardy
Boys), the ``Goosebumps'' producers know their efforts will be
closely scrutinized by the millions of mostly 7- to 13-year-olds
(and their parents) who snatch up each new title (such as ``Say
Cheese and Die'') as soon as it rolls off the presses _ two every
month.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it just young readers whose expectations they're trying
to meet. It's young theatergoers, many of whom will be getting
their first exposure to a play, performed live and without benefit
of special effects screaming across a 70mm screen at the local
multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if they pull it off, the ``Goosebumps'' team says, they
won't just fill up theaters. They'll change theater as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to create a whole new genre of theater,''
explained co-producer Kenneth Feld. ``We think that this is the
first stage play that's been created for families. There have been
musicals, like `Annie.' But this is new.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, this is also a little hype. Maybe that's to be
expected from a man who, if he's not P.T. Barnum reincarnated, at
least lives in his old neighborhood. Along with other big ``arena''
shows (``Disney on Ice''), Feld Entertainment also produces the
Ringling Brothers and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus.
</P>
<P>
   But you must really have to believe in something to undertake a
major commitment such as ``Goosebumps Live on Stage'' represents.
The $6 million production is scheduled to tour the country for
nearly two years, starting in Atlanta and charging $16 to $36 for
tickets at a time when such Broadway ``family'' shows as ``The Lion
King'' and ``Beauty and the Beast'' demand up to $75.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get really sucked into the romance, the `We gotta play
New York' mentality,'' said ``Goosebumps'' co-producer John
Brielle, who says the show needs ``time and nourishment'' right now
and will make it to New York at some point. ``Financially, too,
we're creating a new genre. If you have a $65 ticket, Mom and Dad
might have to leave some of the kids at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if there's anything the American public doesn't need to
be sold on, it seems, it's ``Goosebumps.'' The franchise began
growing to Slappyesque proportions almost from the moment in 1992
that New York writer R.L. Stine introduced his kid-pleasing formula
of funny, scary storytelling in ``Welcome to Dead House.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one more books followed, featuring titles like ``Revenge
of the Lawn Gnomes'' with cliffhangers at the end of each chapter;
more recently, Stine (who writes everything himself, at the rate of
20 pages a day, six days a week) has introduced ``Goosebumps Series
2000'' for young teens as well as the ``Give Yourself Goosebumps''
and ``Goosebumps Presents'' series.
</P>
<P>
   There's a ``Goosebumps'' TV series. ``Goosebumps'' videos. Even,
God help us, ``Goosebumps'' interactive sound T-shirts. So why not
``Goosebumps Live on Stage''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a great idea,'' Stein, whom Feld first
approached about a year ago, said recently by telephone from New
York. ``I told Rupert, `Make 'em scream! Make 'em scream and make
'em laugh!'''
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that simple. Stine may have been enthusiastic
about the idea, but he had neither the theater experience nor the
time needed to write the play. And it was going to be a real play _
although Feld admits they could have taken an easier route.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have done this as a `head' show,'' Feld said, using
the verbal slang for shows that feature singing and dancing
costumed versions of popular children's characters. ``But
(``Goosebumps'') is a story about storytelling, and we felt that
that could only be accomplished in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``A kick line of Slappys couldn't quite make it,'' Feld
continued wryly. ``It had to be a play.''
</P>
<P>
   But who would write it? Years earlier, Feld had seen a one-man
play starring Stacy Keach called ``Solitary Confinement.'' That
playwright might be capable of turning ``Goosebumps'' into a family
show that was scary, but not grizzly. Whoever he was.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Stines. The author and his wife knew that Feld's
mystery man was Holmes, the Tony Award-winning playwright (``The
Mystery of Edwin Drood''), pop musician (``The Pina Colada Song'')
and creator of the Cable ACE-nominated TV series ``Remember WENN.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't know Holmes, but Brielle did. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   . Seventeen years earlier, co-producer Brielle (who also wrote
the ``Goosebumps'' music) had met Holmes briefly while both worked
on a tribute show. So he called a mutual acquaintance, the one-time
choreographer of ``Edwin Drood,'' and asked, ``Can you get me to
Rupert Holmes?''
</P>
<P>
   Coming up with a plot for ``Goosebumps Live on Stage'' was,
thankfully, somewhat less complicated. Old-time radio fans who
share a similar sense of humor, Holmes and Stine hit it off at
their first meeting. They quickly agreed that the play would
consist of three original stories. ``We've done all the books for
TV,'' Stine explained. ``We had to give the kids something new.''
The stories would be linked by a recurring element and, perhaps
more important, by what Holmes calls the distinctive ``Goosebumps
dynamics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the `Goosebumps' world, kids solve their own problems,''
explained Holmes, who read about 40 of the books before writing a
script that Stine subsequently gave him detailed notes on. ``Kids
are afraid, but they're never victims. They're scared, but they're
never paralyzed by fear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Goosebumps Live on Stage'' is the saga of the three Barton
siblings and their best friend, Skate, who are stranded in an
unfamiliar neighborhood after a school basketball game. Looking for
a phone, they wander into the Doomsday Bookshop, where old Mr.
Gander tells them stories out of a dusty old book called
``Goosebumps.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the kids end up being in the stories _ and having to
deal with everything from power-hungry lizards masquerading as
human beings, to spooks haunting an old theater and, of course,
that evil dummy who traps them in a maniacal amusement park called
``Slappy's Fun House.'' In a nearly two-hour show, there are just
as many jokes as scares, and _ parents, take note _ not all the
witticisms are aimed at the youngsters in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, as a parent, I would love to write a children's
show that I would enjoy sitting through as well,'' said Holmes,
whose sons are 11 and 9. ``Before this, I'd dreamed my great
invention for mankind someday was going to be `Barney' videotapes
with adult novels scrolling across the bottom like a stock
ticker.''
</P>
<P>
   But Holmes et al. dreamed of doing something else with
``Goosebumps'' as well. From the first scene change, when the
slightly shabby front of the Doomsday Bookshop unfolds to reveal an
oddity-crammed interior extending the full height and width of the
stage, the audience experiences the transporting power of live
theater. Two children climb a staircase as it moves across the
stage, and, suddenly, a whole new scene and setting emerges; a
character is completely recostumed by dashing through a ``changing
box''; an actor playing a stagehand moves props; and who, exactly,
is inside that gigantic Slappy outfit?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to show kids that there is a world just as exciting
and sometimes more involving than motion pictures or TV, called
theater,'' Holmes acknowledged. ``And that theater isn't simply the
next best thing to big movies. There are things theater can do to
you that nothing else can. It's like magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but it's also, like, a lot of hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before the Atlanta premiere of ``Goosebumps Live on
Stage,'' it's dress rehearsal night at Pensacola, Fla.'s Saenger
Theatre. While 150 audience members fill the front rows of seats,
much of the theater is taken up by sound boards and lighting
control panels, by technicians who talk quietly into headsets or
stare intently at computer screens. A half-dozen video cameras
record every second and angle of the performance, miles of film
that later will be edited down to 30-second clips for TV.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first complete run-through before an audience and with
all the scenery, costumes and props in place. A switchblade phone
that requires exquisite timing to operate in the opening bookshop
scene has only arrived that day, for instance. Two days earlier,
Caitlin Reilly, a Ringling Brothers clown, had come onstage in the
gigantic Slappy costume for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York, where the cast rehearsed 10 hours a day before
moving to Pensacola, Reilly, 26, had spent about two weeks learning
to walk as Slappy. Reilly already knew how to walk on the 4-foot
stilts. It was the rest of the extremely top-heavy 60-pound costume
that took getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, casting the show had taken about two months as Holmes
and the producers searched for actors who could do everything from
walking on stilts to straddling a fine line _ being totally
believable as kids, yet also having the necessary skills to play
thriller and farce.
</P>
<P>
   The results, as perhaps is to be expected with anything
involving ``Goosebumps,'' are a bit unusual: The 20ish actor
portraying youngster Josh Barton also serves as real-life legal
guardian on tour to the 17-year-old actor playing his best friend.
Meanwhile, one of two girls sharing the role of the littlest
Barton, 13-year-old Jaime Lynn Keller, is travelling with her aunt
Holly and a teddy bear wearing a ``My Heart Will Go On'' key chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I didn't have anything to remind me of home,'' said
Jaime, who's signed to a four-month contract. ``My dad had given me
a laptop, and I slept with that for awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks before the dress rehearsal, Jaime and the rest of
company moved to Pensacola, a steamy Florida Panhandle town that
offered the twin benefits of a full-sized theater to work in and a
relatively low profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're away from a world where the media has instant
accessibility,'' said John Wimbs, the show's press agent. ``If we
were in New York, you can bet there'd be a critic in there tonight,
telling people what's not together yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The dress rehearsal audience was weighted heavily toward
children, some of whose parents had won tickets in a radio contest
or were associated with the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really vibrating,'' said Milton resident Lisa Webster,
pointing to her 10-year-old son, Josh, and his cousin Shane Pudsey.
``They're much more excited about going to see this than any
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the excitement level was palpable in the lobby before
the show, helped along by the ``I Was First To Be Scared'' T-shirts
given to all the kids there _ Josh and Shane were overheard
plotting how they might each get a second one. There was also the
obligatory souvenir stand hawking everything from ``Goosebumps''
watches and flashlights to key chains and puppets.
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing, it seems, isn't for sale: A book version of the
Holmes play, written by Stine, will be distributed free to all
young audience members in most cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, it will get more kids reading,'' said Stine. ``This
is what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for now, anyway, the play's the thing. Back in the Saenger's
lobby after the dress rehearsal, a pint-sized mob scene broke out
as Holmes and most of the actors emerged to sign autographs and
answer questions. Right in the thick of things, Jimmy Howard, 14,
said he hadn't really been that interested in seeing the show
initially.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now I'm like pushing little kids out of the way to get
autographs on my (souvenir) T-shirt,'' said the self-professed
punk-rock fan, who wore a Sex Pistols jacket and a rueful grin. ``I
thought it would be some not-so-great, low-budget, rinky-dink
thing. I'll tell my friends to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Comments like those were music to the ears of the ``Goosebumps''
team the next day. From their perspective, as well, the dress
rehearsal had gone amazingly well _ mostly minor tinkering would
take place during several more preview performances in Pensacola
and Chattanooga before the official world premiere in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Stine will be at the Fox Theater on Thursday night, getting his
first official look at the stage interpretation of his beloved
series of books. And soon after, perhaps, the rest of the
``Goosebumps'' team will know if they've pulled off their attempt
at doing justice to Stine's work _ while at the same time creating
a new genre of theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major risk. Is the expectation going to be the
`head' show?'' Feld wondered aloud. ``But it's absolutely the best
thing for the integrity of the `Goosebumps' property.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's already talk about coming up with new stories
to replace these three when this tour of ``Goosebumps Live on
Stage'' has run its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think every person in America should be required to see
this,'' Holmes said pleasantly. ``And then they move on to
`Goosebumps '99.'''
</P>
<P>
   Quick, somebody go find Slappy.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Locally heavy rain and some bands of strong thunderstorms will
occur across southeastern Alabama, northern Florida and much of
Georgia as the remnants of Hurricane Georges drift slowly to the
east.
</P>
<P>
   Several inches of additional rain will fall in many areas to the
east of the low-pressure zone that marks the center of the former
hurricane. Areas of flooding will persist, especially near the Gulf
Coast where 10 to 20 inches of rain have accumulated during the
last few days. There will be a threat of a few tornadoes,
particularly where limited sunshine adds energy to the unstable air
mass over the region.
</P>
<P>
   A weakening front will bring a mixture of clouds and sun as well
as a few showers to the interior Northeast where generally mild
conditions will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a strengthening front will move quickly east from the
Great Lakes accompanied by a broken band of showers. In the wake of
the front, a surge of much cooler air will spread east from the
northern Plains. Some gusty showers will develop near the northern
Great Lakes as the chilly air moves over the warmer water.
</P>
<P>
   Strong thunderstorms will develop over the central Mississippi
Valley as a cold front encounters humid air in place over the
region. Farther west, clouds and showers will be common near the
east slopes of the central Rockies where moist breezes ascend the
sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Broken clouds, showers, and a few thunderstorms will swirl
around a low-pressure area in western Utah. Otherwise most of the
West will be mild with ample sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Bogus Wind
</P>
<P>
   Despite media hype, the gust of 172 mph recorded at Biloxi,
Miss., as Hurricane Georges came ashore on Monday was likely bogus.
At the time, sustained winds at Biloxi were 74 mph. A gust of 172
mph unrealistically exceeds wind codes, which decree that the
maximum gust for comparable sustained winds is 120 mph. A hot wire
anemometer was used at Biloxi. As winds blow over an electrically
heated wire, the wire cools. The rate at which it cools is then
converted to wind speed. If wind-driven rain breaches the
instrument, evaporation inflates cooling rates, leading to spurious
speeds.

   NEW YORK _ Is it a lost masterpiece? The subject is Kurt Weill's
so-called Jewish Oratorio, ``The Eternal Road.'' With music by
Weill, a libretto by Franz Werfel and staging by Max Reinhardt, the
work was finally staged, after delays and postponements, at the
Manhattan Opera House on Jan. 7, 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Technical and logistical problems plagued the performance,
doubling the four-hour running time of its story of a community of
European Jews fearful of a pogrom in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The production ran for several months, until its backers went
bankrupt. And then ``The Eternal Road'' vanished for more than 60
years, perhaps because its ending failed to foretell the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday at 3 p.m., the American Symphony Orchestra, led by
Leon Botstein, will open its season at Avery Fisher Hall with
``Kings and Prophecies: A Road of Promise,'' a concert adaptation
from the work's third and fourth acts.

GORDON PARKS DONATES 227 WORKS TO CORCORAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Wis.)  (mk) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gordon Parks was so pleased by the way the Corcoran
Gallery of Art put together an exhibition of his photographs that
he has given 227 of them, practically every one in the show, to the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   The show, called ``Half Past Autumn: The Art of Gordon Parks,''
is now on view at the Museum of the City of New York, where it will
continue through Nov. 1 before traveling to the Milwaukee Art
Museum. Its tour ends in 2003, after stops in 16 American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Parks' gift includes his own print of his well-known photograph
``American Gothic, Washington, D.C.,'' also known as ``Washington
D.C. government Charwoman.''
</P>
<P>
   The photograph is actually an icon of an icon, a 1942 updating
of Grant Wood's ``American Gothic.'' Instead of a Midwestern farmer
and his wife, Parks photographed a woman who cleaned floors at a
government building that housed the Farm Security Administration,
for which Parks once worked as a photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a pitchfork, Parks' subject, Ella Watson, holds a
broom and a mop. Behind her is a large American flag. Parks'
photograph presents a stoic if telling story of the role of blacks
in America at that time, especially in segregated Washington, where
the job of charwoman was one of the few open to most black women.
</P>
<P>
   Parks, too, is black, and David Levy, president and director of
the Corcoran Gallery of Art, reflected on that as he discussed the
photographer's gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very tough for a black man in photography when he
started out,'' Levy said. ``We have to regard him as a great
American hero. Here he is 85 years old and has no sense of
martyrdom or bitterness.''
</P>
<P>
   The road traveled by Parks, who is noted as well as a movie
director, was long and hard. He was born in Fort Scott, Kan., the
youngest of 15 children. His father was a poor tenant farmer and
his mother died when he was 15. Now he is donating a collection
that the Corcoran can value only in the millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Parks was a photographer for Life magazine for 20 years, and his
films include ``The Learning Tree'' and ``Shaft.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his picture of the charwoman, other notable Parks
photographs in the gift include a series for Life on crime, poverty
and gang warfare in Harlem, as well as on Paris fashions.
</P>
<P>
   The Parks gift strengthens the Corcoran's already large
collection of photographs. Such collecting was pioneered, Levy
said, by the Museum of Modern Art, the George Eastman House and the
Corcoran.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time,'' Levy said, ``photography was regarded as a
journalistic thing, hard to place in the context of art. But now,
even the Getty is getting deeply into photography, and the National
Gallery of Art has large holdings. I think we're getting over that
hump.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole experience of working with Gordon was so positive,''
Levy said. ``We really felt that we shared a great deal _ what our
mission was and what he felt was important for his work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Parks show was seen last year at the Corcoran and this year
at the Minnesota Museum of American Art in St. Paul, in addition to
the Museum of the City of New York. It will be at the Milwaukee Art
Museum from Nov. 20 to Jan. 10, and at the Detroit Institute of
Arts from Feb. 7 to April 25.

IN ISRAEL, NEW MOMENTUM SEEN IN PEACE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a land where skepticism is a national sport,
there were neither hallelujahs nor boos Tuesday following President
Clinton's intervention in the stalemated peace talks between the
Israelis and the Palestinians _ an indication that few believed
there had been a diplomatic breakthrough worth celebrating or
condemning.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even as they shrugged, many Israelis felt the rush of a
new momentum in the peace effort. And on the eve of Yom Kippur,
before they turned off their cellular phones for 24 hours, they
debated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's intentions and the
political repercussions for him if a peace agreement is reached
during the next round of three-way talks.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's right-wing supporters were horrified to hear him
publicly acknowledge his well-known but previously undeclared
willingness to turn over 13 percent more of the West Bank to
Palestinian control. They immediately announced that his political
coalition would disintegrate and new elections would be called if
an agreement is really reached.
</P>
<P>
   Many others said the prime minister could probably beat the
right wing to it and call new elections himself, confident that he
could redefine his constituency by capturing the center _ again, if
he really signs a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone agreed that in the case of this particular
agreement, the devil is in the details, particularly of a security
accord, and there was no indication that those details were any
closer to being resolved.
</P>
<P>
   What was presented by senior American officials as a diplomatic
achievement _ the 13 percent _ was seen here as old news,
repackaged as a watershed by a scandal-ridden American
administration desperate to conduct normal business. What remained
on the table were longstanding deal-breakers, like the Israeli
demand for a Palestinian crackdown on terrorist cells and the
extradition of prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pseudo event, what took place in Washington,'' said
Itamar Rabinowitz, a professor at Tel Aviv University and a former
Israeli ambassador to Washington. ``It brought the diplomatic
thesaurus to new heights. Because obviously an agreement was not
reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, leader of the opposition Labor Party, called it
nothing more than ``a kind of photo opportunity to add to the album
of each of the participants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think something important has been accomplished,'' he
said in an interview. ``Even though the attention of the Americans
is positive, both sides have lost trust in each other, and they're
waiting for the whole thing to hit the iceberg, so they can blame
each other as we all go down. But the proof of the pudding is in
the eating, so we will see in mid-October.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, have
accepted Clinton's invitation to meet again in two weeks, after a
trip here by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Natan Sharansky, Netanyahu's trade minister and a close adviser,
said that while he, too, saw no ``big breakthrough,'' he did see a
refreshed willingness on both sides to finish the deal.
</P>
<P>
   And others said they thought that they saw a new resolve in
Netanyahu to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know him personally very well, and from his body language
and his choice of words, it looks to me like he has finally made up
his mind to do this,'' said Yisrael Harel, a leader of the Yesha
Council, the political organization representing Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though I should say he is a man whose mind can be changed by
pressure because he is not a strong personality,'' Harel continued.
``Still, he sent a message to his coalition partners when he was
speaking. He said the people will be his partners, and that was an
important phrase.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was a phrase that was heard, and leaders of the National
Religious Party threatened to bring down Netanyahu's government.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Benjamin Netanyahu makes the decision to give up more land,
he will be handing Arafat the keys to a Palestinian state,'' said
Hanan Porat, a National Religious Party member of Parliament and
chairman of the Judiciary Committee. ``And that will mean new
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party, too, would consider forcing a vote of no
confidence in the prime minister, although not because of a peace
deal, which it supports, Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about 50 percent that we'll have new elections before
next May,'' he said. ``At a certain point, Netanyahu himself might
feel that instead of being pushed into an election, he wants to
initiate new elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the political calculus is uncertain, both the left and
the right are divided, and the centrist candidate whom polls have
declared most likely to beat Netanyahu _ former Chief of Staff
Amnon Lipkin-Shahak _ has not yet formally resigned from the army
or allied himself with a political party.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get a good deal, then of course there is political risk,
which should be taken,'' Sharansky said. ``But new elections are
not the only option. I am a big believer in a unity government, in
broadening the base of the government.''

SUPREME COURT TO TACKLE SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, getting an early start on its
new term, agreed Tuesday to decide whether schools may be held
liable under federal law for sexual harassment committed by one
student against another.
</P>
<P>
   The justices also said they will rule on whether the National
Collegiate Athletic Association, which governs major college
sports, must comply with a federal statute requiring equal
treatment of men's and women's sports. The high court will also
hear arguments on whether a restrictive California welfare law
violates the constitutional freedom to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Women's rights groups have been watching the three cases
closely, hoping the justices will use the appeals to broaden the
scope of federal laws against harassment and discrimination. The
justices, whose 1998-99 term begins Oct. 5, are expected to render
their decisions in the cases by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the harassment case, Aurelia Davis claims the Monroe County,
Ga., Board of Education violated Title IX of the 1972 Education
Amendments by refusing to stop a fifth-grade boy from groping and
making lewd comments to her fifth-grade daughter LaShonda. The
mother says she and her daughter told teachers of the alleged
harassment but that the instructors did nothing and in one instance
required LaShonda to sit next to the boy, identified in court
papers only as ``G.F.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled
Title IX does not apply to sexual harassment between students, even
when teachers know of the malicious behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration supports Davis' appeal. In a legal
brief, Solicitor General Seth Waxman, President Clinton's chief
spokesman before the court, urges the justices to rule that schools
may be held liable under Title IX if ``school officials knowingly
fail to remedy a sexually hostile or abusive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision to hear Davis vs. Monroe County Board of
Education follows the justices' ruling last June in a Texas school
case. In that decision, Gebser vs. Lago Vista Independent School
District, the justices decided that a district may not be held
liable under Title IX for a teacher's sexual harassment of a
student unless a school official with authority to take action knew
of the misbehavior and failed to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The NOW (National Organization for Women) Legal Defense and
Education Fund, in a brief supporting Davis' appeal, cited the
Gebser decision in telling the justices that in the new case the
teachers knew of the harassment, had the authority to stop it but
failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The high court will also consider the scope of Title IX when
they hear the NCAA's appeal of a lower court decision that the
athletic association must comply with the law. The NCAA says Title
IX applies only to educational institutions that receive federal
funds, not to independent governing bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. District Court for Western Pennsylvania agreed with the
NCAA and dismissed student volleyball player Renee Smith's claim
that the association violated Title IX by making it more difficult
for her than for male athletes to satisfy eligibility requirements.
But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia revived
Smith's lawsuit, ruling Title IX covers the NCAA because it
collects dues from colleges that receive federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   In its appeal, the NCAA argues its connection to federal funding
through dues-paying colleges is too attenuated to satisfy Title IX.
However, Smith counters the NCAA would not exist but for the money
it receives from federally funded colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's lawsuit arose when the NCAA did not allow her to play
intercollegiate volleyball as a graduate student at Hofstra
University and the University of Pittsburgh. NCAA cited its rule
barring graduate students from playing intercollegiate sports for a
school other than the one from which they received their
undergraduate degree.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who attended college at St. Bonaventure University,
argues the NCAA regularly waives its restrictive rule for male
athletes but not for women.
</P>
<P>
   In the welfare case, California Attorney General Daniel Lungren
is appealing a lower court decision that struck down a state law
requiring new residents to wait a year before they may collect
greater welfare benefits than they would have received in their old
state. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled
the law violates the constitutional right of people to travel by
discouraging welfare recipients from entering California.
</P>
<P>
   In his appeal, Lungren argues the California law is not meant to
discourage poor people from entering the state. Instead, he claims
the statute is ``rationally'' related to the ``legitimate state
purpose'' of helping poor residents get off welfare, he says.

PET SNAKES REALLY RATTLE MY CAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - (begin ital) ``Thence will I command the serpent, and
he shall bite them.'' (end ital) &QL; 
_ Amos 9:3 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's that biting part that gets me. That and the 
curling-around-your-neck-while-you're-sleeping-and-squeezing-the-bre
ath-right-out-of-you part.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite that above quote coming directly from the Bible,
some people seem to think that snakes make good pets. A co-worker
recently bought one for his son's seventh birthday. Hey, why not
throw in a pack of matches and some oily rags to go along with it?
</P>
<P>
   Call me old-fashioned, but I like a pet that wags its tail
instead of rattling it. When my dogs shed, they shed their hair,
not their skin.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes all kinds, as I discovered at the Turtle and
Tortoise Show in Phoenix over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   One section of the show was devoted, of course, to turtles,
including a mammoth Sulcata tortoise the size of a truck tire. It
was going for $1,000. Hey, at least snakes have an element of
danger, real or imagined, to keep you on your toes. A tortoise as a
pet? Why not just buy an ashtray and watch it sit on the coffee
table?
</P>
<P>
   But I was here to see snakes and the people who love them, which
sounds like a topic for Jerry Springer, although at first blush, I
don't know how he would work nudity or violence into it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Slithering idiots?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several tables were set up for displaying snakes. The adult
snakes resided in dry aquariums; babies coiled up in Cool Whip
containers with air holes in the tops. Lots of people crowded
around.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I figured your average snake fan would be a long-haired
guy in black-leather pants with flaming skull tattoos and a faded
T-shirt that says ``Iron Maiden Road Crew'' on the back. You know,
tasteful without being gaudy.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the people gathered around the tables to look at
(and hold) the snakes were just kids.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Katsilas and her two sons, Zack and Cody, were thinking
about buying a snake as a pet. As Jack the milk snake slithered
across her shoulders and down the strap of her pocketbook, Katsilas
explained the attraction:
</P>
<P>
   ``They're cool. They just slither around. They don't bark, they
don't chew anything up, they don't run away. Why would you want a
fish? They're just cool to have.''
</P>
<P>
   My wife has fish, and I've never noticed that she has to feed
them live mice, a point Katsilas conceded. Still, Katsilas and her
sons were definitely interested, though they planned to think it
over for a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cobra!'' Zack shouted when asked what kind he'd like, although
I got the idea they might start out with something a little more
pedestrian. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Serpentine attraction &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bob Caulden owns Jack (Jack's name comes from the rhyme that
reminds you of the difference between the harmless milk snake and
the dangerous coral snake, which have similar coloring: ``Red on
black, friend of Jack / Red on yellow, kill a fellow''). He wasn't
selling snakes, just showing them. In addition to Jack, he had a
couple of rattlers on display.
</P>
<P>
   So tell me, Bob, why would I want a snake as a pet?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you the honest truth _ you don't,'' he said. ``They
don't return your affection like a dog. They're about as
interesting as a pet rock as far as pets go. They're interesting
animals _ don't get me wrong. But as far as a pet goes, there's no
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a sensible fellow. On the other side of the
display, though, Robert Pelaez was selling snakes, and he was more
enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's always going to be a small segment of the
population that's going to find exotic pets attractive,'' he said.
And I thought, yeah, the same segment that rents those ``Faces of
Death'' movies. Although in fairness, I should point out that
Pelaez is, ahem, a tax accountant and looks the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you're hooked on reptiles,'' he continued, ``you're
hooked on them for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but that's not what worries me. I worry that they'll be
hooked on me. &QL;

 &HT;    COLUMN: The ins, outs of March beer and Oktoberfest
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 1: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By MIchael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In English, deciphering the 10th month in the German word
Oktoberfest presents no great difficulty. But the curious might
wonder how a beer named for March came to be the toast of October.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year when millions flock to Munich (and
other cities in Bavaria) to quaff Marzenbier, the reddish, slightly
sweet, malt-accented festival brew identified the world over with
Oktoberfest. From late September to the first Sunday in October,
tourists join Germans in the great beer halls and under the huge
tents set up by the city's historic breweries. On spits, chickens
by the thousands slowly turn, alongside rack upon rack of ribs and
countless wursts. In big kettles, dumplings, German potato salad
and red cabbage wait to be ladled onto plates. In kegs, the beer of
the season has been waiting since March.
</P>
<P>
   On that first Sunday in October, there's a big parade to
fairgrounds in Munich, and everyone picnics afterward. Over the
course of 16 days, as many as 5 million people will go to
Oktoberfest; by comparison, about 3 million visited Atlanta for the
1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunistically or not, the custom has caught on elsewhere,
with local fairs and one-night salutes to the season. Last week, as
diners at Phoenix Brewing Co. in Sandy Springs finished their
oxtail soup and prepared themselves for entrees, brewer Bob Garner
ceremonially tapped the keg and poured the first mugs of the
house's fall festbier. Most of Atlanta's brewpubs, in fact, are
offering versions of an Oktoberfest beer or Marzenbier.
</P>
<P>
   But why a March beer to celebrate October _ or even late
September?
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Marzenbiers were laid away in cool caves in late
March, this being the latest that beer could be brewed in the days
before refrigeration. These stocks were drawn from over the summer
and finished off in grand style during Oktoberfest. (Outside
Germany _ and among Americans in particular _ the fiction arose
that Oktoberfest beer and bock beers in spring were strongish
residues dredged from the bottom of the barrel. Brewers are always
amused to hear it.)
</P>
<P>
   End-of-summer festivals were an old tradition, but Oktoberfest
itself originated in 1810 as a marriage celebration. When Prince
Ludwig took the hand of Princess Theresia, the village green in
Munich became the site of a public reception that went on for days.
</P>
<P>
   But it was another 30 years before the style we call Marzenbier
came into being. In 1840 and 1841, Gabriel Sedlmayr of Munich's
Spatenbrau first brewed the style we today call Marzenbier _
full-bodied with a ``bready'' malt aroma, very little hop character
and both a sweetness and a spiciness on the palate. It's been the
beer for Oktoberfest ever since.
</P>
<P>
   These are beers well-suited to spicy dishes and to German
cuisine generally, and entirely different from, say, a pilsener.
Both are lagers, but the latter (if it's a real pilsener) is crisp,
assertive and a bit dry. A Marzenbier is softer at the edges. Its
closest cousins are the ubiquitous ``amber'' or Vienna lagers,
versatile beers that aren't quite so malty and have a touch more
hop character.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, more German brewers, including some of Munich's
oldest, have been exporting the style to the United States. At the
same time, American breweries big and small have offered beers they
variously call Oktoberfest or Marzenbier. Samuel Adams has made an
excellent interpretation of the style in recent years, and a
consumer can be certain of freshness.
</P>
<P>
   That's not always so with the imports. A sampling of four German
brands _ Paulaner, Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr and Beck's _ leaves you
thinking they must surely taste better in Munich (or Bremen in
Beck's case). Beer simply doesn't travel well. It sits in the holds
of ships and then in hot warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four, the Spaten Oktoberfest Ur-Marzen (original March
style) _ even in a green bottle that allows more light penetration
than a brown bottle _ was freshest and most complex, with a firm
maltiness that didn't become too rich. This is, in fact, one of the
world's classic beers from a brewery whose innovations in the 19th
century led to the development of lagers of every style.
</P>
<P>
   The Hacker-Pschorr was slightly dry for the style, but quite
drinkable. The Beck's was ordinary, like the rest of its lineup.
The Paulaner was maltiest and furthest on the way toward oxidation
_ a pity because Paulaner, like Spaten, is one of Munich's citadels
of brewing.
</P>
<P>
   This might seem unfair, but out of curiosity I pulled from the
fridge another German-style beer as I was sampling these four. No
roasted chicken, no rack of ribs, not even a sausage sat before me,
only cheese and crackers and the white of a pickled egg. The four
Marzens sampled, I poured the fifth into a conical glass, waited
for its head (enormous) to settle and sipped. This was a pilsener,
miles apart stylistically yet within the German family of beers. By
the second sip if not the first, I knew this was a more complex,
far more interesting beer. It was Tuppers Hop Pocket Pils, brewed
not in Munich but in Ashburn, Va., by Old Dominion Brewery.
</P>
<P>
   If in Munich, I'd be happy _ thrilled, in fact _ to do as the
Muncheners do. But I wasn't in Munich. I was in Atlanta, and it was
the Hop Pocket that I finished.

 &HT;    From Navy or no, gravy is a winner
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 1: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Maybe there's a Navy cook out there,'' Barbara Benson of
Jefferson, Georgia wrote when she requested a recipe for tomato
gravy such as the one that her husband enjoyed while in the service
in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of responses, all quite different, came in, but we
don't know whether any of them originated with a Navy cook. We just
picked two that sounded good, and our tester proved they are.
</P>
<P>
   The first uses fresh tomatoes and results in a large, 4-cup
batch of creamy, rich gravy that its sender, Alva Bentley of
Decatur, Georgia, said ``is really a winner,'' especially on a
plateful of biscuits, eggs, and bacon. The second is made with
canned tomatoes and bacon drippings and would go well with hot,
fresh corn bread. It came from Betty Printz of Rome, who said an
Alabama friend gave it to her more than 30 years ago. Her family

 &HT;    Turkish Delights: One of the world's great cuisines is enjoying
a warm reception in America
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 1: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heather, my friend who has lived on the coast of the Aegean Sea
for four years, says there are times when she gets sick of Turkish
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does get repetitive,'' she says. ``You walk into a
restaurant, and the first thing you do is look at the meze
(appetizers) and point at the ones you want.'' Point, point, point,
point, she gestures, pretending that she has her nose pressed
against yet another deli case filled with choices that have turned
ho-hum.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not there yet. Not even close. After two weeks in Turkey, I
still look at the shelves of meze and can't imagine how I'm going
to winnow the selections to a non-embarrassing amount of food: I
want it all.
</P>
<P>
   I want the mussels stuffed with rice, pine nuts and currants. I
want both the chunky fried eggplant salad and the smooth
eggplant-yogurt puree. The blood-red roasted peppers in a bath of
olive oil, hot chile and garlic. The slices of velvety cured tuna.
The salad of creamy yogurt cheese tossed with crisp, lemony
purslane.
</P>
<P>
   I have to order the fat rings of fried calamari, which are
fished locally and as sweet and tender as scallops. And I can't
resist another sigara boregi _ the slender, cigar-shaped cheese
pastry that will arrive in a minute puffed and crunchy, hot from
the oil.
</P>
<P>
   The snapshot of dining in Turkey that I take home is this:
sitting outdoors at a harborside restaurant on a balmy evening,
drinking the simple local white wine and watching a waiter deposit
these meze along with stacks of toasted crusty bread.
</P>
<P>
   It is a snapshot, not a photo essay. The seafood dishes I
sampled beside the Aegean are different from those I would find
along the Mediterranean coast to the south or up by the Black Sea.
They're unlike the European-accented stews of Istanbul, the famous
kebabs and baklava from the southeastern city of Gaziantep or the
distinctive noodles of central Anatolian cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey has a great tradition of refined cooking,'' says Joyce
Goldstein, the outspoken cookbook author (``Kitchen
Conversations,'' Morrow) and restaurateur whose San Francisco
eatery Square One spearheaded America's interest in Mediterranean
food in the 1980s. ``It's very much related to the (courtly) Moghul
style of cooking in India. But no information has gotten out here.
The Turks have had no press, no PR.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that tourism is picking up _ Turkey is one of the last
bargains in the Mediterranean region _ that may change. Americans
are coming home starry eyed, not only because of the beaches and
the ancient Greek ruins, but also because of the food.
</P>
<P>
   I certainly did. I was particularly struck by how fresh and
wholesome the everyday ingredients are. Even though Heather and her
husband, Savas, live in an upscale neighborhood in a big city and
both work full time, they still shop at an open-air market where
the glorious tomatoes, yellow figs, pears and cranberry beans are
fresh from a local farm. Where the chickens look scrawny but are
full of flavor, and the baby lamb is, as Turkish cookbook author
Ayla Algar says, ``something like a different species.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when we were on the well traveled beach-ruin route,
we'd eat at tourist buffets where belly dancers entertained people
as they lunged at steam-table meatballs. But other times we'd pull
off at one of the primitive outdoor cafes offering cop sis _
literally, ``garbage kebabs,'' but really whatever bits of skewered
meat are the house specialties.
</P>
<P>
   We went to one where plastic lawn furniture was set around a
beehive clay oven. We watched as the proprietor fired it with dry
olive branches, releasing plumes of fragrant smoke, before setting
out rounds of bread dough to rise nearby. Inside, his wife and
daughter sat side by side at low work tables on the floor by the
fireplace, rolling out gozleme, crepe-thin flatbreads that they
then filled with white cheese or ground meat, folded and slapped
over a pan in the fire. You can't imagine how good those gozleme
tasted as we ate them with tall glasses of a chilled, salted yogurt
drink called ayran.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever possible, we'd get a bowl of manti for lunch: springy,
fingernail-sized meat dumplings that look like tiny cootie
catchers. They come 30 to the bowl, are topped with yogurt and
rimmed around the sides with paprika-infused melted butter. At the
table, we added a little dried mint or hot pepper.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner though, it was meze. With meze you drink, so we'd get
a bottle of wine or a round of beers.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get too much, Heather and Savas would warn. We still have
grilled fish coming. But then, within seconds, the meze would
arrive and fill the table with a mosiac of color, and everyone was
ravenous. And the night was suddenly very young.

 &HT;    My vacation was a total wreck
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If that was a vacation, you can have vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Everything I did was wrong. Everything I touched broke.
Everything that touched me hurt. And on top of that, there was
hurricane Georges making ugly threats in front of me.
</P>
<P>
   We decided to beat the big blow to the beach, in case we needed
to board up windows and batten down such hatches as we could find.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I was put to bed at my son's house in Alford, Fla.,
because of an episode on the highway south of Columbus, Ga. (I call
it an ``episode,'' which is pure idiocy. It was a wreck _ and my
fault.) It was a matter of hitting a little red truck occupied by a
woman and a little girl, or taking to the median. I opted for the
grassy slope where my car, the best car I ever had, sullied like a
sick possum with a flat tire, a bent fender, a gone-yonder bumper
and a tail pipe stuck in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds gathered, a man with a big wrecker truck, two ambulance
people, two deputy sheriffs, a cadre of state troopers and, best of
all, a young fellow who called himself ``just a citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   He got there first, used my car phone to call the authorities,
and said, ``I'm gon' stay with you till somebody else gets here.''
He let my dog Kazan out to go to the bushes and asked if he needed
the attention of a vet.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think bouncing around in the back seat hurt Kazan, but
it played rip with a basket of stuff I had in the trunk for my
friend, Kathy Trocheck. Kathy had brought food to my bedside when I
had a heart attack, the most benign thing to happen to me lately.
</P>
<P>
   I put her pots in a basket, added some homemade jam (from Patsy
Gudger in Ellijay) and a small bottle of apple brandy. The pan in
which Kathy brought peach cobbler was twisted into an aluminum bow
knot. The apple brandy was a mess of shattered glass, smelling
dangerously alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   The man with the wrecker said, ``You can buy a new pan, but
...'' He looked at me uncertainly. Replacing the old body wouldn't
be so easy. I kept telling everybody I was perfectly fine, in
ebullient, radiant health, but I had a tendency to shake and to
want to sit down somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   When the state trooper asked me if I wanted to go to a hotel or
rent a car, I thought, ``What a brilliant idea.'' All that had
occurred to me so far was to just sit there by the roadside until
somebody came and got me.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I saw my car into the Uptown Body shop in Columbus,
rented a car and went on toward the beach and my son's house. His
guest bed was as far as I got for the rest of my so-called
vacation. Doctors, hospitals and pain pills replaced hurricane
Georges as a subject of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   You learn a few wholesome truths when you lie in the bed
moaning. My son accepts all gifts people want to give him,
including fish he doesn't want and a rug a neighbor is replacing
with wall to wall carpet. Take whatever comes, and say thank you,
and bury it in the backyard, he said. How do you bury a vacation in
the backyard?
</P>
<P>
   When I finally crawled out of bed _ with every bone in my body
screaming for revenge _ I found I was the most wimpish driver on
the highway. I didn't exceed 25 miles an hour and I homesteaded at
all stop signs. I should have stayed there by the roadside.

 &HT;    Surviving Lousy College Food 101
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 1: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the World Wide Web is any indication, many college students
are fed up with the food that is being served in their cafeterias,
and they are not going to take it anymore. No longer is the
collegiate set willing to settle for jokes about ``mystery meat''
and the hilarity of an occasional food fight. When it comes to
food, students want improvement and they want it now. In the best
collegiate tradition, they are organizing.
</P>
<P>
   The National Organization of College Students for Better Dorm
Food at http://home.earthlink
</P>
<P>
   .net/(tilde)giuliani/index.html is ``dedicated to doing
something about the terrible food situation facing college students
around the globe.'' The site, which lists Duke University, Penn
State University and the University of Notre Dame among campuses
with the most nutritious campus food, provides useful information
on how students can go about making improvements. There also are
sections devoted to horror stories, poetry and jokes.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, the subject seems to engender jokes _ as you
will see if you call up http://
</P>
<P>
   www.laughnet.net/archive/college/dormfood.htm.
</P>
<P>
   But jests and protests aside, dissatisfied students who want
good chow in the immediate future are more likely to get it by
taking matters into their own hands and preparing at least some
meals themselves. Now that microwaves and hot plates can be plugged
in like any small appliance and many dorm rooms come equipped with
small refrigerators, there are cooking possibilities that did not
exist years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For an excellent primer on dorm room cooking, check out
http://www.yumyum.com/student/order.htm. It's lively and
informative, with information on survival cooking geared to
students who have not had much experience in the kitchen, except on
the receiving end. Also in the vein of ``Feeding Yourself 101'' is
Bill and Al's Never Fail Recipes at
http://www.cs.buffalo.edu/(tilde)ahunt/recipe.htm. Here, dorm
dwellers and others who have had the cord to Mom's cooking severed
recently find sympathetic and easy-to-understand instructions and
recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Once the basics are understood, college students are exploring
something called eating in the ``zone,'' a school of thought that
says a healthy diet should be as close as possible to that of
evolution's original hunter _ the
</P>
<P>
   gatherers. Providing fascinating information on this new dietary
trend, as well as recipes using the three basic building blocks of
``meat, leaves and berries,'' is
http://www.zonemaster.com/evotrain.htm. Apparently, college kids
are eating this site up.
</P>
<P>
   For more traditional recipes, check out Sycamore Place at
http://www.geocities.com/CollegePark/Field/9276/cafeteria.html.
</P>
<P>
   And when all else fails, grab hold of a package of ramen noodles
and dial up http://www.nissinfoods.com/recip1.htm for some
mouthwatering recipes using those three-minute wonders that no dorm
room pantry should ever be without.

 &HT;    The results are in: Winners and losers from premire week
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it wasn't the best ``ER'' episode. Maybe it was even a
lousy one. But last week's ``ER'' season premiere was good enough
to top the Nielsen ratings for the first week of the new fall
season.
</P>
<P>
   The return of ``Friends'' did well _ even better than expected.
``Friends'' finished No. 2, ahead of ``Frasier,'' the new ``Jesse''
and laugh-crippled ``Veronica's Closet.'' All on NBC, of course.
</P>
<P>
   CBS finished as the top network in total viewers. But it also
placed third in viewers age 18-49, the demographic advertisers
covet most.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a rundown of other Nielsen facts:
</P>
<P>
   -- The winners: ``Jesse,'' ABC's ``The Hughleys'' (the most
watched sitcom of Tuesday night), CBS' ``The King of Queens'' and
CBS' ``L.A. Doctors'' all made the top 30 in total viewers.
</P>
<P>
   -- The losers: Fox's ``Living in Captivity'' and ``Costello''
and ABC's ``Cupid'' and ``Fantasy Island'' all finished way, way
back.
</P>
<P>
   -- Who's the king of Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET? For now it's still
ABC's ``Home Improvement,'' followed closely by CBS' ``JAG'' and
NBC's ``Mad About You.'' Fox's ``King of the Hill'' finished a
disappointing 75th.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Ally'' vs. ``Raymond'': CBS' ``Everybody Loves Raymond''
had more viewers than Fox's ``Ally McBeal,'' but ``Ally'' scored
better among viewers age 18-49.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tops night by night: Most watched programs for each day were

   Look what they've done to Corky. With ``Murphy Brown'' a sitcom

<P>
   Ford plays a Maggie, a thirtysomething woman who first discovers
her husband is having an affair with her dental hygienist. Maggie
then hightails it to mom's house to start her life anew. But what
she finds in her hometown is a gaggle of old high school friends
living out their old high school cliques, their old high school
jealousies, their old high school memories.
</P>

   The script is jammed with old high school jargon. ``I like liked

   The men on this show, led by Peter Gallagher, can count on only

   It is enough to know that she's a lawyer, he's a cop and they're

CHINA ADOPTS A MORE DEFENSIVE ECONOMIC STANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SETH FAISON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China's leaders have slipped back into a
defensive stance on a range of finance and trade issues, apparently
worried that the effects of Asian financial crises will eventually
swamp their economy.
</P>
<P>
   A series of recent moves by Chinese authorities _ price
controls, currency restrictions, limits on the sale of state-owned
companies _ seem to reflect a slowdown in the nation's efforts to
shift from a planned to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such steps are justifiably cautious or simply timid,
economists and business executives agree that they are likely to
further deter trade and investment in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, China's central bank announced new restrictions on
foreign-exchange transactions, an attempt to control the flow of
convertible currency out of the country. Officially described as a
crackdown on illegal transactions, the moves will effectively make
it more difficult for both domestic and international companies to
move money in and out of China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hardly what you'd expect from a country that says it
is trying to reform and open,'' said a German executive with long
experience in China, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Maybe
they are wondering how much they really want to integrate with the
world economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Beijing say Chinese companies are improperly moving
dollars overseas, presumably fearing a possible devaluation of the
nation's currency, the yuan, which would make it more expensive to
buy dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Although the nation's foreign-exchange reserves are still
strong, at $140 billion, they have remained largely unchanged this
year while China has earned a trade surplus exceeding $30 billion
and absorbed $27 billion in new foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   Wu Xiaoling, director general of the State Administration of
Foreign Exchange, said that untold billions of dollars were
improperly transferred overseas this year and that new restrictions
were necessary to stop this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a disorderly capital flow is destructive to China,'' Ms.
Wu said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said that a new crackdown required Chinese
companies to bring back any illegal foreign-currency deposits from
overseas by Thursday, or risk severe punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Since there are no accurate statistics on how much money Chinese
companies hold overseas, it may be difficult to gauge the success
of Beijing's efforts, just as it will be hard to track down Chinese
companies' foreign-currency holdings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials have repeatedly promised not to devalue the yuan. But
Tuesday's actions reflect their alarm that so many Chinese
companies are hedging their bets anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have also announced new price controls for a
range of industries, from cars to steel to chemicals to sugar.
Tuesday, the government-guided media reported that the State
Economic and Trade Commission would recommend prices for all major
automakers, which have been suffering in recent months from falling
demand.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent motive is to protect Chinese companies that find
themselves competing with lower-cost imports from neighboring
countries, where currencies have been devalued. Whether or not
these steps are considered constructive, they reverse the trend in
recent years to reduce state interference and allow the market a
greater role in determining prices.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, China announced new restrictions on foreign
investment in the telecommunications industry, a fast-growing area
that has attracted international investors' attention.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of the times, Chinese negotiators have
apparently told American officials and businessmen that the
government is no longer determined to win quick entry into the
World Trade Organization. Some Chinese leaders now argue that it is
the wrong time to join a group that will force China to open its
markets more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   David Aaron, undersecretary of commerce for international trade,
also said last week that Chinese officials had recently become more
rigid in negotiations over market access and on the trade imbalance
between the two nations, which runs strongly against the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Chinese officials have expressed displeasure at
Washington's recent announcement that it will ban imports from
China that come in untreated wooden crates or pallets, to prevent
further incursions by the Asian long-horned beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, officials in Beijing said they would try to
slow the sale of many state industries to private owners, arguing
that too many sales were being made without adequate government
supervision, often at inappropriate prices.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of state-owned industry _ a policy announced with
fanfare a year ago _ has proved confusing, with corrupt local
officials pocketing state assets in some cases. This, in turn, may
be arousing concern over the scale and pace of enterprise reform.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new currency restrictions, banks must demonstrate that
all transactions involving more than $100,000 have full
documentation before they can be cleared by Customs. The State
Administration on Foreign Exchange will scrutinize any transaction
exceeding $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing concerns that introducing new bureaucracy was bound
to inhibit trade and investment, Ms. Wu defended the restrictions.
``It's simply the price we pay in order to combat crimes,'' she
said.

SCHROEDER SEEKS TO ALLY FRENCH FEARS OF BRITISH TIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Seeking to allay French fears that the new German
government will form closer links with Britain at the expense of
France, chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder is scheduled to visit
Paris Wednesday in his first trip abroad since he unseated Helmut
Kohl Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's aides acknowledged the trip to Paris was, in part,
meant to reassure the French that the new chancellor did not value
the Franco-German special relationship any less than his
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   In previous statements, Schroeder, who is more ideologically
similar to British Prime Minister Tony Blair than to the more
leftist French premier Lionel Jospin, made it clear he wanted to
form closer ties with Britain. But Schroeder has stressed that he
wants to develop a triangular relationship between the German,
French, and British governments.
</P>
<P>
   Blair had invited Schroeder and Jospin to join him Thursday at
the Labor Party's annual conference in Blackpool, England, in part
to bask in the fact that Europe's three biggest powers are now run
by left-wing governments _ a vindication of Blair's ``Third Way''
philosophy that places less emphasis on traditional left-wing
ideology.
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder decided it was more important to reassure the wary
French. Germany and France are each other's biggest trading
partners, and together have been the two driving forces for
European integration.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl was a committed Francophile, who in his 16 years as
chancellor forged closer ties with Paris than London, in part
because the British have traditionally been more skeptical about
the wisdom of surrendering national sovereignty in the name of a
united Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, however, is an avowed integrationist who wants to bring
Britain deeper into the European Union so it can take on more of a
leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   French leaders have openly expressed concern that Schroeder's
overtures toward Britain signal an erosion of the special
relationship between France and Germany. French fears have not been
alleviated by the gloating of British government officials in the
wake of Schroeder's victory. The British believe Schroeder will
help them take on more of a role in Europe because he is not nearly
as committed to the Franco-German partnership as Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   The French led efforts to exclude the British from a council
that will oversee the introduction in January of the single
European currency in 11 of the 15 EU countries. The French argued
that because Britain refused to take part in the launch of the
euro, it had no right to be part of the council.
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder believes he can help involve Britain more deeply
in the EU, while at the same time brokering better Anglo-Franco
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Easing French fears has been high on the list of priorities
since Schroeder ousted Kohl, Europe's longest-serving leader.
Schroeder told French radio that his personal relationship with
France was much better than media accounts suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Franco-German axis will remain the most important in
Europe,'' Schroeder said.

HIGHER ED BILL HEADS TO PRESIDENT FOR SIGNATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate Tuesday unanimously approved and sent to
President Clinton legislation aimed at making college more
affordable by increasing grants and lowering interest rates on
student loans.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year reauthorization of the Higher Education Act
emerged from a conference committee as a compromise that
incorporates both Democratic and Republican priorities and extends
special incentives to students who want to become teachers. More
than half of all college students take advantage of the loans and
grants authorized by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation gives millions of students the financial key
to unlock the door to higher education,'' said Senator James
Jeffords, the Vermont Republican and chairman of the Senate
Committee on Labor and Human Resources.
</P>
<P>
   The president is expected to sign the bill, which would reduce
interest rates on student loans by nearly one percentage point to
the lowest rate in almost 20 years. The rates will vary each year
because they are based on short-term Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   This provision could save students $700 on an average debt of
$13,000, said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat,
one of the conferees. The provision would cover new loans, but
would give students with existing loans four months to consolidate
their debts to take advantage of the lower rates and effectively
refinance. At today's market prices, the interest rate would drop
to 7.46 percent from 8.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would prohibit financial assistance to anyone convicted
of possession or sale of a controlled substance.
</P>
<P>
   The US Student Association and the US Public Interest Group
objected that Congress balked at giving all students the
opportunity to consolidate their loans. Most students consolidate
their various loans at the time of graduation. But opponents said a
broader provision would have cost the federal government an
additional $1 billion in subsidies to banks.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial banks objected that a long-planned change in the
federal formula for setting interest rates would reduce their
expected returns and threatened to stop lending money to students.
Congress agreed to subsidize the banks with hundreds of millions of
dollars by setting up a two-tiered system that provides one
interest rate to students and a second, slightly higher one, to
banks.
</P>
<P>
   The bill gradually would increase the maximum Pell Grant to
$5,000 from $4,000 a year by academic year 2003-2004 and increase
college work-study funding to $1 billion from this year's level of
$830 million. Because of limits on funding, the current ceiling on
Pell Grants is $3,000 a year, so the actual increase may amount to
less than $5,800.
</P>
<P>
   A measure sponsored by Representative James McGovern, a
Massachusetts Democrat, would double the Pell Grant for two years
for those students who finish in the top 10 percent of their
graduating high school class, an estimated 84,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any student who is qualified for a college education should
not be turned away because of financial constraints,'' said
McGovern. His amendment ``provides incentives to people who perform
well in high school. ... If they do well, they can see some
financial rewards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Students who earn a degree and take jobs in the child-care
industry or teaching jobs in school districts that serve low-income
children could have up to $5,000 of their student loans forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would consolidate more than a dozen existing teacher
preparation programs into one program aimed at improving teacher
training. It also would give assistance to school districts for
recruiting new teachers.

 By JODY ALESANDRO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I had always thought Mickey a bit of a wimp, until I met him in
Disney's private cruise terminal at Port Canaveral, Fla., sashaying
arm in arm with Minnie across a terrazzo floor map of the
Caribbean. With his triple-E shoes, chunky white gloves and
wide-eyed plastic grin, the Disney Magic's unofficial captain
managed to charm me and my 10-year-old son, Danny, a stalwart Goofy
fan, into posing for a picture with him and his mate. Like so much
aboard Disney's first cruise ship, and in Disney World itself, the
quality costuming and elegant setting had transformed a potentially
cheesy moment into a beguiling bit of silliness. Even my
16-year-old cynic, Alex, trying to be as unobtrusive as humanly
possible in the glassy 70,000-square-foot expanse, admitted he had
almost been ``sucked in by the cuteness.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no small tribute to the Disney Magic's designers that
despite the abundance of mouse ears and duck tails on board, the
83,000-ton ship is anything but ``cute.'' As long as the Chrysler
Building is tall, and just as sleek, it is reminiscent of the grand
ocean liners of the past, with a slender black hull and two red
smokestacks sporting Mickey's silhouette. From the three-story
atrium lobby with its sweeping grand staircase to the stadium
seating in the ESPN Skybox sports club, the purposeful design and
relentless attention to detail enable differently themed areas to
flow together in a Deco-Disney collage of warm woods, steel curves,
swirls of deep turquoise and sea green and frequent, strategic
splashes of primary colors.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic was built according to the plans of several Norwegian
and Finnish architects at the Ficantieri Shipyards in Italy, where
its sister ship, the Disney Wonder, is being outfitted for a spring
1999 launching. Because the Magic's first sailing, originally set
for March, was postponed twice, Disney offered those who had
already booked passage a complete refund or a 25 percent discount
for each delay. In August 1997, I had reserved two cabins for eight
friends and family members as part of a standard package that
included four days at Disney World and three on the cruise. After
the original charges were reduced by half, the six of us willing to
travel during value (as in ``hurricane'') season ended up paying
$5,260, including port charges, for two adjacent three-person
cabins with verandas _ one for Danny, my husband, Daan, and me, the
other for Alex, my brother Michael and his friend Laurie.
</P>
<P>
   About a month after the ship's first official cruise, on July
30, a Disney representative met us at the airport in Orlando, where
we waited an hour for the bus that would take us to Disney's
Boardwalk Inn and Villas, one of several accommodation options in
the package. In exchange for the hotel and cruise documents we had
filled out on the bus, the front-desk clerk at the Boardwalk gave
each of us a Key to the World card, which could be used to pay for
all extras in the hotel and on the ship and to gain admission to
all the Disney World parks, our stateroom, our shipboard safe _
everything except our hotel room, which, at 3:45 p.m., was not
ready yet (check-in time was at 4, I was told).
</P>
<P>
   Still roomless at 4:15, we left for the Magic Kingdom, where we
waited on long lines in the merciless sun to board rides like
Splash Mountain and the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad before
weaving our way through the crowds as fireworks lighted the sky
above Cinderella's Castle and Walt's voice told us that if you
follow your heart, everything is possible. Indeed, when we returned
at 11 p.m., the Boardwalk clerk waved her electronic wand over our
Keys to the World and we entered a sparkling, spacious room, with
veranda, whose fresh decor _ foamy greens and blues accenting the
pure white woodwork _ repeated the hotel's North Atlantic seaboard
theme.
</P>
<P>
   All that was missing was the brisk salty air as the six of us
set off on each of the three remaining days for the sweltering
streets of Disney-MGM Studios or the cool water slides at Blizzard
Beach or the virtual reality of Downtown Disney, usually winding up
at Epcot to watch the fireworks and laser display that, for me, was
a highlight of the trip. All the parks and pavilions were
scrupulously clean and organized, the refreshments priced for a
captive audience (snow cones $3, bottled water $2) and the
employees helpful and excruciatingly friendly. By the time the
hotel's cruise coordinator hopped onto the bus to Port Canaveral
and shouted: ``Are you people going on a cruise?'' we were used to
this cheeriness _ the driver to Blizzard Beach tried to strike up a
round of ``If You're Happy and You Know It.'' As the signs said,
Disney employees are not a staff but a ``cast.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 50-minute bus ride, and our mouse encounter at Port
Canaveral, we entered not a cabin but a stateroom _ about 24 feet
long and 9 feet wide with a spacious veranda and two bathrooms, one
with a sink and four-foot-long tub, the other with sink, toilet and
hair dryer. A tall dresser, desk with drawers, five-foot-wide
closet and enclosed shelves above a cabinet that contained a
television and unstocked mini-bar offered more than enough storage
space. But the details made the room _ the azure accents in the
white tiled bathroom, the plush towels and extra pillows, the
curtain that could be drawn between the queen-size and single beds
and, my favorite, a framed 1934 photograph titled ``Mr. and Mrs.
Walt Disney on Deck.'' It shows a windblown Walt holding on to his
wife with his left arm and, with his right, a long-nosed Mickey
puppet that actually looks like a rodent.
</P>
<P>
   Our bags were waiting for us in the stateroom, along with a
12-page time chart of meals and activities, from wine-tasting to
mouse-hunting, that made excellent reading material on the long
line for the buffet lunch on deck nine, which was struggling
through its third and final hour with lots of fresh shrimp and cold
meats, accompanied by half-cooked rice and barely defrosted rolls.
</P>
<P>
   But all was forgiven when the ship's foghorn blasted out the
first seven notes of ``When You Wish Upon a Star.'' As the Magic
began its 13-hour cruise to Nassau, we dressed for our
first-seating dinner at Lumiere's, the most formal of the ship's
four restaurants and the only one where jackets are requested (but
not always worn _ attire ranged from sequined cocktail ensembles to
sports shirts).
</P>
<P>
   Disney's rotation-dining system places guests in a different
restaurant, but with the same table number and servers, each night.
Since Michael and Laurie had reserved a table at Palo, the
adults-only restaurant that was not part of the rotation, our table
for six had two empty seats, which were filled by a retired New
York police officer and his wife, who generously shared the
Beaujolais given them as recompense for a mistake in their seating
assignment. Among the six of us, we sampled nearly every item on
the five-course menu. The lamb shank in red-wine sauce and the beef
tenderloin in green-peppercorn sauce got high ratings from our
table mates, and Daan and I, though disappointed with the red
snapper, enjoyed the escargot appetizer and a tangy Grand Marnier
frozen souffle for dessert.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Lumiere's golden Parisian glow and our table, right by a large
porthole, were lovely, but our three servers were overly solicitous
_ to the point that when I was asked for the fifth time how
eveything was, I finally blurted out that, to be frank, the fish
was dry (for which I received a dramatic expression of sympathy but
no Beaujolais).
</P>
<P>
   Michael and Laurie fared better with the northern Italian
cuisine at Palo, where they enjoyed rack of lamb in Chianti sauce,
penne with pancetta and a chocolate hazelnut souffle with
vanilla-bean sauce. Even their initial disappointment, that the
portions were small, turned to relief. They were at an 8:30
sitting, at which time the ship was moving at about 22 knots, the
270-degree view through the glass walls was of total darkness and
the whole restaurant, positioned high up on deck 10 over the stern,
rocked enough to slam a sliding door and drastically reduce their
appetites (the closest any of us came to seasickness during an
exceptionally smooth cruise).
</P>
<P>
   Barely a ripple could be felt in the Oceaneer Lab, a midship
play space for 9- to 12 year-olds that Danny and I visited when
``Disney Dreams,'' the most elaborate of the ship's three family
musicals, was canceled ``due to technical difficulties.'' The
beeper I was given after signing Danny in at the ``lab,'' part of a
clever system for locating lost parents, proved unnecessary. A half
hour later we found Dan sitting in the K'nex corner waiting to
leave. He had never gotten a turn at the large round table filled
with computers, and no counselor had introduced him to any other
activity. While he waited to sign out, we saw a group of girls
learning to juggle scarves and many other children having a fine
time. To be fair, it was just not his kind of place. The rest of
the ship was, however.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bars and the clubs, the elaborate spa and workout
rooms over the bridge, this was a cruise for children, of all ages
_ from the water slide and kiddie pool that was cleaned and
refilled with fresh water every morning to the continuous stream of
Disney tunes piped through passageways and decks. Even dinners were
entertaining, especially at Animator's Palate, where columns are
paintbrushes, sketches of Disney characters line the walls and
desserts must be decorated before being eaten. The tender
herb-crusted veal cutlets were on the oily side _ but who cared? Of
the three restaurants for families, this one was the masterpiece,
literally revealing its colors as the evening progressed.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, while the rest of our group cooled off in the
three rather small pools on deck 9 (kiddie, family and adults
only), Daan and I took a tour of Beat Street, a path lined with
wall reliefs of giant clarinets and trumpets that leads to the
adults-only clubs: Rockin' Bar D, a kind of roadhouse disco where
country-western and rock are played on alternate nights; Sessions,
a dark and peaceful piano lounge, and Offbeat, an informal comedy
club. But at 8 p.m., the real action was at Studio Sea, a family
club where pillars look like tall stacks of film tins and
dressing-room mirrors hang askew behind a bar that serves
nonalcoholic cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   On a cruise with 2,150 passengers (maximum capacity is 2,400),
700 of whom were under the age of 18, and a crew of 920, we
marveled at the empty tables in the bars and on deck, the uncrowded
elevators, the absence of screaming children, the overall sense of
space and privacy. Even at Nassau, our first port of call, where we
had headed straight to the cooling waves of Paradise Island, we saw
only a few of our fellow passengers lining up to disembark.
</P>
<P>
   But then we arrived at Castaway Cay. Looking at the rows of
beach umbrellas covering the silky sands of Disney's 100-acre
private island, we wondered where everyone had been hiding. By 10
a.m. all but a few of the lounge chairs on the half-mile-long
family beach were occupied, and the 12-acre snorkeling lagoon was
filled with hundreds of bobbing air pipes following mapped-out
routes around bits of sunken ships that were beginning to attract a
small number of tropical fish. The adjacent teen beach and the
adults-only beach on the other side of the island, where outdoor
massages are given in alcoves facing the water, were emptier, but
the lines for the barbecue buffet seemed endless.
</P>
<P>
   Although floats, bikes and kayaks could be rented on the island,
most of our group went snorkeling while Danny and I went our own
way, desperately seeking Goofy. Having missed his few early-morning
appearances, we were thrilled when we finally found him _ swinging
in a hammock half-hidden between two palms _ just before the ship's
horn summoned us.
</P>
<P>
   Back on board, the bouncy strains of ``Hakuna Matata'' filled
the halls as we walked on down to dinner at the Caribbean-themed
Parrot Cay, a riot of palm leaves and bright island colors. The
food, as usual, was imaginatively presented, the jerk-spiced
sirloin perfectly done, and our servers cheerful as always, though
looking a bit pale in their multicolored tropical shirts. This
time, when they asked how we were, we purposefully returned the
question. Yes, they said, sometimes it was difficult working long
hours and missing home (all of the ship's restaurant staff are
European) _ and the plastic cordiality they had learned became
genuine.
</P>
<P>
   The boys always ate dinner with us, although burgers and fries,
hot dogs or pizza were available on the pool deck between noon and
10 p.m., and ice cream until 8 p.m. It was not the continuous flow
of delectables that I had promised our son with the hollow leg, but
after Alex's first night on the boat, he no longer needed any
enticements from me. The Disney approach to teen-agers is brilliant
in its simplicity: Leave them alone.
</P>
<P>
   Only people ages 13 and 17 are allowed in Common Ground, an
enclosed space on the pool deck with video games, a jukebox and a
bar serving coffee and nonalcoholic drinks. Alex met teen-agers
from all over the country there and at dance parties, as well as on
the Teen Junkanoo Jam Cruise, a Saturday-night boat trip around
Nassau harbor, with a live band and no parents. He was the last one
back to the cabin every night, obviously reveling in his first
tastes of freedom and romance.
</P>
<P>
   His only regret was that we had not gone on the cruise BEFORE we
went to Disney World. After all, what better way to visit the
arm-clutching Tower of Terror at Disney-MGM Studios or the
fireworks display in the Magic Kingdom than with a summer love,
when everything, as Uncle Walt says, is possible.

FRENCH WORRY THAT SCHROEDER WILL ALTER GERMANY'S FOCUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Faced with the prospect of a German chancellor who
believes that his country's relations with London will be at least
as important as its ties with Paris, France is filled with anxiety
about being taken seriously enough by its powerful eastern
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Schroeder, who unseated Helmut Kohl in Sunday's German
elections, lost no time in moving to reassure his allies across the
Rhine. He accepted an invitation to lunch at Elysee Palace on
Wednesday with President Jacques Chirac and a meeting with Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin immediately afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In an article published Tuesday morning in the French daily Le
Figaro and the German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Chirac
expressed concern that a German leader who had none of the
complexes born of World War II might take France too much for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the geopolitical context has been radically
transformed since the end of the Cold War, some ask if the
relationship has lost its reason for being,'' Chirac wrote. ``Our
two peoples give the impression of not knowing each other so well,
of coming together with less spontaneity.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the French concern is fear that unless the
French-German relationship is revitalized when the German capital
moves from Bonn to Berlin next year, France may have difficulty
steering the Germans on a European course of French design.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's generation may no longer feel the sense of
obligation to right historical wrongs that was a central
characteristic of Kohl's era, Chirac said. ``Our bilateral
relationship may seem less intense,'' he wrote. ``The emotion of
reconciliation, so strong for those who went before us, is
attenuating with the passing of the generations.''
</P>
<P>
   For France, the French-German relationship is the keystone of
the whole European edifice, and Germany's support of France's
ambition for a global strategic, economic and political role for
the European Union is crucial. Germany will hold the rotating chair
of the group for six months starting in January.
</P>
<P>
   Even the common European currency that will be introduced next
year, the euro, is seen by Chirac and others as a chance to
challenge the dominance of the dollar, an ambition that, as a
former Bundesbank president, Karl-Otto Poehl, has pointed out, is
shared by few in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   For Germany, good relations with the United States during the
Cold War were as important as those with France. ``Do not force us
to choose between Paris and Washington,'' German officials often
pleaded with their French and American counterparts when, as so
often, France's cultural, economic and political goals clashed with
America's.
</P>
<P>
   That was Kohl's stand for 16 years. But France is not so sure
what Schroeder's position will be.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor-designate was reassuring in an interview with
French Europe 1 radio the day after his election.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal relationship with France is much better than the
press believes,'' he said. ``The Franco-German axis is of historic
importance and will remain the most important axis in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that reinforcing links between Germany and Britain
would make the core European relationship three-sided rather than
two-sided in the future.
</P>
<P>
   With Prime Minister Tony Blair of the Labor Party running
Britain and a Social Democrat in charge of Germany for the first
time in a generation, some members of France's Socialist-led
government see a chance for new European initiatives to tackle the
Continent's double-digit unemployment rates without worrying as
much about inflation as Kohl's conservatives did.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the French clearly expect Schroeder to do is to keep
insisting, as Kohl began to do in the last year or so, that Germany
can no longer be the European Union's rich uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl said Germany would not keep paying in almost $16 billion
more than it got out of European Union programs, and the French do
not expect Schroeder to take a different line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the normalization of Germany,'' French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine said recently. ``Since unification, Germany
doesn't have to be the good boy of Europe any more.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reworking expensive longstanding subsidies for European
agriculture _ arrangements that are still highly beneficial to
French farmers _ is expected to be difficult, and Schroeder will
give his views in a meeting with other European Union leaders in
Austria on Oct. 24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have major problems to deal with in the next few months _
the euro launch, E.U. financing, common farm policy _ and we will
settle them only if France and Germany really agree on how to
settle them,'' Vedrine said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Intending to reassure the French that he took them seriously,
Schroeder named Brigitte Sauzay, a French diplomat who was the late
President Francois Mitterrand's German interpreter, as a key
adviser during his campaign last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me to explain France to him and to suggest measures
that could bring the two societies closer together,'' Mrs. Sauzay
said in an interview at home here in Paris before the elections.
</P>
<P>
   But she observed: ``I think the Germans are changing. I thought
unification would allow them to become more comfortable with
themselves, but instead they're uneasy. They still tend to identify
themselves with their economic performance instead of cultural
values.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing the French would like is for the Germans to work with
them to strengthen the distinct cultural, social and economic
cohesion of Europe and resist the encroachments of ``globalism,'' a
menace the French believe to be incorporated in the Anglo-Saxon
entrepreneurial ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Colombiani, the director of the influential French
daily Le Monde, wrote about this fear in a front-page editorial
that said, ``The fear of a Germany turned toward London is of a
Germany turning its back on the French-German design for Europe as
evidenced by the euro, replacing it with a free-exchange
constellation based on a Washington-London-Berlin triple axis.''
</P>
<P>
   While Germans of a certain age still come here for culture, wine
and food _ ``living like God in France'' is an old German
equivalent of ``living the life of Riley'' _ the younger generation
is more likely to go on vacation to New York or Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   And in France, the first foreign language studied by 88.1
percent of schoolchildren is English. Only 10.5 percent choose
German, down from 14 percent 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Sauzay observed, ``The relationship between France
and Germany greatly marked the world during this century, for
better and for worse. If we are going to restructure Europe in the
next century, we have to do it with Germany.''

`MAGGIE WINTERS': STARTING ALL OVER, WITH MOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for

(mk) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the most backward-looking, unpromising of mini-trends,
television producers seem determined to prove that you can, too, go
home again. WB's dismissible new drama, ``Hyperion Bay,'' sends a
computer whiz and businessman back to his hometown in the
Northwest. NBC has shipped Nathan Lane back to the family vineyard
in ``Encore! Encore!'' and plans a midseason replacement called
``Providence,'' named after the hometown that lures a cosmetic
surgeon back from Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday night there is CBS' pleasantly watchable but
uninspired ``Maggie Winters,'' in which Faith Ford trades in her
ditsy but likable Corky Sherwood character from ``Murphy Brown''
for the role of a floundering woman in her 30s fresh out of a bad
marriage. Apparently never having held a job (how quaint!), Maggie
returns to her small Indiana hometown to live with her mother and
start over.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ford brings her sharp comic timing and engaging presence to
Maggie. But it is Shirley Knight as her sweet, slightly addled
mother who is the show's brightest asset. As Maggie heads to a job
interview at a department store, her mother says, ``I just know
that you can turn even the most menial, thankless, minimum-wage job
into something not to be embarrassed about.'' Ms. Knight delivers
her lines with genuine concern, even when her meaning is miles away
from her words, even when wondering why Maggie didn't take her
cheating husband for all he was worth. You can see Ms. Ford and Ms.
Knight struggling to save the show from its stale concept.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those only-in-sitcom coincidences, Maggie has returned
just in time for her 15th high school reunion. And though she has
flashes of resistance to being dragged back to the past, it takes
minutes for her to pick up a romance with her old boyfriend, Bobby
(Vincent Ventresca), now the town veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   It takes less time for her to shriek and squeal with her old
girlfriends, tedious characters. In the opening credits, one is a
contented mother labeled ``Most Likely to Breed,'' the other a
high-strung career woman called ``Most Likely to Snap.''
</P>
<P>
   Clea Lewis (the bubble-headed Audrey on ``Ellen'') is
wonderfully funny, though, as Rachel, who still sees Maggie as her
high-school rival. ``You stole Bobby Campanella from me,'' she says
when interviewing Maggie for the department store job as her
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were dating Bobby?'' asks Maggie.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, but I liked him and everybody knew it,'' Rachel whines,
running a giant purple comb through her hair.
</P>
<P>
   Such outlandish moments enliven the first episode and, along
with its stars, make ``Maggie Winters'' one of the season's more
congenial new series. That doesn't say much about the long-term
prospects for overcoming its hokey premise.

ARAFAT ACCEPTS U.S. PROPOSAL CALLING FOR ISRAEL'S ADDITIONAL RETURN
OF LAND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After meeting with President Clinton on Tuesday,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said that he backed a plan calling
for Israel to return additional lands on the West Bank as part of
an overall Middle East peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have accepted it,'' Arafat said, referring to a U.S.
proposal that Israel turn over an additional 13 percent of its West
Bank territory to the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace is a Palestinian need, Israeli need, Arab need,
international need,'' Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
   The return of territory captured by Israel during the 1967-Six
Day War would be in addition to the 27 percent of the West Bank
that the Jewish nation had already pledged to return to
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   To meet Israel's security concerns, 3 percent of the additional
lands _ a buffer zone of sorts _ would be turned into a nature
preserve that would be under joint Palestinian-Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
other officials said Israel would relinquish more land on the West
Bank provided it was not be used for attacks on Israel. Netanyahu
endorsed the 13 percent land transfer contingent on Arafat's
guarantee of protection against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement among the two longtime antagonists was a strong
indication that the Mideast peace process, which had been stalled
for months, was back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also has been eager to move along the process. On Monday
he met at the White House with Arafat and Netanyahu, both of whom
agreed to return to Washington in mid-October to conclude
negotiations. In the meantime, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright will fly to the Mideast next week to help leaders iron out
details of any peace pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president is determined to see an agreement rise
from this exercise,'' said White House spokesman Mike McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said that Israel's concerns about security, if they
turned over the lands to the Palestinians, were ``justified.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a central element of the discussions that are under
way between the two parties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said Arafat's talks with Clinton focused not so much on
the land transfer but on how the United States could help the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said that Clinton and Arafat talked about economic
assistance that might be available for people of the West Bank and
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the two men discussed the possible establishment of
a U.S.-Palestinian Committee that could work on bettering relations
between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton talked alone with Arafat for about 20 minutes and
together with senior aides, including Albright and national
security adviser Sandy Berger, for another 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting Clinton walked with the Palestinian leader to
the White House driveway and shook hands with him as photographers
snapped pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a car bomb blew up Tuesday in a West Bank industrial
area, killing a Hamas member and wounding two others. The group has
claimed responsibility for terrorist attacks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has expected a renewal of Hamas bombings, and Tuesday
sealed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza.

DARE TO DREAM OF THE DUELLING JINXES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Bring on the Yankees in the American League
Championship Series, then the Cubs in the World Series. The best
season in baseball history won't be complete until we have Fenway
and Wrigley playing host to the duelling jinxes of the Red Sox and
Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get ahead of ourselves. Why not dream? Why not the best?
Why not have these 1998 Red Sox throw off 80 years of hard luck and
heartache by beating all the teams you really want them to beat?
</P>
<P>
   Babe Ruth was the star of Sox stars when the Cubs and Sox last
clashed in the Fall Classic. And now we have Mo Vaughn, the black
Bambino.
</P>
<P>
   Mo is Babe. How else can we explain his big appetites, his
battles with management, and his Ruthian performance in Tuesday's
first game of the Division Series between the Red Sox and Cleveland
Indians?
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn hit two homers and knocked in seven runs in an 11-3
victory over the Tribe. The win snapped a string of 13 Sox
postseason losses and brought Mo back from the abyss of 1995, when
he went 0 for 14 with seven strikeouts in three straight playoff
losses to the Tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get an opportunity to get here again,'' said
Vaughn. ``I didn't know what was going to happen. I think I'm a
little bit older now and more experienced. You look at situations
like that and learn from them. You saw in '95, I tried to do things
that weren't there. Today I just hit the ball where it was pitched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll ever close the books on what happened in
'95. You gotta keep those things in the back of your mind. You
admit it and understand it. It will always be a lesson for me _ to
sit back and let the game come to you and not try to go out and
force it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely not over yet. There's still a lot of games to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a mistake to dismiss Cleveland so quickly, but Tuesday's
surgical dismantling of the Indians in the first game of the
divisional playoffs served to fortify the growing faith of the
oft-fickle Fenway fandom. It was a win right off the winter
blueprint. Vaughn drove home seven and wonderboy shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra knocked in the other four to complete the scoring for
$75 million ace Pedro Martinez, who cruised to his first postseason
win.
</P>
<P>
   Mo, Nomar, and Pedro. They are the holy trinity of Boston's
Church of Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really confident out there, especially getting those
three runs ahead,'' said Martinez. ``I knew what to do _ make my
pitches and get the ball over and keep that (early) three-run lead.
I didn't want to walk anybody. It looks ugly for a veteran pitcher
to walk batters with a big lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Beating Cleveland is no fluke. The Red Sox now have nine
victories in 12 games against the Tribe this year. This is an
Indian team that played only one game over .500 after the All-Star
break, spent the year on cruise control in the cheesey AL Central
Division, and dropped six of its last seven _ including three of
four to the woeful Twins.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians can't hit Pedro. In four games this year, Cleveland
has just 21 hits, 7 earned runs, and 32 strikeouts in 32 innings
against him. The Indians know they've got Pedro at least once more
if they extend this series. All the pressure will be on Cleveland
Wednesday when Tim Wakefield goes against Dwight Gooden.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is the first,'' said Pedro. ``I don't believe in
anything about Bambino or curses or any of that. All I believe in
is smoke.'
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Darren Bragg interrupted, ``All he believes in is 96
miles an hour on the black.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's two-homer performance was the first by a Red Sox player
in postseason play since Rico Petrocelli and Carl Yastrzemski had
two-homer games in the 1967 World Seriers.
</P>
<P>
   The '67 club is the most beloved Sox team since 1918, and now
we've got Mo &AMP; Co. bringing back all the good feeling New England
had for its team in the golden Summer of Love.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, no one is nervous. No one is fretting, waiting for
something bad to happen. The 1998 Red Sox weren't expected to go
anywhere, and now that they're in the postseason, they're insulated
from some of the torment that haunted their hardball forefathers.
</P>
<P>
   Let's dream. Jump the gun. Forget about past losses and
exaggerate the win. Finish off the Indians. Bring on the Yanks.
Bring on the Cubs. Bring on the (gulp) champagne.
</P>

SPORTS LOSES ITS CHARM AS PLAYERS GROW OLDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a certain charm about little people playing sports that,
for me, is regrettably lacking in their older counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, Slammin' Sammy Sosa and Mighty Mark McGwire heightened
the excitement for baseball fans this year. Agreed, Lisa Leslie has
a mean jump shot over in the WNBA. Nevertheless, other than that
Kodak moment when Tiger Woods embraced his father after winning the
Masters, I have never said, ``Oooohh, isn't that precious?''
</P>
<P>
   It's fall, now, and we're in the middle of football season. I
can't help but notice how competitive my son, Dante, has become.
Now it's ``play to win'' and ``no pain, no gain.'' That's OK, but I
really liked it so much better when he would run up to me after a
game, all smiles and bright eyes, and say, ``Mommy, did we win?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, you're always a winner,'' I'd respond with an
enthusiastic hug and a kiss. My husband would just shake his head
in disbelief, but I figure so what if the team lost the soccer game
by seven goals? If the boy didn't know, and I didn't care, why
sweat the small stuff?
</P>
<P>
   Then my son would say, ``Where are the treats? Do they have
Gummy Bears? I love soccer!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, first you have to go huddle with the coach. Then you
can have a treat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a huddle?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's when a bunch of guys stand around in a circle and
perspire while the coach talks and the parents look at their
watches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do they do that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do the coaches say, Mommy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing that can't wait until the next practice, but it's
tradition, Sweetie, so run along now.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward eight years and the gridiron becomes a battlefield
of mighty warriors. The young men swagger after a bone-crushing
tackle and dance after a field goal. Opposing teams scout their
opponents and insist on checking the birth certificates of
blue-chip players.
</P>
<P>
   The sandbox has become a minefield. Tempers explode, the
less-talented players ride the pine. Coaches sprout pulsating veins
in their necks. It's prime time. It's sixth-grade football!
</P>
<P>
   After the game, my son is devastated. We barely won.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, did you see that? We stink. The line wasn't blocking. The
secondary got burned. Man, we gotta practice more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, it was a great game. Some mistakes were made, but we won
and I'm sure everyone did their best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding? That's the worst game we've ever played, and
besides, you weren't even watching. I saw you. You spent the whole
time talking to the other moms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true, son. You had 10 carries for 97 yards. You
would have gone over 100 if we hadn't gotten those penalties. In
the first quarter, you made three tackles and intercepted a poorly
thrown pass intended for the tight end. In the second quarter, you
tied your shoe three times and had a 40-yard punt. At half time,
you sat on your helmet by your best friend, Elk. You fumbled twice
in the third quarter, speaking of mistakes, but you recovered
nicely and scored a touchdown on fourth and 15 behind some fine
blocking by the right guard and tackle. And the last quarter was
ho-hum, but I did notice when that awful lineman scratched your
hand and drew blood. I need to speak to his mother, by the way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you were paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course. I love coming to your games. It's what I live for.
Now go on over to the huddle. The coach might be saying something
important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's only Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, but go on over anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anyone bring treats?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some Gummy Bears in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, Mom. Football is great!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Then I smile and glance at my watch.

   The upstart computer operating system Linux took a big step into
the big time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The world's top chip maker, Intel Corp., has purchased a stake
in Red Hat Software Inc. of Triangle Research Park, N.C., a leading
distributor of Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is part of a team of investors that also includes browser
maker Netscape Communications Corp. and venture capital firms
Greylock of Boston and Benchmark Capital of Menlo Park, Calif. &UR;  &LR; The
investment group will acquire a minority stake in Red Hat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The deal provides a major credibility boost for Linux, an
operating system being touted as an alternative to Microsoft
Corp.'s dominant Windows system.
</P>
<P>
   Linux is an ``open-source'' software product. Unlike Windows and
other kinds of software, Linux is available free of charge. In
addition, Linux comes with source code &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; the original computer
code as written by the programmers. That way, a Linux user can
modify the operating system to suit his own needs, something that
can't be done with Windows. In recent months, a number of major
software companies, including Netscape and database makers Oracle
Corp. and Informix Corp, have said they would write software to run
on Linux-based machines.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Linux costs nothing, closely held Red Hat sells an
easy-to-install version of Linux and provides the buyer with
technical support. This business model has helped give Linux a
toehold in corporations and government agencies. But many corporate
computer users still hang back, unwilling to count on software that
isn't supported by a major corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat president Robert Young says a deal with Intel and
Netscape could well break down resistance to Linux. Corporate
executives ``no longer have to hide the fact that they're building
servers and rolling out workstations running Linux,'' said Young.
</P>
<P>
   Young said Red Hat would use the infusion of capital to
establish a new enterprise computing division that would provide
support for major firms using Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape is locked in a tough battle with Microsoft for control
of the Internet browser market. Over the past year, Netscape
executives have argued that Linux could be a major challenger to
Microsoft's near-monopoly on desktop operating systems. Yet Intel
is a close ally of Microsoft _ so close that Microsoft's Windows
and Intel's processor chips are often described with a single word
_ Wintel.
</P>
<P>
   Intel spokesman Robert Manetta said that the investment in Red
Hat is not a sign that Intel's relationship to Microsoft is
weakening. Manetta said the investment is part of a long-term Intel
policy of investing in up-and-coming technology companies. He said
Intel has invested $750 million in about 125 small firms, while
remaining a strong Microsoft ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has really changed between the two companies,''
Manetta said. ``It's business as usual.'' Microsoft marketing
manager Ed Muth agreed, predicting that Intel's support of Linux
would have relatively little impact on Microsoft's share of the
operating system market.

   FED-RATES (Los Angeles) _ Lower interest rates from the Federal
Reserve will mean a reduction in borrowing costs for some
households and businesses. In fact, Los Angeles-based Countrywide
says that anyone with a mortgage loan at 7.5 percent or higher can
refinance and save money, an astonishingly low threshold. But it's
not all good news: The lower rates mean diminished earning power

savings or fixed-income investments. By Greg Wilcox. (Will move in

COUNTDOWN TO JUBILEE: WILL ROME BE READY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Oct. 4)  
(JT) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Rome is a huge construction site. Actually, it has 700
construction sites, according to the city's mayor, Francesco
Rutelli, and about 200 of them are in preparation for the Jubilee,
the Roman Catholic Church's celebration of the millennium. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scaffolding, the decoration of choice, masks the front of the
Palazzo Venezia, drapes the facade of St. Peter's Basilica and is
stuck to the front of the Palazzo Farnese. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The projects stretch from the sublime to the pedestrian. The
splendid mosaics of Santa Maria Maggiore are being restored, and
toilets are being installed on the roof of St. Peter's, near where
tourists begin the long, twisting climb to the top of
Michelangelo's dome. Around St. Peter's Square, the columns of
Bernini's colonnade are being scrubbed white. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Traffic is more chaotic than ever. To allow the work around St.
Peter's and the Vatican to proceed, entire avenues have been
rerouted around the Castel Sant'Angelo and back and forth across
the Tiber. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1300, Pope Boniface VIII adapted the jubilee, originally a
Jewish tradition in which every 50th year was set aside for God to
Christian use. Ever since, the church has begun each century with a
Holy Year, urging Christians to do penance and, if possible, to
visit Rome. As the next jubilee quickly approaches, Rome is
primping. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rutelli, the mayor, has been given a new title, special
government commissioner for the jubilee. He has traveled to the
United States, armed with facts and figures, to explain the
preparations, and on a recent Thursday served as tour guide to a
busload of foreign journalists visiting the principal building
sites. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A computer program based on advance tour bookings spits out ever
newer projections of the number of visitors. At last count, the
forecast was for 26 million in the year 2000 (including 2.5 million
Americans), against 14 million in 1997. ``But Rome is a large
city,'' Rutelli said, reassuringly, ``and it's getting ready for
the event.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given the jubilee's religious nature, much activity focuses on
St. Peter's and the Vatican. The Janiculum Hill, next to the
Vatican, is being hollowed for an underground garage for cars and
tour buses. An automobile tunnel now running under the hill will
double in capacity by the addition of a second level under the
existing roadway. At the Vatican Museums, the massive walls are
being pierced to create an entrance complex _ with gift shops,
cafeteria and waiting areas _ capable of sheltering several
thousand visitors and thus eliminating the endless lines that often
snake around the walls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The work engulfs the city and involves the construction of eight
hotels, including a Hyatt at the airport, and expansion of the
subway to include a link, under construction for more than a
decade, from the city's edge to stations near the Vatican that are
scheduled to open in December.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Waving notes, Rutelli counted up the sums: $2 billion from the
Italian government for the restoration; $2.5 billion from public
and private corporations to upgrade telecommunications, and perhaps
another $1.5 billion from small businesses like hotels and
restaurants for their own renovation. In all, in the next year or
two Rome will spend on beautification about the same amount that it
spent in all of the last 10 years.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The jubilee will run from Christmas Eve 1999 to early in 2001,
and will be marked mainly by religious observances. But the city is
preparing a companion program of exhibits and events, focusing
mainly on the theme of Christianity in art and history. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Major excavations are under way in the Roman Forum, and there
are plans to open long-unused sewage tunnels to permit tourists to
walk undisturbed under the broad Via dei Fori Imperiali from one
part of the forum to another. To increase the city's cultural
offerings, a vast new auditorium, designed by Renzo Piano, the
winner of this year's Pritzker Prize, is being built on the
northern outskirts of the city; it will house a multiplex cinema in
addition to three concert halls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Rome was not built in a day, nor will it be restored in that
time, giving rise to a vexing question: Will the work be done when
the pilgrims begin to arrive? Succumbing to an access of realism,
several projects were canceled before they started, like a third
line for the subway and a highway tunnel skirting the Castel
Sant'Angelo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When asked when this or that project would be done, Rutelli
repeatedly replied, ``late 1999.'' The lower level of the Janiculum
tunnel, for instance, one of the biggest works, is not expected to
be complete before November 1999, perilously close to the jubilee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pierluigi Borghini, the head of the opposition in the city
council, thinks that is cutting it too close. ``I have the
impression that this administration has transformed hopes into
certainties,'' he said during a recent tour of the tunnel site. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rutelli sounds unfazed. ``Romans aren't used to changing their
habits; they have to learn,'' he said, responding to questions
about the slow progress of the work. ``We're not tearing our hair
out.''
</P>

BILL WOULD MAKE STATES NOTIFY SEXUAL PARTNERS OF HIV-INFECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Supporters of a bill that would require states to
notify the sexual partners of HIV-positive people argued Tuesday it
would save lives and ease suffering, but opponents said it would
deter high-risk people from seeking testing and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would require that physicians report the names
of people who test positive for the AIDS virus to state public
health officials, who would then inform sexual partners without
revealing the identity of the person who may have exposed them. But
if the individual refused to identify sexual partners, there would
be no criminal or civil penalty.
</P>
<P>
   If a state refused to comply, it would lose federal funding for
AIDS treatment and prevention. Under current law, states are
supposed to notify present and past spouses of people with AIDS,
but critics say that is not being done.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is an affliction in which the human immunodeficiency virus
weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to serious
infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual contact,
sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a physician who sponsored the measure
with Rep. Gary L. Ackerman, D-N.Y., said the bill would break ``the
cycle of transmission by identifying those at risk of infection''
and enable people infected with the virus to get medical care that
can stave off the onset of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn said HIV has wrongly been treated ``like a civil rights
issue instead of a public health crisis'' since the 1980s, placing
the privacy rights of those infected above the public good.
</P>
<P>
   Other infectious diseases such as gonorrhea, hepatitis and
syphilis are reported to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta. While every state reports cases of AIDS,
just 33 states report HIV cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, thousands of people have tragically died of AIDS
when their infections could have been prevented had public policy
followed basic public health policy,'' Coburn said at a hearing on
the legislation by the House Commerce Committee's health and
environment panel.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman, who testified before the panel, said the question is
simple: ``Do people have a right to know if someone infected them
with AIDS?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world, partners would confess _ but disclosing
doesn't come easily,'' Ackerman said. ``The purpose of our bill is
not to penalize, but to protect infected partners.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who testified that 15,000 people in her
San Francisco district had died of AIDS complications, said
requiring states to reveal the names of HIV-infected people and
their partners ``threatens to discourage high-risk individuals from
being tested and getting care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can not fight disease by undermining trust in health
care,'' Pelosi, a Democrat, said. ``In the provision of health
care, privacy and trust are essential.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said voluntary cooperation is the key to getting people
to prevent HIV infection and seek care for it. She also said many
women who disclose HIV infection to a partner suffer from domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   But Ackerman said the ``real domestic violence is to knowingly
have a disease, infect your partner and not tell that person the
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., a member of the health panel,
said he understood why people with HIV might be afraid of having
their names posted on a government list, because many of those
infected _ drug users and homosexuals _ are ``among parts of our
population that have been scorned.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Helene D. Gayle, director of the National Center for HIV,
Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Tuberculosis Prevention, urged
members of the panel not to enact the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle testified that the Coburn-Ackerman legislation would scare
people away from medical care by eliminating anonymous HIV testing.
She also said it would be tough to identify past sexual partners of
HIV-infected people because it is difficult, if not impossible, to
determine when a person is infected.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle also said confidentiality must be assured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Partners may fear discrimination, abuse, domestic violence,
loss of jobs or important personal relationships,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is modeled after a New York law enacted this
year that requires physicians to notify the state Department of
Health when a patient tests positive for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a disease that's not going to go away,'' New York
Assemblywoman Nettie Mayerson, who sponsored the state legislation,
told the House panel. ``We have to deal with it not as a civil
rights issue, but as ... the biggest public health menace of our
time.''

MURDER-ARIZONA (Undated) - The majority of the women murdered in
Arizona were killed by a man they knew and were most often shot to
death, according to a national study of 1996 statistics, the most
recent available, expected to be released Wednesday by the anti-gun
Violence Policy Center. Compared nationally, Arizona was the 21st
most deadly state for women, with 35 murders. By SUSAN STECKNER.

FROG ROCK (Congress, Ariz.) - This frog weighs probably 60 tons and
stands (or squats) more than 16 feet tall. And it's solid rock.
</P>
<P>
   The frog is a Congress landmark. It had existed in its natural
state from prehistoric times until about 1928, when it underwent a
wondrous metamorphosis from rock to art.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, it was nothing more than a huge boulder perched on a
hillside amid several other large rocks. Then along came Sara
Perkins, a homesteader's wife who observed that this particular
rock, when viewed from the proper angle, resembled a frog. WITH

   First report cards for network television this season: some
solid grades for new series, a lot of gentleman's C's, a few
perilous scores that could point to early failure, but mainly more
lessons for every network in the new competitive field of six
networks plus cable, which leaves them hard pressed to find an A.
</P>
<P>
   Even though several networks predicted ratings improvements this
season, the first week showed declines for every single one. The
score: network television down 10 percent, cable up 15 percent. But
of the 10 top cable networks, six were down. Those whose ratings
were up included the Weather Channel, thanks to Hurricane Georges,
and CNN and CNBC, thanks to Hurricane Monica.
</P>
<P>
   The week went best for CBS, which had the most viewers over all
for the first time since 1993. That happened to be the last time
that the network had National Football League football games on
Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   NBC showed the biggest drop in viewers, but some of that was to
be expected, with the network losing not only football but also its
real touchdown hero, Jerry Seinfeld.
</P>
<P>
   ABC hoped mostly for an end to the steep ratings slides of
recent seasons and found solace in the modest drop it recorded last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The worst showing probably was that of the Fox network, which
took a pretty thorough beating. Except for Monday night, Fox did
not beat CBS among viewers from age 18 to 49, even though it prides
itself on appealing to young viewers and CBS is often derided in
the business as the senior-citizen network.

   Fox restricts its competitive standing to that group, and was
the second-ranking network among young viewers last season. Last
week it finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has traditionally had trouble with the season's premiere
week. It holds back its biggest hit, ``The X-Files,'' until
November. But surely disturbing to Fox was the disappointing
performance by ``King of the Hill,'' moved from Sundays to
Tuesdays. It got trounced last week. More ominously, the show that
replaced it on Sundays, ``That '70s Show,'' was off 31 percent with
younger viewers.
</P>
<P>
   One big reason, and perhaps more cause for Fox to worry, has
been the dismal showing this summer of repeats of ``The X-Files.''
Did turning that series into a movie dilute interest in the
television show? Fox will wait for November a bit more anxiously
than before.
</P>
<P>
   CBS had reason to be pleased with ``Everybody Loves Raymond''
and a new series, ``King of Queens,'' on Monday; ``JAG'' on
Tuesday; another new series, ``Martial Law,'' on Saturday, and its
entire Sunday lineup. But it also got a boost from the 32nd Annual
Country Music Awards on Wednesday that will not be duplicated, and
one new show, ``Brian Benben,'' stumbled badly.
</P>
<P>
   ABC got its best news from a new series, ``The Hughleys,'' on
Tuesday, where ``Spin City'' held its own against ``Just Shoot Me''
on NBC. Several other spots showed improvement over dead areas last
year, including a Thursday movie and especially a new lineup on
ABC's child-friendly Fridays. But two new dramas on Saturday,
``Fantasy Island'' and ``Cupid,'' fell short of the network's
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Thursday was predictably down without ``Seinfeld'' and
without ``E.R.'' doing a special event like last year's live
episode. But the network still dominated the night as its five
shows took the top five spots on the rating chart. That included
one new series, ``Jesse,'' that is off to an especially promising
start. Another new series, ``Will and Grace,'' was modestly
impressive, but ``Encore! Encore!'' with Nathan Lane looked
vulnerable.

   Instead of being brought to you by the letter K or the number 3,
starting soon ``Sesame Street'' will be brought to you by Discovery
Zone indoor playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its 30-year history, ``Sesame Street,''
the pioneer and still the reigning role model in preschool
educational television, has signed up a corporate underwriter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a more competitive environment than ever before,'' said
Gary Knell, the executive vice president for operations at
Children's Television Workshop, which produces and owns ``Sesame
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only do other PBS children's programs have corporate
underwriters _ Kellogg's Frosted Flakes and Chuck E. Cheese for
``Barney and Friends,'' for example, or Libby's Juicy Juice and
Baby Gap for ``Arthur'' _ but Children's Television Workshop has
had to generate much of the money to produce ``Sesame Street'' by
selling videos, CDs, books and licensed merchandise like Cookie
Monster dolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally we've subsidized the show itself for many
millions of dollars, and we felt we could make up some of that
money through these corporate sponsorships,'' Knell said, adding
that it was a ``seven-figure'' deal with Discovery Zone and that
the company is pursuing several other underwriters.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Montgomery, president of the Center for Media Education,
a research and advocacy group that focuses on the media's influence
on children, said she was concerned by the shift, even if the
Discovery Zone messages were to be ``pro-social,'' as Knell said
they would be.
</P>
<P>
   ```Sesame Street' was the last bastion of really quality,
completely noncommercial programming, where parents of preschoolers
could feel safe in having their children watch without being
targets of marketing,'' she said. ``This is part of a disturbing
trend in public television.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15-second Discovery Zone credits, at the beginning and end
of each episode, will begin on Nov. 16, when ``Sesame Street''
starts its 30th season on PBS.

   The Sitcom Siren Song
</P>
<P>
   Susan Harris, one of television's most successful and prolific
comedy writers, has told the world for five years that she was
permanently retired after a career in which she wrote the first 70
episodes of the 1970s hit ``Soap'' and created other hits like
``Golden Girls,'' ``Benson'' and ``Empty Nest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Hollywood is kind of a hard town to stay retired in; they
keep looking for you,'' Ms. Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   So after saying no to numerous network entreaties, Ms. Harris
has created a new comedy for ABC, ``The Secret Lives of Men,''
which begins Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling fine about not writing,'' she said. She quit
shortly after she and her husband and production partner, Paul
Junger Witt, had a baby 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly the men around her, including the couple's partner,
Tony Thomas, started getting divorced and ``this show popped into
my head _ a show about divorced guys in their 30s,'' Ms. Harris
said. ``It was full of funny, rich stuff. It sort of wrote
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she discovered by listening in on men's conversations
that contrary to their image, ``men do talk to each other.'' The
critical reaction to the show has been mixed, which she said
surprised her. ``Maybe it's a Clinton backlash _ a touchy-feely guy
who can almost cry on cue. Maybe some people don't want to see
those kind of guys on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC certainly had a positive reaction; the network gave the show
its best spot for a new comedy, after ``The Drew Carey Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris has written the first 10 episodes, and she admits to
being ``near tears'' over the weekly production grind. ``When I was
sitting home writing, I was happy. When it all starts in
production, I regret ever having done this.''
</P>
<P>
   She does not regret the time period or the chance to build
another hit. If the show goes well, she said, she will probably
write a couple more episodes this season and two or three to start
next season. ``Then,'' she said, ``it will be time to back off and
get my life back.''

IN THE FIGHT AGAINST FAT, WE FORGOT ABOUT SUGAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're all counting fat grams and eating low-fat cookies. So how
come we keep getting fatter?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because we're eating too many calorie-laden low-fat and
fat-free snack foods, suggest surveys commissioned by the U.S.
Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are getting a lower percentage of their calories from
fat (34 percent, down from close to 40 percent five years ago), but
we're eating more calories overall. The number of people overweight
and obese is at an all-time high, notes the American Heart
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, too many people mistakenly believe that if they
count fat grams, they can ignore calories.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people read labels, they're more likely to notice what's
low-fat and `healthy,' but may not be looking at calories,'' says
Karen Donato, coordinator of the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute's Obesity Education Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, more people are eating out, and portion sizes have
increased,'' Donato says. ``Another issue is decreased physical
activity. So, people are consuming more calories and are less
active. It doesn't take much to tip the energy balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though weight-lifting and kick-boxing classes are in vogue,
studies indicate that Americans are more sedentary on the job and
in their leisure time. We turn on the television and open the
garage door with the push of a button, step on the elevator to
``climb'' a single flight of stairs, and sit in front of computer
terminals for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Children also are watching far more television and are less
physically active than in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we broaden our definition of obesity to include people who
are overweight, over 50 percent of American adults and 15 to 20
percent of our children are overweight today,'' says Dr. Robert
Eckel, professor of medicine and physiology and program director of
the General Research Center at the University of Colorado Health
Science Center in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to some widely circulated ideas about low-fat eating,
calories do count,'' Eckel says. ``We need to wake up. We're too
heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lower-fat foods may have contributed to the mistaken idea that
there are some ``free'' foods that we can overindulge in without
paying much attention to how much we are eating, says Barbara
Gollman, a spokesman for the American Dietetic Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another problem is that our frequency of eating out is
increasing, and it's adding up on our hips,'' Gollman says.
``Portions are larger and foods are richer than they need to be for
healthy eating. And we tend to think of eating out as a special
occasion, so we celebrate with foods we might not eat at home.''

GORDON PARKS DONATES 227 WORKS TO CORCORAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeats to fix spelling in slug; no other changes) 
 (ATTN: N.Y., Wis.)  (mk) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gordon Parks was so pleased by the way the Corcoran
Gallery of Art put together an exhibition of his photographs that
he has given 227 of them, practically every one in the show, to the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   The show, called ``Half Past Autumn: The Art of Gordon Parks,''
is now on view at the Museum of the City of New York, where it will
continue through Nov. 1 before traveling to the Milwaukee Art
Museum. Its tour ends in 2003, after stops in 16 American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Parks' gift includes his own print of his well-known photograph
``American Gothic, Washington, D.C.,'' also known as ``Washington
D.C. government Charwoman.''
</P>
<P>
   The photograph is actually an icon of an icon, a 1942 updating
of Grant Wood's ``American Gothic.'' Instead of a Midwestern farmer
and his wife, Parks photographed a woman who cleaned floors at a
government building that housed the Farm Security Administration,
for which Parks once worked as a photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a pitchfork, Parks' subject, Ella Watson, holds a
broom and a mop. Behind her is a large American flag. Parks'
photograph presents a stoic if telling story of the role of blacks
in America at that time, especially in segregated Washington, where
the job of charwoman was one of the few open to most black women.
</P>
<P>
   Parks, too, is black, and David Levy, president and director of
the Corcoran Gallery of Art, reflected on that as he discussed the
photographer's gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very tough for a black man in photography when he
started out,'' Levy said. ``We have to regard him as a great
American hero. Here he is 85 years old and has no sense of
martyrdom or bitterness.''
</P>
<P>
   The road traveled by Parks, who is noted as well as a movie
director, was long and hard. He was born in Fort Scott, Kan., the
youngest of 15 children. His father was a poor tenant farmer and
his mother died when he was 15. Now he is donating a collection
that the Corcoran can value only in the millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Parks was a photographer for Life magazine for 20 years, and his
films include ``The Learning Tree'' and ``Shaft.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his picture of the charwoman, other notable Parks
photographs in the gift include a series for Life on crime, poverty
and gang warfare in Harlem, as well as on Paris fashions.
</P>
<P>
   The Parks gift strengthens the Corcoran's already large
collection of photographs. Such collecting was pioneered, Levy
said, by the Museum of Modern Art, the George Eastman House and the
Corcoran.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time,'' Levy said, ``photography was regarded as a
journalistic thing, hard to place in the context of art. But now,
even the Getty is getting deeply into photography, and the National
Gallery of Art has large holdings. I think we're getting over that
hump.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole experience of working with Gordon was so positive,''
Levy said. ``We really felt that we shared a great deal _ what our
mission was and what he felt was important for his work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Parks show was seen last year at the Corcoran and this year
at the Minnesota Museum of American Art in St. Paul, in addition to
the Museum of the City of New York. It will be at the Milwaukee Art
Museum from Nov. 20 to Jan. 10, and at the Detroit Institute of
Arts from Feb. 7 to April 25.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From the nondescript headquarters of his Houston
construction firm, Leo E. Linbeck Jr., a lanky, bow-tied executive
with a drawl, is masterminding a crusade to overturn the nation's
tax system.
</P>
<P>
   Once, someone like him might have hired some of Washington's
``Gucci Gulch'' lobbyists to prowl the marble corridors outside
Congress' tax committees. But Linbeck, with Texas-style
audaciousness, wants to engineer a populist uprising to replace the
income tax code with a national sales tax. And with $15 million
from some initial investors and mass fundraising, he has run a
radio and television advertising campaign and employed an army of
media consultants, pollsters, political strategists, marketers,
academics and yes, even a few lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine what it would be like if you were in Congress and you
got a thousand phone calls a week and letters and e-mails and
faxes,'' Linbeck, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in
Dallas, said. ``Not people from all over the country, but your
constituents, people whose names you recognize, the people who were
at the polls with you, who live down the street with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck and his fellow investors in ``Americans for Fair
Taxation'' are unusual in the scale of their ambition. But their
methods have become commonplace as lobbying has undergone a
revolution over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely now does a well-connected Washington lobbyist work alone
to persuade power brokers in Congress. Instead, the lobbyist has
become just one of many players running full-fledged national
campaigns intended to create a ``grass-roots'' groundswell in
support of, or more often in opposition to, legislation before
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In their million-dollar costs and their reliance on television,
polling and grass-roots constituency building, these efforts most
resemble presidential campaigns. And they are now so pervasive and
sophisticated that it has become difficult to distinguish between a
lobbying effort, an issue advocacy campaign and a citizens'
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these efforts are genuine grass-roots movements. But
others are deceptions in which a special interest pays to create
the appearance of a popular groundswell.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of these techniques has spread the wealth of the
influence industry beyond the lawyer-lobbyist to a new class of
political professionals, who often play overlapping roles as
advisers to presidential and congressional candidates, corporate
tacticians and media pundits.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where the distinctions and conflicts between their
multiple roles seem to matter less and less and can even be a
business advantage, strategists who are ideological enemies in
politics put their differences aside to work together on
large-scale corporate campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is the outgrowth of several developments in technology
and politics. E-mail, computer databases, talk radio and 24-hour
cable television all make it easier to organize and send a
political message across the country at warp speed.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, power in Washington has been dispersed, so
that new ways are needed to influence more legislators. The media
age politician is far more likely to be moved by polls, television
ads and mass constituent contacts than by party discipline, a
committee chairman or a Washington wise man. And the Republicans in
Congress know they came to power with the help of several groups
with grass-roots memberships: the National Federation of
Independent Businesses, the National Rifle Association, the
Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a couple of evolutions happening simultaneously,''
said Keith Appell, of Creative Response Concepts, a Republican
public relations concern that is involved in national issue
campaigns. ``There's Republican sensitivity to grass roots, and
certain lobbying methods you didn't have before and the explosion
of media in the communications age.''
</P>
<P>
   Public policy experts debate whether the new methods of lobbying
have made it more democratic by taking it out of the back rooms of
the Capitol or whether they have simply made it far more difficult
for interests without money to compete in the public arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of a trend in Washington where rational debate on
issues gets buried in big-budget sound bites,'' said Edward
Yingling, the chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck says of his way of moving Congress: ``It's not as
orderly. It's not as predictable. It's not as controlled as some
might want it to be. But I think those are positive attributes.''
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of the worlds of lobbying and politics is
evident in how Linbeck has gone about his people's crusade. He
estimates the effort will take several years and ultimately cost an
extraordinary $90 million, a sum likely only if hundreds of
thousands of Americans join his cause. Right now, a major tax
overhaul is only a glimmer far out on the horizon of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his initial money went to hire prominent academics and
research organizations to develop the 23 percent national sales
tax. But to speed the organizing and make his proposal as
politically appealing as possible, he has also turned to national
experts in politics, using Denis Calabrese, a Houston Republican
consultant and onetime aide to Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, as his
chief strategist. With Calabrese's help, ``Americans for Fair
Taxation'' has hired an all-star cast from both parties to propel
his tax plan:
</P>
<P>
   _Richard Wirthlin, President Reagan's pollster, surveyed the
electorate's attitudes towards the tax system, with some help from
Mark Mellman, pollster to the Democratic leadership in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   _Don Sipple, a media adviser to Bob Dole's presidential campaign
produced early television advertisements to test-market the sales
tax.
</P>
<P>
   _Fred Steeper, a well-established Republican pollster in
Michigan, checked on the advertisements' results.
</P>
<P>
   _Creative Response Concepts, whose president, Greg Mueller, was
communications director for Patrick Buchanan's 1996 presidential
run, promotes the sales tax to journalists.
</P>
<P>
   _Charles Sewell, a one-time Democratic staff aide and strategist
who is now a vice president at the Washington office of Ketchum
Public Relations, scours the country for civic leaders who can head
chapters of Americans for Fair Taxation in the nation's 435
congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   _Americans for Fair Taxation does have a more traditional
lobbying team too, from Arter &AMP; Hadden, a law firm whose ranks
include two former members of Congress from Texas, Thomas Loeffler,
a Republican, and Jim Chapman, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Argus Group, another Washington lobbying and government
relations company, has drafted the sales tax legislation. This may
sound like the lobbying equivalent of the Normandy invasion. But
ever since the epic battle against Clinton's proposal for national
health insurance in 1994, these kinds of ensembles have assembled
on issue after issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients and industries have come to appreciate there are no
solo pilots in this town,'' said Jack Quinn, who returned to the
law firm of Arnold &AMP; Porter after he stepped down as White House
counsel. ``Now you send armies, ships, tanks, aircraft, infantry,
Democrats and Republicans, grass-roots specialists, people with
special relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, much about these campaigns remains undisclosed,
from the cost to who is behind them. Many consultants who are
willing to explain their techniques will not identify their
clients, citing confidentiality clauses in their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 the new Republican Congress approved major changes in
how Congress does business. It imposed a gift ban and passed tough
new disclosure requirements for lobbyists. But the legislation did
not include reporting requirements for ``grass-roots'' lobbying
like telephone and letter-writing campaigns, even if the campaigns
were generated by hired lobbyists and organizers.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier effort to pass a disclosure law that would have
required reporting on such lobbying faltered in the Democratic
Congress in 1994 when Rep. Newt Gingrich, then the House Republican
whip, branded the measure as an ``anti-religious'' attempt to chill
growing grass-roots conservative movements like the Christian
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Many groups had an interest in that battle because many have
genuine, permanent grass-roots memberships, from the Christian
Coalition to the Sierra Club. But creating citizens movements _ or
the semblance of one _ on demand has also become big business.
</P>
<P>
   Big public relations companies and even the little boutique
shops advertise such arcane-sounding specialities as: ``development
of third party allies'' or ``grass-roots recruitment and
mobilization,'' or ``grass-tops lobbying.'' The goal of these kinds
of campaigns is to shape the terms of congressional debate and to
persuade ordinary voters to serve as the front-line advocates for
the paying clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the concept, you move beyond candidate advertising
and beyond party organizations and form your own free-standing
operation around an issue,'' said Brian Lunde, a former executive
director of the Democratic National Committee who specializes in
this kind of organizing. ``The day of the PAC check and the steak
dinner and the golf dinner is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners say a grass-roots effort can cost from $40,000 for
a small-scale attempt to sway the vote of just one or two crucial
members of a subcommittee to many millions of dollars to sway a
majority in Congress. Some companies base their fees on the number
of calls or letters they generate.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Campaigns &AMP; Elections magazine, a trade
journal, conducted a painstaking survey and concluded that
``grass-roots lobbying'' _ separate and apart from more traditional
lobbying _ had become an $800 million industry over 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And advertising, like the tobacco industry's more than $40
million campaign against tobacco legislation this spring, adds to
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inside game of lobbying is in decline and the outside game
of consumer messaging _ of marshaling public opinion _ is advancing
and increasing,'' said Mike Murphy, media consultant in 1996 to the
Republican presidential candidates Lamar Alexander and Bob Dole.
``And savvy companies have figured out that the best experts to
hire to do this kind of work are political consultants.'' His
company also specializes in advertising, research and political
organizing for corporations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Evolution &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, corporations rarely used any of these
techniques. Grass-roots mobilizations were the province of
environmentalists, the civil rights movement or the anti-war
effort. Television advertising on legislation would have been
considered an extravagant waste of money.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1980s, campaign strategists looking for ways to
keep a stable business during off-years and corporations looking
for a better way to argue their case found common ground.
</P>
<P>
   Sewell, who made the transition from Democratic politics,
recalls that his first experience with the industry he now
specializes in came when AT&AMP;T, after it was forced by regulators to
spin off the regional phone companies, hired the political public
relations company where he then worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't know what they were asking for '' he said. ``They
thought they needed something like what was in a political
campaign. We didn't know quite what to make of it, but we started
developing programs whereby we understood that just like a member
of Congress has a constituency, a corporation has a constituency.
Our job was to go and identify that constituency and mobilize that
constituency to advocate a point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then such campaigns have become pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   New forms of communication like the Internet, e-mail, talk radio
and computerized ``blast faxes'' have made it far easier to
organize national constituencies and instantly instruct them on
when to deluge Congress in letters and phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the congressional gift ban cut down on
opportunities for traditional lobbyists to wine and dine lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   And as party discipline has waned, members of Congress have also
proved ever more responsive to television advertising or contacts
from home, or the ups and downs of instantly sampled public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have entrepreneurial politicians not disciplined by the
party but by their own images,'' Murphy said. ``The mainspring in
this is that public opinion counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least the element of public opinion that is marshaled by
the paid organizers and image makers. ``There may be a lot of
people who agree with your position but they will never get
involved,'' Sewell said. ``It's our job to find the people who
would agree with the position and get them involved.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Television Advertising &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Often these days, it is television advertising that frames the
terms of discussion for the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when the Health Insurance Association of America
used its $17 million ``Harry and Louise'' commercials to help
defeat Clinton's plan for universal health insurance, the effort
was pioneering.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big gamble in that nobody had done this kind of thing
on that scale before,'' said Ben Goddard, a partner in the Malibu
company, Goddard-Claussen/First Tuesday, that made the commercials,
in which a middle-aged couple agonized in their kitchen about
Clinton's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Now Goddard's company has its own Washington office. And
television advertising recently crossed another milestone. The
estimated $40 million advertising campaign that the five largest
tobacco companies used this spring to defeat anti-tobacco
legislation was the most expensive and sustained issue advocacy
campaign ever undertaken on legislation, according to the Annenberg
Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Such advertising campaigns are usually accompanied by
industry-run mobilizations of the grass roots, intended to make
average citizens the advocates for the paying corporate clients.
Sometimes the advertisements help lobbyists find those sympathizers
by running toll-free telephone numbers for people to call.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these efforts still amount to easily spotted
carpet-bombing of Congress with mass-generated form letters and
telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who sponsored the
anti-tobacco bill, was swamped with form letters opposing his
legislation from members of the National Smokers Alliance. The
alliance receives financing from the Philip Morris Companies Inc.,
the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. and the Lorillard Tobacco Co.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, also received letters opposing his
position on tobacco _ from one particular part of his state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't figure out why I would get all these letters from
one area,'' Harkin said. ``It turns out they work for a Kraft food
plant owned by R.J. Reynolds. But there was no disclosure of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the practitioners who create grass-roots lobbying
campaigns for business say that at their best, they mobilize real
people with a sincere interest in the cause _ sometimes company
employees, shareholders, retirees or vendors and sometimes
individuals carefully selected through sophisticated demographic
research.
</P>
<P>
   Take the campaign waged this year by the nation's credit unions
to preserve their memberships in the face of a Supreme Court ruling
that federal regulators had overstepped when they allowed small
employee groups, too small to form their own credit union, to join
others.
</P>
<P>
   To pass their legislation over the opposition from the banks,
the credit unions hired a large Washington cast of lobbyists,
strategists and public relations specialists to mount an issue
campaign that would take advantage of the fact that credit unions
have loyal customers who favor them over banks. One person familiar
with the campaign said it has cost about $12 million over two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The strategists deployed every weapon in the lobbying arsenal,
including television commercials, talk radio, letter-writing
campaigns and toll-free numbers that customers could use to call
Congress. The campaign culminated in a rally of 7,000 supporters on
the West Lawn of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Gill, a former Democratic campaign coordinator for House
races who was the credit unions' chief strategist, said, ``Members
of Congress had a classic dilemma. They want the support of their
local banks and their campaign contributions, but they also want
the votes of over 100,000 credit union people who really care about
this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The credit unions were not loath to do fund-raising too. Some
credit union members paid $25 to $100 apiece to hold special
fund-raisers for specific lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bankers Association had its own in-house
specialists in ``grass-roots'' lobbying, but decided that it would
not run the same kind of campaign as the credit unions. ``We knew
from our polling and focus groups and others this was not a battle
we would be able to win in terms of grass-roots volume,'' said
Yingling, the chief lobbyist for the association. ``We had to win
it in terms of the quality of the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the last two weeks before the Senate was to vote, the
banks did turn to a toll-free number to generate thousands of
telegrams to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   After this summer's loss, Yingling said his group was
re-examining its budget for future grass-roots efforts. ``This is
just going to continue to escalate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What Does It Mean &LR;
</P>
<P>
   These changes in lobbying are taking place at the same time that
party politics is metamorphosing in the television age, with
fund-raisers replacing block captains and the public increasingly
cut off from either main party. And some say these lobbying efforts
are the politics of the future. ``It's like the election industry
back in the '70s,'' Lunde said. ``There was no such thing then.
This is the same thing. It's the next generation of political
campaign in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners differed over whether the new practices were
reinvigorating participation or squelching it.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck of Texas said that his sales tax movement gives citizens
a chance to dictate an agenda to Congress instead of acting like
vassals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a form of contemporary feudalism,'' he said.
``Now how do you reverse that in a relatively benign way? A loud
demonstration to the electorate that they do not have to be a
supplicant with respect to a very important issue for them. And if
they are interested in this and run with it to the extent that the
polling, focus groups and test markets suggest they will, it will
be a leverage point for creating a different view of government by
the average person.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that so much money is being poured into these
efforts that their true purpose is to drown out competing
viewpoints. ``The whole effort of these campaigns is to prevent a
second opinion from occurring,'' said David Cohen, a co-director of
the Advocacy Institute, which teaches citizens groups how to make
their cases.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who was one of the leaders of the
fight for lobbying disclosure, said that the problem with some of
the techniques is that they can create a distorted picture when
firms are paid to generate a certain number of phone calls or
telegrams and keep canvassing the citizenry until they meet the
quota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly a member of Congress is getting 50 phone calls on
something,'' Levin said. ``That's a lot of phone calls. What the
member doesn't know is that 950 other people were contacted and
said, `No way.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So it looks like you are being inundated,'' Levin said. ``It
creates the perception of huge support or opposition when in
reality there may be no such thing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Grass Tops &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Because mass mobilizations have become so prevalent, a number of
companies have become experts in a technique known as
``grass-tops'' lobbying, aimed at mobilizing an elite as opposed to
the masses.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to figure out to whom a member of Congress cannot
say no _ his chief donor, his campaign manager, a political mentor.
The lobbyist then tries to persuade that person to take his
client's side on an issue. If the method works, the member of
Congress may never know that a person contacting him had been
revved up by a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   To pull off this feat, Washington lobbying and public relations
agencies keep databases of organizers across the country _ most of
them with backgrounds in politics _ who are intimately familiar
with local politicians. Richard Pinsky of West Palm Beach, Fla.,
who managed Dole's Florida primary campaign in 1996, is one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Pinsky said that in the past five years he has been hired by
three Washington public relations and lobbying companies on a
variety of legislation before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with Florida a swing delegation in a House fight over
trade, the Dewey Square Group, a public relations firm, relied on
Pinsky to find prominent citizens to lobby targeted House members
to support giving Clinton ``fast-track'' trade negotiating
authority.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Pinsky said, he asked Robert Martinez, Florida's
former Republican governor, who has an international trade
practice, to reach Rep. Jim Davis, a Democratic freshman. ``It
wasn't necessarily that a former Republican governor would have
influence on a Democratic congressman,'' Pinsky said, ``as that the
governor lived in his district.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis _ who did come to support the president _ said that he had
independently sought to speak with the former governor. And he said
it did not matter if Pinsky had also spoken with Martinez because
``I knew he had a business interest in promoting trade,'' he said.
``I took it into account.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that if someone without an obvious interest reached
him him on an issue because of the involvement of a Washington
lobbying firm, he would want to know about the role of the
intermediaries.

 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Opening night at the Metropolitan Opera is one of
those times in the performing arts when the audience commands as
much attention as the event being witnessed onstage. With the house
bulging with gowned and tuxedoed patrons and with a banquet
awaiting some of them on the upper levels, the Met made a shrewd
choice of repertory on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Saint-Saens' ``Samson et Dalila'' was just the ticket: a
second-rate opera offering just enough surface charm and colorful
production values to compete with its many-hued listeners out
front. Television cameras, transmitting the evening's doings to
watchers of the Public Broadcasting Service, seemed to swivel back
and forth from stage to orchestra seats, and I, for one, found the
spectacle of spectators proceeding down the aisles at least as
stimulating as Saint-Saens' dull-as-dishwater first act.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few distractions from the general revelry. One
marked the 30th anniversary of Placido Domingo's debut at the
house. Domingo's extraordinary loyalty to the Met has included more
than 550 singing performances, 39 roles, conducting appearances in
six operas, and 17 opening nights. The latter statistic ties Enrico
Caruso in the first-night derby, and afterward Domingo was
presented with a Caruso caricature and some autograph bars from
Cilea's ``Adriana Lecouvreur,'' the tenor's debut role on Sept. 28,
1968.
</P>
<P>
   Opera operates on so many different levels that one can often
come to the rescue of another. It happens several times in the
Met's ``Samson et Dalila,'' first of all in the role of Dalila
itself, which rises above the musical mediocrity around it.
</P>
<P>
   Second is the Elijah Moshinsky-Richard Hudson production, with
its seductive oranges, reds, pinks and various points in between.
The opera recounts the biblical struggle between Hebrews and
Philistines, and the monochromatic depictions of the first and the
extravagant shades that cover the second send out a message that
goodness is boring, evil is gorgeous, and that for the pious,
beauty is not to be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of Monday's display,
however, was how beauty of singing can on occasion transcend the
quality of what is being sung. We are used to good music's
overcoming bad words in opera, but here was the voice in and of
itself overcoming both. So splendid were the voices in this less
than satisfying opera that one almost came to understand the
rabidity of opera-singer cults, the loud and semihysterical bands
of followers that attach themselves to individuals and relegate the
operas being sung to a peripheral status.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard, at any rate, to imagine a better Dalila than Olga
Borodina, who was to have sung the role a year ago but took time
out to become a mother. Ms. Borodina's confidence in the sheer
physical quality of her voice emboldens her to range from powerful
outbursts to near stage whispers, both of which carry easily in
this big space. More important is the musical elegance of her
delivery, the fineness of the diction, the absence of excess, the
tastefulness that nonetheless is couched in the most passionate and
seductive of terms. It was singing to remember.
</P>
<P>
   For a tenor in his late 50s, Domingo still exhibits an
astonishing vocal health. His Samson was at once reckless in its
flat-out devotion and skillfully managed. Domingo's ultimate upward
reach at the opera's last moment nearly went astray, but that
simply reminded us of the exertions that led up to it.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the voices, all male, were at least energetic. Rene
Pape made a good impression as the Old Hebrew. Sergei Leiferkus
(the High Priest), Richard Paul Fink (Abimelech) and Bernard Fitch,
Alfred Walker and Charles Anthony (as various Philistines) worked
hard. Graeme Murphy's dance sequence and its minimally clad
performers underlined a healthy interest in sex among the pagans.
Duane Schuler created the lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Peter McClintock took over the stage direction for this year's
revival and seems to have toned down some of the overly excitable
tendencies of Moshinsky's original. James Levine conducted the
Met's orchestra and chorus in a performance that moved swiftly but
never panted for breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samson et Dalila'' opened the Met's season but did not really
represent it. Schoenberg's ``Moses und Aron'' and Berg's
``Wozzeck'' promise important moments later on. Carlisle Floyd's
amiable ``Susannah'' will give the house a momentary American
voice. Janacek's ``Katya Kabanova'' returns, and there will be new
productions for three old favorites: Mozart's ``Nozze di Figaro,''
``La Traviata'' by Verdi and Donizetti's ``Lucia di Lammermoor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Samson'' was something less: a nice entertainment for the Met
subscribers. One was happy for them, for it is they who keep this
house in such fiscal good health. What raised Monday's performance
above the level of mere floor show, on the other hand, was a level
of singing that floated disembodied above both the opera and its
party-minded listeners.

CHINESE DISSIDENTS ISSUE A SHARP CHALLENGE TO THE GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A small group of dissident intellectuals here has
issued a sharp challenge to the government, circulating two
manifestoes on freedom and social justice that reject in scathing
terms many hallowed tenets of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge arises as the government acts to stamp out a
fledgling alternative political party, in recent weeks temporarily
detaining many of its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The two new declarations, about five single-spaced pages each in
English translation, are circulating on the Internet and in faxed
copies. One, a ``Declaration on Civil Rights and Freedom,'' details
how individual rights are suppressed in China and rejects the
government's argument that human rights are a relative concept, to
be adapted to national conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The second, a ``Declaration on Civil Rights and Social
Justice,'' analyzes what the writers say is the theft of the fruits
of the emerging market economy by a privileged clique.
</P>
<P>
   The manifestoes place unusual emphasis on social justice and a
link between dictatorship and the cornering of economic wealth. The
arguments could have popular appeal in China, because as the
dazzling economic growth of recent years begins to stall, concerns
about corruption and inequality are rising.
</P>
<P>
   More unusual is that the statements, which do not mince words in
their indictments of the communist system, are signed by five
people who are still living here, albeit under the close watch of
security agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will assume the consequences of issuing these declarations,
including the possibility of being sent to prison,'' said a signer,
Ding Zilin.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ding and her husband, Jiang Peikun, also a signer and said
to be the chief drafter of the declarations, are the parents of a
student who was killed when the army smashed pro-democracy
demonstrations in 1989 in Tiananmen Square. Retired professors at
People's University in Beijing, they are known as tireless
campaigners for an official reappraisal of the student movement.
</P>
<P>
   The other signers are Wei Xiaotao, an engineer and the younger
brother of an exiled dissident, Wei Jingsheng; Lin Mu, onetime
Communist Party secretary of Northwestern University in Xian, and
Jiang Qisheng, a former doctoral candidate at People's University
who was jailed for one and a half years after 1989 and never
allowed to resume his studies.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang said in an interview Tuesday that individual freedoms and
rights were a ``core value of all humanity'' and that through the
declarations ``we hope we can arouse a peaceful and open popular
movement demanding these freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   The declaration on rights and freedom includes a frontal assault
on the primacy of the Communist Party, still a cardinal principle
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's rulers continue to impose on all Chinese citizens a
political party that cannot represent the interests and will of all
the people,'' the statement says. ``If this situation continues
there is bound to be increasing conflict with the reality of
pluralistic interests and values that have emerged in the process
of China's modernization.''
</P>
<P>
   The document belittles China's efforts to promote the rule of
law, saying the legal system remains ``a tool used by the ruling
clique to maintain and safeguard its grip on power.''
</P>
<P>
   The second manifesto, on rights and social justice, contends
that economic changes here have enabled a political elite and those
who curry its favor to enrich themselves at the expense of the
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society's wealth,'' it says, ``is not being accumulated by
hard-working, pioneering and law-abiding people, but is falling
into the hands of the dregs of society, the holders of privileged
power and their sycophants, corrupt officials and those who steal
what they are entrusted with protecting.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Ding, speaking by telephone from Wuxi in Jiangsu Province,
where she and her husband are spending the fall, said the group had
not tried to enlist other signers, in part because of the danger.
</P>
<P>
   She said the process of discussing and sharing drafts had been
nerve-racking. Wei and Jiang Qisheng were briefly detained because
of their work on the declarations, as were other friends who sent
related faxes or messages.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ding said the authors had faxed the declarations to a
contact in New York for translation into English and distribution
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The declarations have been posted on the sites of a group in New
York, Human Rights in China (http://www.hrichina.org) and an
international group, the Digital Freedom Network
(http://www.dfn.org).

   BOEING-WOODARD (Seattle) Ron Woodard, forced out earlier this
month as president of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, has decided
to retire effective Nov. 1, the company announced Tuesday. Woodard
has not announced what he plans to do next, and was not available

HOUSE EMBROILED IN IMPEACHMENT DISCUSSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Signs of disarray abound as the House confronts the
momentous task of weighing President Clinton's possible
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the frenzy, many House Democrats seethed at their leader,
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, last week for calling on
Republicans to resolve the Clinton inquiry within 30 days. Gephardt
issued the challenge a day before his party's 206 House members
could have discussed the strategy at their weekly policy meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought 30 days was a mistake to talk about,'' said
Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat and senior
member of the House Judiciary Committee, the day after Gephardt's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many House Republicans privately railed
against Speaker Newt Gingrich's confrontational role in the
impeachment matter. Fearing Gingrich's rhetoric could dissolve the
aura of bipartisanship they need to preserve their credibility,
rank-and-file GOP members succeeded in steering him away from the
spotlight, if only temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes in the tumultuous early stages of the landmark
inquiry. From top to bottom, the House is embroiled, as one senior
Democratic staff member observed Tuesday, in ``a frantic,
unmethodical, narrow-minded, play-it-by-the-half-hour process''
that threatens to undermine the public's faith in the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   News conferences erupt in partisan bickering, as lawmakers
jostle for position before the cameras. Rival aides on the
Judiciary Committee argue bitterly in the hallways outside the
hearing room, accusing each other of engaging in unsavory politics.
</P>
<P>
   And many lawmakers, cringing at the confusion, are voicing
concerns about the potential consequences for themselves, the
presidency and the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It undercuts everything. Everything,'' said the Senate
majority leader, Trent Lott, Tuesday about recent attacks by
Democrats on the Republican handling of the impeachment process, a
criticism of the GOP that several recent polls show a majority of
Americans agree with.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent burst of animosity among lawmakers in both
parties, Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, the Judiciary
Committee chairman, said the fighting has been ``horrendous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee, which is conducting a preliminary
impeachment inquiry, is expected to recommend early next week that
the House open a full-scale investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are so high that if Congress convicts Clinton without
a fair, orderly impeachment, the repercussions could harm the
country for a generation or more, asserted Representative Jerrold
Nadler, a New York Democrat who serves on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mishandling the process could create ``the most divisive act
since the Vietnam War,'' Nadler said. ``If we're not going to have
20 years of recriminations, then it has to be done fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the first signs of constructive bipartisanship among
Judiciary Committee members, four lawmakers Tuesday sent Hyde a
letter asking him to determine whether the independent counsel,
Kenneth W. Starr, plans to forward evidence to the House on his
other investigations of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William D. Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat who has
avoided partisan grandstanding and opted for trying to work with
several committee Republicans behind the scenes, forged the
preliminary alliance with Democrat Howard L. Berman of California,
and two Republicans: Representatives Lindsey O. Graham of South
Carolina, and W. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter to Hyde, the four expressed concern that Starr
recently indicated he would ``soon make final decisions about what
steps to take, if any, with respect to the other information'' on
his investigation into the Whitewater real estate transaction, the
firings of the White House travel office, and the administration's
improper use of FBI files.
</P>
<P>
   The four lamwakers asserted the impeachment inquiry could be
damaged by a raft of new information from Starr on matters
unrelated to Clinton's sex scandal. In asking Hyde to consult
Starr, Delahunt's coalition stated, ``It will minimize the risk
that new information might surface at a later date, forcing the
committee to subject the American people to the entire process all
over again.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hyde tried to ease partisan tensions on Monday by
granting a number of high-priority requests from the Democratic
minority. Notable among them was his pledge that President Clinton
and his lawyers will be permitted to fully participate in a formal
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to approve the inquiry late next week.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also reversed position and permitted committee
investigators from both parties to begin inspecting an estimated 20
boxes of additional evidence related to Clinton's affair with
Monica S. Lewinsky that Starr did not deliver to Congress.
Democrats suspect the material may contain information that could
help Clinton's defense.
</P>
<P>
   But discord persists as the votes draw near on whether to open a
formal inquiry. Emotions are particularly raw on the Judiciary
Committee, which is far more widely divided along ideological lines
than the House itself.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, for example, continues to anger Democrats over his
position on numerous issues, including leaving open the possibility
of expanding the potential impeachment inquiry to matters that are
not under Starr's jurisdiction such as campaign fund-raising abuses
in the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the final batch of Starr's investigative material
that the Judiciary Committee approved making public is scheduled to
be released Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The material, which House investigators in both parties said
contains ``no smoking guns,'' is expected to provide extensive
details about several key elements of Starr's investigation,
including Linda R. Tripp's controversial role in secretly taping
dozens of phone calls with Lewinsky and in wearing a hidden
recording device for the FBI to monitor a conversation with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The documents include a claim by former Clinton adviser Dick
Morris that presidential allies had mounted a ``secret police
operation to go around and intimidate women'' who may have been
involved with the president. But in an interview with The
Associated Press, Morris said his testimony was based on no
firsthand information and was a supposition based on his reading of
affidavits and published accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, in her conversation recorded by the FBI, is said to
have told Tripp, ``I wouldn't cross these people for fear of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the material to be released indicates that White House
adviser Sidney Blumenthal asked Hillary Rodham Clinton about
Lewinsky and was told not to worry, that the president was
``ministering to a troubled young person.''

<P>
   DISNEY-HIGH-CULTURE (Burbank, Calif.) _ Like Coke or McDonald's,
the Disney name and brand is so implanted in the culture of the
nation and the world that to say the word is to evoke a wholly
defined universe _ in this case Disney's familiar panoply of antic,
animated icons and competent, comforting family entertainment. To
some they add up to imaginative, benign, pop culture marvels. To
others, they're just superficial cultural junk. But the storyboard
outside Michael D. Eisner's office is a window onto another side of
the Mouse. Seemingly unnoticed, under Eisner's watch, Disney has
become a purveyor of what can only be described as high culture. By
Peter Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   SLAM-FILM (Undated) _ Marc Levin's feature film ``Slam'' is a
vivid marriage of ideas usually seen as contradictions: documentary
and fiction, action and poetry, black and white. ``Slam,'' which
opens here on Friday after screening in the New York Film Festival,
is the story of a young black performance poet, Raymond Joshua
(Saul Williams) who is imprisoned on a petty drug charge but who
manages to establish his identity and his voice within the
maelstrom of a Washington, D.C. jail. By Laura Winters. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CELEBRATION-TOWN (Celebration, Fla.) _ There are similarities
between the fictional movie town and this post-neotraditional town
built by those masters of make-believe, the Walt Disney Co. Both
are pretty and orderly, populated by smiling, waving residents and
blessed by sunny skies and warm temperatures. And like the movie
town, Celebration has its own unique rules and designs for social
engineering. But, after living here for 15 months, my family can
testify that Celebration is a real place, with its own attributes
and its own problems. Indeed, the town represents an ambitious,
real-life attempt by Disney to employ architecture and urban design
to revive the sense of community and place that Americans tell
pollsters are missing in traditional suburbs. By Douglas Frantz.
</P>
<P>
   IMPOSTORS-FILM (New York) _ Fox Searchlight on Friday released
``The Impostors,'' an ebullient slapstick comedy about two
down-at-heels actors who stow away on a luxury liner that Stanley
Tucci wrote, directed, produced and stars in with Oliver Platt.
This is his sophomore effort, following ``Big Night,'' the surprise
1996 hit he co-wrote with his cousin and co-directed with Campbell
Scott. By Karen Durbin.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   NEW-MUSIC (Undated) _ I have a bad case of the post-avant-garde
blues. Whenever I hear people praise a new piece of music for being
``accessible,'' and for nothing else, I long for the days when new
music could strike terror in the soul instead of just aiming to
please. By David Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   MELLENCAMP-MUSIC (Minneapolis) _ John Mellencamp, 46, the artist
formerly known as Johnny Cougar, John Cougar and John Cougar
Mellencamp, will release his first album of all new material in
five years on Tuesday for Columbia Records. A kind of rock star
Job, he has somehow endured for two decades and 14 records. By Neal
Karlen.
</P>
<P>
   MOTHER-NATURE'S-RADIO (Undated) _ To hear Mother Nature's radio,
one must travel to an area free of electronic interference (the
desert, the jungle, Siberia, Central Park) with a specially made
very-low-frequency radio receiver tuned below the AM and FM bands.
And that is what a growing number of hobbyists have been doing over
the last few years, attracted not just by the sweet sounds and the
possibility of making discoveries in this bizarre branch of plasma

   CAGE-MUSIC (Undated) _ The Sonatas and Interludes are either the
sins of John Cage's youth or else the last of his important music.
It depends on what you think music is, and Cage had some different
ideas about that. The longest of these 20 pieces is a little over
four minutes, the shortest not quite two. What made them different
from the other music being written in 1948 was the medium: the
prepared piano, in which keyboard sound is transformed by strategic
insertions of foreign objects onto or between the piano strings.
Attached to a new version of the Sonatas and Interludes, played by
Aleck Karis and recorded by Bridge, is Cage himself in 1982,
reading a paper called ``Composition in Retrospect,'' which he
wrote the year before. ``The music is always going on,'' he says
several times. ``It is we who turn away from it.'' By Bernard
Holland.

   STERBAK-ART (Montreal) _ The conceptual sculpture of the
Canadian-based artist Jana Sterbak has inspired reams of humorless,
abstruse theoretical writing that leaves none of her layered
metaphors unturned. Yet Ms. Sterbak's work _ seductive, intensely
physical and edged with dark absurdity _ delivers a mind-body
frisson unknowable by intellect alone. In art circles in the United
States, she is perhaps best known for what could be called a piece
of wearable art. ``Vanitas: Flesh Dress for an Albino Anorexic,''
from 1987, is an actual shift of raw, sewn-together flank steak,
which, when fresh, was modeled (but not by the artist) and then
left to hang, rank and wizening, in a gallery. A wider view of Ms.
Sterbak's nuanced provocations will be furnished in a mid-career
survey of her work at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago,
from Saturday through Feb. 21. By Ann Wilson LLoyd.

Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, makes an affirmative case.

EARTH BLASTED BY ENERGY FROM DISTANT STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earth's upper atmosphere in August crackled with a burst of
energy from an exotic kind of star halfway across the galaxy that
blew its stack, undergoing a starquake so massive that it spewed
out more energy in five minutes than all of human civilization
could use in a billion billion years.
</P>
<P>
   Seven different spacecraft picked up x-ray energy measurements
so strong their instruments were swamped; two of them were so
overwhelmed they shut themselves down for protection.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time, astronomers said Tuesday, that an
identifiable distant star has had a significant impact on Earth's
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The blast of energy caused the uppermost layer of Earth's
atmosphere, the ionosphere, to become as electrically charged in
the middle of the night as it normally is in daytime when bathed in
the sun's radiation _ even though the outburst took place 20,000
light years, or 120 billion billion miles, away from the Earth and
sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if night was suddenly turned into day in the
ionosphere,'' said Umran Inan, a professor of electrical
engineering at Stanford University who was part of a team that
measured the disruption to the atmosphere. ``We now know that
Earth's physical environment is affected not only by our own sun
but by energy originating from distant parts of the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Any astronauts in orbit at the time would have been exposed to a
flash of x-rays about as intense as a dental x-ray, the astronomers
said Tuesday _ not enough to do any harm, but an astonishing amount
considering how distant the source was.
</P>
<P>
   The star that produced the outburst is believed to be only the
second ever discovered of a new type, called a magnetar. The
existence of magnetars was first predicted theoretically six years
ago by astronomers Robert Duncan of the University of Texas and
Christopher Thompson of the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Magnetars are a type of neutron star, the densely packed remnant
left behind when certain kinds of stars end their lives in
cataclysmic explosions called supernovae. The dense stars, weighing
more than the sun but packed into a space the size of a city _
about 12 miles across _ have by far the strongest magnetic fields
of any objects known in the universe: ``The magnetic field of the
star is humongous, 300 trillion times more intense than the Earth's
or the sun's,'' said Chryssa Kouveliotou, an astronomer with the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Marshall Space
Flight Center in Alabama, at a NASA briefing Tuesday reporting the
observations.
</P>
<P>
   The star, called SGR1900(plus)14, rotates at a rapid clip of
once every 5.1 seconds, and the rotating magnetic field
occasionally causes stresses so great that they crack the star's
mile-thick crust of iron, producing a flash of gamma rays. Such
gamma flashes have been known for 20 years, and their origin has
remained a mystery until this year. Last May, Kouveliotou and her
colleagues published a paper identifying magnetars as the source of
what were known as ``soft gamma-ray repeaters.''
</P>
<P>
   But the outburst that began about 20,000 years ago and
registered here on Aug. 27 was a far more devastating event than
these normal starquakes, she said, and must have involved a vastly
more violent disturbance of the whole star's structure. Such events
are impossible to predict, she said, but this same star may repeat
its performance sometime in the next decade or so. Although
astronomers have been observing some x-rays from the sky for about
two decades, the satellites capable of pinpointing the origin of
such bursts have only been in existence for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   James Cordes of Cornell University said that such stars must
exist throughout the universe, and although massive outbursts such
as the one recorded in August must be extremely rare, chances are
the Earth has been subjected to much closer ones in the distant
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose there was one 100 light years away,'' he said. ``The
influence would be 40,000 times greater.'' Although nobody has
analyzed exactly what effects such a blast would have, Cordes said
it is likely that such events have happened within the span of time
that life has existed on Earth, and may have had profound _ and
perhaps detectable _ effects on creatures that lived at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The flash of energy produced by the magnetar was identified by
two specialized astronomical satellites designed to monitor x-rays
and gamma rays _ which are high-energy forms of electromagnetic
radiation, similar to light and radio waves. They are Beppo-SAX, an
Italian and Dutch-built satellite, and NASA's Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discovery of magnetars is a major breakthrough in
astrophysics,'' Kouveliotou said. And detecting the incredible
outburst of Aug. 27 was an extra bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new kind of star with bizarre properties that
weren't even imagined until a few years ago,'' said Paul Hertz of
NASA headquarters. ``It makes you wonder what else is out there.''

   LOBBY-II (Washington) _ Second of two articles on lobbying: From
the nondescript headquarters of his Houston construction firm, Leo
E. Linbeck Jr., is masterminding a crusade to overturn the nation's
tax system. Once, someone like him might have hired some of
Washington's ``Gucci Gulch'' lobbyists to prowl the marble
corridors outside Congress's tax committees. But Linbeck, with
Texas-style audaciousness, wants to engineer a populist uprising.
While he and his fellow investors in ``Americans for Fair
Taxation'' are unusual in the scale of their ambition, their
methods have become commonplace as lobbying has undergone a
revolution over the past decade. Rarely now does a well-connected
Washington lobbyist work alone to persuade power brokers in
Congress. Instead, the lobbyist has become just one of many players
running full-fledged national campaigns designed to create a
``grass-roots'' groundswell in support, or more often in
opposition, to legislation before Congress. By Alison Mitchell.

 &HT;    Mississippi begins to pick up Georges's mess
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILOXI, Miss. _ Casinos are known for never closing, but no
bells were ringing and no dice were rolling along Mississippi's
Gulf Coast Tuesday as the area recovered from the devastating winds
of Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mississippi did not get the drenching rains that soaked
Alabama and Florida, high winds gusting at times to 170 miles per
hour left gas stations in tatters, downed thousands of trees and
power lines, ripped the roofs of schools and homes, and left piles
of sand along U.S. 90, the scenic highway that runs along the
coast. ``We're doing just fine but I'm not staying next time,''
said Emily Meyers, who was mourning the loss of several fruit trees
in her back yard in Biloxi. ``My nerves still can't settle. I'm
remembering what it felt like waiting to see what would happen
next.''
</P>
<P>
   The casinos in Biloxi suffered only minor damage and expected to
reopen today. But some businesses in this beach resort town,
especially gas stations, looked almost destroyed. From Gulfport to
the Alabama line, coastal Mississippians stepped outside Tuesday
and assessed the damage. Few businesses were open, all schools were
closed. A curfew was in effect from sundown until sunrise today.
</P>
<P>
   The few shops and restaurants that managed to open attracted
customers in droves who stood in lines that snaked into parking
lots. At Lowe's in Gautier, people waited for chain saws, shovels
and plastic sheeting to cover broken windows and torn roofs. In
Pascagoula, they mobbed Domino's Pizza, one of the few places with
hot food.
</P>
<P>
   Most people along the coast had no power and many had no phone
service much of Tuesday, but as the evacuees streamed back south
along U.S 49, so too did hundreds of utility trucks from as far
away as Arkansas and Georgia. The Federal Emergency Management
Agency as well as the Salvation Army, also moved into the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a bad one because of the wind,'' said Leon Gates, who
lives in Pascagoula. His house survived with only a few leaks, but
he had a terrifying experience Monday as Georges blew ashore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I boarded up all my windows and one by one, the boards flew
off,'' he said. ``I'm still getting my nerves back together. I have
stayed through all the hurricanes_Camille, Betsy_but I don't know
if I will stay again. Of course, I always say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Photine Blahos left her brick home in Biloxi, but she was back
Tuesday, sweeping leaves and repairing the roof and trying to get
back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad we left,'' she said. ``They scared us to death with
talk of the storm surge. You can't just sit there in the dark and
wait for the water to come up over your roof.''

 &HT;    Georgia case against school system to be heard
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear a Georgia case
in which a Forsyth woman seeks to find the school system
responsible for failing to prevent a classmate from sexually
harassing her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Aurelia Davis filed suit against the Monroe
County Board of Education after her daughter, LaShonda, was
harassed at least eight times over six months. At the time,
LaShonda was a fifth-grader at Hubbard Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks the right to sue under Title IX of the
Education Amendments of 1972, which provides that no one, on the
basis of their sex, can be denied benefits or be subjected to
discrimination in educational programs receiving federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' claims were rejected by U.S. District Judge Wilbur Owens
in Macon, reinstated by a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta and, in August of last year,
dismissed by the full appeals court in a 7-4 opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thrilled to death,'' Davis said Tuesday after
learning the nation's highest court will hear her case. ``My smile
right now is as wide as the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 40, said she wants her case to require ``schools to have
a responsibility that schoolchildren will be both served and
protected. My daughter wasn't taken care of and they should pay for
it. . . . I did not set out to make a landmark ruling, but if
that's what it takes to make schools liable, that's what it takes.
It didn't take courage to do this. It took anger, pure anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' lawyer, Verna Williams of the Washington-based National
Women's Law Center, expressed confidence the Supreme Court would
rule in her client's favor. ``Schools can't just turn their backs
on the most harmful, severe and pervasive form of harassment that
interferes with students' inability to learn,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision marks the second time the Supreme Court has
picked a Georgia case to determine whether school districts can be
held liable for student harassment and abuse. In 1992, in a
Gwinnett County case, the court ruled school boards could be held
responsible when students are sexually harassed by their teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' lawsuit claims LaShonda was sexually tormented by a male
student, described only as G.F., culminating in a sexual battery to
which he pleaded guilty in Juvenile Court. LaShonda was an A and B
student before the harassment began and then plunged into despair,
receiving failing grades and writing a suicide note her father
found. Her mother complained to school officials who did little
more than separate LaShonda and G.F.'s classroom seating
assignments, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal appeals courts are split on the question of whether
school boards can be held liable under Title IX for
student-on-student sexual harassment. The ruling by the 11th
Circuit, which has jurisdiction over federal cases out of Alabama,
Florida and Georgia, followed a similar opinion by the Fifth
Circuit in New Orleans. The Seventh Circuit in Chicago and the
Ninth Circuit in San Francisco have ruled that school boards can be
held liable.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11th Circuit's decision, Judge Gerald Tjoflat wrote that
the Davis lawsuit ``fails to state a claim under Title IX because
Congress gave no clear notice to schools and teachers that they,
rather than society as a whole, would accept responsibility for
remedying student-student sexual harassment when they chose to
accept federal financial assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Tjoflat said that any decision to the contrary could open the
floodgates to Title IX lawsuits and possibly influence a school
district's decision whether to accept federal funds. He cited a
1993 survey by the American Association of University Women
Educational Foundation which found that 65 percent of all students
in grades eight to 11 were victims of some form of sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   In dissent, Judge Rosemary Barkett said the majority opinion
``ignores the plain meaning of Title IX as well as its spirit and
language. . . . Title IX does not make a school responsible for the
actions of harassing students, but rather for its own
discrimination for failing to remedy it once the school has
notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Hartley, general counsel for the Georgia School Boards
Association, said he hopes that the Supreme Court follows the
guidelines it set in an opinion issued this June in a
teacher-on-student sexual harassment case. In that 5-4 decision,
the court said the Lago Vista Independent School District in Texas
could only be held responsible if a teacher sexually harassed or
abused a student so long as school authorities were notified,
showed a ``deliberate indifference'' and did nothing about it.

<P>
   Are leaders born or bred? Can students be taught how to set a
course that others will follow?
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Bryant, director of the Virginia Women's Institute for
Leadership at Mary Baldwin College, a women's college in Staunton,
Va., is a believer. ``If some things can't be taught,'' she
insisted, ``at least they can be learned.'' The institute, whose
mission is to bring out the take-charge qualities in its students,
opened in 1995 with 42 students; it now has 150.
</P>
<P>
   Leadership as an area of study is becoming increasingly popular
at colleges and universities throughout the country. There are
nearly 700 leadership-development programs at American academic
institutions today, about double the number four years ago,
according to the Center for Creative Leadership, a nonprofit
educational research organization based in Greensboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Some are merely resource centers to which prominent leaders are
invited for a day or two in the hope that some charisma will rub
off. But others, including the University of Richmond's program,
address the subject with an array of rigorous courses like
``History and Theories of Leadership'' and ``Leadership in
Political Systems,'' and offer successful candidates a bachelor's
degree in leadership studies.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be too early to gauge the programs' effectiveness,
administrators say the course of study and mentorship help shape
responsible leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that leadership is learned, not just an
attribute,'' said John Burkhardt, a spokesman for the W.K. Kellogg
Foundation in Battle Creek, Mich., which has given about $20
million over the past decade to some 34 institutions to develop
leadership-teaching programs. ``We look to the idealism and energy
of today's youth to use these skills to create a better working
democracy in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   A principal reason for the blossoming of leadership studies is
that, at a time of economic uncertainty, students (and their
parents) see the programs as ``career-planning resources,'' to take
a phrase from the Mount Holyoke College catalog. Mount Holyoke's
program, for example, stresses internships and counseling, with
interviews with prominent professionals in the students' area of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, administrators find leadership development
programs to be effective recruiting tools. Austin College, a
liberal arts school in Sherman, Texas, offers 15 $10,000
scholarships a year to students who enroll in its Leadership
Institute. ``Many others who didn't make it come to us anyway,''
said Shelton Williams, the institute's director.
</P>
<P>
   The standards for admission to such programs are often high.
``We're not just looking for a resume with a lot of presidencies on
it,'' Williams said. ``We're looking for people who created
organizations or took existing ones to a higher level.''
</P>
<P>
   The easy part, most specialists agree, is teaching skills like
running a meeting, resolving conflicts and getting the best out of
creative people. The hard (if not impossible) part is to instill
such essentials of leadership as charisma, perseverance and
trustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to set up a learning situation at Mary Baldwin by
putting the students in leadership situations outside the
classroom, like running a social event or operating a motor pool
for the ROTC,'' Ms. Bryant said. ``They can learn through
experience, so the key to our program is putting the students in
those situations all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes a good student of leadership? Students are graded on
everything from their effectiveness on the speaker's platform to
their ability to analyze success or failure on the part of
historical or fictional figures, ranging from Abraham Lincoln to
Captain Ahab.
</P>
<P>
   The programs have become particularly popular at private women's
colleges. ``It's an outgrowth of the women's movement of the 1980s,
when large numbers of women began entering the upper ranks of
business and politics,'' Ms. Bryant said. ``These programs teach
women the skills they need.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The idea of leadership development can be traced to the
Industrial Revolution, said Mary Schwartz, a spokeswoman for the
Center for Creative Leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first stimulus was when people left the farms and came to
the cities to work in highly organized factories,'' Ms. Schwartz
said. ``They needed help to get people working together. The next
thing was when the soldiers came home from World War II. They tried
to exercise leadership in the control-and-command style, the way
they had done in the military, but it didn't motivate people so
they looked around for something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1959,'' she added, ``the Carnegie and Ford Foundations
simultaneously published reports proposing ways to reform business
and management training at the college and university level, and
that was really the birth of leadership education.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that a formal academic program is the best
way to develop future leaders. Ruth Simmons, the president of Smith
College in Northampton, Mass., said leadership development, which
is mentioned in the college's recruiting literature, takes place at
Smith naturally without benefit of a program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of our low student-faculty ratio and the small scale
of the college, Smith students get close attention and mentoring
from the faculty,'' Ms. Simmons said. ``That gives them the
confidence to go out and start companies because they've done big
things here. Also, because the students live in one of 35
self-governing houses, the chances are great that any student who
wants the opportunity to be in a responsible role will get the
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, in a women's college, it's easier for the students to
take risks,'' Ms. Simmons said. ``They can experiment without fear
of criticism. And when they leave, they're not frightened. They
don't retreat.''
</P>
<P>
   Many academicians, though, seem to prefer a more direct
approach. One of the nation's best-known leadership schools, the
Jepson School of Leadership Studies at the University of Richmond,
offers a degree in leadership, and its graduates typically go into
business, law or government.
</P>
<P>
   The school got its start in 1992 with a $20 million gift from
the investment banker Robert S. Jepson Jr., an alumnus. It has 11
faculty members, including Mary Sue Terry, a former Virginia state
attorney general, and accepts 40 juniors and 40 seniors each year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Mount Holyoke College, a women's college in South
Hadley, Mass., started its own leadership resource center, the
Center for Leadership and Public Interest Advocacy, which does not
offer degrees. Activities include a new theme each semester _
currently, ``Making a Difference'' _ related symposiums,
discussions, scholars-in-residence, lectures and ``dinner and
dialogues,'' at which students talk informally with faculty members
over a meal. Courses include ``Speaking, Arguing and Writing,''
which focuses on the art of persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers point to students like Jennifer Miscovich, a junior at
Austin College's Leadership Institute, as evidence that leadership
can be brought out in people who show promise.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miscovich, a self-described wallflower who in high school
expected to pursue ``a conventional career'' in teaching or the
health sciences, now holds two jobs, maintains a 3.87 grade point
average and founded the Sherman, Texas, chapter of America's
Promise, the national organization of business and civic leaders
who work to help at-risk youths.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on her transition to a budding mover and shaker, Ms.
Miscovich credited the leadership institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It woke me up,'' she said. ``It gave me insight into public
life. There's no turning back now. I know I'm going to be involved
in some sort of community service from here on.''

GROUPS SAY BAY STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER HAS TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Citing a pattern of ``unethical and anticonsumer
behavior,'' officials from several consumer and environmental
groups Tuesday called on Acting Governor Paul Cellucci to fire his
insurance commissioner, Linda Ruthardt.
</P>
<P>
   A Cellucci administration spokeswoman called the anticonsumer
allegations ``ludicrous'' and ``hogwash,'' and a campaign spokesman
said ``the charges appear to be more about politics than policy.''
But neither official knew whether Cellucci had actually read the
letters sent by the consumer and environmental groups. Ruthardt did
not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, there's nothing new here,'' said Kim Hinden
McDonald, the spokeswoman for the state's Office of Consumer
Affairs and Business Regulation, which oversees the Division of
Insurance. ``This is a rehash.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Massachusetts Public Interest Research
Group, the Center for Insurance Research, Clean Water Action, and
the Housatonic River Initiative urged Cellucci to fire Ruthardt.
Common Cause of Massachusetts, in a separate letter, said Ruthardt
should be fired only if she refuses to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commissioner Ruthardt has demonstrated a pattern of improper
and wrongful actions coupled with `standard operating procedures'
which continue to put the interests of the insurance industry above
those of the public,'' the officials said in their letter.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt has approved cuts in auto insurance rates each of the
past four years, saving Massachusetts drivers millions of dollars.
McDonald cited those rate cuts as evidence of Ruthardt's
proconsumer actions.
</P>
<P>
   But Deirdre Cummings, the official from Masspirg who signed the
letter, said Ruthardt's alleged pro-industry leanings now raise
questions about those decisions. ``I have very serious concerns
that those rate reductions should have been bigger for consumers,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the consumer officials cited a number of instances in
which Ruthardt allegedly put industry interests ahead of consumer
interests, the trigger for Tuesday's letter to Cellucci was a
meeting Ruthardt held March 23 with a representative of the auto
insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was first disclosed by Stephen J. D'Amato, a former
top aide to Ruthardt who resigned and wrote a letter on Sept. 8 to
Cellucci stating that Ruthardt ``is too closely aligned with the
insurers to protect the public adequately.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said Daniel Johnston, the president of the Automobile
Insurers Bureau, met with Ruthardt to discuss ``settlement of the
profit portion of the 1999 rate hearing, presumably on terms
favorable to the insurance industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place before the actual start of the hearing
process to set next year's rates, but Cummings said the timing of
the meeting was irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be the equivalent of a judge having a meeting with a
defendant in a case before her and the defendant comes in to
advocate for a favorable outcome,'' Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, who advocates for consumers
before Ruthardt and is also challenging Cellucci for governor, did
not side with the consumer activists Tuesday. But his office plans
to question Johnston under oath this week about his meeting with
Ruthardt and has raised concerns that the meeting may have tainted
the rate-setting process.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter to Cellucci, the consumer and environmental
groups cited several other actions taken by Ruthardt, including her
decision to allow Emlico to relocate to Bermuda, where the insurer
filed for liquidation and walked away from millions of dollars in
environmental cleanup liability in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The groups also cited Ruthardt's refusal to hand over documents
in connection with her rulings on the shift of State Mutual Life
Assurance Co. of Worcester from a company owned by policyholders to
one owned by shareholders; D'Amato's allegation that she pressured
the State Rating Bureau, a unit within her agency, to accept rates
favorable to the industry; and her failure to fully investigate
alleged unfair claims practices by the Travelers Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, whose letter to Cellucci was initially dismissed by an
administration spokeswoman as self-promotional, said he hoped the
administration's tune will now change and that it will address the
issues raised in his letter.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt, the former insurance director for Girl Scouts USA, was
hired by former Governor William F. Weld in August 1993. She
replaced Kay Doughty, who was ousted for being too cozy with
insurance industry lobbyists. The State Ethics Commission fined her
$2,000 in 1995 for ``routinely'' accepting free dinners,
entertainment, and sports tickets from insurance industry lobbyists
and executives.

   GORNJI OBRINJE, Yugoslavia _ The bodies of 15 women, children
and elderly members of the Deliaj clan lay slumped among the rocks
and streams of the gorge below their village in Kosovo province
Tuesday, shot in the head at close range and in some cases
mutilated as they tried to escape advancing Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   In the village houses, three men, including Fazli Deliaj, the
95-year-old patriarch, who was paralyzed, were burned to death by
Serbs who torched the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Down the dirt track a few kilometers, at Donji Obrinje, three
more elderly people lay dead on their backs in their gardens, shot
in the head as they apparently came out to plead for their lives.
Ali Kolludra, 62, still gripped his hooked walking stick Tuesday as
he lay dead on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Local villagers said the executions took place on Saturday
morning, two days after the village came under siege by the
Yugoslav army and Serbian police.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, monitors from the United States and the European
Union inspected the bodies of the Deliaj clan in the gorge. That
night they submitted a graphic written report of what they saw to
their embassies in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the families buried their dead, 21 in all, while
about four miles away in Golubovac, a survivor showed a reporter
the pools of blood left by a separate attack on Saturday that he
said left 13 dead.
</P>
<P>
   The killings appeared to show as definitively as anything that
the forces of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, have been
conducting a campaign of terror and destruction against ethnic
Albanian civilians which is intended to intimidate them, but which
appears instead to be inspiring even stronger defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials in Washington and at NATO last week stepped up
their threats of military force against Milosevic and demanded that
his forces stop their rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian government, whose driving force is Milosevic,
announced on Monday that it had ended its tank and artillery
offensive against separatist guerrillas in Kosovo. But ambassadors
visiting Kosovo Tuesday from Belgrade said they saw no sign that
the army and police had withdrawn to barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the lower Drenica Valley, where the Kosovo Liberation
Army has been most resilient, it appeared that the executions were
intended to send a particularly stark message of terror before
winter sets in and the Serbian forces face more difficulty in
moving around. The spate of killings on Saturday appeared to occur
as Serbian forces wound up their current operations in the area.
</P>
<P>
   About 250,000 ethnic Albanians _ who outnumber Serbs nine to one
in Kosovo _ have been forced from their homes since the spring.
Many of their homes were burned and looted by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments and human rights groups say they cannot
definitively enumerate the number of civilians _ on either the
ethnic Albanian or the Serbian side _ executed since the start of
the conflict in March. But Human Rights Watch, a New York-based
group, is scheduled to issue a report that documents two major
incidents, in the villages of Prekaz, Likoshe and Cirez, where
Serbian forces shot 80 Albanian civilians in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   At the site of the other execution, in Golubovac Tuesday, Adem
Hoxhaj, 63, described to a reporter how 13 men were lined up
against the fence of his house on Saturday morning and shot with a
machine gun from a mound of earth about 10 feet away. There were
separate pools of blood for each body along the fence Tuesday and
the casings of about 80 bullets on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Hoxhaj said the men, between 18 and 35 years old, were all
brought to his house by Serbian police from the nearby forest where
they had been hiding. The rest of the villagers were also brought
in from the forest but were herded into a house and detained, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoxhaj said he escaped from the house and could see the
execution from hedges on the other side of the garden. His
description fit closely with that given to diplomats Tuesday by
another survivor, whose account they said they considered ``very
credible.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gornji Obrinje Tuesday, the bodies of the dead were slowly
being brought up from the gorge. Two of the ethnic Albanian men
arranging the burial wore holsters with pistols.
</P>
<P>
   From the way some of the bodies lay on a rocky path, it was
evident that the women and children had tried to escape and had run
straight into police. Zahide Deliaj, 27, lay on the rocks, shot in
the face, and behind lay her two daughters, Gentiana, 7, and
Donieta, 5, their yellow rubber boots still on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   A few feet behind Mrs. Deliaj, on the same path, lay Mejhane
Deliaj, 27, and her 4-year-old daughter, Menduhije. Behind her lay
Lumnije Deliaj, 30, who relatives said was seven months pregnant.
Her abdomen had been slit open.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report by the diplomatic monitors, who include former
military officers, was very precise in its descriptions of how the
women and children were shot at close range.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors also said in their report that they found an
elderly couple ``heavily mutilated.'' The report said, ``The man
was decapitated, his brain removed and left `displayed' beside his
wife's corpse.'' The woman's throat had been slit and her left foot
mutilated in an apparent attempt to cut it off, the monitors noted.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a puddle of blood remained on the foam mattress
where the woman, Hava Deliaj, 68, was found, and the brain of
Pajazit Deliaj remained on the adjacent mattress. Both were buried
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the clan's elders, Sadri Deliaj, 56, who managed to elude
the attacking Serb forces, described Tuesday how, last Thursday,
large numbers of Serbian troops, tanks and armored personnel
carriers that had been in the area surrounded the village. Armed
members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, underarmed and outgunned,
apparently left the area, fleeing the Serbs, the monitors said.
</P>
<P>
   The more vulnerable members of the family _ about 16 women,
children, aunts and uncles _ were sent down to the gorge where it
was thought they would be safer. There they set up the tarpaulin
shelter for sleeping and fashioned a makeshift kitchen for cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Deliaj said that on Saturday, both soldiers and police
approached the village. ``They came on foot and I heard armored
personnel carriers,'' he said. ``There were all kinds of
uniforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Deliaj said that as the armed Serbs approached the gorge he ran
away. ``I heard the screaming, and I heard the shooting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the body of one victim was carried out of the rocks on a
wooden stretcher Tuesday, her niece, Halime Hajdari, 15, wept. ``I
always hated the Serbs and I hate them now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A young man, Arsim Deliaj, 19, also wept as the bodies of
Gentiana and Donieta Deliaj, who were his nieces, were arranged
side by side on a stretcher. ``If they found me, they'd cut me up
too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Was he angry that the Kosovo Liberation Army couldn't better
defend his relatives? ``Not at all,'' he said. ``They didn't have a
chance, they didn't have the weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Muslim custom requires that the dead be buried as soon as
possible. In this case, the Deliaj family members said they had to
wait until the Serbian forces had left and it was safe to come and
look for the dead and the missing.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday morning, 18 graves had been dug at the top of a shady
green field near the village. Enough blankets had been found to
drape around the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m., they were burying the 14th body, the pregnant Luminje
Deliaj, who was slid into the ground wrapped in a red throw and
then covered with the soft ocher soil.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Francesca Funk had been in Japan for only a
short time when she made a request of her host during breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked for some bread,'' the Irving, Texas-based marketing
consultant recalls. ``I was tired of rice, and I knew that we'd had
bread the night before.''
</P>
<P>
   Her hosts said they would get it, and someone was dispatched to
the nearest town to buy some. By the time they had returned,
breakfast was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I known, I would have told them not to bother,'' Funk
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were ashamed that the breakfast wasn't to my
satisfaction, and I was mortified that they went to that much
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   In a world growing smaller all the time, conflicting customs,
cultures and traditions are bumping up against one another at an
embarrassing tempo.
</P>
<P>
   What might be a minor faux pas among neighbors at a dinner party
in Fort Worth or Houston could lead to a personal international
incident at a conference in Tokyo _ or Mexico City or Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
   And they have. In embarrassing numbers.

   As more Texans enter the global marketplace, Bubba is meeting

   Incidents are often based on the mistaken American notion that
businessmen in other cultures want us to show them how to do
business, one cross-cultural consultant says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many American companies think they can blow into town, show
their catalog, illustrate their specification and sign a deal,''
said Edward Retta, owner of Cross Culture Communications in Dallas,
a consultant for international businesses. ``But ours isn't the
only way; in fact, it's one of the youngest ways, and it doesn't
always work.''
</P>
<P>
   Even large multinationals can make major blunders when they
cross national and cultural borders.
</P>
<P>
   When the Marlboro man mounted billboards in Hong Kong, the
message was the opposite of what the image conveys in places such
as Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image that the Marlboro man conveys here is macho
independence and ruggedness,'' said Rose LeBaron, a Plano,
Texas-based consultant of Chinese descent. ``But in Hong Kong, they
saw him as a dirty, smelly bumpkin.''
</P>
<P>
   The image was revamped.
</P>
<P>
   The new Marlboro man in Hong Kong was an executive standing next
to a Mercedes with a shiny glass skyscraper in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the image that is desirable there,'' LeBaron said.

for India's large Muslim minority.

   Bill Drake, a Waxahachie, Texas-based intercultural trainer for
large corporations, was recently brought in to help a Texas
high-tech company that was having a problem with its Dutch
partners.
</P>
<P>
   The company's engineers had been conducting teleconferences with
their Dutch counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Drake said he observed the meetings as they devolved into
misunderstanding and acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans were chatty and friendly,'' Drake recalled. They
were also dressed casually, like many employees of high-tech
companies, wearing khakis and polo shirts.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dutch appeared in the teleconference room, they wore
tailored suits and serious expressions.
</P>
<P>
   Drake said it didn't take long to figure out the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the Americans' point of view, the Dutch were rigid,
judgmental and unwilling to compromise,'' Drake said. ``The Dutch
thought the Americans were sloppy and unbusinesslike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both were trying to put forth their best efforts, but each was
viewing the other from their own specific perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as both sides understood what was going on, they were
able to adjust their views and find solutions to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans have prejudices,'' Drake said, underlining the core of
cultural misperceptions. ``If you don't go to the trouble of
understanding the culture that you're dealing with, you're not
going to get very far.''

   Frank Walton, a Fort Worth businessman whose company does
business in about 60 countries, has discovered some of the hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   For Texans, it is the Asian cultures that can be the most
difficult to understand, Walton and others agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe and South America, at least the cultures are mostly
Western and Christian,'' Walton said. ``In Asia, there's a code of
how you should look, what you should say, how you are supposed to
look at people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can wear the wrong color and blow the whole deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton's skittishness comes from experience.
</P>
<P>
   His company makes highly technical infusion pumps. He remembers
the time he played host to a big Japanese customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the mistake of saying he had a nice camera, and he gave
it to me,'' Walton said. ``Then you're a dummy holding a camera you
don't need, and the guy doesn't have anything to take pictures with
for the rest of his trip.''
</P>
<P>
   The extreme, often formal, politeness of the Japanese contrasts
sharply with the American approach.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Francesca Funk had been in Japan for only a
short time when she made a request of her host during breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked for some bread,'' the Irving, Texas-based marketing
consultant recalls. ``I was tired of rice, and I knew that we'd had
bread the night before.''
</P>
<P>
   Her hosts said they would get it, and someone was dispatched to
the nearest town to buy some. By the time they had returned,
breakfast was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I known, I would have told them not to bother,'' Funk
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were ashamed that the breakfast wasn't to my
satisfaction, and I was mortified that they went to that much
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   In a world growing smaller all the time, conflicting customs,
cultures and traditions are bumping up against one another at an
embarrassing tempo.
</P>
<P>
   What might be a minor faux pas among neighbors at a dinner party
in Fort Worth or Houston could lead to a personal international
incident at a conference in Tokyo _ or Mexico City or Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
   And they have. In embarrassing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   As more Texans enter the global marketplace, Bubba is meeting
Mr. Wong more often. And many times the outcome ranges from comical
to disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents are often based on the mistaken American notion that
businessmen in other cultures want us to show them how to do
business, one cross-cultural consultant says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many American companies think they can blow into town, show
their catalog, illustrate their specification and sign a deal,''
said Edward Retta, owner of Cross Culture Communications in Dallas,
a consultant for international businesses. ``But ours isn't the
only way; in fact, it's one of the youngest ways, and it doesn't
always work.''
</P>
<P>
   Even large multinationals can make major blunders when they
cross national and cultural borders.
</P>
<P>
   When the Marlboro man mounted billboards in Hong Kong, the
message was the opposite of what the image conveys in places such
as Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image that the Marlboro man conveys here is macho
independence and ruggedness,'' said Rose LeBaron, a Plano,
Texas-based consultant of Chinese descent. ``But in Hong Kong, they
saw him as a dirty, smelly bumpkin.''
</P>
<P>
   The image was revamped.
</P>
<P>
   The new Marlboro man in Hong Kong was an executive standing next
to a Mercedes with a shiny glass skyscraper in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the image that is desirable there,'' LeBaron said.
</P>
<P>
   Even good intentions aren't always enough.
</P>
<P>
   When fast-food giant McDonald's entered the market in India, it
created a veggie burger to appeal to the country's Hindu majority,
who do not eat beef because of the cow's religious significance.
But McDonald's continued to offer some of its trademark beef items
for India's large Muslim minority.
</P>
<P>
   Hindus demonstrated en masse at the golden arches, declaring the
company the world's largest killer of cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Most blunders aren't as gigantic.

<P>
   Bill Drake, a Waxahachie, Texas-based intercultural trainer for
large corporations, was recently brought in to help a Texas
high-tech company that was having a problem with its Dutch
partners.
</P>
<P>
   The company's engineers had been conducting teleconferences with
their Dutch counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Drake said he observed the meetings as they devolved into
misunderstanding and acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans were chatty and friendly,'' Drake recalled. They
were also dressed casually, like many employees of high-tech
companies, wearing khakis and polo shirts.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dutch appeared in the teleconference room, they wore
tailored suits and serious expressions.
</P>
<P>
   Drake said it didn't take long to figure out the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the Americans' point of view, the Dutch were rigid,
judgmental and unwilling to compromise,'' Drake said. ``The Dutch
thought the Americans were sloppy and unbusinesslike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both were trying to put forth their best efforts, but each was
viewing the other from their own specific perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as both sides understood what was going on, they were
able to adjust their views and find solutions to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans have prejudices,'' Drake said, underlining the core of
cultural misperceptions. ``If you don't go to the trouble of
understanding the culture that you're dealing with, you're not
going to get very far.''

<P>
   Frank Walton, a Fort Worth businessman whose company does
business in about 60 countries, has discovered some of the hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   For Texans, it is the Asian cultures that can be the most
difficult to understand, Walton and others agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe and South America, at least the cultures are mostly
Western and Christian,'' Walton said. ``In Asia, there's a code of
how you should look, what you should say, how you are supposed to
look at people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can wear the wrong color and blow the whole deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton's skittishness comes from experience.
</P>
<P>
   His company makes highly technical infusion pumps. He remembers
the time he played host to a big Japanese customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the mistake of saying he had a nice camera, and he gave
it to me,'' Walton said. ``Then you're a dummy holding a camera you
don't need, and the guy doesn't have anything to take pictures with
for the rest of his trip.''
</P>
<P>
   The extreme, often formal, politeness of the Japanese contrasts
sharply with the American approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans think that the most important thing to achieving a
relationship is to be friendly,'' said Funk, whose strategic
research firm is called Noetix. ``For the Japanese, it is to be
polite and considerate.''
</P>

SENATE SENDS CLINTON APPROPRIATION BILLS FOR DEFENSE, EDUCATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate gave its final approval to defense and
higher education spending bills Tuesday and sent both to President
Clinton for his expected signature.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the education measure, which could boost Pell
Grant student loans by up to $1,500 a year, by a 96-0 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Before recessing for a day in observance of Yom Kippur, the
Jewish Day of Atonement, the Senate also approved a massive $250
billion defense-spending bill that includes a 3.6 percent pay raise
for military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed both measures Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The defense measure was the third and largest appropriations
bill passed by Congress this year. But 10 other measures that
should have been approved before the start of the 1999 fiscal year
Thursday are still bottled up in the House and Senate because of
disagreements between the White House and lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Three or four more of those could win approval by this weekend
or early next week. But in order to avoid a government shutdown
Oct. 9, when a nine-day temporary spending measure expires,
Congress will have to roll the remaining bills into one catchall
piece of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs early last week that Republicans might be
willing to risk a shutdown to force Clinton to accept an $80
billion tax-cut bill already approved by the House. But there are
indications now that the measure may not even pass the Senate. Even
if it does, it would likely be sent to Clinton as a separate
measure, which he could veto without affecting government
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican leaders conceded Tuesday that they would not
be able to muster enough votes to overcome Democratic criticism
that the tax bill authored by House Ways and Means Chairman Bill
Archer, R-Texas, would draw from the estimated budget surpluses
that Clinton wants to use to shore up Social Security. At least
five Republicans, and perhaps as many as a dozen, may end up voting
against it because they believe it's ``too large,'' as Sen. John
Chaffee of Rhode Island put it.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders had hoped to press Clinton on the tax-cut
issue. But recent polls show a growing dissatisfaction with
Congress for not being able to finish its legislative work by the
traditional Oct. 1 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Tuesday that he
sees litle chance of fireworks developing over the remaining
appropriations bills or the tax-cut measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should be trying to challenge the White House
... I think time for that sort of thing is past,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the defense-spending measure, which accounts for
$1 of every $7 the government will spend next year, Congress has
also approved measures to keep the legislative and executive
branches of government operating. Legislation allowing the Pentagon
to continue construction projects has passed and has been signed by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The president is expected to sign the higher education bill as
well when it reaches his desk. Long an advocate of increasing
student loans, the bill contains many of the things Clinton has
wanted. In addition to increasing Pell Grants from an average of
$3,000 a year to $4,500, it would also reduce interest rates for
most student loans for the first time in 17 years and cap them at
8.24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Department would be required to run its
student-loan operations in a more businesslike manner, with a chief
operating officer at the helm. One aim of the program is to make it
more ``consumer friendly,'' a move that would include publishing a
list of available loans and the estimated costs of an average
college education.

PROFESSORS BATTLE MICROSOFT OVER RESEARCH ON NETSCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two Boston professors are fighting Microsoft Corp.'s
demand that they turn over confidential research they gathered for
an upcoming book about its rival, Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant, facing an antitrust
lawsuit in Washington, hopes audio tapes of the professors'
interviews with Netscape executives, along with their notes and
other research, will support its claim that Netscape's business
problems are the result of its own blunders and not caused by
unfair competition by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Microsoft, brought by the Justice Department
and 20 state attorneys general, is scheduled to go to trial Oct. 15
in Washington. To prepare its defense, Microsoft obtained a
subpoena in US District Court in Boston demanding the professors'
research on Net-scape.
</P>
<P>
   But David Yoffie, of Harvard Business School, and Michael
Cusumano, of MIT's Sloan School of Management _ whose book,
``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and its Battle
with Microsoft,'' is due to be published Oct. 20 _ are refusing to
turn over the material. They claim that doing so would violate
their First Amendment rights and academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our postion that all our research at Harvard and MIT is
premised on building relationships of confidentiality and trust
with the companies we work with,'' said Yoffie. If companies
believed tapes and transcripts of their interviews could later
surface in court, they would be reluctant to participate in future
research, the professors said.
</P>
<P>
   The authors said nothing important was left out of the book, but
Microsoft spokesman Greg Shaw said his company is pursuing the
taped interviews because ``it is important to actually be able to
hear Netscape executives in their own words supporting Microsoft's
position in the current litigation.''

TOM BRADLEY, FORMER LOS ANGELES MAYOR, DIES AT 80 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas)  (lb) 
 By JANE FRITSCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Bradley, the sharecropper's son who became mayor of Los
Angeles and presided over the city for two decades of explosive
growth and change, died on Tuesday at the Kaiser Permanente Medical
Center in West Los Angeles. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack. Bradley had been in poor
health since March 20, 1996, when he had his first heart attack.
Two weeks later, after he had undergone cardiac bypass surgery, a
stroke left him partly paralyzed and unable to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was mayor from 1973 to 1993, an era during which Los
Angeles was transformed from a collection of suburban neighborhoods
to what Bradley liked to call a ``world-class city'' with
glittering skyscrapers, a dramatic new skyline and a vibrant
downtown. During the Bradley years, Los Angeles surpassed Chicago
to become the United States' second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   His election as the first black mayor of a major and largely
white city reflected a significant change in local politics in
America. For most of that time, Bradley was an immensely popular
figure whose stately bearing and placid demeanor seemed to reassure
the residents of his increasingly polyglot city.
</P>
<P>
   Soft-spoken and self-effacing, Bradley shunned some of the
perquisites that his stature and office might have brought him.
Calling it a foolish waste of money, he refused to use a cellular
telephone that was installed in his car, a former aide recalled.
Still, Bradley learned to move as easily in the society of the
fabulously wealthy as he did in the world of the poor and
disadvantaged from which he had come.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a lot of flash to him,'' said Dee Dee Myers, the
former White House press secretary, who worked for Bradley in the
1980s. ``Quiet determination was his hallmark. His enemies always
underestimated him, but at the end of the day he was always the
last one standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a long period of relative harmony in the city, Bradley's
tenure was marked at the beginning and at the end by racial strife.
</P>
<P>
   He first ran for mayor in 1969, when the Watts riots of four
years earlier were still an open wound in Los Angeles. He was
painted as a dangerous radical by the incumbent mayor, Sam Yorty,
and lost.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1973, Bradley had forged a powerful coalition of black
and white liberals and moderates, and soundly defeated Yorty to
become the city's first black mayor. That he did so at a time when
the black population of Los Angeles was only about 15 percent was a
testament to his broad appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1992, as Bradley was mulling over whether to run for a
sixth term, the city was roiled by three days of riots sparked by
the acquittal of four white police officers who had been charged
with the beating of an unarmed black motorist, Rodney King.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was deeply affected by the riots and, five months later,
announced that he would not run for mayor again. ``The April unrest
tore at my heart,'' he said, ``and I will not be at peace until we
have healed our wounds and rebuilt our neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most in Los Angeles, Bradley was taken by surprise by the
rioting. ``He never really understood it,'' a friend recalled. ``It
was a tragedy in his life that you can't overestimate. It was like
he was hit in the stomach with a two-by-four.''
</P>
<P>
   Since stepping down as mayor, Bradley was associated with the
Los Angeles office of Brobeck, Phleger &AMP; Harrison, a San Francisco
law firm that hoped to capitalize on his ties to Asia; Bradley had
vigorously courted businesses in Pacific Rim nations on behalf of
Los Angeles while he was mayor.
</P>
<P>
   After his stroke, his activities for the firm were severely
curtailed. Friends said he regained most of his mobility but never
regained his ability to speak. Even so, he maintained an active
social life, with a group of loyal friends sharing responsibility
for taking him to lunch and civic events each day. Some friends
read to Bradley regularly because, while his mind remained sharp,
he could no longer read or write, said Wendy Greuel, a former aide.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent lunch with former staff members, Bradley squinted
his delight at jokes about himself, his shoulders heaving with the
gaiety of the occasion, Ms. Greuel said
</P>
<P>
   ``His face would light up,'' said Ms. Myers, who had lunch with
Bradley last spring. ``He very rarely got discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   The second of seven children, Thomas Bradley was born on Dec.
29, 1917, on a cotton plantation in Calvert, Texas. His
grandparents were slaves, and his father, Lee Thomas Bradley, was a
sharecropper who abandoned the family not long after they moved to
Los Angeles, when Tom was 7.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Crenner Bradley, worked as a maid to support the
children. Young Tom earned money with a paper route, and later as a
publicity photographer for the comedian Jimmy Durante.
</P>
<P>
   During the toughest of those early years, the family was so poor
that Tom could not afford new shoes and socks. He lined his worn
shoes with cardboard and vowed that when he got a job he would have
an ample supply of socks, he once told an interviewer. ``They
became a symbol of my poverty,'' he said. ``When I was on the
police department, I can remember every sale that was held in
downtown Los Angeles, I always managed to stop by and stock up on
socks, it was like a security blanket. Then one day I noticed I had
about 200 pairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley entered the University of California at Los Angeles on a
track scholarship in 1937, but dropped out after his junior year to
join the Los Angeles Police Department, where he stayed for 21
years. In 1941, he married Ethel Mae Arnold, whom he had met at
church when they were teen-agers. They had three daughters, one of
whom died on the day she was born.
</P>
<P>
   While working as a police officer, he went to law school at
night and eventually earned a law degree from Southwestern
University. Meanwhile, he was working his way up from walking a
beat to the rank of lieutenant, the highest rank a black officer
had achieved at the time. But in 1961 he concluded that he could go
no higher, and quit the department.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for a time for a law firm, but his real interest was
politics, and in 1963 he ran for and won a seat on the Los Angeles
City Council, to which he was re-elected twice.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he made his first attempt to unseat Yorty, who
repeatedly raised the issue of race and asserted that Bradley was
appealing for votes to blacks and ``left-wing militants.'' At the
same time, some militant blacks denounced Bradley as a ``white
man's candidate'' and referred to him as ``Uncle Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley sought to play down race as an issue, but had little
success. ``I have no sympathy for lawlessness,'' he said, ``but
even less sympathy for injustice, poverty, unemployment and slum
housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, with the race issue receding and Yorty under
attack in personal and financial scandals, Bradley was elected to
his first term as mayor.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nonconfrontational and intent on building coalitions, he set out
to revive the storefronts and small businesses that had been wiped
out during the Watts riots, and to successfully position Los
Angeles as the unofficial capital of the Pacific Rim for an era of
burgeoning trade.
</P>
<P>
   For years, as a new wave of Hispanic and Asian immigrants were
drawn to the city, both residential and commercial development went
virtually unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, with Los Angeles booming, Bradley tried the first of
two attempts to defeat the incumbent Republican, George Deukmejian,
for governor of California, but lost by less than one percentage
point.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley reached the height of his popularity when he brought the
Olympic Games to Los Angeles in 1984. Despite a boycott by most of
the communist countries, the Games went off without a hitch and
showed off the glittering city to the world.
</P>
<P>
   He had fought hard to bring the event to Los Angeles, but at the
same time he forced a tough agreement with the International
Olympic Committee to indemnify the city against any possible
financial losses. The Los Angeles games were the first privately
financed Olympics and it turned a huge profit.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation buoyed by the Olympics success, Bradley was
re-elected mayor in 1985 with 68 percent of the vote over John
Ferraro, a conservative City Council member, who got only 30
percent. ``Los Angeles is the city of hope and opportunity,''
Bradley said. ``I am a living example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   With his profile high, Bradley ran against Deukmejian again in
1986, but was soundly defeated and vowed that it was his last
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   During Bradley's five terms as mayor, Los Angeles International
Airport was renovated, the Port of Los Angeles became the biggest
and busiest in the country, the city's financial and business
district was revitalized and construction of a subway was begun.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually, the years of growth for which Bradley could
claim credit brought problems for which he was blamed. Pollution,
traffic jams and overdevelopment had become major issues for
Bradley in his later terms.
</P>
<P>
   A symbol of propriety and ethics, Bradley felt particularly
wounded in 1989 when newspapers began raising questions about his
personal financial and business dealings. The stories, which
prompted investigations by law-enforcement authorities, described
how for years Bradley had been paid as a director or consultant for
banks that did business with the city. Also, he had failed to
disclose some investments and stock dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing, but he
agreed to pay a $20,000 civil penalty for the disclosure lapses.
And he conceded that he had made ``an error in judgment'' by
accepting outside employment while mayor. The damage to his
reputation had been done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst year of my entire life,'' Bradley, an
intensely private man, told a reporter in 1990. ``It went on and
on, day after day, and you know you're literally helpless to do
anything except ignore it and go about your business.''
</P>
<P>
   But more difficult times were ahead. The videotape of the
beating of Rodney King, played over and over on television within
hours after it happened on March 3, 1991, led to calls for the
ouster of Daryl Gates, the city's combative police chief.
</P>
<P>
   Hamstrung by a city charter that gave Gates virtual lifetime
tenure, Bradley appeared helpless to act. He began working behind
the scenes to put pressure on Gates and eventually moved to fire
him, but was blocked by an increasingly powerful City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Bradley and Gates were so strained that when
the rioting first erupted in April, 1992, the two had not spoken
for more than a year. Their poor communication was pointed to by a
panel of inquiry led by William Webster, a former director of the
FBI, as a factor in the city's inability to act quickly to quell
the disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, badly shaken by the acquittal of the white officers,
was uncharacteristically blunt in the hours after the verdict. At a
televised news conference, he said he was ``outraged'' at the
outcome of the trial. ``Today that jury asked us to accept the
senseless and brutal beating of a helpless man,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   He regained his composure in the tumultuous days after the
verdict and set about to bring calm to the city, but critics said
he shared some of the blame for the riots in which more than 50
people died and property damage approached a billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably was outraged,'' said Ferraro, the city council
president, ``but he's the mayor of the city and he's got to keep
his cool and calm.'' Bradley quickly got his anger under control,
Ferraro said, adding, ``I think he's shown some leadership since
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Several days after the riots had subsided, as he began working
on plans to rebuild the city, Bradley was asked whether, if he were
not the mayor, he would be afraid to be a black man in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``I would be angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is survived by his wife and their daughters, Phyllis and
Lorraine.

NOT EVEN TRYING TO APPEAL TO THE MASSES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANDY MEISLER 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three years ago, a successful comedy writer named
Dan O'Shannon (``Newhart,'' ``Cheers,'' ``It's a Living'') sat down
to write the pilot of a new sitcom. His central character, Maggie
Day, was a 40-year-old woman going through a midlife crisis.
</P>
<P>
   He sprinkled laughs on every page as Maggie coped with an
inattentive husband, a couple of self-centered teen-agers and an
unrequited crush on her boss, the local veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   O'Shannon thought he'd written a network sitcom. The major
broadcast networks thought otherwise. One programming executive
told him to make Maggie 10 years younger and unmarried. Another
told him, ``The demographic is all wrong'' and that because his
lead character contemplated adultery, ``no one'' would like her.
</P>
<P>
   Exit O'Shannon, to a two-year writing and producing stint on
NBC's ``Suddenly Susan,'' a sitcom about, you guessed it, a
20-something single woman.
</P>
<P>
   But enter, in August 1998, Lifetime Television for Women, a
basic cable channel known hitherto mainly for documentaries and
reruns of women-in-crisis television movies. The channel made
``Maggie'' one of three new women-oriented series on its Tuesday
night lineup.
</P>
<P>
   So now O'Shannon, 36, has a 13-episode order, a new office on
the Paramount Studios lot, a stripped-down three-person writing
staff, a good measure of creative freedom and the certainty that no
matter how well his series does, it will be absolutely unknown to
the great bulk of the American viewing public.
</P>
<P>
   On an average night, Lifetime gets a 1.7 rating and is watched
in 1.5 million households, approximately one-sixth the number tuned
into the average fairly successful broadcast network series.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to get a 3 rating,'' says O'Shannon, wryly,
``Lifetime would treat me like a god.''
</P>
<P>
   What O'Shannon has created, it seems, is a new and rather
stealthy weapon in the current broadcast-cable power struggle.
Let's call ``Maggie'' and other cable comedies like it
``nichecoms'' _ series that are outwardly sisters to the
mass-appeal shows on NBC, ABC and CBS but are actually cleverly
targeted arrows to the heart of narrowly focused audiences. Along
with their close relation, the niche drama, these shows make up an
increasing percentage of cable programming.
</P>
<P>
   This may come as a shock to those who have believed that weekly
comedy and drama series _ the foundation of broadcast programming
for 50 years _ will be yesterday's format when and if the
long-awaited television revolution arrives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most widely watched thing on our network is `Stargate
SG-1'; it outperforms every theatrical movie on our air,'' says
Jerry Offsay, president for programming of Showtime Networks,
referring to a second-season drama that receives almost no media
mention outside hard-core science fiction circles.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime also recently added ``Linc's,'' an
African-American-oriented comedy of the kind that no longer appears
on the major networks, and ``Rude Awakenings,'' an ``adult'' comedy
about a recovering alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime's main premium-cable rival, HBO, has ``Oz,'' a weekly
men-in-prison drama conceived and run by Tom Fontana, the
co-creator of ``Homicide''; ``Sex and the City,'' a comedy
exploring the ``dating and mating habits'' of single New Yorkers by
Darren Star (``Melrose Place''), and ``Arliss,'' a comedy about a
rapacious sports agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maggie's'' Tuesday night companions on Lifetime are ``Oh
Baby,'' a comedy about a single woman who opts for artificial
insemination, and ``Any Day Now,'' a drama about an interracial
friendship in the Deep South. The USA Network, amid its aggressive
slate of original series, runs adventure dramas like ``The Net''
and ``La Femme Nikita,'' series almost indistinguishable from
broadcast competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Even American Movie Classics, primarily a cable outlet for
vintage films, has for four years been producing ``Remember WENN,''
a comedy set in a dysfunctional radio station in the 1940s. And
most of these cable channels are actively developing additional
series.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as far as weekly cable series are concerned, only one
question really remains: will these venerable formats be reinvented
and reinvigorated or simply spread, like pop-cultural kudzu, to
higher and higher channel numbers?
</P>
<P>
   The cable series' creators, most of whom got their start working
on network series, tend to emphasize their liberation from the
strictures of broadcast television-like censorship, the rigidity of
the commercial format, and the tyranny of ratings and demographics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel I have the opportunity to write my show with a
focus and a viewpoint, without trying to appeal to everyone in the
world,'' says Susan Beavers, the creator of ``Oh Baby.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Fontana of ``Oz'' agrees that cable offers more creative
freedom. ``When you don't have to bring people back from a
commercial, you don't have to manufacture an `out,' '' he explains.
``You can make your episode at a length and with a rhythm that's
true to the story you want to tell.'' (Of course that's true only
on premium cable channels.)
</P>
<P>
   On cable series, unlike network shows, ``the emphasis is on
quality and originality,'' says Star of ``Sex and the City,''
although some broadcast executives might not agree.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, cable-series producers go so far as to deny the
connections with their broadcast counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a sitcom,'' says Robert Wuhl, the star and
executive producer of ``Arliss.'' ``All sitcoms look exactly the
same. The same setups, the same lenses, the same transitions, the
same everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do isn't at all like that,'' he continues. ``We don't
have to worry about subject matter. We don't have to be politically
correct. What we do is make a little comedy movie every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Such declarations of distinctiveness, of course, delight
executives and publicity agents at the cable channels. Dig a little
deeper, however, and the conversation has a somewhat less
idealistic ring.
</P>
<P>
   Cable executives mention that weekly series help target a core
audience and attract subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Albrecht, HBO's president for original programming, says:
``We see series as a retention device, a reason to buy HBO. After
all, if you hear about something good on TV, you can't tune into it
unless it's going to be on for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   But premium cable series aren't geared to attract the great bulk
of broadcast television fans. In fact, just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of people we want to attract are people who don't
watch a lot of television,'' says Albrecht. ``These are usually
better-educated, slightly older men and women age 35 to 55, who can
probably more easily afford to keep our service.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk like this would no doubt astound television executives of
past decades. They made large fortunes by broadcasting sitcoms and
dramas that were kept within well-researched parameters to attract
the widest audiences possible. These series were relatively easy to
create, produce and, most important, rerun.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the 1950s, series like ``I Love Lucy'' and
``Gunsmoke'' helped drive somewhat edgier fare (like live drama,
satirical sketch comedy and anthology series) out of prime time. In
the 1980s, cable, with its slate of unedited movies and music and
comedy specials, was seen as the antithesis to its broadcast
competition.
</P>
<P>
   But even in their formative years, the cable networks
occasionally experimented with series: Showtime introduced a mildly
risque sitcom called ``Brothers'' in 1984; Garry Shandling's
innovative ``It's Garry Shandling's Show'' had its premiere on
Showtime in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   HBO started ``First and 10,'' a football sitcom (starring O.J.
Simpson and Delta Burke), in 1984 and ``Dream On'' (from the team
that later created NBC's hit ``Friends'') in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Lifetime commissioned and began running new episodes of
``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,'' a critically acclaimed but
painfully low-rated sitcom that had been canceled by NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree, however, that the turning point came in 1992, when
``The Larry Sanders Show'' had its premiere on HBO. A darling of
the critics, the sitcom-within-a-talk-show was widely presumed to
be too ``inside'' for the vast majority of non-media-savvy viewers
but perfect for attracting subscribers to a premium service.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Larry Sanders' was not a mass appeal hit, which is only bad
if you're in the business of having a mass appeal hit,'' says
Albrecht of HBO. ``But the show gave us tremendous credibility. And
when you're selling a product, perception becomes important.''
</P>
<P>
   Albrecht admits that he is desperately seeking new series with
the cachet of ``Larry Sanders.'' That may be bad news for the
firebrands who predict a clean break from the television of the
past but good news for people like O'Shannon, who is attached to
the series form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can say everything I want in a sitcom,'' he says.
``I just think it's time the form grew up a little.''

WRESTLING WITH BIBLICAL CRITICISM: IT'S NOT SUNDAY SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)

Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative CONNIE
WHITE in Kansas City at (800) 444-0267 or (816) 822-8448, or fax

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``What do you mean,'' exclaimed one student, ``that there's no
evidence for a worldwide flood?''
 &HT;    My colleague explained again that no reliable historical or
scientific evidence exists to prove Noah's Ark. The students --
shocked by his scholarly bombshell -- struggled to maintain their
composure.
 &HT;    Every fall, in college and seminary classrooms across the
country, first-year religion students encounter ideas upsetting to
their faith. Most expected Bible courses to be like Sunday school.
They did not expect rigorous critical challenges to the Hebrew and
Christian scriptures.
 &HT;    Biblical criticism is not new. For more than a century, biblical
scholars have employed literary, historical, and other critical
methods to the Bible to better understand its context and message.
 &HT;    Whether they realize it or not, most church people understand
basic biblical criticism. My Sunday school teacher said that Moses
wrote the first five books of the Bible. Yet, when I read the text,
I noticed something odd. Moses wrote his own death scene! How could
that be?
 &HT;    Being curious, I spotted other contradictions. Why did Genesis 1
and 2 seem so different? Why did Peter deny Jesus on six occasions
instead of three? Why were Luke's and Matthew's accounts of Jesus'
birth distinctive?
 &HT;    As if the Bible's internal discrepancies were not enough,
teachers provided additional difficulties to ponder: what about
dinosaurs? a six-day creation? Adam and Eve? a bodily resurrection?
By high school graduation, believing in the Bible is tough.
 &HT;    Then a final blow: some Harvard Ph.D. spouting off about
``myth.'' What's a student to think?
 &HT;    Biblical scholarship explores questions raised by both the text
and by knowledge external to the scriptures. Often their
conclusions -- such as the biblical flood is a myth -- prove
disconcerting to people of faith. Ministers, priests and rabbis
often sidestep these issues with their congregations.
 &HT;    Conservatives insist that Isaiah himself wrote the book of the
Bible that bears his name, while more recent scholarship indicates
that two or three people wrote the book. As we quipped in seminary,
``Three Isaiahs just doesn't preach well.''
 &HT;    Silence regarding these questions helps no one. How do believers
deal with intellectual problems raised by the Bible -- as well as
controversial findings of biblical scholars?
 &HT;    One possibility is, of course, to chuck it. When some people
encounter these problems, they reject the Bible -- ``a bunch of
myths and superstitions'' -- as in any way meaningful to life.
 &HT;    But doubters and atheists aren't alone in chucking it. Believers
often dismiss science, history or biblical scholarship as ``secular
humanism.'' They ridicule science, doubt the findings of history
and archeology, and refuse to engage contemporary intellectual
debate. They sometimes construct elaborate pseudo-scholarship to
prove their beliefs -- and prove that secular scholarship is a
conspiracy undermining Christian truth.
 &HT;    A second possibility is to compartmentalize one's faith and
intellectual life. This option, encouraged by public education, is
an easy way around the tensions. Be devout on the weekend. But in
class or on the job, just do your work. Don't let religion intrude
on your study of biology or anthropology; don't let biology or
anthropology trouble your private prayer. Science is science. Faith
is faith.
 &HT;    Most of us, however, do not live in neat, little boxes. We may
try to bracket, but eventually stuff spills over the edges. Some
professor's lecture sends you reeling. A co-worker commits an
egregious ethical violation. Faith and life collide.
 &HT;    The third -- and most difficult -- option is to allow faith and
intellect to speak with one another. Because of the pressure to
separate religion from other spheres, any attempt to integrate --
rather than segregate -- heart and mind can be daunting. Yet the
pursuit of wholeness -- spiritual and intellectual -- is central to
the quest to know and love God.
 &HT;    To integrate faith and learning, the conversation must consist
of equal partners. One should be fully open to the questions of
both belief and inquiry. Faith and intellect are equally challenged
and challenging. Everything is up for grabs -- with all the
tensions, ambiguities, paradoxes and problems. And therein lies the
adventure.
 &HT;    I commiserate with my students struggling with Noah's story. It
took years for me to accept that the first chapter of Genesis is
poetry, that no wise men showed up at Jesus' birth, and Paul did
not write I Timothy.
 &HT;    Wrestling with contemporary biblical criticism has helped me to
understand that historic literalism and scientific accuracy are not
the Bible's point.
 &HT;    This knowledge, much to my surprise, did not lead to infidelity.
Rather, it has led to a deeper experience of God through the
biblical texts. I've learned to ask different questions of the
Bible -- broader, more relevant, and tougher questions about
meaning, faith and ethics.
 &HT;    Biblical scholarship makes me a better Christian -- not a
secular humanist or atheist.
 &HT;    It may not preach easily, but ultimately, it preaches well.

   CLINTON-CANTON (Canton, Ohio) _ This town is a political
bellwether, a place that votes as America does for president, that
swung to the Republican presidents during the 1980s and to Clinton
in the 1990s, and from extensive interviewing here it is clear that
people still support the president. And while they are most

NUMBERS TALK FOR VAUGHN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The second wave of press folk was descending on Mo
Vaughn, who, having first answered questions in the official
Interview Room, was now seated comfortably in front of his locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo,'' said one radio type, ``are you all talked out?''
</P>
<P>
   Talked out? Mo? Talked out after smashing two home runs and a
double and knocking in a postseason record-tying seven runs? Talked
out after setting the tone for an 11-3 Red Sox Game 1 victory over
the Indians Tuesday? Talked out after driving in more runs with
three swings of the bat in this game than the entire team produced
three years ago in the same series against the same opponent?
Talked out after playing the role of Boston Red Sox Playoff
Exorcist?
</P>
<P>
   ``On a day like this,'' grinned Maurice Samuel Vaughn, ``you've
got to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The man had a right to talk. He had a right to gush. He had a
right to do just about anything he wanted to do, because his was
the kind of performance an athlete works toward. You put in the
time to hone the skills so that every once in a while, it all goes
your way.
</P>
<P>
   The two operative tallies going into this game were 0 for 13 and
0 for 14. The former represented the Red Sox' postseason record
since Thursday, Oct. 23, 1986, when Bruce Hurst beat the Mets in
Game 5 of the World Series. The latter represented Vaughn's
personal record of batting futility in the three-game loss to these
same Indians during the 1995 Division Series. With one first-inning
swing of the bat, Mo officially took care of the second problem
while symbolically disposing of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Mo's three-run homer off Jaret Wright in the first
was the biggest Red Sox hit in the past 12 years. It put an end to
all the aggravation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though people say, `Well, I wasn't here,''' said Mike
Stanley, ``you're still cognizant of the streaks. Even if you don't
read the papers, you pass by a TV and somebody is mentioning it.
When Mo hit that home run, it eased a lot of minds in the
clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't put any words to it,'' said Mo's longtime teammate and
friend, John Valentin, who was on first base at the time. ``But it
was soooo big. It got the monkey off his back. It took care of the
0 for 13s and 0 for 14s. I know he wanted to contribute today, but
I don't even think he understands how big that home run was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting to come up with men on base in the first
inning,'' Vaughn declared. ``You come up for the first time and
you've got an opportunity to put the team ahead. Who knows what
will happen? But let me tell you that you don't think you're going
to hit a three-run homer your first time up in the playoffs, and
that's a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn delivered the mail his way, and that's another fact.
He poked an outside fastball into the left-field seats for a home
run in the first inning. He turned on a changeup for a two-run
homer to right in the sixth. And he yanked an inside pitch past
first baseman Jim Thome for a bases-loaded double in the eighth.
That, friends, is a vintage Maurice Vaughn day at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I didn't do in '95,'' he explained. ``I didn't hit
the ball where it's pitched. I tried to force things instead of
letting the game come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of guys would never, ever talk about a colossal personal
failure. Those guys would glare at anyone with the audacity to
mention the incident and mumble something about having ``put '95
behind me.'' That's not the Mo Vaughn way. In the days and weeks
leading up to this series, he was just as likely to bring it up
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '95,'' he said Tuesday, ``I had an MVP season, and then I
came here and did nothing. It was hard to take. I had the
completely wrong approach. Let's face it; you've got to admit your
failures and see if you can learn from your mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of Mo's future. It is reasonably safe
to say that with every 1998 playoff homer and RBI, the sound you
hear in the background will be the cash register ka-chinging and
ka-chinging. A big postseason for Mo will easily vault him into the
eight-figure category.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking about my contract situation for next year
right now,'' he insisted. ``Right now we've got games to win.
That's what we have to be concerned with. There will be plenty of
time to take care of the situation when the time comes.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a good answer, and it's the answer Red Sox fans want to
hear. Nor is there any doubt that Mo is sincere. He wants to win.
He has always wanted to win. There is no doubt that his No. 1
priority at the present time is to do all he can to bring a world
championship to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But sometime between the end of Tuesday's game and the start of
today's game, Mo Vaughn could be forgiven for allowing a huge grin
to cross his face. He had once again demonstrated that the
organization needs him more than he needs the organization. The
disciplined approach Vaughn brought to the batter's box Tuesday
will be just as disciplined in another uniform as it is in this
one.
</P>
<P>
   And professional and personal discipline defines Mo Vaughn. The
0 for 14 happened, and Mo can't go into the record books, armed
with some white-out, and expunge those evil numbers. He doesn't
even want to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll ever close the books on what happened in
1995,'' he said. ``I think I'll always refer back to it and learn
from it because I think, as much as it hurts, you're always going
to learn more from negative things than positive things.''
</P>
<P>
   Home run. Home run. Double. Seven runs batted in. That's a
learning experience. That's a ballplayer. And he may still be
talking.

HOW MUCH DO COMPUTERS HELP STUDENTS LEARN MATH?

<TEXT>
<P>
   The first large-scale examination of how computers affect the
learning of mathematics in American classrooms found that when used
selectively by trained teachers in middle schools they can
significantly enhance academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   But the study also indicated that their value in elementary
school is far more limited and that when used primarily for drills
and practice at either level, which is common, or when students
spend long periods of time using them, computers in schools can be
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   The results imply that school districts should spend more on
computers in middle schools than elementary schools and should
focus attention on professional development for teachers to make
sure they know how to use the computers effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The study, called ``Does it Compute?'' released Tuesday, was
carried out by a researcher at Educational Testing Service in
Princeton, N.J. and sponsored by the journal Education Week and the
Milken Exchange on Education Technology, which promotes the
effective use of computers in the classroom. It took the scores of
thousands of fourth and eighth graders on the 1996 math portion of
the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, the most
widely cited test given to samples of students across the country,
and examined them based on surveys of students and teachers
regarding classroom computer use.
</P>
<P>
   Among eighth graders, it found that when students used computers
for more complex mathematics like simulations, which measure
changing variables, or applications, where data are manipulated and
analyzed, gains of more than a third of an academic year were
registered. For fourth graders using computers for mathematical
games, the gain was a tenth of an academic year, or a few weeks'
worth of instruction. The study divided computer use into four
categories: drill and practice (common but least effective),
demonstration of new topics (seldom used), as well as mathematical
games, and simulations and applications.
</P>
<P>
   By using a large sample size and controlling for such factors as
socio-economic background, teacher preparedness, class size and
school environment, the new study offers insight in the heated
debate over the cost-benefit of the $5 billion spent annually on
school computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When computers are used to perform certain tasks, namely
applying higher order concepts, and when teachers are proficient
enough in computer use to direct students toward productive uses
more generally, computers do seem to be associated with significant
gains in mathematics achievement,'' concluded the report, written
by Harold Wenglinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It added: ``The effects of technology appear to be much smaller
in the fourth than the eighth grade, and so may not be
cost-effective. To the extent that the primary benefit of computers
lies in applying higher order skills, there may not be much
opportunity to benefit from using computers before middle school.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the circumscribed and mixed nature of the findings, they
are likely to be used by both sides in the debate over whether the
investment has proven itself. In 1983, there was a computer for
every 125 students whereas in 1995, the ratio was 1 to 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this tells me is that under certain conditions, uses of
technology with certain kids in certain subjects at certain times
will be effective,'' said Larry Cuban, an education professor at
Stanford University and a longstanding skeptic toward the value of
computers in schools. ``That kind of conditional statement can be
made about virtually any approach to teaching. The question I
continually ask is how else we could achieve the same results in a
less costly way.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who have advocated increased investment in education
technology say they feel vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is unprecedented about this study is the way it takes a
broad cross section of schools,'' said Christopher Dede, a
professor of education and information technology at George Mason
University in Virginia. ``It turns out that if you are at all in
the ballpark about using technology correctly, there are some
things that are happening that are good. It is not idiosyncratic to
one teaching style or software vendor but something fundamental.
Technology permits different kinds of pedagogy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report describes technology uses among the 6,627 fourth
graders and 7,146 eighth graders who took the core NAEP assessment
in mathematics in 1996. It sought to avoid pitfalls of earlier
studies on computer use by, for example, asking not about ratio of
computer to student but frequency of use since in many schools
computers may be available but unused.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that eighth graders and fourth graders use
computers in school at about the same frequency. Less well off
students have as much access to computers as better off students
and, in fact, poor students had higher levels of computer use than
their better off peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to white, non-poor, and suburban students, those who
are minority, poor and urban find at least as much opportunity to
use computers in school,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It added, ``It seems that policies to promote computer access in
school have succeeded in eliminating inequities of this sort; yet
inequities in teacher preparedness and what is taught using
computers remains.''
</P>
<P>
   The report measured teacher preparedness by whether teachers had
received training in computer use but it did not distinguish
between a weekend seminar and a semester-long course. Any teacher
who had any training was counted as prepared.
</P>
<P>
   It found that when computers were used largely for drill and
practice in eighth grade, there was lower academic achievement. For
fourth graders, mathematical games were positively related to
academic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The report acknowledges that its method allows for possible
cause-and-effect confusion, saying that strong students may use
computers in more complex ways. But by controlling for background
and student work the previous year, the study concluded that
computers were the likely source of the positive results.

   BRADLEY-OBIT (Los Angeles) _ Former Los Angeles Mayor Tom
Bradley, the visionary whose 20 years in office saw the creation of
the city's modern skyline, the giddy high of the 1984 Olympics and
the smoldering low point of the 1992 riots, has died. He was 80.
Bradley, an imposing 6 foot 4 inches in height, became an
internationally known figure during his five terms in office. He
was the first African-American to be elected mayor of Los Angeles
and the first to be nominated by a major party to run for governor.

   LAPD-FORCE (Los Angeles) _ The number of police on Los Angeles
streets rose by 26 percent since the Rodney King beating, but the
use of force declined by 22 percent, with fewer shootings and less
use of batons and pepper spray, according to a report released
today. Critics praise the trend as a welcome change from the days
when the LAPD had a reputation for brute force. But a separate
study by the Inspector General has raised questions about whether
LAPD officers are being disciplined in all cases of improper
behavior. Checking into one detail in the report that indicated

not all good news: The lower rates mean diminished earning power

savings or fixed-income investments. By Greg Wilcox. (Will move in

DISNEY: GENUINELY ARTIFICIAL, REALLY SURREAL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As usual, Tocqueville had it nailed even before it happened.
More than a century before Disneyland opened its doors, the great
analyst of modern democracy grasped the spirit of hysteria that
infuses the entire theme park genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not fear,'' he wrote, ``that the poetry of democratic
nations will prove insipid or that it will fly too near the ground;
I rather apprehend that it will be forever losing itself in the
clouds and that it will range at last to purely imaginary regions.
I fear that the production of democratic poets may often be
surcharged with immense and incoherent images, with exaggerated
descriptions and strange creations, and that the fantastic beings
of their brain may sometimes make us regret the world of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to grant that Disney's theme parks are full of strange
creations, but do they rate as poetry? ``The Architecture of
Reassurance,'' a show of Disney's theme park architecture that will
open on Tuesday at Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, makes an
affirmative case.
</P>
<P>
   The work on view may seldom rise to the level of great poetry,
but it does fulfill the Greek idea of poetics as the making of a
culture's connective tissue. If you are prone to cultural analysis,
the theme parks offer a field day for symbolic interpretation. And
if you have kids, there is the pleasure of fulfilling their desires
in a public, social ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Karal Ann Marling, an art historian, and originally
presented at the Canadian Center for Architecture, the show was the
fourth in that institution's monumental, six-part survey, ``The
American Century.''
</P>
<P>
   I missed the show in Montreal, , but if the Canadian Center's
past shows and the intelligent, handsome catalog produced for this
one are any guide, this should be a golden opportunity for serious
thought on a deceptively frivolous subject.
</P>
<P>
   As the show's title suggests, this is not a hollow, celebratory
occasion. Since the Disney people are notorious control freaks, the
show's ambivalent stance can itself be counted a curatorial
achievement. It is also the proper stance to take toward a subject
that stirs up such complicated feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting more than 200 drawings, plans, renderings, models and
archival photographs, the show traces the history of the genre from
Disney's initial, unsuccessful efforts to build an amusement park
in Burbank to the parks constructed in France and Japan after his
death.
</P>
<P>
   The installation, designed by Robert Anderson and Chriswell
Lappin, is laid out to evoke the genuine, artificial thing. (Not to
be missed: a less varnished look at Disney's world is presented in
the museum's lower gallery, in a series of photographs by Catherine
Wagner specially commissioned for the show.)
</P>
<P>
   In the renderings, you get to see Disney's attractions in their
pure dream state, without too hot a sun overhead, children
demanding to go to the bathroom and the claustrophobia induced by
some of the rides. And it's instructive to see the names of
individual designers attached to what can otherwise resemble the
corporate face of a carnivalesque ministry of fear.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt it is possible for baby boomers like myself to look at
Disney straight, any more than it was possible for Dorothy and her
companions to be impressed by the wizard after Toto pulled back the
curtain. Time has done a Toto on Disney, and on ourselves. We grew
up with this name as a symbol of innocence and wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the media's preoccupation with itself, we now see
Disney as an imperial corporation with global ambitions. Thanks to
hindsight, we can perceive that even in the 1950s, Disney's
innocence was a gloss over the invention of the mass consumer
society. To that extent, we may feel that we were had, and it's
tempting to find a scapegoat for the disillusions of grown up life.
</P>
<P>
   But Disney was also a major American artist, and he applied part
of his genius to the invention of mass consumption. The capacity
for wonder is an important quality, and why shouldn't the
technology of information be used to sustain as well as unmask this
quality in an informational society.
</P>
<P>
   Tocqueville's prediction could apply to many forms of culture,
high and low: Cinerama. Abstract Expressionism. The Empire State
Building. The 1893 Chicago World's Fair. Trump Taj Mahal.
``Gravity's Rainbow.'' Monicagate. But no form has transported more
people toward imaginary regions on such a grandiose physical scale
as Disney's theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   This show will hold particular interest for those who follow the
Surrealist strain that has emerged in the work of Frank Gehry, Rem
Koolhaas, Philippe Starck, and other architects. There are clear
formal resemblances between Surrealistic painting and some Disney
designs, like two unbuilt schemes for the entrance to the Anaheim
park's Tomorrowland.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But the conventionally rendered projects are even more
Surrealistic. The supernaturally tidy Main Street, the Matterhorn
rising in a suburban Southern California desert, the tropical river
flowing in the shadow of a Bavarian castle: these display
characteristic Surrealistic techniques of displacement,
juxtaposition, and the uncanny. Even Dali never contrived to put a
whole nation in mouse ears.
</P>
<P>
   If the purpose of this architecture is to reassure, then it is,
of course, a subversion of Surrealism's anarchic spirit, not a
fulfillment of it. But some Disney attractions are genuinely
disturbing. I'd rather climb the (real) Matterhorn than subject
myself a second time to It's a Small World, the ride commissioned
from Disney by the Pepsi-Cola Co. for the 1964-65 New York World's
Fair. That endless, repetitive jingle; those identically sized
dolls; the molasses pace of the mechanized boats add up to a truly
harrowing nine minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say it's art. In an interview in the catalog,
Frank Gehry describes a meeting at which the Disney president,
Frank Wells, rejected a plan by Robert Venturi for Disneyland
Paris. Venturi had designed a grande allee of 150-foot-tall,
two-dimensional Mickeys and Minnies, shaking hands at 50-foot
intervals, along a stretch the length of the Champs Elysee. ``It
was Bob Venturi at his pinnacle, just the best,'' Gehry says.
``There is an essence and a truth in Venturi's portrayal of this
whole thing. That's why he could not do work for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gehry himself did manage to create one of the few theme-park
projects that rates as architecture. His Festival Disney at
EuroDisney features an avenue of square columns, tiled with
iridescent metal, supporting an aerial grid of cables fitted with
small electric lights.
</P>
<P>
   It is a ``Red Shoes'' scene, poignant in the contrast between
the lumbering columns, the shifting colors of their surfaces and
the sad carnival light of the tiny lamps overhead. In this
hyperbolic context, Gehry's understatement showed up the difference
between art and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Tocqueville had a theory about why American artists might be
prone to abandon the great to reach the gigantic. He states in one
paragraph what George W.S. Trow took many pages to describe in his
book, ``Within the Context of No Context.'' The paragraph is worth
repeating.
</P>
<P>
   ``In democratic communities, each citizen is habitually engaged
in the contemplation of a very puny object: himself. If he ever
raises his looks higher, he perceives only the immense form of
society at large or the still more imposing aspect of mankind. His
ideas are all either extremely minute and clear or extremely
general and vague; what lies between is a void. When he has been
drawn out of his own sphere, therefore, he always expects that some
amazing object will be offered to his attention; and it is on these
terms alone that he consents to tear himself for a moment from the
petty, complicated cares that form the charm and the excitement of
his life.''
</P>
<P>
   But some artists work creatively with those terms, and a few
even change them.

FEDS, AS EXPECTED, DROPS KEY RATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve Tuesday lowered a key interest
rate for the first time in nearly three years, pumping a modest
amount of fuel into a US economy that is already feeling the drag
of the global economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   The US economy is still healthy and growing, with inflation and
unemployment well in check. Still, recent events like the stock
market sell-off and the 4,700 job cuts that Gillette Co. announced
Monday have their roots overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, in a brief explanation of its rate cut, said it needed
to ``cushion'' the effects of weak economies abroad on future US
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no case for a rate cut for the current US economy,''
said Allen Sinai, chief global economist with Primark Decision
Economics of Boston. ``But our central bank cannot take the chance
-- it is just too risky -- that the US economy will fall apart.
This was a preemptive move in a situation where world risks loom
very large.''
</P>
<P>
   Fed policy-makers voted to cut the target for the federal funds
rate by a quarter point, to 5.25 percent. It was the first
reduction since January 1996 in the key interest rate, which banks
charge each other for overnight loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed controls the fed funds rate by trading government
securities with banks. It left unchanged, at 5 percent, the more
symbolic discount rate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Normally, a cut in short-term rates by the Fed prompts lenders
to lower a variety of other interest rates, which reduces the cost
of home mortgages, credit card debt, and other loans. However, some
analysts said, the effect this time would be muted, because US
interest rates are already low.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have withdrawn money from investments they consider
risky, such as foreign stocks, and invested it in US government
bonds, which are seen as safer. This has made more money available
to US borrowers and cut the cost of borrowing. Mortgages are at a
30-year low, and rates on government securities, from 3-month
Treasury bill to 30-year Treasury bonds, are below the federal
funds rate that the Fed controls. They are unlikely to fall
further, some analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   However, they said, the Fed move might prompt banks to cut the
prime rate, which would lower interest rates on loans that are tied
to the prime, most notably home-equity loans. The Fed rate cut
could also make it easier for businesses to obtain working capital.
</P>
<P>
   If that occurs, businesses and consumers would be able to borrow
money more cheaply to buy and produce goods, which in turn would
keep businesses working and people employed.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets expected a rate cut of between one-quarter and
one-half point, and they gave a mixed response to the Fed's
announcement. The Dow Jones industrial average initially fell more
than 100 points but rebounded to close at 8082.58, down 26.26, or
0.3 percent. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose a scant 0.03
percent and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.4 percent. The yield
on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond declined to 5.09 percent
from 5.14 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed move was not universally applauded, as some analysts
said the US economy was too strong to merit a rate cut. With
unemployment low and consumer spending high, there is little sign
of an economic slowdown, said Allan Meltzer, an economist at
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, who heads a Fed-watching
group called the Shadow Open Market Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were split on whether Fed policy-makers would follow up
with more rate cuts in their final two meetings of the year.
</P>
<P>
   At Westfalia Investments, a New York brokerage, chief strategist
Peter Cardillo said he ``suspected'' the Fed would cut rates by a
quarter-point in both November and December.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple reason is that there will be an erosion in consumer
confidence, which will lead to less spending by consumers,'' he
said. In fact, the Conference Board, which tracks consumer
attitudes, Tuesday said its index of consumer confidence fell to
126 in September from 133.1 in August. It was the first time the
index fell for three straight months since 1994. Consumer spending
drives two-thirds of US economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   But Meltzer noted that the Fed, in explaining its rate cut
Tuesday, said that ``a slightly lower federal funds rate should now
be consistent with keeping inflation low and sustaining economic
growth.'' With that language, he said, the Fed was suggesting that
no more rate cuts are planned.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also appeared to reinforce recent remarks by Fed
chairman Alan Greenspan that his primary role is to manage the US
economy -- not those of other nations. It said the Fed wanted to
make sure that weakness overseas does not hurt the United States,
but said nothing about improving conditions abroad.
</P>
<P>
   As much of Asia has fallen into recession, including the
powerhouse of Japan, many nations have looked to the United States
to remain strong, buy foreign goods, and help pull the world out of
its slowdown. But in testifying before a House committee earlier
this month, Greenspan downplayed his role as a global leader. ``Our
essential mandate is to the economy of the United Stats of
America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also said at that hearing that he was not
orchestrating a coordinated cut in interest rates by the world's
industrialized nations, as some had speculated. Such a rate cut
would likely spur economic activity not only in the industrialized
nations but around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Fed is likely giving great weight in its
decision-making to conditions abroad, said Ralph Bryant, a senior
fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally in a (Fed policy-making) discussion, the foreign
situation would get much less attention than the domestic
situation, and most people would vote with no weight on it at
all,'' he said. ``But I'm guessing now it was probably enough to
tip many members of the committee to lower the funds rate. Had it
not been for such a turbulent international situation, chances are
they would not have done so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The awkward truth is that nobody knows -- not even members of
the (Fed) committee -- whether this rate cut will seem like the
right thing to have done, with the wisdom of hindsight,'' said
Bryant. ``The uncertainties are very great in the world financial
markets and the world economy.''

SCIENTISTS HAVE NEW EVIDENCE FOR EXISTENCE OF `MAGNETARS'

<TEXT>
<P>
   A powerful blast of stellar radiation briefly penetrated Earth's
upper atmosphere one night last month. While it never reached the
ground and posed no health hazard, scientists say, the radiation
stripped atoms of their electrons and disrupted the quiet of the
high night sky with electrical conditions that severely limited the
range of radio transmissions. It rocked delicate instruments on at
least seven spacecraft, causing temporary shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers analyzing data from the event, on Aug. 27, said
Tuesday that the wave of gamma and X-ray radiation and high-energy
particles had come from a cataclysmic magnetic flare on a star
20,000 light-years away. Such immense magnetic forces, they think,
are strong evidence supporting the existence of a strange type of
astronomical body called a magnetar.
</P>
<P>
   Theory holds that magnetars are exceedingly small and dense
objects, a variation of the neutron stars that are more massive
than the sun but compressed in a sphere no more than 12 miles in
diameter. These are the remnants of the collapse and explosion of a
large star. More commonly, neutron stars are like pulsars, which
spin rapidly and emit steady pulses of radio waves. A magnetar is
one of the few neutron stars observed so far that repeatedly emits
bursts of gamma rays and is thought to have an extremely powerful
magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever caused the event of Aug. 27, the observations have
inspired astronomers to speak in superlatives of awe:
</P>
<P>
   _ The radiation, they say, appears to be evidence for the most
powerful magnetic field ever seen in the universe, billions of
times stronger than any on Earth and 100 times stronger than any
previously known in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   _ No blast so powerful has ever been detected striking Earth
from beyond the solar system. One astronomer calculated the total
energy that the star must have released to produce the Aug. 27
radiation surge. If that energy could be harnessed, it would be
enough to power all of civilization virtually to the end of time.
But, of course, only a tiny fraction of that energy reached Earth.
</P>
<P>
   _ The event was the first in which a significant, though
temporary, change in Earth's environment could be traced to energy
from a distant star.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have discovered a new type of star with a superstrong
magnetic field,'' said Dr. Chryssa Kouveliotou, an astrophysicist,
expressing the favored interpretation of the sudden surge of
stellar radiation reaching Earth. She is with the Marshall Space
Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., and spoke in a news conference
at the offices of NASA in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of scientists at radiotelescopes have analyzed the
short-lived afterglow of subatomic particles ejected by the star in
the tumultuous magnetic eruption, probably from stresses that
produced tremendous starquakes. They have drawn similar
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there's smoke, there's fire, and we've seen the smoke
that tells us there's a magnetar out there,'' said Dr. Dale Frail
of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   In the same statement from the observatory, Dr. Shri Kulkarni,
an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology, said the
radio antennas had detected emissions from particles ejected at
nearly the speed of light from the surface of the neutron star
interacting with the extremely powerful magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time this phenomenon, predicted by
theorists, has been seen so clearly from a suspected magnetar,''
Kulkarni said, noting that the radiotelescope observations
complemented the gamma ray and X-ray data gathered by several
spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   At the NASA news conference, Dr. Robert Duncan, an
astrophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin, who has been a
leader in magnetar theory, cautioned that scientists were still
analyzing data from the Aug. 27 observations. ``Magnetar is the
leading theory to explain this,'' he said, ``but in science, the
theory has to keep on passing the tests, and there should be more
good tests soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Cordes, a specialist in neutron stars at Cornell
University who was not involved in the new research, called the
findings ``a very astounding triumph for observations and
theoretical astrophysics _ it's a really big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kevin Hurley, a research physicist at the University of
California at Berkeley, who calculated the likely magnitude of the
object's magnetic field, said that seven spacecraft were the first
to record ``the intense flash of X-rays'' from last month's event.
</P>
<P>
   Although the radiation caused several of the craft to shut down
automatically to prevent damage, they still had time to provide
data with which scientists pinpointed the location of the putative
magnetar. It coincided with an object in the constellation Aquila,
designated SGR1900+14, that had previously been observed emitting
periodic flashes of intense gamma rays. It is one of the sources
called soft gamma-ray repeaters.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of magnetars was proposed in 1992 as a theoretical
explanation for these soft gamma repeaters, which were first
detected six years earlier. Only four of them are known so far.
They are different from the gamma ray bursters, which seem to be at
even greater distances and do not appear to repeat themselves. Last
May, astronomers reported detecting such a gamma ray burst that was
so violent and bright that for about 40 seconds it apparently
outshone all the rest of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   A ground network of low-frequency radio transmitters, operated
by Stanford University, monitored the sudden changes in the upper
atmosphere because of the radiation blast. Dr. Umran Inan, an
electrical engineer and head of the Stanford research team, said
the effects were especially marked in the ionosphere, the part of
the atmosphere at altitudes between 35 and 50 miles that is
important to radio communications. Radio stations that usually can
broadcast great distances in the quiet night sky were probably
reduced to the short ranges of daylight, the solar radiation
causing electrical disturbances in the atmosphere.

PUBLISHER DISAVOWS `SMARTEST-DUMBEST CITIES' LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (Attn.: Ala., Ga., Tx.) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's almost too true an Aggie joke.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, an Atlanta publisher named College Station the ``most
literate'' and ``smartest'' city in America.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, it disavowed the designation.
</P>
<P>
   The city manager of College Station _ home to Texas A&AMP;M
University, whose proud alumni are the butt of countless jibes
assuming a general lack of intellectual agility _ reacted with
equanimity, after he stopped laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of a `good news, bad news' joke,'' said Skip Noe,
47, the city manager. ``They're not saying we're not intelligent;
they're saying they're disowning that particular analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Longstreet Press, a subsidiary of Cox Newspapers, which owns the
Austin American-Statesman and Waco Herald-Tribune, issued a brief
statement saying that a free-lance publicist issued a list of
``smartest'' and ``dumbest'' cities based on per capita book sales
and that the PR man's analysis was ``erroneous.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not spell out what part was mistaken and a company
spokesman did not return calls requesting clarification.
</P>
<P>
   The ``dumbest'' cities cited in the list were Anniston, Ala.,
San Angelo, Texas, and Athens, Ga., in that order. Among big
cities, Dallas had the least smarts.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bard, a Longstreet employee, indicated that the company
had been inundated by complaints from residents of poorly rated
communities. He said calling someone stupid is bound to generate
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Bard said the analysis by Atlanta publicist Bob Hope, no
relation to the comedian, was based on information from the
American Booksellers Association and was based on 1992 Commerce
Department data.
</P>
<P>
   Hope issued Friday's news release without Longstreet's approval,
the company said. ``We apologize for the misuse of this
information,'' said Chuck Perry, Longstreet's president.
</P>
<P>
   San Angelo's designation as second-dumbest didn't go down well
in the West Texas community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they're checking books out of the library,'' suggested
E.J. Holland, dean of Angelo State University's College of Liberal
and Fine Arts. ``It seems a little dumb to judge cities by a single
indicator. And San Angelo is really a neat place to live.''

<P>
   As usual, Tocqueville had it nailed even before it happened.
More than a century before Disneyland opened its doors, the great
analyst of modern democracy grasped the spirit of hysteria that
infuses the entire theme park genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not fear,'' he wrote, ``that the poetry of democratic
nations will prove insipid or that it will fly too near the ground;
I rather apprehend that it will be forever losing itself in the
clouds and that it will range at last to purely imaginary regions.
I fear that the production of democratic poets may often be
surcharged with immense and incoherent images, with exaggerated
descriptions and strange creations, and that the fantastic beings
of their brain may sometimes make us regret the world of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to grant that Disney's theme parks are full of strange
creations, but do they rate as poetry? ``The Architecture of
Reassurance,'' a show of Disney's theme park architecture that will
open on Tuesday at Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, makes an
affirmative case.
</P>
<P>
   The work on view may seldom rise to the level of great poetry,
but it does fulfill the Greek idea of poetics as the making of a
culture's connective tissue. If you are prone to cultural analysis,
the theme parks offer a field day for symbolic interpretation. And
if you have kids, there is the pleasure of fulfilling their desires
in a public, social ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Karal Ann Marling, an art historian, and originally
presented at the Canadian Center for Architecture, the show was the
fourth in that institution's monumental, six-part survey, ``The
American Century.''
</P>
<P>
   I missed the show in Montreal, , but if the Canadian Center's
past shows and the intelligent, handsome catalog produced for this
one are any guide, this should be a golden opportunity for serious
thought on a deceptively frivolous subject.
</P>
<P>
   As the show's title suggests, this is not a hollow, celebratory
occasion. Since the Disney people are notorious control freaks, the
show's ambivalent stance can itself be counted a curatorial
achievement. It is also the proper stance to take toward a subject
that stirs up such complicated feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting more than 200 drawings, plans, renderings, models and
archival photographs, the show traces the history of the genre from
Disney's initial, unsuccessful efforts to build an amusement park
in Burbank to the parks constructed in France and Japan after his
death.
</P>
<P>
   The installation, designed by Robert Anderson and Chriswell
Lappin, is laid out to evoke the genuine, artificial thing. (Not to
be missed: a less varnished look at Disney's world is presented in
the museum's lower gallery, in a series of photographs by Catherine
Wagner specially commissioned for the show.)
</P>
<P>
   In the renderings, you get to see Disney's attractions in their
pure dream state, without too hot a sun overhead, children
demanding to go to the bathroom and the claustrophobia induced by
some of the rides. And it's instructive to see the names of
individual designers attached to what can otherwise resemble the
corporate face of a carnivalesque ministry of fear.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt it is possible for baby boomers like myself to look at
Disney straight, any more than it was possible for Dorothy and her
companions to be impressed by the wizard after Toto pulled back the
curtain. Time has done a Toto on Disney, and on ourselves. We grew
up with this name as a symbol of innocence and wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the media's preoccupation with itself, we now see
Disney as an imperial corporation with global ambitions. Thanks to
hindsight, we can perceive that even in the 1950s, Disney's
innocence was a gloss over the invention of the mass consumer
society. To that extent, we may feel that we were had, and it's
tempting to find a scapegoat for the disillusions of grown up life.
</P>
<P>
   But Disney was also a major American artist, and he applied part
of his genius to the invention of mass consumption. The capacity
for wonder is an important quality, and why shouldn't the
technology of information be used to sustain as well as unmask this
quality in an informational society.
</P>
<P>
   Tocqueville's prediction could apply to many forms of culture,
high and low: Cinerama. Abstract Expressionism. The Empire State
Building. The 1893 Chicago World's Fair. Trump Taj Mahal.
``Gravity's Rainbow.'' Monicagate. But no form has transported more
people toward imaginary regions on such a grandiose physical scale
as Disney's theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   This show will hold particular interest for those who follow the
Surrealist strain that has emerged in the work of Frank Gehry, Rem
Koolhaas, Philippe Starck, and other architects. There are clear
formal resemblances between Surrealistic painting and some Disney
designs, like two unbuilt schemes for the entrance to the Anaheim
park's Tomorrowland.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But the conventionally rendered projects are even more
Surrealistic. The supernaturally tidy Main Street, the Matterhorn
rising in a suburban Southern California desert, the tropical river
flowing in the shadow of a Bavarian castle: these display
characteristic Surrealistic techniques of displacement,
juxtaposition, and the uncanny. Even Dali never contrived to put a
whole nation in mouse ears.
</P>
<P>
   If the purpose of this architecture is to reassure, then it is,
of course, a subversion of Surrealism's anarchic spirit, not a
fulfillment of it. But some Disney attractions are genuinely
disturbing. I'd rather climb the (real) Matterhorn than subject
myself a second time to It's a Small World, the ride commissioned
from Disney by the Pepsi-Cola Co. for the 1964-65 New York World's
Fair. That endless, repetitive jingle; those identically sized
dolls; the molasses pace of the mechanized boats add up to a truly
harrowing nine minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say it's art. In an interview in the catalog,
Frank Gehry describes a meeting at which the Disney president,
Frank Wells, rejected a plan by Robert Venturi for Disneyland
Paris. Venturi had designed a grande allee of 150-foot-tall,
two-dimensional Mickeys and Minnies, shaking hands at 50-foot
intervals, along a stretch the length of the Champs Elysee. ``It
was Bob Venturi at his pinnacle, just the best,'' Gehry says.
``There is an essence and a truth in Venturi's portrayal of this
whole thing. That's why he could not do work for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gehry himself did manage to create one of the few theme-park
projects that rates as architecture. His Festival Disney at
EuroDisney features an avenue of square columns, tiled with
iridescent metal, supporting an aerial grid of cables fitted with
small electric lights.
</P>
<P>
   It is a ``Red Shoes'' scene, poignant in the contrast between
the lumbering columns, the shifting colors of their surfaces and
the sad carnival light of the tiny lamps overhead. In this
hyperbolic context, Gehry's understatement showed up the difference
between art and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Tocqueville had a theory about why American artists might be
prone to abandon the great to reach the gigantic. He states in one
paragraph what George W.S. Trow took many pages to describe in his
book, ``Within the Context of No Context.'' The paragraph is worth
repeating.
</P>
<P>
   ``In democratic communities, each citizen is habitually engaged
in the contemplation of a very puny object: himself. If he ever
raises his looks higher, he perceives only the immense form of
society at large or the still more imposing aspect of mankind. His
ideas are all either extremely minute and clear or extremely
general and vague; what lies between is a void. When he has been
drawn out of his own sphere, therefore, he always expects that some
amazing object will be offered to his attention; and it is on these
terms alone that he consents to tear himself for a moment from the
petty, complicated cares that form the charm and the excitement of
his life.''
</P>
<P>
   But some artists work creatively with those terms, and a few
even change them.

RED SOX DEMOLISH INDIANS IN FIRST PLAYOFF GAME, 11-3 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ You could build a team around any one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Put the three together, as the Red Sox have done, and maybe you
can fashion something even more enduring, the kind of thing that
comes around, oh, once every 80 years or so and is cherished like a
family heirloom.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn, Pedro Martinez, and Nomar Garciaparra didn't win a
World Series Tuesday afternoon. World Series? Vaughn hasn't even
won a return trip to Boston next year.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of an 11-3 demolition of the Cleveland Indians
in which Vaughn hit two home runs and a double and drove in seven
runs, Garciaparra hit a three-run homer and sacrifice fly and drove
in the other four runs, and Martinez struck out eight in seven
innings, the Red Sox did more than end their 13-game postseason
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   They proclaimed, as loudly as Shirley Vaughn was cheering her
son during the most productive game of his career, that they have
designs on something beyond just winning Game 1 of their
best-of-five American League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, this is big,'' said Dennis Eckersley, the wise head who
has been in this position more than any other inhabitant of a Red
Sox uniform. ``It took a little pressure off of Mo, off of us. For
now. For tonight. But not tomorrow. Because it's big, but then it
just keeps getting bigger and bigger, right? This is just the
start.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who had not won in the postseason since Game 5 of
the 1986 World Series, salved the sting of that indignity as surely
as Vaughn buried the memory of his 0-for-14 performance in the
division playoffs in 1995, when the Indians swept the Red Sox in
three games.
</P>
<P>
   With his three-run homer in the first inning off Indians starter
Jaret Wright, his two-run homer off reliever Doug Jones in the
sixth, and his two-run double off reliever Jim Poole in the eighth,
Vaughn matched Mariner Edgar Martinez's record for most RBIs in a
postseason game. He also drove in more runs Tuesday than the Red
Sox scored in all three games combined against the Indians in '95.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mother's pride is great, fantastic, overjoyed,'' said
Shirley Vaughn, who was wearing a necklace with a golden ``No. 42''
and was waiting to give a hug to the man-monster who ate Cleveland
but to her was ``Mama's baby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I let it completely out,'' she added. ``Where we were sitting,
there were only four of us yelling for the Red Sox. Everybody
finally told us, `Would you please be quiet?'''
</P>
<P>
   While Vaughn's three-run homer had the effect of a stun gun on
the crowd of 45,185 in Jacobs Field, Garciaparra's three-run homer
off Wright in the fifth was the silencer. It gave the Sox a 6-0
lead against a team that managed just two singles through the first
five innings against Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaret made mistakes to their first two hitters and it cost us
six runs,'' said Indians catcher Sandy Alomar. ``Mo and Nomar are
very clutch hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the first two hitters in the Sox lineup, Darren Lewis
and John Valentin, were producing five hits between them and
scoring five runs, a total that might have been even higher if
Lewis hadn't left the game after being beaned in the left earflap
by Wright in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're going against Pedro and you find yourself behind,
3-0, that's difficult,'' Indians first baseman Jim Thome said.
``When you find yourself behind, 6-0, that's almost impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's second homer of the day, which made him the first Sox
player to hit two in a postseason game since Carl Yastrzemski and
Rico Petrocelli during the 1967 World Series, made it 8-0 in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told everybody just before the game, `Just perform your
normal activity in a relaxed fashion under pressure,''' said
Vaughn, whose seven RBIs also are a personal best. ``Because I know
how it felt not to be relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   The anxious moments were few for Martinez, who had never pitched
before in the postseason. He gave up a two-run homer to Kenny
Lofton in the sixth, a bases-empty homer to Thome in the seventh,
and invited a visit from manager Jimy Williams in the wake of
Thome's homer when he uncorked a third-strike wild pitch to Travis
Fryman and gave up a double to Brian Giles.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Williams goes to the mound only when he intends to make
a pitching change. That may have been the plan Tuesday, too. But
according to Martinez, he changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really motivated me was to hear Jimy say, `I was going to
take you out but I'm not going to do it because I have a lot of
confidence in you and know you can do it,''' said Martinez, who
proceeded to put out that little brushfire by retiring Alomar on a
foul popup to Vaughn and inducing Omar Vizquel to hit a soft liner
to Garciaparra at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Jim Corsi drew mopup duty, but not before the Red Sox
had tacked on three more runs, two on Vaughn's double, the last on
Garciaparra's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' Vaughn said, ``things look pretty good for this
ball club because we got Game 1 and we've got Pedro going again.''
</P>
<P>
   The view isn't quite as bleak as it might appear for the
Indians. They have lost the first game in seven consecutive
postseason series and have come back to win three. This is the
first time, however, that they've lost a series opener at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a perfect-world scenario,'' Indians manager Mike
Hargrove said. ``We didn't look forward to losing our first game to
keep our tradition going.''
</P>
<P>
   There was at least one person in Jacobs Field looking forward to
a carryover effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had fun today,'' Shirley Vaughn said, ``and we're going to
have fun tomorrow.''

FED CUTS SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES BY QUARTER OF A PERCENTAGE
POINT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal Reserve policy-makers agreed to nudge down
short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point
Tuesday in an effort to help calm the financial turmoil devastating
economies around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Following through on signals telegraphed repeatedly by Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan during the last few weeks, the Federal Open
Market Committee voted to reduce the federal funds rate _ the
benchmark rate commercial banks charge one another for overnight
loans _ to 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed left the discount rate, the rate the central bank
charges for loans to financial institutions, unchanged at 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's cut in the federal fund rate represents the first
movement in interest rates in a year and a half and the first
reduction in nearly three years. Major banks are expected to follow
the Fed's lead and lower their prime lending rates _ the rates they
charge their best customers.
</P>
<P>
   But institutions such as Chase Bank of Texas, a unit of Chase
Manhattan Corp. in New York, Wells Fargo Bank and NationsBank all
held off taking action Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the quarter-point reduction was expected, many investors
on Wall Street were hoping for a steeper cut of at least half a
percentage point on the federal funds rate and at least some
movement on the discount rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged on the news Tuesday,
although stocks regained ground later to close down only 28.32
points. The dollar also fell in value against the yen and peso and
the bond market got a boost from the rate cut.
</P>
<P>
   Fed officials, in a brief statement, said they were cutting
rates to help cushion the effects of ``increased weakness in
foreign economies and of less accomodative financial conditions
domestically.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists say the Fed action was necessary, not so much to help
a still humming U.S. economy, but to send a signal overseas that
the Unites States will assume a leadership role to combat the
global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the U.S. needs a cut in interest rates,'' said
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.
``We don't need stimulation right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The crisis, sparked by a collapse in the real estate market in
Bangkok, Thailand, in July 1997, has already upset the economies of
East Asia, flattened the Russian Bear and is now ravaging the
economies of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's leadership was necessary, analysts said, after an
international effort to coordinate interest rate cuts throughout
the industrialized economies never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   The economies of Latin America were particularly anxious for the
rate cut, Sohn said. Troubled economies from Brazil to Venezuela
are hoping the lower rates will help boost economic activity in the
United States, while allowing the Latin economies to attract cash
with their extraordinarily high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   For Fed watchers, the committee's explanation for its action was
a rather striking statement, since ``the Federal Reserve typically
has not based monetary policy on international events,'' noted Lynn
Reaser, chief economist for NationsBank Private Client Group in
Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Buckwalter, chief executive of Chase Bank of Texas, argued
that with the recent decline in economic growth, the extremely low
inflation rate and the tremendous turmoil in markets around the
world, the Fed had much more room to cut, perhaps by as much as 100
basis points or 1 percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I don't think this means a whole lot for the
average person,'' Buckwalter said, adding ``I think it's almost
kind of a holding pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, however, didn't acquire the nickname ``incremental
Al'' for nothing, noted Bryan Jordan with Banc One Investment
Advisors in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, since Greenspan took over as Fed chairman in 1987, the
Fed has cut interest rates 30 times, 27 of which were in
quarter-point increments, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Since a larger cut would have been so unusual, the Fed would
have risked sending a dire message, Sohn argued. ``People might
think, `Gosh, the world must be coming to an end.'''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also may be trying to save some ammunition, if he
needs to help the markets again down the road with further rate
cuts, Fed watchers said. ``He probably wants to keep some powder
dry,'' Buckwalter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's Open Market Committee is slated to reconvene Nov. 17
and then again Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   While their concerns may be secondary under the current
circumstances, Americans are likely to benefit from lower rates on
their home equity loans, credit cards and other consumer debts.
</P>
<P>
   A family with a $20,000, five-year home equity loan tied to the
prime rate, for instance, would, under the old rates, pay $420.04 a
month and $5,202.23 in interest over the life of the loan, said
Sara Campbell, senior vice president of the North Palm Beach,
Fla.-based Bank Rate Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   With the lower rates, that family's monthly bill would dip to
$417.60 a month, while paying a total $5,055.88 in interest over
the life of the loan, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   A consumer carrying a $2,000 balance on a credit card that
charged 16.10 percent interest and who is making payments of $100 a
month would need 24 months to pay off that debt, while racking up
total interest charges of $344.42 over that time-frame.
</P>
<P>
   With the lower rates, that same credit card holder would pay a
total of $337.37 in interest charges and take 23 months to pay off
the debt, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its myriad effects on consumer credit costs, the
Fed's action could help to bolster sagging confidence among
American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its index of consumer
confidence dropped to 126.0 points in September, down from 133.1
points in August and its lowest level since October 1997.

PREVIEW OF MLS PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wily Bora Milutinovic has thrown a snag into what ought to be
mere preliminaries for Major League Soccer's anticipated D.C.
United-Los Angeles Galaxy showdown in the Oct. 25 title game.
</P>
<P>
   United, winner of the first two MLS Cups, and the Galaxy are
expected to face off at the Rose Bowl, but Milutinovic's inclusion
in the process as new coach of the New York/New Jersey MetroStars
has suddenly made the improbable seem possible.
</P>
<P>
   The former U.S. national team coach, who has guided four nations
to the World Cup's second round, is famed for his ability to
succeed in tournament play under difficult confines. He finds
himself in that position with the Metros, whose talent and
accomplishment this season suggest anything but an MLS power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to have good results,'' says Milutinovic, whose team
which opens Eastern Conference play tonight in Columbus wants to
emulate the Colorado Rapids, who made a stunning playoff run to
last year's final. ``The main plan is to try to be champion. It
will not be easy ... but it is not impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   D.C. and the Galaxy, both 24-8 during the regular season, are
the favorites, but the expansion Chicago Fire also appear capable
of winning the crown.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the first-round series:
</P>
<P>
   WESTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy (24-8, 68 points) vs. Dallas Burn (15-17, 37): Cobi Jones
(19), Welton (17) and Mauricio Cienfuegos (13) have totaled more
goals than the entire Dallas squad (43), and L.A.'s defense led by
Robin Fraser also was the league's best. The Burn, who shutout the
Galaxy twice in last year's first-round sweep, need exceptional
play from goalkeeper Mark Dodd and defender Chad Deering. Season
series: Galaxy, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (20-12, 56) vs. Colorado (16-16, 44): The expansion Fire
are solid everywhere, in defense (goalkeeper Zach Thornton had
eight shutouts, Lubos Kubik is the defender of the year
frontrunner), in midfield (MVP hopeful Peter Nowak) and up front
(emergence of Ante Razov and Josh Wolff). They'll be without Jorge
Campos he wasn't getting much playing time, so he returned to
Mexico on Monday (with MLS's blessing) to play for Pumas UNAM. The
Rapids have won five of six and count on midfielder Ross Paule,
defender Marcelo Balboa and forward Wolde Harris. Season series:
Chicago, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   EASTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United (24-8, 58) vs. Miami (15-17, 35): United is loaded,
with Marco Etcheverry, Jaime Moreno, John Harkes and Roy Lassiter,
but the Fusion won the last two meetings and have played some
inspired soccer since Ivo Wortmann took over as head coach in July.
Carlos Valderrama has been spotty for Miami this year, but Diego
Serna has emerged as a top striker. D.C. may be without Moreno
(bruised shoulder) and Tony Sanneh (strained groin) for the opener.
Season series: 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus (15-17, 45) vs. New York/New Jersey (15-17, 39): The
Crew have a superb attack featuring forwards Stern John (26 goals)
and Brian McBride (10) and creative midfielders Brian Maisonneuve
and Andy Williams, but they haven't been able to translate that to
wins. Columbus, which may be without Maisonneuve (sprained ankle),
has lost its last five. The Metros lost six in succession before a
shootout victory in Milutinovic's debut last weekend. Season
series: 2-2.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sharp exchange with senators, the Joint Chiefs
of Staff said Tuesday that pet military projects sought by House
Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, and
Congress' refusal to close unnecessary bases, are weakening the
nation's defense.
</P>
<P>
   The four-star admirals and generals who testified before the
Senate Armed Services Committee usually engage in a mutual
admiration contest with the lawmakers who oversee the military. If
the nation's top officers ever harbor gripes about their legislator
patrons, they usually express them in private.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, even though they did not mention congressional
leaders by name, the military brass took aim at a famously fat
piece of Air Force spending that benefits their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   They were provoked into a round of defensive recriminations with
the military's staunchest supporters on Capitol Hill. In volley
after volley, senators accused the Joint Chiefs of misleading
Congress earlier this year about the seriousness of problems that
are eroding the armed forces' fighting ability.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans and some Democrats on the committee accused
the Chiefs of sugar-coating problems like pilot shortages and
training cuts seven months ago, then reversing themselves Tuesday
by saying that the same shortcomings endangered the combat
readiness of American forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that you were not candid to this member in the
problems and challenges that we faced,'' complained Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., a decorated Navy pilot who spent more than five
years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Momentarily stunned, the Chiefs responded by saying that they
had been warning lawmakers for months, even years, of the failings,
and that the situation had worsened since they last testified.
Moreover, they noted, the problems would not be so bad if Congress
would let the Defense Department close unneeded bases and stop
forcing it to buy planes and ships it does not need.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they said, Congress in the past three years has
bought 20 C-130 transport planes for $1 billion that the Air Force
hasn't requested. The planes were built in Gingrich's district in
Marietta, Ga., and many were then stationed at bases in
Mississippi, Lott's home state.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gingrich nor Lott were mentioned by name when the
C-130's came up Tuesday, but the aircraft are the stuff of military
pork legend. ``Not only were the planes added,'' said Gen. Michael
Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff, ``but then we're told where to
put them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, chimed
in with another suggestion that put military needs over domestic
politics. He said that if Congress would approve two new rounds of
base closings, the Pentagon could save an additional $21 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That would be enough for 450 new strike fighters, 12 warships or
650 Comanche helicopters, he said. ``We support closing additional
bases,'' said Shelton, who did not single out any installations.
</P>
<P>
   The angry exchanges came just two weeks after the nation's top
military commanders warned President Clinton about growing fiscal
strains on the armed services. A week after the grim report,
Clinton proposed giving the Pentagon an immediate new infusion of
between $1 billion and $4 billion, and promised to consider a much
larger increase in military spending in 2000. The Pentagon's budget
is $271 billion for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's offer helped diffuse a growing chorus of complaints
from Republicans who accuse the administration of taxing the
military with an increasing number of overseas missions.
</P>
<P>
   But even the chiefs said Tuesday that the short-term infusion,
while helpful, does not address chronic problems, from replacing
aging equipment to recruiting and retaining qualified troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force, for instance, is short 700 pilots. The Army's
budget for new weapons is at the lowest level since 1959. And the
Navy's serious aircraft accident rate increased 82 percent from a
year ago, partly because the Navy is pushing its crews so hard,
said Adm. Jay Johnson, chief of naval operations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Republicans were confounded why the chiefs had not issued these
same dire warnings when they testified individually in February and
March, especially since Republicans and many independent experts
had been flagging dangerous signs that combat readiness was wearing
thin.
</P>
<P>
   Had the chiefs confirmed the Republicans worst fears about
eroding readiness then, congressional aides said later, the
criticisms would have been invaluable fodder to use against the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans' frustration echoed in question after question. Many
recited testimony the chiefs gave in February, describing the
readiness problem as tight but not terrible.
</P>
<P>
   McCain attacked Shelton's explanation that the military was
caught off guard by this year's seemingly unending stream of crises
requiring U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Shelton, did you think that Saddam Hussein was going
to join the Boy Scouts?'' McCain said. ``Did you think we were
going to leave Bosnia within a year?''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said they were taken aback by Shelton's two main
financing priorities: fixing the military's retirement system and
closing the pay gap between military personnel and civilians with
similar training _ at a total estimated cost of at least $40
billion over five years. Senators said neither was raised as a
serious concern earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   As senators came closer and closer to calling the chiefs liars,
the officers, their integrity challenged, bristled. ``For four
years, I've come here and told you exactly what our problems were,
didn't pull a punch and got my butt chewed out sometimes,'' said
Gen. Charles Krulak, the Marine Corps commandant.
</P>
<P>
   But the senators did not give an inch. At the end of the
bruising 4-1/2 hour hearing, senators lectured the chiefs to be
more outspoken in the budgetary battles to preserve readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a war,'' said Sen. Robert Smith, R-N.H. ``You're
battlefield commanders. You have to be commanders rather than
bureaucrats.''

CONTRACEPTIVE INSURANCE BILL HITS STUMBLING BLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Antiabortion lawmakers in Congress have thrown up a
last-minute roadblock to a measure that would make government
insurance plans pay the costs of prescription contraceptives for
federal workers.
</P>
<P>
   Passed in slightly different versions by the House and Senate
this summer, the legislation has been a high priority for women's
advocacy groups and is designed not only to get the insurance to an
estimated 2 million federal workers, but also to nudge private
health plans to provide substantially more coverage for
contraceptives than they do now.
</P>
<P>
   But some antiabortion legislators and lobbyists, arguing that
some contraceptives are in fact ``abortifacients,'' or
abortion-inducing drugs and devices, are trying to get the
conference committee to kill the measure rather than resolve the
minor differences between the House and Senate bills.
</P>
<P>
   The issue and the antiabortion strategy have deadlocked the
negotiations on the Treasury Department-Postal Service spending
bill, which contains the contraceptive-coverage measure. Conferees
gave up Monday night after a long session, several inconclusive
votes, and no deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely extraordinary,'' said Representative Nita
Lowey, a New York Democrat who sponsored the bill in the House and
attended Monday's meeting. ``We're talking about basic health-care
coverage for women, we're talking about a measure that passed both
houses. Yet the Republican leadership is going to great lengths to
strip out this amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, five GOP House members on the conference
committee sent a letter to Representative Jim Kolbe of Arizona,
chairman of the Approrprations subcommittee that handled the bill,
asserting ``this language would mandate coverage of drugs and/or
devices which many believe are capable of causing abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative lawmakers urged the bill be changed to allow
any insurer to opt out for ``religious beliefs and moral
convictions.'' Supporters of the legislation say that language
loophole is large enough to render the measure meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Eight conservative senators sent a similar but stronger request
to Colorado Republican Ben Nighthorse Campbell, who chairs the
Treasury appropriations subcommittee in the Senate. ``We believe
this amendment is a precedent-setting attempt to mandate coverage
of other abortifacients,'' the letter of Sept. 4 said. ``For the
above, we believe the provision should be dropped from the
conference report.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the contraceptive-coverage provision
unanimously on a voice vote July 29. The current opposition,
including that of Oklahoma's Don Nickles, a members of the Senate
leadership, and presidential aspirants Bob Smith of New Hampshire
and John Ashcroft of Missouri, signals that some members are
concerned about a backlash from their core, conservative
constituencies but didn't want to go on record with what might have
been reported as an anti-woman vote on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Women's-rights activists say they took advantage of the huge
interest in Viagra, and the initial agreement by insurers to pay
for prescriptions of it, to press the issue of contraceptive
coverage. For years, groups such as Planned Parenthood have
complained that women are shortchanged because half of all private
insurers don't pay for the Pill or other prescription
contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling my colleagues to get real, this bill has nothing
to do with abortion,'' said Democratic Senator Harry Reid of
Nevada, an abortion-rights opponent who says he and Maine
Republican Olympia Snowe sponsored the contraceptive coverage bill
to help prevent unintended pregnancies and abortions. ``I don't
know where this is coming from, but I think it should have been
done in the daylight, not in letters to the leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops said
House leaders are ``sympathetic'' to their appeals to oppose the
contraceptive-coverage bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has changed for us,'' said Helen Alvare, a spokeswoman
for the Catholic Conference. ``We want to get rid of this measure,
and it's what we have been working hard on.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Christopher Smith, a New Jersey Republican and a
leader of antiabortion lawmakers in the House, fought the Lowey
amendment on the House floor and is central now to efforts to
substantially alter it or kill it in the conference, staffers on
the Appropriations Committee say. Smith did not respond to requests
for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Time is running out on the spending bills. Congress wants to
adjourn by the end of next week for the midterm elections, and any
appropriations bills that aren't passed by the end of this week are
likely to be rolled into one big omnibus spending bill that would
essentially fund government agencies at their current levels into
the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The fear among backers of the contraceptive-coverage measure is
that the conferees will give up and let GOP leaders in the House
and Senate decide the contents and status of the Treasury-postal
bill, which is their prerogative at the 11th hour.
</P>
<P>
   Reid says he is confident a deal can still be reached this week
to preserve the contraceptive provision. A spokesman for Snowe said
she might be willing to let Senate conferees simply accept the
House version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Anne Northup, a Kentucky Republican, said she
opposes the Lowey amendment as an unnecessary federal mandate. But
she contends Democrats have successfully exploited the antiabortion
opposition to build their own momentum. ``In the end, the pro-life
community is going to have to choose its priorities,'' Northup
said, ``and this is probably one fight they will have to set
aside.''

GENE STUDIES FIND KEY TO RARE ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have found a gene defect that causes a rare, lethal
disease in boys, rendering them helpless to attack from a virus
that most people harbor harmlessly.
</P>
<P>
   By adulthood, about 90 percent of adults have become chronically
infected with the Epstein-Barr Virus, or EBV, which lives in the
immune system of most adults without causing trouble, though in
adolescence or later it can cause infectious mononucleosis.
</P>
<P>
   But about one in a million boys inherits a mutant form of the
newly discovered gene _ a gene for a protein that acts as an
important on-off switch for a part of the immune system, say
researchers at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center who are reporting the find this week. Working
independently, a large collaboration of European laboratories also
found the gene.
</P>
<P>
   The immune disease it causes is called X-linked
lymphoproliferative syndrome, or XLP. ``X-linked'' means the gene
is on the X, or female, chromosome and it is inherited by boys from
their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   The boys with the damaged gene are so sensitive to the
Epstein-Barr virus that when they encounter it _ usually after the
age of 2 1/2 _ the immune system often unleashes a violent but
ineffective response that succeeds only in ravaging the liver, bone
marrow and other organs. When it doesn't result in that kind of
acute reaction, the virus can trigger a deadly cancer, lymphoma, in
susceptible youths. No one born with XLP syndrome lives beyond age
40.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they have discovered the single flawed gene _ dubbed
SH2D1A _ scientists hope to find out just how it makes the
difference between holding EBV harmlessly at bay in most people and
allowing it to send the immune system into an unregulated frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the discovery, by Cox Terhorst, chief of the
division of immunology at Beth Israel Deaconess in Boston, his
co-author Joan Sayos, and others is to appear in Thursday's issue
of the journal Nature. Terhorst said the gene is an important
player in a cell-signaling system that normally keeps the immune
system in check.
</P>
<P>
   The protein made by the gene is known as SAP, and it turns out
to be a natural inhibitor of the immune response. When it's
defective, or mutant, SAP can't bind to, and inhibit, another
protein called SLAM, that sits on the surface of immune B-cells and
T-cells and signals them to proliferate and go on the attack.
Without the inhibiting protein, SLAM's signals continue unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, the response to these EBV-infected cells probably
goes out of control, and that's why the boys die,'' said Terhorst
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery explains ``how it is that almost all of us live
with the EBV virus, and it's quite remarkable that more of us''
aren't devastated by it, said Terhorst.
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary accompanying the report in Nature, researchers
George Klein and Eva Klein of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden
wrote that the finding ``may improve the diagnosis of a severe but
enigmatic disease with variable manifestations, and it may in time
lead to treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   Such treatments might include gene therapy, suggest the authors
of a commentary accompanying the report by the Europeans in the
journal Nature Genetics Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that a correctly functioning version of the SH2D1A
gene could be inserted into the blood cells of a patient with XLP
syndrome, said the authors. That approach was suggested by Dr.
Michel Sadelain of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in
New York and Dr. Elliott Kieff of Brigham and Women's Hospital and
Harvard Medical School.

GARCIAPARRA PUTS THE QUIET ON CLEVELAND CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The man hates to talk about his own work. Ask him to
comment on it and he might volley a question of his own back to
you. Like: ``Can you ask me about something else?'' And you know
what that means, don't you? Simply translated: Don't ask me
anything if you can help it.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra plays shortstop for the Red Sox. He likes to
obsessively tug on his batting gloves before each at-bat. He likes
to play jokes on his teammates. He likes to talk about hip-hop and
soccer. He does not enjoy looking into camera lenses and talking
about the way he plays baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday at Jacobs Field, Garciaparra made more than 45,000
Indians fans behave like him. One moment, everyone here was buzzing
during Game 1 of the Sox-Indians Division Series. The next, not
many Ohioans had anything to say. They went from gabby participants
to silent observers in one motion. And this is how they got there:
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth inning _ with John Valentin on second base and
Damon Buford on first _ Garciaparra took the first pitch he saw
from Jaret Wright and knocked it 373 feet over the left-field wall.
You know how uncomfortably quiet it gets in a room when someone
says something inappropriate? That's how it was here after the
Garciaparra home run. Except, fittingly, the shortstop didn't say
anything. He just did it. People in Cleveland didn't appreciate it.
Suddenly, the score was 6-0. That might not be so bad when you are
facing an average American League pitcher with an earned run
average near 5, but the Indians had to deal with Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The game was over then, unofficially. By the end of the
afternoon, Mo Vaughn would have seven RBIs and Garciaparra four.
The Sox would end a 13-game postseason losing streak with an 11-3
win. Garciaparra, though, would continue a streak that has lasted
longer than the 30-game hitting streak he had as a rookie and, for
that matter, the 56-gamer Joe DiMaggio had in 1941. Once again, he
looked at the talkers and wondered why they had so much to talk
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you tell me about your homer?'' someone shouted from the
crowd, a crowd littered with cameras, microphones, and recording
devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit it over the fence,'' Garciaparra replied.
</P>
<P>
   It went like that for 10 or 15 minutes. The answers were
efficient. Direct. Sometimes sarcastic. He did acknowledge that
``there was some anxiety'' before his first career postseason game.
But he wanted to hear nothing of the 13-game losing streak that
dated to 1986. He was asked how he dealt with such talk of extended
losing streaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we don't say that,'' he snapped. ``You do.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra doesn't say much at all. He is a doer. That is why
Mike Hargrove fears him. The Indians manager has been known to flip
on local talk radio while driving home. He has also been known to
call all-sports stations and complain about their critiques of him.
Maybe he will listen tonight to the talkers to see if they have any
suggestions on how to pitch Garciaparra, the nontalker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd rather not pitch to them at all,'' Hargrove was saying
about Garciaparra and Vaughn. But he explained that throwing the
ball was necessary because the two sluggers kept coming up with men
on base. ``We didn't have anywhere to put them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If someone must talk about baseball, that is the kind of
dialogue Garciaparra likes to hear. He tells you that he would
rather focus on the men who got on base before him, enabling him to
do his job. He says the 11 RBIs from the Nos. 3 and 4 hitters
wouldn't have been possible without the work of Darren Lewis and
John Valentin. He wants to know why people don't talk about that.
And why do they mention All-Star teams? (For the record, he thinks
All-Star teams are senseless in team sports so, no, he is not
bothered that Hargrove picked Omar Vizquel to represent the AL in
July instead of him.)
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the park Tuesday, a man tapped Garciaparra on the
shoulder. It was Vaughn's father, Leroy. The men smiled and hugged.
It was all that needed to be said.

WILLIAMS, MARTINEZ GO EYE TO EYE IN SEVENTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Stare. It was a vintage heavyweight stare, there
on the mound in the seventh inning, a stare seldom seen in baseball
between a pitcher and his manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Stare. In boxing, it is always a macho move _ who will blink
first? _ but in baseball, it is a look into the soul. Did Pedro
Martinez have anything left?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy (Williams) was going to get him (out of the game),'' said
Red Sox catcher Scott Hatteberg, who was as close as referee Mills
Lane ever was to The Stare. ``Pedro was definitely showing he
wanted to stay in the game. And Pedro was going to have a little
talk with (Williams) if he wanted to take him out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stare. Pedro Martinez might as well have been Evander
Holyfield and Jimy Williams could have been Mike Tyson, Martinez's
stare was so intense. Williams said later that he could tell by
looking into Martinez's eyes that the pitcher had more than enough
fortitude to stay in the game, even with runners on second and
third after a shaky stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's normally my look when I'm pitching,'' Martinez said
after wrapping up the Red Sox' 11-3 rout of the Cleveland Indians
Tuesday in the opener of their best-of-five Division Series.``I'm
normally very intense when I'm pitching. But (The Stare) wasn't
anything bad; it was just, `Let me stay in. I can do it. I know I
can do it.' And (Williams) did. He understood what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, long after game's end, long after Martinez had told the
gaggle of media how much it meant for him to win his postseason
debut with a seven-inning, six-hit, three-run, no-walk,
eight-strikeout performance, the Red Sox ace walked back into the
locker room and headed right to the manager's office.
</P>
<P>
   There pitcher and manager relived The Stare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy just told me that `when I looked into your eyes, I knew
you could do it,''' recounted Martinez. ``He said, `I came to take
you out,' but he left me in the game, and that made me feel good
that he had so much confidence in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston was leading, 8-3, at the time, and the crisis was not
that severe. Still, Martinez had given up a home run to Jim Thome
in the inning, and after a wild pitch on a strikeout allowed Travis
Fryman to reach first, Brian Giles had doubled on a bouncer over Mo
Vaughn's glove down the right-field line. The situation was getting
sticky.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the conference at the mound and The Stare. Martinez
(``It really motivated me to hear Jimy say he knew I could do it'')
promptly induced Sandy Alomar to lift a soft foul pop to Vaughn at
first and escaped the inning when Omar Vizquel hit a soft liner to
Nomar Garciaparra at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   The Stare was emblematic of Martinez's desire to live up to his
reputation in his first playoff game. Once Vaughn hit a three-run
homer in the first, Martinez never was in danger. ``It was great to
know you were ahead already and you have the advantage,'' he said.
``Then it's up to you to get the ball over and make the right
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but not so fast, said Hatteberg. It might be great to jump
to a 3-0 lead in the first inning, but then your starting pitcher
has to make sure his first inning is clean so the advantage is not
immediately lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people realize how important that is,'' said
Hatteberg of Martinez going 1-2-3 through the Indians in the first
after Vaughn's homer and again dispatching Clevelaand 1-2-3 in the
fifth after Garciaparra's three-run homer in the top of the inning
gave Boston a 6-0 lead. ``Jaret Wright got pounded in the first. He
gave up a homer in the first and we scored some runs and then we
come out on the field and get 'em 1-2-3. He barely has time to get
water and catch his breath and he's back on the mound. It's the
best thing: score some runs and then go right at 'em when they're
up.''
</P>
<P>
   As for pregame butterflies, ``I didn''t think Pedro was nervous
at all,'' said Hatteberg. ``If he was, he was hiding it pretty
well. Right out of the gate, he was throwing steam.'' Martinez
repeated the mantra of Williams and the entire team that a playoff
game ``is just like a regular game.'' Of course, it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I told you before, I would have to wait until (Tuesday)''
to see what pitching in the postseason would be like, said Marinez.
``And I did. And it was no different. I think the butterflies were
gone in my early days in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But when he was back in the Red Sox locker room, he was
whistling and shouting in joy, ``My day's over now.''
</P>
<P>
   The day was not perfect, since Martinez had to stay away from
one of his out pitches _ the changeup _ ``after I threw one to
Kenny Lofton (in the fourth) and he screamed it into center field.
Then I kind of had an idea they were aware of my changeup and I
needed to switch to something else and go about it differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez mixed his fastball and breaking ball for 121 pitches,
and most important, he issued no walks even though he went to a 3-2
count six times and a 3-1 count once. Once the Red Sox took the
lead, he said, ``I didn't want to walk anyone. It looks bad for a
veteran pitcher (with the lead) to be walking people to get away
from the long ball and stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   So he went right after the Indians, ``and they did hit them out
a couple of times. But I don't regret it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez had passed his first postseason test, and
certainly, there was no regret in that.
</P>
<P>
   Nor in The Stare. It was the look of a heavyweight.

POLLY KLAAS' LEGACY: `THERE ARE KIDS WHO WILL BE SAVED'

 By BLEYS W. ROSE The Press Democrat in Santa Rosa, Calif.   c.1998
N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Polly Klaas' disappearance from her bedroom in Petaluma, Calif.,
during a slumber party five years ago ignited a massive nationwide
search that ended two months later with the discovery of the
12-year-old's body near an abandoned sawmill.
</P>
<P>
   Her killer, an ex-con with a history of kidnapping women, was
caught and convicted, but the stunning nature of the crime _ a
stranger snatching a child from her home _ continues to reverberate
in law enforcement agencies across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying spurred a series of reforms in the criminal justice
system, including changes in how authorities handle missing
children cases and the enactment of tough new laws for dealing with
repeat offenders, especially those who prey on children. Polly's
death also created an explosion in the public's awareness of sex
offenders living in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been lots and lots of changes and all for the
good,'' said Polly's mother, Eve Nichol. ``There is no question
that there will be kids who will be saved because of them. There is
no better memorial to my Polly.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, police immediately enlist the help of the media and
volunteer search organizations when they believe a child has been
kidnapped. They also use the Internet to quickly disseminate
information.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to the public reaction and political furor over the
kidnapping, about 30 states in the nation will soon have
legislation mandating prison for repeat offenders. In California,
there are now about 4,100 repeat offenders in prison primarily
because of the state's ``three strikes'' law, which mandates
25-year to life sentences for three-time felons.
</P>
<P>
   A year after Polly was killed, 7-year-old Megan Kanka was slain
in New Jersey by a neighbor with a history of abusing children. The
public outcry to both killings led almost every state to pass laws
requiring that police notify communities of sex offenders living in
their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Since his daughter's death, Marc Klaas has devoted his life to
protecting children; he says things have improved in the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much greater community awareness because Petaluma set
the standard,'' he said. ``One huge step is that the FBI is more
than willing to get involved and they have agents in every field
office trained in the protocol. But, traveling around the country I
see many police agencies that are still not equipped to deal with a
Polly Klaas case, there is still a reluctance to believe a stranger
did this to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the kidnapping exposed flaws in the flow of information
in the criminal justice system, state government and local agencies
moved to fill in the gaps. California lawmakers made complete
criminal records more accessible to different agencies. And Sonoma
County police agencies closed a hole in their radio communications
that had prohibited the news of the kidnapping from being sent
beyond Petaluma.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case has made it clear to an entire generation of law
enforcement that you don't let anything go unexamined, that you
give the case appropriate treatment when a kid is abducted,'' said
Greg Jacobs, the assistant District Attorney who prosecuted the
case. ``Every law enforcement officer has in the back of his mind
what happened in the Polly Klaas case.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened was that Richard Allen Davis slipped through the
back door of the Klaas' home and kidnapped Polly from her room,
where she had been having a slumber party with two friends.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI compared the search for Polly to that conducted for the
kidnapped child of Charles Lindbergh. Five million flyers were
issued, pairing Polly's face with a sketch of the suspect that
turned out to be strikingly accurate.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour after Polly disappeared, Davis was caught
trespassing about 25 miles away on wooded private property on the
outskirts of Santa Rosa and his car was searched by Sonoma County
deputies. But notice of the kidnapping had not been broadcast to
the deputies and Davis was released since property owner Dana Jaffe
did not want to prosecute and the officers could find no reason to
hold him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all missing children reports and suspect descriptions are
issued on all radio channels, regardless of jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 19, Davis was stopped again, this time by California
Highway Patrol officers and jailed for drunken driving. However, he
was released after pleading guilty because the state's criminal
computer did not show any outstanding warrants. The system has
since been modernized to provide up-to-date information on parole
violations and previous records.
</P>
<P>
   The break in the case came Nov. 28 when Jaffe called police
after finding clothing and personal items not far from the spot
where Davis had been questioned by deputies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for Dana Jaffe checking her property to see that wood
cutters had cleared brush properly, this might have gone down in
history as an unsolved crime and I don't know if Davis would ever
have been caught,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   After checking their files and reviewing Davis' record as a
burglar and twice-convicted kidnapper, authorities were able to
locate him at his sister's home at the Coyote Valley Indian
Reservation. He was arrested on a parole violation on Nov. 30,
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, Davis called for Mike Meese, the Petaluma
police officer heading the investigation, and confessed. He then
led authorities to the girl's body.
</P>
<P>
   A study commissioned by the Justice Department in 1994 and
conducted by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children
said from 3,200 to 4,600 children a year may be victims of stranger
abductions. That's a small percentage of the estimated 495,000
children that the center said are runaways, abandoned, or are
abducted by family members.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jacobs and other law enforcement officials now
acknowledge that several weeks passed before they accepted that
Polly was kidnapped by a stranger. Most child kidnappings result
from custody fights or domestic disputes and are committed by a
family member, a common thread that until the Klaas case largely
determined the course of police reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Davis case became the worst case scenario in a child
kidnapping and now everyone excepts that as the norm,'' said Davis'
attorney, Barry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Meese, the officer who handled Polly's case, said her legacy is
that law enforcement now takes a much closer look at how they
handle missing children cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI now has a much closer involvement with local law
enforcement and even developed a protocol for handling cases based
on this kidnapping. This case demonstrated that cooperation between
agencies can work if they set aside their parochial agendas.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we now have an awareness of child safety that we did not
have before Polly Klaas,'' he said.

A DIRECTOR WITH AN EVOLVING CLASSICAL LEXICON  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VALERIE GLADSTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Kudelka walked through the corridors of American Ballet
Theater's headquarters on lower Broadway in Manhattan as if he
belonged there. Although he became artistic director of the
National Ballet of Canada in 1996, his many years as a freelance
choreographer make him feel at home with troupes all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he came down from Toronto to coach Ballet Theater's
second ensemble, the Studio Company, and to make final arrangements
for his troupe's one-week engagement at City Center, which begins
Tuesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kudelka began with James Crescent and Isaac Stappas, who were
learning his piece ``Passage.'' Regarding them intently from behind
his round, steel-rim spectacles, he looked like a mathematics
professor trying to figure out a difficult equation. ``Be more
fluid coming into the arabesque from the deep plie,'' he
instructed, as the plaintive chords of the taped accompaniment
filled the room. They tried again. It was clear he would correct
them until they got both the steps and the emotion just right. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't demonstrate the way I once did,'' explained Kudelka,
who is 43. ``I remember seeing articles about the search for a cure
for back pain when I was a young dancer and never believing I'd
suffer.'' He winced. ``It's the strain. I suspected that running a
company would be like creating a full-length ballet every day _ and
it is. Sometimes the responsibility for so many people's lives
weighs me down. I used to be in psychotherapy to talk about myself.
Now I spend most of my sessions discussing human relationships.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kudelka wanted the job. ``I was tired of spending so much
of my life in hotel rooms making up short ballets,'' he said. ``All
that responsibility without any authority. I wanted to impose my
vision.''
</P>
<P>
   When his 45-member company performs this week, he hopes his
vision will be apparent. It has been 10 years since its last visit.
``I strongly believe in the traditions of classical dance,'' he
explained, ``but I'm trying to animate them and move the language
forward. That's what people should see.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, foreign talent gave the National Ballet name
recognition _ the works of the English choreographer Frederick
Ashton and the American choreographer Glen Tetley, the performances
of Rudolf Nureyev and the leadership of the Danish dancer Erik
Bruhn.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1951 by the English dancer Celia Franca, it still
carries on the English tradition of story ballets, although
abstract works increasingly enter the repertory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the National can also be appreciated for its Canadian
character,'' Kudelka said. Although his father came from Hungary,
his mother was Canadian, and they made their home, with his six
siblings, on a dairy farm in Newmarket, Ontario, outside Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian created every ballet the company presents in New
York, and almost all of its members are homegrown. Four
high-profile dancers, including Vladimir Malakhov and Robert
Tewsley, left to follow Kudelka's predecessor, Reid Anderson, to
his new position as director of the Stuttgart Ballet. But Kudelka
doesn't begrudge him their defection. ``Reid has always been a
wonderful mentor and friend,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kudelka's long choreographic career began when he was 13 and a
student at the National Ballet's school. ``Even then,'' said
Christopher House, the artistic director of Toronto Dance Theater,
``James showed incredible facility and imagination.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He continued to create works throughout the years he performed
with the National Ballet and the experimental Les Grands Ballets
Canadiens. At both companies, he eventually also held the position
of artist in residence. His reputation grew with each new piece. He
received commissions from the San Francisco Ballet, Boston Ballet,
American Ballet Theater, the Toronto Dance Theater and from the
soloists Margie Gillis and Peggy Baker. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Upon becoming artistic director of the National Ballet, Kudelka
joined the elite group of well-known choreographers who run
companies. The short list includes John Neumeier at the Hamburg
Ballet, Jiri Kylian at Netherlands Dance Theater and William
Forsythe at Frankfurt Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``James is an artist through and through; he sees everything in
terms of art,'' said Valerie Wilder, the National Ballet's
executive director. Greta Hodgkinson, a principal dancer, agreed,
``He has already been wonderfully thought provoking for the
dancers. James makes us hear music in new ways.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The programs at City Center show Kudelka's breadth. They feature
six New York premieres, four of them by him, with the others by
John Alleyne, artistic director of Ballet British Columbia and
Dominique Dumais, a National Ballet soloist.
</P>
<P>
   Kudelka's pieces are ``Musings'' to a Mozart quintet (1991),
``The Four Seasons'' to the well-known Vivaldi score (1997),
``Desir'' to Prokofiev waltzes (1991) and ``Washington Square,''
based on Henry James' novella, to music by Michael Conway Baker
(1979). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These ballets contain Kudleka's trademarks: complicated
classical footwork, free use of the arms, intricate, convoluted
stage patterns and psychological depth. They synthesize the many
styles he danced, classical and modern, during his performing
years.
</P>
<P>
   The themes of love, romance, death and sex pervade them all. ``I
commission James,'' said Kevin McKenzie, artistic director of
Ballet Theater, ``because he is a superb choreographer, but also
because I like his dark side.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now a bright side, evident in the spirited ``Four Seasons,''
complements that dark side. Last year, Kudelka choreographed a
joyful ``Nutcracker.'' In May, his version of ``Swan Lake'' will
have its premiere in Toronto. ``I don't do things only for myself
anymore,'' he said, ``I do them for the company.''

MORE US COMPANIES EXPECTED TO FEEL OVERSEAS WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Once investors saw consumer-products companies as a
good bet in hard times, but Gillette Co.'s announcement Monday that
it plans to lay off 4,700 workers is a sign that the rules have
changed _ and a sign that problems overseas are hitting home.
</P>
<P>
   According to conventional wisdom, people buy items such as
razors, laundry detergent, and soda even in a recession.
</P>
<P>
   And for that reason, companies like Boston-based Gillette;
Coca-Cola Co.; and Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., maker of Tide, Pampers,
and Charmin toilet paper, have often fared better during tough
times than cyclical industries such as steel or semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not anymore. That's because Gillette is now as likely to
sell razors in Russia as in Boston. And P&AMP;G gets about do 10
percent of its $37 billion in annual sales from in Asia, said
Edward Jones analyst Tony Vento, who follows both companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a leap in Brazilian interest rates or the fall of
the Russian ruble can hurt such companies.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G and and Gillette went overseas for a simple reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the growth is,'' said economist Ezra Greenberg of
Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, a Lexington, Mass. forecasting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Gillette. For the last five years, profits grew about 11
percent annually from sales in the United States, Canada, and
Western Europe. For the rest of the world, annual profit growth was
running at about 20 percent _ until recently.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason for that difference in growth. Many American
men are already willing to spend a dollar or more on a razor-blade
cartridge. But many Russians still shave with 8-cent razor blades.
As a result, there's a greater opportunity for profits as Gillette
seeks to persuade Russians to trade up and buy more expensive
blades.
</P>
<P>
   However, with the ruble heading south, Gillette's Russian sales
are falling. Duplicate this pattern over many emerging markets, and
a result is that the overseas profit growth that Gillette once
enjoyed ``isn't there'' this year, said Gillette spokesman David
Fausch.
</P>
<P>
   A slump in foreign markets, along with the costs of launching
the Mach3 razor, led Gillette to warn Monday that third-quarter
profits will be lower than expected &UR;  &LR; after 32 quarters of
double-digit gains. The warning came as a bit of a shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a surprise they're continuing to have problems; it's
the magnitude,'' said analyst Vento, who added, ``It's worse than
we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillette issued its warning Monday after the stock market
closed. On the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday, shares fell 2 3/8
to close at 37 5/8 on heavy trading of 15.2 million shares. Since
July, Gillette shares have lost 40 percent of their value.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gillette's assurance that sales of Mach3 are going
``gangbusters,'' some analysts aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a real sense yet of how successful or
unsuccessful the Mach3 is going to be,'' said analyst Robert
Izmirlian of Standard &AMP; Poor's Equity Group. ``I'm not so sure
people want to spend $6 and change for four (razor) blades.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillette insists that its layoff announcement is unrelated to
problems in Asia, Russia, and Brazil. A plan to reorganize and
streamline the company has long been in the works, Fausch said. &UR;  &LR; 
Nevertheless, economists expect that Gillette's announcement of
layoffs is only among the first of many. Analyst Vento, for one,
expects P&AMP;G to announce some layoffs soon.
</P>
<P>
   And over the next six months, layoffs in Massachusetts could
approach the thousands as various companies feel the effects of
overseas turmoil, said Rachael Chioino, a regional economist for
Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to companies such as Gillette, she said, ``Exports have
been rising rapidly _ almost explosively for the last few years _
and that market has been pulled out from under a lot of companies
that have been riding that export boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Two more US companies joined Gillette Tuesday and said they
expect to be hurt by overseas problems. One was Goodyear Tire &AMP;
Rubber Co.; the other was RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Near term _ the next six to 12 months _ things will be
tough,'' Vento said of Gillette. ``But the basic long-term
fundamentals of the company remain the same.''

 By MICHAEL WINERIP   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ In 1996, Canton's newspaper, The Repository,
endorsed Bill Clinton for president. It was not an easy call for
editorial board members. For much of its history, The Repository
has had a Republican slant. At the endorsement meeting, while
editors praised the president's economic and welfare overhaul
policies and called him courageous for standing up to the gun and
tobacco lobbies, they also fretted over ``the character issue,''
``the womanizer,'' ``the guy involved in Whitewater.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frightened,'' David Kaminski said to his fellow editors
that day in late October 1996, ``that we will be embarrassed as a
newspaper if we endorse Clinton and have a huge scandal break
out.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, of course, is exactly what happened. Fifteen months
later, as details of the investigation into the relationship
between the president and former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
came spilling out, Kaminski, the Repository editor, and his fellow
board members began to seethe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was growing more and more disgusted with the fact that his
sexual relationship was part of a national discourse,'' said
Kaminski. ``I have a 12- and 15-year-old and they're quite aware
that the president is accused of awful things.''
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Beck, the editorial page editor, who describes herself as
``moderate to liberal'' feminist said, ``I was so upset, I could
not bring myself to editorialize about the dress _ I found it so
offensive that we as a nation had to think about it, so I didn't
mention it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Starr report became public, ``we were simply
appalled,'' said Kaminski. ``Our patience broke. I read excerpts
from The AP midafternoon on the computer. It put us over the
edge.'' That evening of Sept. 11, the newspaper that had
twice-endorsed Clinton composed an editorial beginning with the
words: ``President Clinton ought to resign. He has destroyed his
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the two weeks since, it has become clear to The
Repository's top editors that they are out of step with their
community on this one. This is a political bellwether, a place that
votes as America does for president, that swung to the Republican
presidents during the 1980s and to Clinton in the 1990s, and from
extensive interviewing here it is clear that people strongly
support the president. Even right after the Starr report was
issued, when the sentiment against Clinton was most heated, calls
to the newspaper's response line favored the president's remaining
in office; that first weekend, 56 percent of the 674 callers
opposed impeachment. ``I even hear it from my mother,'' said
Michael Hanke, the newspaper's general manager. ``She's never
talked about the news business in her life and she tells me,
`That's HIS business, ''' referring to the president's private
life.
</P>
<P>
   It is the ordinary people of Stark County, not the political
elite, who are behind the support for the president. Just as there
is a division between Americans living inside and outside the
Washington Beltway, there is a split here in Stark between
community leaders and the general population that goes beyond
Republican and Democratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   The people who run the newspaper and the judicial system, the
nonprofit agencies and the schools, tend to be much more concerned
with the implications of a politician like Clinton lying than
mainstream Stark County residents, who often assume that lying and
evasion are the standard operating procedure for politicians.
Leaders immersed in public policy spend their lives striving to
bring order to community life; the general population lives with
the reality, the cracks, gaps, imperfections, potholes and
shortcomings of daily life.
</P>
<P>
   An example of this split in the community: Sally Efremoff is a
family court magistrate and former school board member who voted
for Clinton in 1996 because she was in agreement with his stands
for abortion and against school vouchers. She now thinks it would
be best if he resigned. ``I tell the young people who come before
me in court you shouldn't lie, you shouldn't cheat. And then they
see the president's not paying attention to this? The whole system
of justice is built on the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is not how Tom Gates, a Republican who voted for Bob
Dole in 1996 and George Bush in 1992, working the register at The
Book Shoppe in the Canton Centre mall, sees it. Gates does not
support impeachment because he feels this is more about sex than
lies, and he expects politicians to lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a politician, that's how you get into power,'' said
Gates. ``Clinton's a standard politician.'' Rita Amedeo, a
supermarket produce clerk who tends to vote Republican, although he
voted for Ross Perot in 1996, agrees. with that view. ``I hate to
see him resign or be impeached,'' she says. ``It's not that this
kind of thing hasn't happened to other presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Stark, a political swing county of 370,000 in northeastern Ohio,
has voted as America has in eight of the last nine presidential
elections. For that reason, The New York Times spent the 1996 year
writing about political and economic trends here and that November,
Stark County voters gave Clinton an 8 percentage point victory _
precisely his national margin. While there has been no scientific
polling done in Stark recently (it is too expensive for the local
paper to undertake), from six dozen interviews done here at
supermarkets, factories, a bar, a book shop, a hair salon, as well
as with community leaders ranging from Joel Cochran, minister of a
Christian Coalition church, to Rep. Ralph Regula, the moderate
Republican representing the district, to Jim Repace, president of
the union at the Hoover vacuum cleaner factory, it appears
Clinton's support is still strong.
</P>
<P>
   At GSV Design Group, a beauty salon in one of Canton's pricier
neighborhoods, the verdict one recent afternoon _ even among women
who did not support Clinton for president in 1996 _ was nearly
unanimous in his favor. Rosemary Zaremba, a housewife getting a cut
and wash, never much liked Clinton (''I can't believe I'm standing
up for him'') but does not think he should be impeached.
``Absolutely not,'' she said. ``Most men would lie in that
situation. This isn't a public issue _ I think if they said they'd
investigate all of Congress the way they did Clinton, this would be
over quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The salon owner, Sharon Vaccani, (Dole '96, Bush '92) who was
doing Ms. Zarmeba's hair, agreed, ``As Rose said, he hasn't done a
bad job as president _this isn't impeachable.'' And Toni Mikstay,
the hairdresser at the next station (Dole, `96) felt the same. ``I
don't think anything should happen to him,'' she said. ``Look, I
didn't vote for Clinton for president, I thought he was a weasel,
too shady, but this is a personal matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Katie Hanenkrut (Perot `96) interrupted her shopping at a
Fishers Foods supermarket to say, ``No other president was
impeached for these doings. You can't judge someone's personal life
as long as it doesn't interfere with your work life.'' And Wendell
Skelley, a supervisor for American Electric Power, (Perot '96, Bush
'92) carrying an armful of groceries said, ``This has all been such
a waste of money and time. Quite frankly, there's an awful lot of
people in the same situation. Quite frankly, even a person you work
with could be in the same situation.''

</P>
<P>
   A majority of those interviewed see it as a personal matter and,
for guidance on how to judge it, look into their own lives and the
lives of their neighbors. There is no more respected family in
Stark County than the Timkens, who for four generations have run
the the Timken steel and bearing company, Stark's biggest employer,
with 6,800 workers here and 21,000 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Timkens are admired for working to keep good-paying union
jobs in Canton and for their local philanthropy. They are known as
rabid Republicans who donate $100,000 to the party during
presidential election years. And they are also known as a family
that has had its share of stormy marriages and painful divorces.
Last year, W. R. ``Tim'' Timken Jr., the company chairman, reached
a divorce settlement with his first wife just before the case was
to go to trial and remarried a few months later.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, Joseph Toot Jr. was divorced from one of
Timken's sisters, but continued as company president. ``People here
talk about the Timken situation, the Toot situation,'' said Repace,
head of the union at Hoover and a Clinton supporter. ``And their
attitude is `live and let live.' I think it's the same attitude you
see about the president. We're going to impeach a president because
he had an affair and didn't want to stand up and admit it? I mean,
come on.''
</P>
<P>
   Regula, a cautious, moderate Republican, who is expected to
easily win re-election to a 14th term, has not taken a stand on
impeachment. In the days after the Starr report, he says, calls to
his office were running three to one for impeachment, but the grand
jury videotape ``moderated people, you could feel a shift, and
we're not getting a lot of calls now.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, too, is helped by the economy here; when he was
elected in 1992, unemployment in Stark was about 8 percent;
currently it is 3.9 percent. Janet Weir Creighton, the county
auditor, (a Republican who thinks the president should resign) says
``our country is in great shape, our county is in great shape.''
Sales tax revenues are up 6.5 per cent over last year; the general
county debt was recently paid off; real estate values are up an
average of 18 per cent and challenges to property tax assessments
are at an all time low. ``People are happy,'' she says, ``People
are content.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a fear, expressed even by middle of the road
Republicans, that impeaching Clinton will set loose right wing
forces in the Republican Party. Nancy McPeek, a banker, a former
president of the county United Way, and a moderate Republican (Dole
'96) believes that the president should have to go through the
impeachment process, but she also worries it will make the right
wing more dominant in the party. ``If they're successful,'' she
says, ``it will give the Far Right a bigger bandstand for the
conservative approach to issues like abortion and vouchers and that
does scare me.''
</P>
<P>
   It scares Democrats even more. They are in a bad position in
Ohio, even without Clinton's problems. Republicans are favored to
win all six statewide races this year, including governor and
senator. Susan Keim, a nurse (Clinton `96 and `92) says she is fed
up hearing congressional leaders bragging that they are not going
to be paying attention to the public opinion polls as they make
their decisions on Clinton. ``I hate that,'' she said, ``I think we
count. We are the polls.'' Her husband, a Timken steelworker, said
in November, for the first time in years, ``I'm just voting
straight Democrat.''

 &HT;    CLINTON PLANS EVENT TO CELEBRATE BUDGET SURPLUS
 &HT;    690&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton plans a White House ceremony
Wednesday to trumpet the first federal budget surplus in three
decades _ and to fire the next salvo in his election-year battle
with congressional Republicans over what to do with the money.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's message from the Rose Garden will be decidedly upbeat:
In the federal fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, the government will
be out of the red for the first time since 1969, having slain a
deficit dragon that threatened the nation's economic future.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the surplus for
the 1998 budget year at $63 billion. Clinton will announce a new
White House estimate ''in the $70 billion range,'' an
administration official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was first elected in 1992 partly on a promise to
stem the flow of red ink, means to make the most of the good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's easy to imagine that if we were going to get the
first federal budget surplus in a generation, the first since 1969,
the first since people were wearing paisley bell-bottom trousers
and paisley ties, ... yes, we would want to crow upon such an
achievement,'' said White House spokesman Michael McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also ready to use the budget surplus to Democrats'
advantage in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   In fund-raising speeches in recent weeks, Clinton has claimed
that the surplus resulted from the leadership of Democrats who
understand the need to balance taxes and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans counter that the surplus is the outcome of their
1994 takeover of Congress, which under the Constitution has the
sole authority to levy taxes and spend money.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had not had welfare reform and entitlement reform and
domestic discretionary spending cuts and the tax cuts that
increased economic growth, we would still be in deficit,'' House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., asserted in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the real hero of the deficit struggle has been the economy,
Gingrich said, not either party nor the president.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can take 5 percent of the credit, we'll take 5 percent and
90 percent goes to the American people, who go to work every day
and pay taxes,'' Gingrich said. ''I don't think they're all that
impressed watching politicians run around and take credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Private economists agree with Gingrich about the origins of the
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost entirely a function of the economy doing well,''
said Patrick Fleenor, senior economist for the Tax Foundation, a
nonpartisan Washington research group. ''Revenues are coming into
the federal government at an unprecedented level.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the federal government collected an estimated $1.72
trillion in taxes and fees during the year that ends Wednesday.
That's one-fifth the value of all the nation's goods and services,
the highest proportion since at least 1962.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, contending that at least some of the surplus
should be returned to taxpayers, have approved a proposal to cut
taxes by $80 billion over the next five years, a plan Clinton has
already vowed to veto.
</P>
<P>
   Any surplus in the federal budget, Clinton has said, should be
set aside until Republicans and Democrats can develop a plan for
shoring up the Social Security program, which faces serious
financial troubles early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not against tax cuts,'' Clinton told a group of wealthy
Democrats at a fund-raiser here Monday night. ''But I do not
believe we should get into this surplus for tax cuts, or for
Democratic spending programs, until we have saved the Social
Security system for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich countered that Clinton is engaging in ''demagogic
dishonesty'' by attacking Republican-backed tax cuts while
proposing his own spending increases under the label of ``emergency
spending'' and suggesting that Republicans aren't committed to
shoring up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ought to set aside money to save Social Security. We're
prepared to do that, and he and I have been talking about it since
October of last year,'' Gingrich said. ''I think we will pass a
bill next year to save Social Security, on a bipartisan basis.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the partisan squabbling over what to do with it, a
budget surplus, after three decades of red ink, is good news for
the country, which doled out an estimated $363 billion in interest
this year simply servicing its huge debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Washington ought to be, by and large, pleased with the budget
outcomes,'' said Donald Straszheim, president of the Milken
Institute, an economic research group in Santa Monica, Calif. ''I
don't think this is a party issue. Both the House and the Senate,
and the White House, have been involved in all of the decisions of
the last 10 or 20 years'' that have helped rein in deficit
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the dirty little accounting secret that neither party is
likely to mention Wednesday is that, in the strictest sense, the
budget is still not balanced.
</P>
<P>
   This year's $70 billion surplus includes $104 billion in funds
generated by two Social Security trust funds. Technically, that
money should not be counted as government revenues. Take it away,
and the federal budget, for all the celebration Wednesday, remains
in deficit.

COMMENTARY: THE GASBAG GANG  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone knows that something big happened, but what? ``It's as
if a boil was lanced and the fever has broken,'' said Ed Markey, a
Massachusetts congressman, after the Bill Clinton grand jury video.
Yes, the country's mood about-faced that Monday _ but why?
</P>
<P>
   You've heard the media's answers: ``Scandal fatigue.'' ``The
American people just want it to go away.'' ``Clinton is a master at
television.'' ``Ken Starr and the Republicans overplayed their
hand.'' But these same catch phrases had been applied to the public
reaction to the release of the Starr report and every other scandal
``shocker'' before that. They don't explain the fallout this time,
when the country defied talking-head predictions by not only
boosting Clinton's polls yet again but by seeming to pronounce the
whole story over.
</P>
<P>
   The best explanation I've heard comes not from a journalist but
a film maker in Los Angeles. He speculated that the marathon video
was, in theatrical terms, a nine-month drama's catharsis. By being
forced ``to talk about his penis for four hours on television,'' as
my acquaintance put it, Bill Clinton did in effect receive a
punishment, just or not, that landed with the audience as if it
were a final curtain. Never ``Macbeth'' to begin with, Monicagate
had found a climax satisfying its own trashier scenario _ a
mortifying public humiliation instead of a beheading. Like any
cathartic denouement, it leaves the audience feeling relieved. It
breaks the fever.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the new mood's origins, the media are already
chastising the unwashed masses for it. ``Yes, the American people
say they've had enough of the story,'' we're instructed, ``but
there is a constitutional process that must be followed.'' Once
more ``the American people'' are being told by what Calvin Trillin
in Time labels TV's ``Sabbath Gasbags'' that they are too stupid or
amoral or selfishly prosperous to get with the program of the
Washington Establishment.
</P>
<P>
   When history looks back at this saga it will show that the
media, after initial stumbling, did get the scandal's facts
straight _ yes, ABC's Jackie Judd is vindicated, there IS The Dress
_ but that they were clueless about what they keep condescendingly
calling ``the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Film makers and other artists may yet make more sense of this
story than have the mass journalistic media. This week The New
Yorker offers intriguing thoughts on Monicagate by novelists as
various as Jane Smiley, Louis Begley, James Salter and Toni
Morrison. Stephen King has told his views to Salon. William Styron,
Guenter Grass and Gabriel Garcia Marquez have advertised theirs by
petition. But one novelist has gone so far as to write a nearly
novella-sized nonfiction narrative of the story _ so sharp that it
could bear the ironic title ``Democracy,'' in honor of Henry Adams'
archetypal Washington novel, had its author, Joan Didion, not used
it for a previous book.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Didion's must-read piece, in The New York Review of Books,
wastes little time arguing for or against Clinton, who, like Starr,
is almost a bit player in her account of the Washington
political-media culture that conveyed its war to the rest of us.
Instead she follows the gasbags _ whose sole knowledge of
``Americans at large'' comes from focus groups and ``the Q and A
after a lecture date'' _ as they turn the public into the scandal's
``unindicted co-conspirator.'' As Ms. Didion documents with
abundant specifics, the gasbags repeatedly treat Americans as
``recalcitrant children, fecklessly resistant to responsible
guidance.'' Meanwhile they exploit the nation's actual children as
moral bludgeons, constantly citing ``our kids'' as the casualties
of the President's bad example.
</P>
<P>
   As if to ratify Ms. Didion's take, Nickelodeon this week took
the radical step of having Katie Couric and Linda Ellerbee converse
with children about the scandal _ instead of treating us to more
tearful ``What will the children think?'' sermons by All Monica
commentators too busy rushing into makeup to talk to their own. The
kids, of course, knew full well what Clinton had done, but had no
loss of moral compass; they held firm that lying and adultery are
wrong even as they disdained impeachment. In other words, they
sounded just like all those stupid adults who have for nine months
refused to follow the Beltway's script _ in Washington, the real
impeachable offense.

RATE CUT HAS LITTLE IMPACT AS DOW FALLS BY 28.32 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also FED, FED-CONSUMERS) 
(mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first interest rate cut since January 1996 failed
to impress stock investors Tuesday, and the major market indexes
were narrowly mixed at the end of a fairly active session.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the bond market had a somewhat stronger reaction
and drove up prices, particularly in the long end of the market,
pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond down to
another 30-year low, to 5.09 percent. (Bond prices and their yield
move in opposite directions.)
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the Federal Reserve Board announced shortly after 2
p.m. ET Tuesday that it had voted to lower its target for the
federal funds rate, by one-quarter of a percent, to 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks, which were modestly higher early in the day, pulled back
after the Fed decision was announced, and the market see-sawed for
the rest of the day. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down
28.32 points, or nearly four-tenths of 1 percent, to 8,080.52.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poors 500 index eked out a gain of 0.33 of a
point, to close at 1,049.02. And the NASDAQ composite index fell
5.17 points, or three-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,734.05.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a rate cut has been viewed as a near certainty
since Sept. 23, when Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told
Congress that slumping economies abroad were a bigger threat to the
health of the American economy than inflation. And stock prices
staged some strong rallies for a few days after he made those
comments.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, Tuesday's announcement had an anticlimactic
element.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed never used to announce interest rate cuts like they
are doing now,'' said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G.
Edwards in St. Louis. ``We have spent the last several sessions
discounting this news.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the session had its share of surprises, and some were
unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   A number of big companies, including Goodyear Tire and Rubber,
Viacom Inc. and CBS Corp., were hit hard on concerns that
third-quarter earnings would not meet expectations. And the Fed's
rate cut failed to provide much assistance to many financial
service company stocks, despite the fact that such companies stand
to benefit directly from a reduction in borrowing costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the general earnings tone remains poor, the laundry list
of companies buying back stock has accelerated in recent days,''
said Thomas Galvin, investment strategist at Donaldson Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette. ``We may get to a point where lower rates cushion the
economy, stabilize earnings and some big- market capitalization
sectors, like the financials, technology and energy, show gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors hammered stocks that were not dispensing good news.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear, North America's largest tire maker, fell 3 3/4, to 52,
after warning that unfavorable conditions in Asia and Latin America
would cause third-quarter earnings to fall short of expectations.
The stock's drop accounted for about 25 percent of the decline in
the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Viacom Inc. fell 11 percent on concern that higher
costs at its Blockbuster Entertainment video store chain and MTV
Networks cable unit would hamper growth in third-quarter cash flow.
The company's Class B shares fell 6.88 to 56.75 in heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   CBS fell 2 1/2, to 23 1/4, on concern that cash flow growth in
its television businesses would slow due to advertising cutbacks by
General Motors in the wake of its recent strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But other companies that have previously announced a slowdown in
third-quarter earnings saw their stock prices improve. A notable
example was Coca-Cola, which rallied for the second straight day.
Coke's stock closed at 58 11/16, up 1 7/16 a share.

   ``If you are going to disappoint, the market will kill you,''
Goldman said. ``But if your outlook is better, you get rewarded.
This market is becoming much more discriminating than it was a few
weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Treasury prices rose after the Fed announcement, even though
some traders and investors had expected a cut of half a percentage
point.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury rose 22/32, to 106 7/32. The
yield of 5.09 percent was down from 5.14 percent on Monday and down
27 basis points, or hundredths of percentage points, from where it
was just three weeks ago.

THERMO NAMES NEW PRESIDENT; COMPANY TO LAY OFF 700 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Texas, Calif.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citing Asia's economic slowdown and a desire to speed a
previously announced restructuring, Thermo Electron Corp. has named
a new president and says it will lay off more than 700 employees in
three subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The high-technology conglomerate which, including its nearly two
dozen affiliates and subsidiaries, had $3.6 billion in sales last
year, will take $53 million in charges against third-quarter
earnings, mostly for severance pay.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the announced layoffs are at Thermo Instrument Systems
Inc., the Waltham, Mass. &UR;  &LR; company's largest publicly traded
subsidiary &UR;  &LR; in Franklin, Mass.. But a spokeswoman said Tuesday only
a few of those cutbacks will be in Massachusetts, with the bulk in
Texas and California or overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, George N. Hatsopoulos, Thermo Electron's chairman and
chief executive, named Arvin H. Smith, 69, chief executive of
Thermo Instrument, as the parent firm's president, effective
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Hatsopoulos, 71, said Smith will share with him previously
announced goals to shed money-losing or low-profit units, and
ultimately choose a top management team from among four candidates
promoted to co-chief operating officers in August.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Hatsopoulos said widening global
economic problems prompted the company to speed up the
restructuring that was also announced in August. Thermo Electron,
which has about 23,000 employees at operations worldwide, said then
that it intends to reduce its present 23 operating divisions and
subsidiaries to 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a business slowdown in manufacturing in the United
States, and our businesses have been hurt somewhat from the Asian
crisis,'' Hatsopoulos said. ``I wanted to accelerate the
(restructuring) process and rather than waiting a couple of years,
do it before the end of this year.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Thermo Instrument alone, with about $1 billion in sales
last year, expects about a 10 percent drop in both revenues and
earnings this year.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has been with Thermo Electron for 28 years and was already
executive vice president of the parent company. He succeeds John
Hatsopoulos, 64, George's brother, whose plans to retire also were
announced in August.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Lewis, one of the four co-chief operating officers named
then, will become chief executive at Thermo Instrument.
</P>
<P>
   George Hatsopoulos said Smith had been discussing retirement but
agreed to stay on for two to three years to complete the
restructuring and executive transition.
</P>
<P>
   Of the restructuring charges announced Tuesday, the largest
share, about $28 million, is at Thermo Instrument, which makes high
technology laboratory equipment used in the drug, biotechnical, and
other manufacturing industries.
</P>
<P>
   Other cutbacks are planned at ThermoLase, a unit of publicly
traded ThermoTrex that operates a chain of spas, and ThermoRetec,
an environmental remediation firm.
</P>
<P>
   Thermo Electron's stock closed up 1/8 at 15 15/16.

TALIBAN DIPLOMAT WAITS IN VAIN FOR U.N. RECOGNITION OF HIS
GOVERNMENT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Someone from the delegation with the sign that
says ``Afghanistan'' made a speech in the General Assembly Tuesday.
But he wasn't a representative of the people who run the country.
</P>
<P>
   Miles away in his small office in a third-floor walkup in
Queens, N.Y., the representative of the Taliban, which now controls
all but one corner of one province of Afghanistan _ and has ruled
the capital, Kabul, for two years _ was still waiting to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United Nations is using the seat of Afghanistan as a tool
of pressure on an Islamic emirate to change its policies and to
impose on it a kind of coalition government that will be
consequently a secular government,'' said Abdul Hakeen Mujahid, the
Taliban's most important diplomat. ``This is their goal.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't work, said Mujahid, 41, who was born under an Afghan
monarchy, fled a Communist takeover and joined one of the more
moderate movements that sent holy warriors to fight the Soviet army
before joining the radical Islamic movement and became its
ambassador-in-waiting here.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the particularities of Afghan people is that no one can
impose their will upon them,'' he said, in an understatement of
several hundred years of history. ``The people of Afghanistan are
very free people and they are making their decisions by
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Other nations will come around, he added, ``once they realize
that the Taliban Islamic movement, a grass roots movement, arose
from the people of Afghanistan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our priority is that we bring peace and security inside
Afghanistan,'' he said, adding that the defeat of the remaining
forces of the American-backed Mujahedin armies was the movement's
first priority. ``After that there will be very little need for
bargaining with the outside powers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban will not negotiate its beliefs away for outside
recognition, Mujahid said over green tea and sugared almonds, an
Afghan specialty.
</P>
<P>
   He was reading through his overnight faxes from Kandahar, the
Taliban's spiritual capital. Religious scholars there researched
the holy books to consider how much of a woman's head must be
covered _ they did not rule out an uncovered face. They also
examined whether one Islamic nation, in this case Afghanistan, had
the right to defend itself against another Islamic nation, Iran,
and with the help of non-Islamic outsiders. The answer was an
unambiguous yes.
</P>
<P>
   By the side of his desk, Mujahid keeps his small pile of
reference books, one the Koran and another a guide to the New York
Public Library. On his second tour in New York _ he was the
Taliban's ambassador in Pakistan for about six months this year _
Mujahid has brought his family.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Khatoon, was a village girl, he said, representative
of the very conservative society that dominated rural Afghanistan
before the Taliban existed, and where the movement finds its
deepest support. To illustrate his point, he said he recently spent
days trying to find a female ear specialist for her because she
refused to see a male doctor, although she was in great pain.
</P>
<P>
   They have five children, only one a daughter, Zakira, a
10-year-old. He is searching for an Islamic school for her that is
not coeducational. The boys will go to American public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban has been unpopular with women's groups, human rights
organizations and many governments and international organizations
for its efforts to impose its puritan vision of society on Afghans,
and it has been reviled even by the Iranians for giving Islam an
out-of-date image, if not a bad name. It has not been able to budge
either the General Assembly credentials committee, which decides
who holds U.N. seats, or the powerful governments behind it, most
of all the United States.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials are in a bind. They find it hard to work in
Afghanistan within the confines of the Taliban's discriminatory
rules against women, and agree with much of the criticism of the
movement. Yet officials say that they believe that international
recognition might change the movement's distrust and hostility
toward the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Mujahid, who has graduate degrees in both religion and political
science, has watched as Laurent Kabila, now fighting for the
survival of his government in a widening African war, won Congo's
seat almost overnight after the fall of Mobutu Sese Seko in May
1997. Mujahid also saw Cambodia's seat declared vacant after a July
1997 coup. It remains vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan, however, continues to be represented officially
here by the remains of the defeated and largely exiled government
of Burhanuddin Rabbini, whose deputy foreign minister, Abdullah
Abdullah, spoke Tuesday. Mujahid called the situation ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``To keep the seat of Afghanistan in the hands of the personal
representatives of Rabbini is not justice,'' he said. ``It is not
fair. It is not according to the rules or the principles of the
United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They killed this nation,'' he said. ``They killed more than
60,000 people. They destroyed the country, ruined the country. They
divided it into fiefdoms and ruled them with independent
governments.''
</P>
<P>
   They shot at each other's aircraft and amassed fortunes,
building palatial homes and businesses, he added. Now they exist on
the support of outside powers _ Iran, Tajikistan, and Russia, among
others, he said. Their last stronghold is now the Panjsher valley
of Parvan province.
</P>
<P>
   ``These realities will be accepted one day, once people realize
that these warlords couldn't represent the people of Afghanistan,''
Mujahid said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Marc Levin's feature film ``Slam'' is a vivid marriage of ideas
usually seen as contradictions: documentary and fiction, action and
poetry, black and white.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slam,'' which opens here on Friday after being shown at the
New York Film Festival, is the story of a young black performance
poet, Raymond Joshua (Saul Williams), who is imprisoned on a petty
drug charge but who manages to establish his identity and his voice
within the maelstrom of a Washington jail.
</P>
<P>
   As indicated by the punning title, the premise of ``Slam'' is
itself unusual: not often are jail (the ``slammer'') and the
spoken-word scene (``slams'' are competitive poetry performances)
linked together.
</P>
<P>
   The film is actually fiction, though it gains a graphic
documentary quality from having been shot mainly at the District of
Columbia's Detention Facility. Both hard-driving and entertaining,
with its poetry and a hip-hop soundtrack, ``Slam'' won prizes at
both the Sundance and Cannes film festivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of people, the experience of `Slam' feels really
fresh,'' said Geoffrey Gilmore, Sundance's director of programming.
``We all have seen films about young struggling kids from a
minority background who end up in jail. The difference with `Slam'
is that the film goes beyond this to talk about creativity and the
exploration of one's soul, no matter what the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of how ``Slam'' was made is as striking a narrative as
the film itself, due to the film's cast of characters and to the
collaborative way in which it was created. Marc Levin, one of the
film's producers and writers as well as its director, is an
award-winning documentary film maker.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Stratton, another of the film's producers and writers,
is a novelist and journalist who served eight years in a federal
penitentiary for importing marijuana. Henri Kessler, a third
producer, is a former club owner and party promoter.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, Stratton and Kessler are all white, but the three
principal actors whom the film introduces, and who all crafted
their own parts, are black. Both Saul Williams, who plays the
central figure of Ray, and Sonja Sohn, who plays his lover and
mentor Lauren, are poets and actors, while Bonz Malone, who plays
the prison leader Hopha, is a writer and former graffiti artist who
has also served time.
</P>
<P>
   How these larger-than-life personalities came together to form
the patchwork quilt of ``Slam'' is a story that starts with Levin's
own background. Born in New York and reared in New Jersey, the son
of political activists, Levin, 47, owes his sensibility partly to
the ferment of the late 1960s, when he came of age.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamic gray-haired director has made a career of filming
documentaries that explore such issues as the drug war and race
relations. When asked about the challenges he has faced as a white
film maker exploring this terrain, he said, ``That's always been
the spot I've been drawn to in American culture _ the place where
black and white cultures meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere do these worlds collide more than in Washington, where,
as Levin says, ``there is one of the highest rates of incarceration
for young black men, and yet it is also our nation's capital.''
</P>
<P>
   He was drawn there to make a documentary within the Washington
jail system in 1997 because of a wish to expose what he calls ``the
waste of all these lives. We've written off a generation of young
black men, because as a society we've reached a place where
rehabilitation and compassion are no longer on the page.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting HBO documentary, ``Thug Life in D.C.,'' will be
playing in limited theatrical release this fall and led directly,
for Levin, to the birth of ``Slam.'' While shooting ``Thug Life''
in the spring of 1997 at the D.C. Detention Facility (familiarly
dubbed the D.C. Jail), it occurred to Levin that he might have
finally found the locale for a feature film.
</P>
<P>
   He and his partners, Stratton, Kessler, and David Peipers had
formed Offline Entertainment Group in 1994 with the aim of making
feature films, and Levin had been considering the story idea of an
artistic black kid who goes to jail. This character became a poet
when Levin saw Saul Williams performing at a poetry slam in April
of 1996 and cast him as his lead.
</P>
<P>
   Denied access to New York's Rikers Island, the film makers
turned to the Washington prison administrators they knew from the
documentary; those administrators took the startling step of
approving the filming of ``Slam'' in their jail. ``The director of
the D.C. Department of Corrections was Margaret Moore, and the
warden of the jail was Pat Jackson,'' Levin said, ``strong,
intelligent black women who are torn apart because they're putting
away their own people.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Jackson, who has since moved on to another prison, said,
``Marc and his crew wanted people to know about the whole process
and were really ultimately concerned with `How can we make this
change?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In structuring ``Slam,'' Levin allowed his actors to create
their own lines and decided to shoot in a spontaneous,
documentary-like style that was dubbed, by his crew, ``drama
verite.''
</P>
<P>
   The actors spent nine months developing the story and their
characters before filming started. Much of the dialogue was to be
improvised on camera.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Raymond Joshua (Williams) manages to stave off a
beating in jail by a dazzling poetry performance that literally
disarms his enemies. The charismatic prison leader Hopha (Bonz
Malone) pays Raymond's bail so that he can spread a message of
nonviolence on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Once out, Ray embarks on a romantic relationship with the
writing teacher whom he had met while in prison, as he grapples
with the reality that he will most likely still have to serve time.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Levin got in touch with Malone, a longtime friend, to ask
him to play the role of Hopha, he found him serving a four-month
sentence on Rikers Island for assault. ``As it turns out, it was
role rehearsal,'' Malone said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A slight 30-year-old whose business card reads ``consigliere,''
Malone is a combination of ambassador and impresario. By age 18, he
was writing a column for Spin magazine, and he now writes a monthly
column for Vibe magazine called ``Tuph St.'' ``I ran with gangs
since I was 12, been in jail in and out since I was 15,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His experiences have made him embrace what he says is ``Slam's''
uplifting message. `` `Slam' is about a young poet who goes to jail
and finds his voice _ first how to free himself, and then how to
free others,'' he said. ``It's about bettering your life situation
even in a harder place. I've (italics)been(end italics) there.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 26, who as Ray performs his own poetry throughout the
film, has, in contrast, an almost otherworldly sense of calm and a
majestic way of speaking. Rangy and dreadlocked, he grew up in
upstate New York, the son of a Baptist pastor and a schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   He has a master's in fine arts degree from New York University.
``In preparing to play Ray, my through-line was `How many spells
can I cast through poetry?' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sohn, who plays Lauren Bell, has her own fervor. Tall, half
Korean and half black, she grew up in projects in Virginia and
knows the terrain of ``Slam'' well. In one scene, Lauren, teaching
a workshop in the jail, breaks down in tears as she mentions her
dead brother _ a detail Ms. Sohn took from her own life. ``I hope
the film gives a reality to those stereotyped faces and lives that
people think they know,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After getting approval from the prison administrators, the team
drove down to Washington in late July of 1997 for a two-week
guerrilla-style film shoot. The financing of ``Slam,'' which cost a
little over a million dollars, only fell into place at the end:
until then, Kessler had maxed out his credit card.
</P>
<P>
   The film has sly humor, notably in the scene where Marion Barry,
the former mayor of Washington has a cameo role as an anti-drug
judge. The film makers also cast some of the real inmates in
various roles, all the while improvising and working under time
constraints.
</P>
<P>
   This gave rise to scenes such as the one where Williams, playing
Ray in his jail cell, embarked on an extended verbal riff with an
actual prisoner, Bay, in the cell next door. ``We were freestyling
back and forth, for 45 minutes,'' Williams said. ``They didn't even
say, `Cut.' They just changed the film and let us keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most galvanizing scene to shoot was the one
where Ray faces his enemies down in the jail yard. The warden
unexpectedly closed down the shooting that night, but then allowed
the crew to shoot again the following day _ only for an hour,
though, and with more inmates in the yard, many of whom were not
aware that Williams was not a real prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting these `new kid' looks from people,'' Williams
recalled. ``When it came time for people to start gathering around
me, some of them actually did want a piece of me.'' He smiled.
``But the poetry stopped them.''
</P>
<P>
   In this volatile environment, Levin kept his cool. ``Marc knows
that life itself is unscripted,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Slam'' team attributes the acclaim that the film
subsequently attracted at festivals to the nature of Ray's odyssey.
Despite the sobering questions the film poses about the justice
system, it also presents the idea of freedom as a metaphysical,
rather than a literal, state.
</P>
<P>
   I think the key to `Slam' is in that line which Lauren says:
`Freedom isn't out here, it's in here,' '' said Ms. Sohn, pointing
to her head. `` `Never give anyone the power to take away your
freedom.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There are no easy answers in the film, only many heated
arguments. ``The film is about choices,'' Malone said. ``It's
foolish to think that this is just one race or class of people
affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the film seems to have set in motion a string of
other projects. Levin has just finished shooting ``White Boys,''
partly financed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, which was shot on
location in Iowa and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``White Boys,'' starring Danny Hoch and written by Hoch and
Levin, among others, is a dramatic comedy about white teen-agers in
the Midwest who emulate black hip-hop culture. Not only does Levin
intend to sustain his drama verite methods in his next films, he
also intends to continue exploring the questions that he raised
with ``Slam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been so stuck in definitions _ liberal and conservative,
black and white,'' he said. ``That's one of the great things about
the hip-hop generation: there's a new dialogue of race. We have to
find a new way of thinking about black and white. You have to get
in and mix it up and tell people, `This is what I want to say.'''

 &HT;    Cink man with task
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ Stewart Cink's mission is clear. He can't
let it happen. To have a Tour Championship occur at East Lake Golf
Club in four weeks and to fail to make the field would be a huge
opportunity lost and a circumstance too depressing to ponder.
Besides, who else out there in the top 30 knows how greens that
once felt the spike marks of Bobby Jones break on a daily basis?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my home course,'' Cink said. ``I can't miss that. There's
no secret about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The quest continues for Cink this week at charming, challenging
Callaway Gardens, Ga. during the Buick Challenge, where last year
only one man, Davis Love III, finished ahead of him. He stands 32nd
on the PGA Tour money list and needs to make the top 30 to enjoy
the opportunity at East Lake Oct. 29-Nov. 1. Passed Sunday by Hal
Sutton, who won at the Texas Open to jump over the $1 million mark
and assure his spot in the Tour Championship, Cink crept a bit
closer, tying for 11th and earning $31,733 for a 1998 total of
$783,941.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still know where I rank on the tour as a player,'' he said.
``I still think I can get the job done. I'm looking for a high
finish, hopefully a victory. I still feel like I have a chance to
win every time I tee it up and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Maturity has always come smoothly for the former Georgia Tech
player. Becoming a father in college, as son Connor pushed he and
wife Lisa's lives to the organizational limit, accounted for a huge
part of the process. In less than two years as a full-time player,
Cink, 25, has matured similarly on the PGA Tour. It would surprise
nobody if after shooting 17-under last year and losing, he were to
beat everybody around the Mountain View course this week and drive
back to Smyrna, Ga. in a new Buick. Same thing if Cink made the
Tour Championship and earned its $720,000 first prize. He has
established himself that solidly, that quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But first Cink has to get in. He doesn't want to think about his
friend Billy Andrade falling $5 short in 1997. If Cink is teeing
off at East Lake Oct. 29, he could have a distinct edge on the
field. It's a track where he has shot 64 just playing with friends
and members. As straightforward as the Rees Jones redo of Donald
Ross' original work is, there are quirks to the greens that Cink
has been filing away since beginning an affiliation with the club
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it could be a real advantage because I know the
greens,'' Cink said. ``They're tricky and they're hard to read
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge of how to handle the Bermuda rough won't hurt, either.
And Cink, when in Atlanta lately, has been playing East Lake with
the rough beyond the six-inch mark. Heck, you could lose a club in
the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't cut it,'' Cink said, ``I think the rough will be
the determining factor.''

 &HT;    Golf Notes: Rains hit Callaway
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley

   PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ Now that the Buick Challenge has managed to
assemble its best field in history _ 21 of the top 30 money-winners
_ the mission is to keep it from floating away. Unfortunately,
Callaway Gardens' alternating-year weather jinx has appeared again,
thanks to stalled Hurricane Georges, which is expected to soak the
Mountain View course, in its best condition in recent years, at
least through Thursday. Texas Open winner Hal Sutton Sunday became
the latest qualifier for the Tour Championship, moving from 31st to
15th with a win at San Antonio. One thing is certain, regardless of
the weather, there will be no two-round champion, as was the case
in 1996, when Michael Bradley won a 20-minute, one-hole, five-man
playoff for the title. The PGA Tour has made a commitment to play
at least 54 holes to determine a champion. . . . With hard rains
Tuesday at Callaway, Buick Challenge defending champion Davis Love
III and Justin Leonard picked a good time to play their ``Shell's
Wonderful World of Golf'' match at Winged Foot Golf Club,
revisiting the 1998 PGA Championship site. Leonard had to enjoy a
change of scenery after bogeying the final two holes Sunday at San
Antonio _ missing a 5-footer at the 18th _ to finish second.

   Just when it appeared Scotland's Colin Montgomerie's next move
might be reaching for the long putter, he settled his putting game
well enough to win the German Masters last Sunday. Although the
major championships still befuddle Montgomerie, he took over the
lead in the European Order of Merit by 119,926 pounds over
England's Lee Westwood and has a sixth consecutive money title in
reach. ``I'm proud of myself for being able to show what I can only
call the courage to win,'' said Montgomerie after sinking a
5-footer at the 18th to beat Vijay Singh and Robert Karlsson.

   At least four players will be playing the Atlanta area
``trifecta'' this fall _ Buick Challenge, Tour Championship and
Sarazen World Open. Mark Calcavecchia, Jim Furyk, Payne Stewart and
Scott Hoch, provided he receives an expected sponsor exemption, are
scheduled for all three. . . . Maple Ridge pro Mike Gill of
Columbus, Ga. aced Mountain View's fifth hole during Monday's Larry
Mize Pro-Am. . . . Corey Pavin's top 10 Sunday at San Antonio,
Texas was his first since a tie for eighth at the 1997 Mercedes
Championships. . . . Hoch undoubtedly confounded German TV
audiences last week when he popped a fairway wood from the rough
during the European Tour telecast and yelled, ``Infield fly rule in
effect!'' . . . Tom Watson is playing the Buick Challenge for the
first time in 25 years since it was at Green Island in Columbus,
Ga. as the Buick Southern Open. . . . Jack Nicklaus has selected
his son Jackie, 37, as his captain's assistant for the President's
Cup in Australia Dec. 11-13. . . . Robert Gamez, who has missed
nine cuts in the last 10 events, said, ``I built a new house and
I've been in it five months, but I can't furnish it the way I've
played.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton met Tuesday with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and emphasized the work that the Palestinians
need to do to combat terrorism as the Israelis withdraw from an
additional 13 percent of the West Bank, senior U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the leaders second meeting in two days, after a session
on Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and it
demonstrated, Clinton's aides said, the president's determination
to complete an interim agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Israel has accepted a phased withdrawal from the West
Bank, of the 13 percent that Washington had insisted on, American
attention turned to the more complicated details of how
Palestinians can improve security. The improvements are supposed to
be made parallel with the Israeli pullbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Those topics involve issues like dismantling terrorist cells,
confiscating some guns and halting the ``incitement'' of residents
through anti-Israeli speeches and propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace is a Palestinian need, Israeli need, Arab need,
international need,'' Arafat said after the hourlong talks with
Clinton. ``We are very close on a number of subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat expressed hope that a deal could be reached at a meeting
here next month, a move agreed to on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said, ``The president is
determined to see an agreement arise from this exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu and Arafat, whose personal and ideological dislike and
distrust for each other have become ingrained, met on Monday for
the first time in more than a year. Even more important, senior
American officials said, they agreed to a series of contacts and a
way to manage crises between them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also wanted to reassure Arafat of Washington's
commitment to help the Palestinians through aid and investment,
White House officials said. Clinton emphasized ``how much terrorism
undermines Arafat, as well,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans also wanted to go over some of Arafat's concerns
about what remains to be done, including Palestinian needs for
security from attacks by Israeli settlers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Early next week Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the
Middle East negotiator, Dennis Ross, will travel to the Middle East
for talks with the two sides, to try to insure that the meeting
next month succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to have Netanyahu, Arafat and their aides and
experts at a site near Washington, with American officials guiding
their negotiations and Clinton involving himself as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   If an interim deal can be finished, talks will formally open on
a final settlement between Israel and the Palestinians, originally
envisioned in the 1993 and 1995 Oslo accords to be completed by May
4.
</P>
<P>
   Although American, Israeli and Palestinian officials
acknowledged that much work remains to be done, all expressed a new
confidence that the time is ripe for a deal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   American officials expressed particular concern about the
dangers of new violence or unilateral actions by either side that
could quickly erode the wary willingness of the two men to work
together.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emphasized to both that they needed to avoid
embarrassing each other.
</P>
<P>
   He and Albright pressed Arafat in his United Nations speech on
Monday to avoid any commitment to declaring an independent
Palestinian state after May 4, if the final-status negotiations
have not succeeded by then.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, while asking the help of the world to achieve that goal,
complied with the American request.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, speaking here on Monday, said that he had told Arafat
that any such unilateral step would force him to respond in kind
and destroy the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   The other great concern is of another bombing on Israeli
civilians by Palestinian radicals opposed to Arafat and the peace
effort. American officials pointed to an explosion Tuesday in
Ramallah, on the West Bank, of a car that was apparently being
equipped as a bomb for use against Israelis. The explosion killed a
participant in the Hamas organization and wounded two other
supporters of the militant Islamic group.
</P>
<P>
   Similar attacks have disrupted momentum toward peace and pushed
Netanyahu to attack Arafat for his apparent failure to insure
complete security for Israelis, even when the bombers lived in or
moved through Israeli-controlled territory.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has been bracing for a renewal of Hamas bombings and
Tuesday sealed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza Strip ahead
of Yom Kippur.

FED'S CUT SHOULD MEAN LOWER BORROWING RATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also MARKET, FED) 
(mk) 
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's decision Tuesday to lower interest rates
for the first time since January 1996 should translate into lower
borrowing rates on many consumer loans and keep mortgage rates for
home purchases and refinancings below 7 percent at least through
the end of the year, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction of a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.25
percent, in the target for the federal funds rate was smaller than
had been widely anticipated. But the impact is enough to keep
30-year fixed-rate mortgages below 7 percent in 1998 and possibly
through 1999, said Robert Barr, a senior economist at Fannie Mae, a
congressionally chartered private company that helps finance
mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   The Mortgage Bankers Association of America, a trade group, has
an even more optimistic forecast, estimating that rates could drop
as low as 6.25 percent before the year ends.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage rates are at their lowest levels in a generation but
have not fallen as much as yields on Treasury securities, the
benchmarks for calculating rate trends.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that strong investor demand for Treasuries as a
safe haven from turbulent markets has pushed those yields lower.
</P>
<P>
   The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was about 6.64
percent in the week ended Sept. 25, the 15th consecutive week of
rates below 7 percent, according to Freddie Mac, the mortgage
company. That level was 2.07 percentage points higher than the 4.57
percent yield on 10-year Treasury securities. On average, 30-year
fixed mortgage rates are usually about 1.5 percentage points higher
than the yield on 10-year Treasury notes.
</P>
<P>
   That gap could narrow as Treasury rates stabilize near historic
lows and mortgage rates slip, Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, new mortgages for home purchases and refinancings are
expected to hit a record $1.4 trillion, said Brian Carey, an
economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   After the Fed's move Tuesday, Norwest Bank in Minneapolis cut
its prime lending rate, and others were expected to follow. The
prime rate is a benchmark for other consumer and corporate loans,
like credit cards, auto loans and small-business loans. The prime
rate, 8.5 percent at most banks, should fall by at least a
quarter-point, analysts estimate. Banks may also cut the interest
rates they pay on savings accounts and certificates of deposit.
</P>
<P>
   On average, savings accounts paid interest of about 2.17 percent
in April, according to Bank Rate Monitor, a research firm in North
Palm Beach, Fla., that reports savings account rates twice a year.
One-year certificates of deposit at banks paid an average rate of
4.69 percent as of Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers with such loans as adjustable-rate mortgages and home
equity lines of credit tied to the prime rate could see the impact
of lower rates within the next few months, said Keith Gumbinger,
vice president of HSH Associates, a financial research firm in
Butler, N.J.

 &HT;    Braves breakdown by position
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FIRST BASE: Andres Galarraga
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga has exceeded what the Braves had hoped,
answering the questions about age (37) and Coors Field by producing
the best numbers ever by a full-time Braves first baseman. Of
concern is a late-season power swoon. Galarraga finished the year
with just two homers in his last 74 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga Avg. H HR RBI SB
</P>
<P>
   vs. Chicago .211 8 3 7 0
</P>
<P>
   1998 .305 169 44 121 7
</P>
<P>
   SECOND BASE: Keith Lockhart
</P>
<P>
   A potential problem area. Keith Lockhart missed two weeks in
late September with a problem hamstring and is one misstep from
being on the bench. Platoon-mate Tony Graffanino finished the
season hitting .155 during the last two months. Lockhart likes
October. He has a .364 postseason average.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart Avg. H HR RBI SB
</P>
<P>
   Vs. Chicago .182 6 0 1 0
</P>
<P>
   1998 .257 94 9 37 2
</P>
<P>
   THIRD BASE: Chipper Jones
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones had 11 hits in nine playoff games last year, but
the memory of his performance during the last postseason has served
as an incentive this season. His 122 runs this year are the most by
a Braves player in 15 years, and he became the first Atlanta player
since Dale Murphy to drive in 100 runs three seasons in a row.
</P>
<P>
   C. Jones Avg. H HR RBI SB
</P>
<P>
   Vs. Chicago .314 11 3 7 2
</P>
<P>
   1998 .313 188 34 107 16
</P>
<P>
   SHORTSTOP: Walt Weiss
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's feel-good position. Walt Weiss, 34, and Ozzie Guillen,
33, are back in the postseason, when neither thought they'd get a
chance. Weiss got one ring with Oakland nine years ago, but
Guillen, a critical acquisition, has never had a sniff of the World
Series in 13 seasons in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss Avg. H HR RBI SB
</P>
<P>
   Vs. Chicago .000 0 0 0 0
</P>
<P>
   1998 .280 97 0 27 7
</P>
<P>
   LEFT FIELD: Ryan Klesko
</P>
<P>
   The Braves could use an upgraded performance from Ryan Klesko,
who hasn't posted numbers this low since he was a rookie. After a
June appendectomy, he hit just five more homers and drove in just
23 runs. Danny Bautista, slowed by a tender knee, platoons to
offset Klesko's .213 average against left-handed pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko Avg. H HR RBI SB
</P>
<P>
   Vs. Chicago .241 7 0 1 0
</P>
<P>
   1998 .274 117 18 70 5
</P>
<P>
   CENTER FIELD: Andruw Jones
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones, who proved himself to be the best center fielder
in the league this year, also was one of the club's driving forces
through the second half. Jones rose above his manager's periodic
ire to emerge as the player the Braves have been advertising, all
of that coinciding with his 21st birthday.
</P>
<P>
   A. Jones Avg. H HR RBI SB
</P>
<P>
   Vs. Chicago .419 13 1 7 1
</P>
<P>
   1998 .271 158 31 90 27
</P>
<P>
   RIGHT FIELD: Michael Tucker
</P>
<P>
   It runs hot and cold in right, where Michael Tucker struck out
112 times, lost 39 points off his batting average from last year
and cast some doubt about his future in the organization. Gerald
Williams platoons to hit .366 against left-handers and accounted
for five homers and three doubles in his last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker Avg. H HR RBI SB
</P>
<P>
   Vs. Chicago .321 9 0 3 0
</P>
<P>
   1998 .244 101 13 46 8
</P>
<P>
   CATCHER: Javy Lopez
</P>
<P>
   No catcher hit more home runs than Javy Lopez, and only Mike
Piazza drove in more runs than Lopez's 106, second most by any
Braves catcher in history. (Joe Torre had 109 in 1964.) Add in
reserve Eddie Perez and the position went 40-for-138. Lopez's eight
passed balls tied a career-low.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez Avg. H HR RBI SB
</P>
<P>
   Vs. Chicago .344 11 1 3 0
</P>
<P>
   1998 .284 139 34 106 5
</P>
<P>
   BENCH
</P>
<P>
   Do they have enough? By platooning at three positions, manager
Bobby Cox can match up with any bullpen in the late going.
Left-handed Curtis Pride hit .184 as a pinch hitter, but
right-handed Greg Colbrunn hit .389 off the bench since rejoining
the club in July. As Atlanta benches have gone, this is better than
most.
</P>
<P>
   Colbrunn Avg. H HR RBI SB

</P>
<P>
   NO. 1 STARTER: John Smoltz
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz started the year in Greenville on an injury-rehab
assignment and wondered if his elbow would make it to Memorial Day.
He finished the year pitching as well as he ever has. He had the
best winning percentage in the majors, and his strikeout ratio (9.3
per nine innings) was the second-highest of his career.

<P>
   NO. 2 STARTER: Tom Glavine
</P>
<P>
   No NL pitcher has had more 20-win seasons this decade than
Glavine, whose 20-6 record has him in line for his second Cy Young.
His 2.47 ERA is a career-low, and he finished strong, going 8-2
with a 1.98 ERA in his last 14 starts. He was even better away from
Turner Field, posting a 12-2 record and a 1.78 ERA on the road.

<P>
   NO. 3 STARTER: Greg Maddux
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux led the NL in ERA (2.22) and broke the 200-strikeout
barrier for the first time in his career. His 142 victories since
1991 are the most in the majors. But a 6-7 second half remains
unexplained and resulted in Maddux being dropped to third in the
postseason rotation. He is 3-0 in four LDS starts.

   BULLPEN: Kerry Ligtenberg
</P>
<P>
   Braves relievers finished strong, with only four runs allowed in
their last 33 2/3 innings (1.07), and the transfer of Denny Neagle
and Kevin Millwood to the bullpen only makes it a stronger group.
Kerry Ligtenberg is just the third Atlanta closer to reach 30
saves. The deposed Mark Wohlers did it only two times.

 &HT;    Dogs are championing Bailey
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ What's in a name?
</P>
<P>
   That's what University of Georgia athletics officials are asking
Heisman Trophy voters across the nation this week in the school's
most aggressive promotions pitch in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   And the Bulldogs are hoping voters agree that Georgia's Bailey
is the Champ.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia mailed full-color pamphlets touting junior All-America
candidate Champ Bailey as a legitimate contender for three of
college football's biggest awards _ the Thorpe (given to the
nation's top defensive back), Biletnikoff (top wide receiver) and
the Heisman, which goes annually to the nation's top overall
player.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, a 6-foot-1, 181-pound cornerback/wideout from Folkston,
will get a chance to catch voters' attention the next two weeks
when the 12th-ranked Bulldogs face No. 6 LSU and No. 3 Tennessee in
critical SEC contests.
</P>
<P>
   The road date at LSU will be broadcast nationally by ESPN at 7
p.m.; the Tennessee game in Athens will be televised regionally by
CBS at 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really big,'' Bailey said. ``The big thing is if we can
come out with some wins. It makes it that much more special. This
is about competing for a national title and everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those games are going to be big for him as far as exposure,''
Dogs coach Jim Donnan said. ``I think he'll have a chance again to
show everybody what his capabilities are.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey could be the top Thorpe candidate _ North Carolina's Dre
Bly took a big hit in last week's loss to Georgia Tech. Bailey is
widely regarded among the nation's top four defensive backs, along
with Bly, Arizona's Chris McAlister and Ohio State's Antoine
Winfield.
</P>
<P>
   But Bailey still has some work to do in the eyes of Heisman
voters.
</P>
<P>
   While it's still early in the race, Bailey didn't receive a vote
in the latest Heisman poll by the Scripps Howard News Service,
which was released Tuesday. Bailey received three votes the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks Cade McNown of UCLA, Donovan McNabb of Syracuse,
Tim Couch of Kentucky and Michael Bishop of Kansas State continue
to garner the most attention from voters, along with Texas running
back Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are still 20 guys out there who have positioned
themselves for Heisman consideration,'' said Don Borst, a Heisman
voter and Seattle-based correspondent for ESPN. ``I think Williams
was the leader at the beginning of the year, but he's not anymore.
It's wide open.''

<P>
   The lack of an apparent front-runner could benefit Bailey, who's
starting to receive the attention of a serious candidate. CBS,
CNN/SI and ESPN plan to broadcast lengthy segments on Bailey in the
next two weeks. Feature articles on Bailey will be published later
this week in the Washington Post and USA Today newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing hurting Bailey is that he hasn't been on television
that much,'' said Heisman voter Chris Harry of the Orlando
Sentinel. ``It's funny because every time you see highlights of
him, he's diving for a pass or making a play on offense. I think
what voters want to see are the spectacular defensive plays. But
I'd vote for the guy. The guy's almost exactly like (1997 Heisman
winner Charles Woodson of Michigan).''
</P>
<P>
   Woodson, a surprising Heisman winner over Tennessee quarterback
Peyton Manning, may have opened the door for two-way players like
Bailey. Through three games this season, Woodson's and Bailey's
statistics nearly mirror each other.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Woodson had 11 tackles and one interception on
defense in the first three games. He also had three catches for 74
yards and one touchdown on offense, and returned nine punts for 63
yards. Woodson averaged about 70 plays in 12 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's best performance this year came in Georgia's 17-3 win
at South Carolina on Sept. 12. He had 86 plays in that game and
made a 50-yard reception late to seal the victory. Through three
games, Bailey has 12 tackles and one interception on defense; 11
receptions for 218 yards and two touchdowns on offense; and one
kickoff return for 24 yards on special teams. He missed nearly the
entire second half of Georgia's 16-9 win over Wyoming on Sept. 19
with cramping in both legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bailey is probably as good or better than what Woodson brought
to the table,'' said Tom Dienhart, college football writer for The
Sporting News. ``I don't think there's any question about that.
When Michigan needed a big-play guy on offense, they went to
Woodson. Bailey's obviously that guy at Georgia right now. He's the
one stretching the defense to open up the running game.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodson's obvious advantage over Bailey? A national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows?'' Dienhart said. ``If Georgia comes out of this
October stretch with five wins, the guy would be near the top.''

 &HT;    Falcons' better half is the second
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons are 2-1, but the way they arrived
at that record contains a disturbing trend. Opponents have combined
to outgain Atlanta 734-397 and outscore the Falcons 47-14 in the
first halves.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has either trailed or been tied at halftime in each of
its three games.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that Atlanta has outscored opponents, 42-10,
and outgained opponents, 578-405, in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons coach Dan Reeves knows the slow starts won't get the job
done during the course of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a team that can afford to fall behind, and try to
catch up (on a regular basis),'' said Reeves, who indicated that
the team has been bothered by crowd noise in two road games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taking us too long to adjust,'' linebacker Cornelius
Bennett said. ``I don't think we do a good enough job getting our
personnel situated, and adjusting to (opponents') tendencies.''
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious in the Philadelphia game, which Atlanta won 17-12
after trailing 9-0 at halftime. The Eagles outgained the Falcons
208-64 in the first half -- at home. It wasn't until the second
half that Atlanta began attacking Philly's rookie cornerbacks and
trying to take away the Eagles' short passing game by jamming
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Halftime) is the only time when you get everybody together,
and get their attention (to make big adjustments),'' defensive
coordinator Rich Brooks said. ``I just don't think we're ready for
the speed and tempo of games.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the practice week winds down, players go into a `glide,'
where they don't practice as fast. Then the game rolls around, and
it seems (the other team) is going 900 mph. Maybe we need to
emphasize practicing faster, not more physical to where people get
hurt, but faster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I agree with that, but . . . we're a team that
has to consider everything,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler thinks part of the problem is youth.
Rookie linemen Ephraim Salaam, Jose Portilla, Bob Hallen have been
forced into duty for various reasons, and rookie receivers Tim
Dwight and Jammi German played a lot Sunday against the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's a settling-in period or getting over
jitters,'' Chandler said, ``but as the game wears on, we do things
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler has a passer rating of 69.8 in the first half, 89.9 in
the second half. Jamal Anderson is averaging 23 yards in the first
half with a 3-yard average per carry; in the second half, he's
averaging 72 yards on 5.7.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons also have no sacks in the first half, six in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we have no answer,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   But the team knows something has to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to find that fire from start to finish,'' Bennett
said.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve Board cut interest rates by a
quarter of a percentage point Tuesday in an attempt to keep the
financial turmoil that is afflicting much of the world from
derailing the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank reduced the main short-term rate it controls to
5.25 percent from 5.5 percent, the smallest increment available to
it, in a move intended as much to signal the Federal Reserve's
deepening concern about the economy's prospects as to stimulate
faster growth.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Federal Reserve has cut rates since
January 1996, and the first change in rates since March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The cut in the federal funds rate, widely anticipated by
economists and investors, will put downward pressure on the rates
paid by consumers and businesses, and could give a slight boost to
the U.S. economy at a time when the financial crisis that began
last year in Asia is hitting the United States with increasing
force.
</P>
<P>
   Maury Harris, an economist at Paine Webber in New York,
described it as a ``growth insurance policy'' taken out by the
Federal Reserve to head off the possibility of a downturn and the
need for a more pronounced rate cut later.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction is likely to have only a marginal effect on the
problems plaguing Japan, Southeast Asia, Russia and Latin America.
But to the extent it keeps the U.S. economy healthy, the rate cut
would help other countries by strengthening demand for their
products from the world's biggest economy.
</P>
<P>
   It also could give embattled markets around the world some
reassurance that Alan Greenspan, the world's most influential
economic policy-maker, recognizes the severity of the crisis facing
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really signaling that somebody at the top knows what's
going on,'' said Cary Leahey, an economist at High Frequency
Economics, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, where there had been some speculation that the
rate cut could have been half a percentage point, investors seemed
disappointed that the Fed had limited the reduction to a
quarter-point.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average dipped almost 100 points
immediately after the announcement by the Fed on Tuesday afternoon
before rebounding somewhat to close at 8,080.52, down 28.32 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big signal is that the Fed is still very cautious in how
fast it moves,'' said John Silvia, chief economist at the Kemper
funds in Chicago. ``They're confronted with two very different
mixed pictures _ domestic economic strength and foreign financial
market concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's decision to limit the rate cut seemed to
reflect the continuing concern among some of its members that with
unemployment at 4.5 percent, a 25-year low, there is still a risk
that upward pressure on wages could cause an inflationary spiral if
growth accelerates.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last several months there have been increasing signs
that the economy is slowing because of the problems that have
devastated Asia and Russia and are threatening Latin America. Since
early this month, Greenspan has been signaling that the risks from
abroad were forcing the central bank to consider a rate reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers and farmers have seen many of their export markets
shrivel. The stock market has fallen sharply from its mid-July
peak, raising questions about the ability and willingness of
consumers to continue spending. Fearful of growing worldwide risks,
investors and lenders have pulled back, creating the circumstances
for a credit shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The near-collapse last week of a little-known but highly
sophisticated investment firm, Long-Term Capital Management LP,
made clear that the United States was not completely insulated from
jarring financial shocks. And just hours before the Fed announced
its decision Tuesday, the Conference Board, a business research
group, reported that consumer confidence fell sharply in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The action was taken to cushion the effects on prospective
economic growth in the United States of increasing weakness in
foreign economies and of less accommodative financial conditions
domestically,'' the central bank's policy-making Federal Open
Market Committee said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent changes in the global economy and adjustments in
the U.S. financial markets mean that a slightly lower federal funds
rate should now be consistent with keeping inflation low and
sustaining economic growth going forward,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Fed's statement was notable for its emphasis
on tightening credit conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the interest rates that most affect consumers are
already quite low, especially mortgage rates, and consumer demand
has shown no signs of being inhibited by interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems at Long-Term Capital Management, including the
losses its problems have inflicted on banks and brokerage firms, as
well as a rise in the cost of capital for companies seeking
financing in the stock and bond markets, have together created a
developing squeeze on Wall Street. In addition to exerting a
braking effect on growth, the tighter conditions could cause
problems in the event that other investment firms or banks
encounter difficulties linked to the global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Easing the federal funds rate _ the rate on overnight loans
between banks _ would help counter that credit shortage and help
avert any potential problems in the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not your normal kind of rate cut,'' said David Orr, an
economist at First Union Corp. ``It was not taken to stimulate an
economy being hurt by high interest rates. It was taken to protect
the economy from a potential credit contraction resulting from loan
losses at major money-center banks and brokerages.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed left unchanged, at 5 percent, the other short-term rate
it controls _ the largely symbolic discount rate on loans it makes
to banks.
</P>
<P>
   The policy panel meets twice more this year _ on Nov. 17 and
Dec. 22 _ and many analysts think further rate reductions are
likely, especially if growth continues to show signs of moderating
or if the global crisis further unsettles the markets.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning,'' Orr said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has been under growing pressure for months from Wall
Street, manufacturers, farmers and other nations to cut rates. But
within the central bank there has always been a band of determined
inflation-fighters who are likely still to be wary of loosening
policy.
</P>
<P>
   They have been led this year by Jerry Jordan, the president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, and William Poole, the
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Both have
expressed concern at policy meetings this year that a rapid
increase in the money supply is an early warning sign of
inflationary pressures. How they voted at Tuesday's meeting will
not be disclosed until the minutes are released on Nov. 19; their
votes at the previous meeting, on Aug. 18, will be disclosed on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed may also have held to a quarter-point reduction Tuesday
because of its experience in 1987, when it quickly cut rates after
the stock-market crash in October. Although Greenspan was widely
praised at the time for increasing the flow of money into the
financial system during a time of crisis, the economy proved
stronger than expected, inflation began creeping up and within
months the Fed had to reverse itself and start raising rates.
</P>
<P>
   While Fed officials have repeatedly stressed in recent weeks
that they cannot act as central bankers to the world, their
decision Tuesday, especially if followed by additional easing,
could have some helpful effects on the global markets.
</P>
<P>
   Lower U.S. interest rates could help diminish the flow of
capital from around the world to the United States, where Treasury
securities have become the safe haven of choice for increasingly
nervous investors. If less money flows into the United States from
abroad, more is available for investment in other markets that need
it more.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, rate cuts could weaken the dollar and help
encourage lower rates in other countries, helping governments,
banks and companies that are coping with debts denominated in
dollars and with tumbling currency values.

 &HT;    Braves will win/lose if....
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE BRAVES WILL WIN IF:
</P>
<P>
   _ John Smoltz keeps it going. The Cubs saw him at his worst on
May 23 _ two innings, two runs in a no-decision _ the day before
Smoltz hit the DL the second time. Since then, he has gone 13-2
with some of the most effective work of his career. Smoltz has a
15-4 career record against the Cubs, and if there is a Game 4,
Smoltz has a career 2.73 ERA at Wrigley Field. The Cubs haven't
beaten him the last 10 times they've faced him, dating to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Braves can keep the Cubs out of the big inning. When it
absolutely needs to score, Chicago has had trouble manufacturing
runs, which favors Atlanta in a close game. The Cubs are ranked
11th in the league in sacrifice flies, 11th in sacrifice bunts and
15th in stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   _ Atlanta's bullpen can maintain its late-season surge. While
the Braves were finishing with a 14-2 run, the relievers performed
about as well as they have all season. The bullpen allowed only
nine runs in its last 44 2/3 innings (1.81 ERA), and five of those
runs came in one inning, on Sept. 13 against Florida. Braves
relievers struck out 40 batters in the last 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cubs maintain their Atlanta profile. Chicago has not fared
well in Georgia in recent years, going 7-17 the last four seasons.
Turner Field had posed a particular hurdle. The Cubs lost nine of
their first 10 games at the Braves' new home, until they swept a
two-game series July 20-21.
</P>
<P>
   _ Greg Maddux maintains his mastery over his former employer.
Since leaving the Cubs after winning the 1992 Cy Young award,
Maddux is 7-1 against Chicago. The only defeat came in his last
start, on July 21. In 11 career starts against his old team, Maddux
has given up only 16 earned runs in 84 1/3 innings (1.71 ERA).
</P>
<P>
   THE BRAVES WILL LOSE IF....
</P>
<P>
   _ They allow the Cubs to hammer them as they did all summer.
Chicago's .271 team average was tied with Colorado's for the
highest against Atlanta pitching this year. The 50 runs were the
second-most scored against the Braves. The Cubs also homered 11
times off Atlanta, and that was with Sammy Sosa sitting out two
games with a bad hand.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cubs remain patient at the plate. Chicago is ranked sixth
in the NL in walks, but the team was far better than that against
the Braves. No one walked more against Atlanta than the Cubs' 36
times, which worked out to once every 3.9 innings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gary Gaetti realizes that it's October. The veteran third
baseman has a .192 career average (15-for-78) against the Braves
since coming to the National League three years ago. But in the
1996 postseason, while with St. Louis, he hit .292 against the
Braves in the NLCS, including an eighth-inning grand slam in Game 2
off Maddux at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium that broke open an 8-3
Cardinals victory.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kevin Tapani continues to baffle Atlanta. Though he has a
career 4.50 ERA against the Braves, he has two wins in three starts
against them this season.
</P>
<P>
   _ They don't get improved performances from second baseman Tony
Graffanino and right fielder Michael Tucker. Both have struggled
much of the year and finished hitting a combined 57 points below
their career averages. But both have had excellent years against
Chicago: Graffanino is hitting .500 and Tucker .321 with three
doubles, a triple and eight walks.

 &HT;    Cubs will win/lose if ...
 &HT;    By I. J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE CUBS WILL WIN IF....
</P>
<P>
   _ Kerry Wood suddenly finds that his right elbow is strong
enough to pitch. Wood threw 51 pitches in an instructional league
game Monday and he might be able to pitch in Game 3 on Saturday,
when the series is scheduled to go to Wrigley Field. Wood has been
tough at home, with a 9-1 record and 2.97 ERA. He was 1-0 against
the Braves in three starts, allowing five runs in 20 2/3 innings.
Wood has not pitched since Aug. 31. Chicago has a real chance if
the Cubs can split the first two games in Atlanta and have Wood
available.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sammy Sosa goes on another of his homer binges and the Cubs
follow suit. Sosa hit three of his 66 homers against the Braves,
but when he's on a tear, the rest of the team gets excited. Twenty
one of Sosa's homers have given the Cubs the lead. Sosa has only
three hits in 33 career at-bats against Game 1 starter John Smoltz.
He has to stay hot.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cubs pitching shuts down Chipper Jones and Andres Galarraga,
who have hurt Chicago this season. But that's a lot to ask of a
tired staff. Manager Jim Riggleman had to use 19-game winner Kevin
Tapani in relief Monday night in the playoff game against the
Giants, so the Game 1 starter will be Mark Clark (9-14), who was
0-1 against the Braves with a 5.88 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   _ The bullpen regains its early-season form. This group has
labored, especially after Wood was sidelined and Terry Mulholland
was moved back into the rotation. Closer Rod Beck has 51 saves, but
he has shown signs of fatigue. The key could be Terry Adams, who
has struggled with a 4.33 ERA. The Cubs, 30-27 in one-run games,
have a chance if they can keep the game close.
</P>
<P>
   _ They get a little luck on their side. This is a mismatch on
paper. But Chicago won six of nine against the Braves during the
regular season. And the Cubs are overdue for some postseason
success.
</P>
<P>
   THE CUBS WILL LOSE IF ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Chicago plays like it did during the final week of the regular
season. The Cubs looked like a beer-league softball team. If they
make mistakes against a veteran club like the Braves, it will be
over in three.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sosa goes into a slump. When Sosa plays well, the Cubs win. He
is hitting .308 against Braves pitching this year, with three
homers and five RBIs in 26 at-bats. Braves pitcher Greg Maddux has
said before that he doesn't like facing the free-swinging Sosa,
because he hits pitches outside the corners, where Maddux likes to
work.
</P>
<P>
   _ Riggleman is forced to go to his bullpen early. The Cubs are
thin in relief, and Riggleman needs to stretch his starters as long
as possible. Both Steve Trachsel and Tapani should be able to give
a little extra.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wood doesn't pitch. The Cubs are a much different team when
Wood is pitching. He can take over a game, especially against a
team that swings for the fences, as the Braves sometimes do. If he
is unavailable, the chances of Tapani, Trachsel and Mark Clark
carrying the Cubs are slim to none.
</P>
<P>
   _ They freeze. It happened to the Braves in 1991, when they
faced the Pirates and lost Game 1. But the Braves were involved in
a seven-game series and had time to adjust and win. Chicago cannot
afford to freeze in a five-game series.

   POSITION PLAYERS
</P>
<P>
   FIRST BASE: Mark Grace
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa swings the big bat for the Cubs, but Mark Grace is
the heart of the team. Grace is one of the most consistent players
in baseball. He has hit above .300 four years in a row, and he's
one of the best defensive first basemen in the game. Grace hits
John Smoltz (21-for-63) and Tom Glavine (22-for-72), but struggles
against Greg Maddux (6-for-27). He is hitting .333 with runners in
scoring position.

   SECOND BASE: Mickey Morandini
</P>
<P>
   A change of scenery has worked for Mickey Morandini, who is
having a career year. Morandini is hitting around .300 and has
driven in 14 more runs than last year. He doesn't make many
spectacular plays in the field but is solid, with good range and a
strong arm. Morandini is hitting .353 (19-for-54) against Smoltz
and .308 (24-for-78) against Greg Maddux. He hit just .241 in
September but is at .352 with runners in scoring position.

   THIRD BASE: Gary Gaetti
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs acquired Gary Gaetti from the Cardinals on Aug. 19, and
he played a major role down the stretch. Gaetti has hit eight home
runs, including the huge one in Monday's playoff victory over the
Giants. Gaetti has plenty of postseason experience, including the
Twins' 1987 world championship, and he played well against the
Braves in the 1996 league championship while with St. Louis. Gaetti
is consistent on defense and can provide the big hit.

   SHORTSTOP: Jose Hernandez
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs opened the season with Jeff Blauser at shortstop, but
he struggled, hitting .219. So the Cubs turned the spot over to
Jose Hernandez, who can play almost any position. Hernandez has
provided more power than the team thought he had. He is one of the
best athletes in baseball but hit only .155 this month.

<P>
   LEFT FIELD: Henry Rodriguez
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Henry Rodriguez is a star, sometimes not. Rodriguez,
who had a strong first half, is hitting .211 this month. He can be
very dangerous with runners on base, although he might not start
Game 1 because he is 2-for-22 against Smoltz. Then again, he also
struggles against Maddux (8-for-35) and Glavine (2-for-17).

</P>
<P>
   CENTER FIELD: Lance Johnson
</P>
<P>
   For years, Lance Johnson has been one of the steadiest leadoff
hitters in the game. He covers a lot of ground in center field but
has been slowed by hamstring problems that limited him to 83 games
and dropped his stolen bases to 10. But Johnson is hitting .365 in
September and provides leadership in the clubhouse.

</P>
<P>
   RIGHT FIELD: Sammy Sosa
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa has become so much more than a home-run hitter. His
.308 average is 51 points better than his career mark, and he's
hitting .309 with runners in scoring position. He hit at least one
homer in 15 consecutive series and had 11 multihomer games, which
tied a major-league record. He still struggles defensively at times
and didn't steal bases this season as he had in the past. Of
course, that could be because he had 30 more homers than last year.

<P>
   CATCHER: Tyler Houston
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs platoon Tyler Houston and Scott Servais at catcher. But
the left-handed-hitting Houston, a former Brave, continues to
improve and caught Monday's playoff game. Houston was 6-for-20 as a
pinch hitter. Servais will get the start against Braves lefty Tom
Glavine and is 0-for-12 as a pinch hitter this season.

</P>
<P>
   BENCH
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs have a nice supply of talent, including Orlando Merced,
Glenallen Hill, Brant Brown, Matt Mieske and Manny Alexander. Brown
is used against some right-handers and is the club's main
left-handed pinch hitter. He is 6-for-20 with four RBIs in that
role. Hill is having a super season after coming over from the
Mariners. He is 4-for-13 with two homers and seven RBIs in
pinch-hitting duties. Alexander is used some as a defensive
replacement at short.

   NO. 1 STARTER: Mark Clark
</P>
<P>
   Because the Cubs were unable to set up their rotation for the
postseason and had to win a one-game playoff, they will have to go
with Mark Clark in the opener. Clark has been inconsistent all
season, and his ERA has risen steadily over the last three years.

</P>
<P>
   NO. 2 STARTER: Kevin Tapani
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Tapani, who returned last year from injury, led the team
in wins with 19. Tapani, who started and lost to Houston on Friday,
had to work more than an inning in relief in Monday's playoff game
and was charged with two runs. His ERA was a relatively high 4.85.

</P>
<P>
   NO. 3 STARTER: Kerry Wood
</P>
<P>
   Wood was Chicago's most productive pitcher, with 233 strikeouts
in just 26 starts, but he hasn't pitched since Aug. 31 and is
questionable for this series with a sore elbow. If Wood can't go,
the Cubs will use Steve Traschel, Monday's winner, for Game 3, with
Terry Mulholland, who saved Chicago down the stretch, available as
a spot starter.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   BULLPEN: Rod Beck
</P>
<P>
   Closer Rod Beck appeared to tire at times during the season, but
he still finished with 51 saves, only the fifth player in
major-league history to reach that number. He can be awfully tough
against the Braves: Andres Galarraga has just three hits against
him in 15 at-bats, while Ryan Klesko is 0-for-6 and Keith Lockhart
is 0-for-4. On the other hand, Chipper Jones is 4-for-7 against
Beck, and Javier Lopez is 4-for-6. For his career, Beck has 16
saves in 20 opportunities against Atlanta. Cubs setup men Terry
Adams and Felix Heredia have struggled lately, particularly Adams.

MIGHTY DUCKS NOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Even though the Anaheim Mighty Ducks are 1-5 in the
exhibition season and have allowed 26 goals in their last four
games, Anaheim goalie Guy Hebert insists it's not the time to
panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time to continue to be positive, he said. ``Everybody
is still excited. We didn't expect to come in and win every game.
I've played for a long time and I've never seen a team go 9-0 or
10-0 (in the exhibition season) and go on to win the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert says it's going to take time for the team to learn new
coach Craig Hartsburg's defensive system, which features at least
one defenseman remaining in front of the Anaheim net at all times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are used to playing man-to-man, and in this system you
have to be very patient, he said. ``I think it will be effective,
but you're not going to learn it and perfect it in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert says the system is something completely new to him, but
that he likes the idea that Hartsburg is very committed to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited Craig is going to work with one system and keep
working on it, he said. (That he's) not going to change from night
to night and get guys more confused. I think in the long run it
will be very effective for us.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, coach Pierre Page changed systems several times.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg wasn't real happy after the Ducks gave up four
third-period goals in Monday's 5-3 loss to the Kings, but he seemed
to soften his stance on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of good things happened, he said. ``I'm not happy we
lost, but we are trying to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no lack of effort. Eventually we will be a good
team, it could be days or a couple of weeks, but we will get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe to some people it doesn't look like (we are improving),
but we see things.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg says he isn't disappointed in any of his defensemen
thus far, but he hopes that Jason Marshall and Kevin Haller will
become the team's top defensive pairing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Haller and Marshall as two guys we can trust defensively
and play aginst the other team's top players, he said.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Trnka, a 22-year old defensemen who played well towards
the end of last season, could be on the bubble this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fighting for a position ... he needs to show us more,
said Hartsburg, who added that Trnka missing a portion of camp due
to contract dispute ``didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Patrick Lalime, who has struggled in his last two outings
(12 goals allowed) will play one of the games against Nashville --
either in Cincinnati on Friday or Milwaukee on Saturday. Hebert
will play the other game.

THESE DUCKS GET QUACKING ON OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE AND BILLY WITZ  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oregon, off to its first 4-0 start since 1988, is ranked No.17,
but here's some even more impressive numbers: 48, 33, 58 and 63.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the Ducks' point totals in wins over Michigan State,
Texas-El Paso, San Jose State and Stanford. Just what first-year
offensive coordinator Jeff Tedford expected, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the things you'd like to happen,'' said Tedford, a
former Warren High and Cerritos College quarterback who came to
Eugene after six seasons as the offensive coordinator at his alma
mater, Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players have done such a good job of executing. We've got
a lot of play-makers on the the field and the offensive line is
doing an excellent job.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tedford arrived this spring with plenty of questions
about the Ducks. Who would replace the Pac-10's leading rusher,
Saladin McCullough? Who would replace big-play receiver Pat
Johnson, now with the Baltimore Ravens? Could the Ducks again exist
with two quarterbacks Akili Smith and Jason Maas?
</P>
<P>
   It turns out Ruben Droughns, a JC transfer, has stepped in for
McCullough, rushing for a pair of 200-yard games. Herman Ho-Ching,
a freshman tailback from Poly, rescued the Ducks against UTEP with
three fourth-quarter touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Smith won the quarterback job and Damon Griffin, returning after
missing 1997 with a dislocated thumb, and Los Alamitos product Tony
Hartley have emerged as big-play receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system hasn't really changed at all,'' said Tedford, whose
group averages 543 yards per game. ``It's mainly the players who
are getting the job done. I think the guys understand that if they
just take care of the little things and not make mistakes, we're
going to be pretty hard to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Bearing down on defense
</P>
<P>
   California's offense was almost non-existent in a 24-14 win over
Washington State on Saturday. The Bears only scoring drive
</P>
<P>
   if that's what you call it was officially minus-14 yards and
concluded with a 42-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   So, the defense took over. The Bears recovered two fumbles,
intercepted four passes and scored three touchdowns. The touchdowns
were supplied by defensive end Mawuko Tugbenyoh
</P>
<P>
   (10-yard fumble return) and defensive backs Deltha O'Neal
</P>
<P>
   (76-yard interception return) and Drae Harris
</P>
<P>
   (26-yard interception return).
</P>
<P>
   The four interceptions matched Cal's season total of a year ago,
when the Golden Bears' allowed 237 yards passing per game and were
seventh in the Pac-10 in pass defense. Cal has eight interceptions
already this season and leads the Pac-10 in pass defense (149 yards
per game).
</P>
<P>
   Players of the week
</P>
<P>
   Oregon quarterback Akili Smith
</P>
<P>
   , Arizona State linebacker Adam Archuleta
</P>
<P>
   and California cornerback-return man Deltha O'Neal
</P>
<P>
   were selected the Pac-10 Conference Players of the Week.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was 18 of 29 for 357 yards and four touchdowns in Oregon's
63-28 victory over Stanford. Archuleta had 11 tackles, including
five for a loss and a sack in Arizona State's 24-3 win over Oregon
State. O'Neal returned an interception 76 yards for a touchdown,
returned a kickoff for 49 yards and had six punt returns for 87
yards a 14.5-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   Around the conference
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's Emory Brock made a big play in the Cardinal's loss to
Oregon on Saturday. Brock, a former walk-on and son of baseball
Hall of Famer Lou Brock, blocked a punt late in the first half to
set up a short touchdown pass and help the Cardinal close to within
35-21. ... Oregon's much-improved defense may have lost linebacker
Peter Sirmon for the season. Sirmon, the Pac-10's leading tackler a
year ago, has a torn chest muscle and did not play Saturday against
Stanford. His replacement, Chris Vandiver, has 19 tackles. ... Cal
has already matched last season's win total (three) in only four
games. The Golden Bears may be stuck on three wins for a few weeks,
however, as the next three contests are against USC, Washington and
UCLA. ... Arizona State's J.R. Redmond fumbled the ball twice in
the Sun Devils' victory over Oregon State. The talented Carson High
product has five fumbles in the first four games. ... Washington
State safety Lamont Thompson, a true sophomore with nine career
interceptions, may see more two-way duty with Nian Taylorbeing
bothered by a sore knee. Thompson played receiver against Cal, but
did not catch a pass. ... Arizona State cornerback J'Juan Cherry
was whistled for four major infractions - two pass interference, a
holding and a face mask - against Oregon State. He also made seven
tackles and had a big pass deflection near the Sun Devils goal
line. ... Arizona is 4-0 and ranked 14th in the nation, but the
wins have come against teams with a combined 3-11 record. A better
mark of what type of team the Wildcats have will come on Saturday
at Washington and Oct. 10 at home against UCLA. ... Washington,
after its 55-7 loss to Nebraska, is 1-6 against Top 10 teams since
the start of the 1995 season. It was the Huskies worst loss since a
52-0 loss to Alabama in 1975.

A FEW BUCKS CAN'T CHANGE JERRY WEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I had dinner with Jerry West the other night, and I looked for
changes.
</P>
<P>
   I always look for changes when one of my friends signs a
five-year contract for around $18 million, which is what Jerry West
recently did with the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   As you might know, Jerry had been in my bread and water
financial category for the longest of times Laker owner Jerry Buss
had been paying him a disgusting, below market $1.25 million a
year! and I just wondered how different he would be in the wake of
his new wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you condescend to still talk to us paupers?'' I asked
West, half in jest.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry West the storied Zeke from Cabin Creek, Hall of Fame
basketball player, longtime esteemed Laker executive, longtime Los
Angeles fixture, 60 years young shook his head slowly and grinned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, please,'' he said. ``I don't take any of this stuff
seriously. Actually, I'm embarrassed by it all. I'm embarrassed by
what I make. The most my father ever made in a year was $6,000.
Sure, it's nice. It gives me security for my family. But change me?
Please. I'm the same person now that I've always been.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry West's name has been in the news a lot these days, almost
as much as it was throughout the 1960s and early 1970s when he
dispensed heroics on a regular basis for the Lakers as a
high-scoring guard.
</P>
<P>
   And not just from his new contract, the signing of which
climaxed what had become such a volatile disagreement with Buss
that West, at one point, had decided to announce his retirement
from the Lakers on Aug.31.
</P>
<P>
   West also has agreed to do consulting work for super agent
Michael Ovitz, a longtime Laker season ticket holder who's put
together a group whose desire it is to bring an NFL expansion team
to Los Angeles and build a football stadium in Carson.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, West was seriously considering a lucrative offer to go
to work full-time for Ovitz on his fledgling project, but changed
his mind when Buss finally decided to meet West's salary demands.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jerry West will accompany Ovitz to an NFL meeting in
Kansas City in late October, and plans to give a speech to the
owners on the expansion team committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll talk about the virtues of having a football team in Los
Angeles,'' said West. It's absolutely ridiculous that an area the
size of Southern California doesn't have a team. I myself was a big
fan, first with the Rams and then with the Raiders. I used to go to
a lot of games, especially after I retired as a player. I think
something is missing around here on Sundays, and I hope I can help
do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   West says he's not drawing a paycheck from Ovitz for his input.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just believe in what Michael Ovitz is doing, and I think
he's going to be the person to get an NFL team here,'' says West.
``He's got some very big business people involved in the whole
process, and that proposed stadium he wants to build in Carson
would be just unbelievable. It's what we desperately need here in
L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Jerry West is concentrating all his energies these days
on bringing an NFL team to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   He's still busy with his Laker duties, even though the NBA is
now in the throes of a bitter lockout that threatens the opening of
training camp, if not the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supposed to open in Hawaii on Oct.3, and that doesn't
seem likely now,'' said West.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ominous labor miseries hovering over his league,
West still has been spending several hours a day on the telephone
with general managers around the NBA, discussing possible trades.
</P>
<P>
   It seems as though every team in the league that needs a center
is desirous of Elden Campbell, who's proven he can play such a
position and also has proven he can't play forward alongside
Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all sorts of intriguing possibilities,'' says West
without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I didn't detect any noticeable difference in Jerry
West's demeanor compared, say, to a former teammate of his, Pat
Riley, who changed more than any person I've known in sports after
he became rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
   Riley took his new status quite seriously, and his hat size
inflated several inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you able to look your neighbors in the eye now?'' I asked
West, who owns a home in Bel Air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' he replied. ``I'd have to make a lot more money
than I now am to reach their financial level.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Jerry West might turn out spending more time helping
Michael Ovitz this fall than worrying about the Lakers, unless the
dispute between the players and owners is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what's going to happen,'' said West. ``All I
can do on my end is prepare for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   And count all that money he dredged out of a reluctant Jerry
Buss.

   WASHINGTON _ From the nondescript headquarters of his Houston
construction firm, Leo E. Linbeck Jr., a lanky, bow-tied executive
with a drawl, is masterminding a crusade to overturn the nation's
tax system.
</P>
<P>
   Once, someone like him might have hired some of Washington's
``Gucci Gulch'' lobbyists to prowl the marble corridors outside
Congress' tax committees. But Linbeck, with Texas-style audacity,
wants to engineer a populist uprising to replace the income tax
code with a national sales tax. And with $15 million from some
initial investors and mass fund raising, he has run a radio and
television advertising campaign and employed an army of media
consultants, pollsters, political strategists, marketers, academics
and yes, even a few lobbyists, to energize the citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine what it would be like if you were in Congress and you
got a thousand phone calls a week and letters and e-mails and
faxes,'' Linbeck, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in
Dallas, said. ``Not people from all over the country, but your
constituents, people whose names you recognize, the people who were
at the polls with you, who live down the street with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck and his fellow investors in ``Americans for Fair
Taxation'' are unusual in the scale of their ambition. But their
methods have become commonplace as lobbying has undergone a
revolution over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely now does a well-connected Washington lobbyist work alone
to persuade power brokers in Congress. Instead, the lobbyist has
become just one of many players running full-fledged national
campaigns intended to create a ``grass-roots'' groundswell in
support of, or more often in opposition to, legislation before
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In their million-dollar costs and their reliance on television,
polling and grass-roots constituency building, these efforts most
resemble presidential campaigns. And they are now so pervasive and
sophisticated that it has become difficult to distinguish between a
lobbying effort, an issue advocacy campaign and a citizens'
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these efforts are genuine grass-roots movements. But
others are deceptions in which a special interest pays to create
the appearance of a popular groundswell.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of these techniques has spread the wealth of the
influence industry beyond the lawyer-lobbyist to a new class of
political professionals, who often play overlapping roles as
advisers to presidential and congressional candidates, corporate
tacticians and media pundits.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where the distinctions and conflicts between their
multiple roles seem to matter less and less and can even be a
business advantage, strategists who are ideological enemies in
politics put their differences aside to work together on
large-scale corporate campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is the outgrowth of several developments in technology
and politics. E-mail, computer databases, talk radio and 24-hour
cable television all make it easier to organize and send a
political message across the country at warp speed.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, power in Washington has been dispersed, so
that new ways are needed to influence more legislators. The media
age politician is far more likely to be moved by polls, television
ads and mass constituent contacts than by party discipline, a
committee chairman or a Washington wise man. And the Republicans in
Congress know they came to power with the help of several groups
with grass-roots memberships: the National Federation of
Independent Businesses, the National Rifle Association, the
Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a couple of evolutions happening simultaneously,''
said Keith Appell, of Creative Response Concepts, a Republican
public relations concern that is involved in national issue
campaigns. ``There's Republican sensitivity to grass roots, and
certain lobbying methods you didn't have before and the explosion
of media in the communications age.''
</P>
<P>
   Public policy experts debate whether the new methods of lobbying
have made it more democratic by taking it out of the back rooms of
the Capitol or whether they have simply made it far more difficult
for interests without money to compete in the public arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of a trend in Washington where rational debate on
issues gets buried in big-budget sound bites,'' said Edward
Yingling, the chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck says of his way of moving Congress: ``It's not as
orderly. It's not as predictable. It's not as controlled as some
might want it to be. But I think those are positive attributes.''
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of the worlds of lobbying and politics is
evident in how Linbeck has gone about his people's crusade. He
estimates the effort will take several years and ultimately cost an
extraordinary $90 million, a sum likely only if hundreds of
thousands of Americans join his cause. Right now, a major tax
overhaul is only a glimmer far out on the horizon of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his initial money went to hire prominent academics and
research organizations to develop the 23 percent national sales
tax. But to speed the organizing and make his proposal as
politically appealing as possible, he has also turned to national
experts in politics, using Denis Calabrese, a Houston Republican
consultant and onetime aide to Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, as his
chief strategist. With Calabrese's help, ``Americans for Fair
Taxation'' has hired an all-star cast from both parties to propel
his tax plan:
</P>
<P>
   _Richard Wirthlin, President Reagan's pollster, surveyed the
electorate's attitudes towards the tax system, with some help from
Mark Mellman, pollster to the Democratic leadership in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   _Don Sipple, a media adviser to Bob Dole's presidential campaign
produced early television advertisements to test-market the sales
tax.
</P>
<P>
   _Fred Steeper, a well-established Republican pollster in
Michigan, checked on the advertisements' results.
</P>
<P>
   _Creative Response Concepts, whose president, Greg Mueller, was
communications director for Patrick Buchanan's 1996 presidential
run, promotes the sales tax to journalists.
</P>
<P>
   _Charles Sewell, a one-time Democratic staff aide and strategist
who is now a vice president at the Washington office of Ketchum
Public Relations, scours the country for civic leaders who can head
chapters of Americans for Fair Taxation in the nation's 435
congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   _Americans for Fair Taxation does have a more traditional
lobbying team too, from Arter &AMP; Hadden, a law firm whose ranks
include two former members of Congress from Texas, Thomas Loeffler,
a Republican, and Jim Chapman, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Argus Group, another Washington lobbying and government
relations company, has drafted the sales tax legislation. This may
sound like the lobbying equivalent of the Normandy invasion. But
ever since the epic battle against Clinton's proposal for national
health insurance in 1994, these kinds of ensembles have assembled
on issue after issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients and industries have come to appreciate there are no
solo pilots in this town,'' said Jack Quinn, who returned to the
law firm of Arnold &AMP; Porter after he stepped down as White House
counsel. ``Now you send armies, ships, tanks, aircraft, infantry,
Democrats and Republicans, grass-roots specialists, people with
special relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, much about these campaigns remains undisclosed,
from the cost to who is behind them. Many consultants who are
willing to explain their techniques will not identify their
clients, citing confidentiality clauses in their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 the new Republican Congress approved major changes in
how Congress does business. It imposed a gift ban and passed tough
new disclosure requirements for lobbyists. But the legislation did
not include reporting requirements for ``grass-roots'' lobbying
like telephone and letter-writing campaigns, even if the campaigns
were generated by hired lobbyists and organizers.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier effort to pass a disclosure law that would have
required reporting on such lobbying faltered in the Democratic
Congress in 1994 when Rep. Newt Gingrich, then the House Republican
whip, branded the measure as an ``anti-religious'' attempt to chill
growing grass-roots conservative movements like the Christian
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Many groups had an interest in that battle because many have
genuine, permanent grass-roots memberships, from the Christian
Coalition to the Sierra Club. But creating citizens movements _ or
the semblance of one _ on demand has also become big business.
</P>
<P>
   Big public relations companies and even the little boutique
shops advertise such arcane-sounding specialities as: ``development
of third party allies'' or ``grass-roots recruitment and
mobilization,'' or ``grass-tops lobbying.'' The goal of these kinds
of campaigns is to shape the terms of congressional debate and to
persuade ordinary voters to serve as the front-line advocates for
the paying clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the concept, you move beyond candidate advertising
and beyond party organizations and form your own free-standing
operation around an issue,'' said Brian Lunde, a former executive
director of the Democratic National Committee who specializes in
this kind of organizing. ``The day of the PAC check and the steak
dinner and the golf dinner is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners say a grass-roots effort can cost from $40,000 for
a small-scale attempt to sway the vote of just one or two crucial
members of a subcommittee to many millions of dollars to sway a
majority in Congress. Some companies base their fees on the number
of calls or letters they generate.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Campaigns &AMP; Elections magazine, a trade
journal, conducted a painstaking survey and concluded that
``grass-roots lobbying'' _ separate and apart from more traditional
lobbying _ had become an $800 million industry over 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And advertising, like the tobacco industry's more than $40
million campaign against tobacco legislation this spring, adds to
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inside game of lobbying is in decline and the outside game
of consumer messaging _ of marshaling public opinion _ is advancing
and increasing,'' said Mike Murphy, media consultant in 1996 to the
Republican presidential candidates Lamar Alexander and Bob Dole.
``And savvy companies have figured out that the best experts to
hire to do this kind of work are political consultants.'' His
company also specializes in advertising, research and political
organizing for corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The Evolution
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, corporations rarely used any of these
techniques. Grass-roots mobilizations were the province of
environmentalists, the civil rights movement or the anti-war
effort. Television advertising on legislation would have been
considered an extravagant waste of money.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1980s, campaign strategists looking for ways to
keep a stable business during off-years and corporations looking
for a better way to argue their case found common ground.
</P>
<P>
   Sewell, who made the transition from Democratic politics,
recalls that his first experience with the industry he now
specializes in came when AT&AMP;T, after it was forced by regulators to
spin off the regional phone companies, hired the political public
relations company where he then worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't know what they were asking for '' he said. ``They
thought they needed something like what was in a political
campaign. We didn't know quite what to make of it, but we started
developing programs whereby we understood that just like a member
of Congress has a constituency, a corporation has a constituency.
Our job was to go and identify that constituency and mobilize that
constituency to advocate a point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then such campaigns have become pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   New forms of communication like the Internet, e-mail, talk radio
and computerized ``blast faxes'' have made it far easier to
organize national constituencies and instantly instruct them on
when to deluge Congress in letters and phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the congressional gift ban cut down on
opportunities for traditional lobbyists to wine and dine lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   And as party discipline has waned, members of Congress have also
proved ever more responsive to television advertising or contacts
from home, or the ups and downs of instantly sampled public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have entrepreneurial politicians not disciplined by the
party but by their own images,'' Murphy said. ``The mainspring in
this is that public opinion counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least the element of public opinion that is marshaled by
the paid organizers and image makers. ``There may be a lot of
people who agree with your position but they will never get
involved,'' Sewell said. ``It's our job to find the people who
would agree with the position and get them involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Television Advertising
</P>
<P>
   Often these days, it is television advertising that frames the
terms of discussion for the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when the Health Insurance Association of America
used its $17 million ``Harry and Louise'' commercials to help
defeat Clinton's plan for universal health insurance, the effort
was pioneering.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big gamble in that nobody had done this kind of thing
on that scale before,'' said Ben Goddard, a partner in the Malibu
company, Goddard-Claussen/First Tuesday, that made the commercials,
in which a middle-aged couple agonized in their kitchen about
Clinton's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Now Goddard's company has its own Washington office. And
television advertising recently crossed another milestone. The
estimated $40 million advertising campaign that the five largest
tobacco companies used this spring to defeat anti-tobacco
legislation was the most expensive and sustained issue advocacy
campaign ever undertaken on legislation, according to the Annenberg
Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Such advertising campaigns are usually accompanied by
industry-run mobilizations of the grass roots, intended to make
average citizens the advocates for the paying corporate clients.
Sometimes the advertisements help lobbyists find those sympathizers
by running toll-free telephone numbers for people to call.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these efforts still amount to easily spotted
carpet-bombing of Congress with mass-generated form letters and
telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who sponsored the
anti-tobacco bill, was swamped with form letters opposing his
legislation from members of the National Smokers Alliance. The
alliance receives financing from the Philip Morris Companies Inc.,
the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. and the Lorillard Tobacco Co.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, also received letters opposing his
position on tobacco _ from one particular part of his state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't figure out why I would get all these letters from
one area,'' Harkin said. ``It turns out they work for a Kraft food
plant owned by R.J. Reynolds. But there was no disclosure of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the practitioners who create grass-roots lobbying
campaigns for business say that at their best, they mobilize real
people with a sincere interest in the cause _ sometimes company
employees, shareholders, retirees or vendors and sometimes
individuals carefully selected through sophisticated demographic
research.
</P>
<P>
   Take the campaign waged this year by the nation's credit unions
to preserve their memberships in the face of a Supreme Court ruling
that federal regulators had overstepped when they allowed small
employee groups, too small to form their own credit union, to join
others.
</P>
<P>
   To pass their legislation over the opposition from the banks,
the credit unions hired a large Washington cast of lobbyists,
strategists and public relations specialists to mount an issue
campaign that would take advantage of the fact that credit unions
have loyal customers who favor them over banks. One person familiar
with the campaign said it has cost about $12 million over two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The strategists deployed every weapon in the lobbying arsenal,
including television commercials, talk radio, letter-writing
campaigns and toll-free numbers that customers could use to call
Congress. The campaign culminated in a rally of 7,000 supporters on
the West Lawn of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Gill, a former Democratic campaign coordinator for House
races who was the credit unions' chief strategist, said, ``Members
of Congress had a classic dilemma. They want the support of their
local banks and their campaign contributions, but they also want
the votes of over 100,000 credit union people who really care about
this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The credit unions were not loath to do fund raising too. Some
credit union members paid $25 to $100 apiece to hold special
fund-raisers for specific lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bankers Association had its own in-house
specialists in ``grass-roots'' lobbying, but decided that it would
not run the same kind of campaign as the credit unions. ``We knew
from our polling and focus groups and others this was not a battle
we would be able to win in terms of grass-roots volume,'' said
Yingling, the chief lobbyist for the association. ``We had to win
it in terms of the quality of the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the last two weeks before the Senate was to vote, the
banks did turn to a toll-free number to generate thousands of
telegrams to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   After this summer's loss, Yingling said his group was
re-examining its budget for future grass-roots efforts. ``This is
just going to continue to escalate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What Does It Mean
</P>
<P>
   These changes in lobbying are taking place at the same time that
party politics is metamorphosing in the television age, with
fund-raisers replacing block captains and the public increasingly
cut off from either main party. And some say these lobbying efforts
are the politics of the future. ``It's like the election industry
back in the '70s,'' Lunde said. ``There was no such thing then.
This is the same thing. It's the next generation of political
campaign in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners differed over whether the new practices were
reinvigorating participation or squelching it.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck of Texas said that his sales tax movement gives citizens
a chance to dictate an agenda to Congress instead of acting like
vassals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a form of contemporary feudalism,'' he said.
``Now how do you reverse that in a relatively benign way? A loud
demonstration to the electorate that they do not have to be a
supplicant with respect to a very important issue for them. And if
they are interested in this and run with it to the extent that the
polling, focus groups and test markets suggest they will, it will
be a leverage point for creating a different view of government by
the average person.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that so much money is being poured into these
efforts that their true purpose is to drown out competing
viewpoints. ``The whole effort of these campaigns is to prevent a
second opinion from occurring,'' said David Cohen, a co-director of
the Advocacy Institute, which teaches citizens groups how to make
their cases.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who was one of the leaders of the
fight for lobbying disclosure, said that the problem with some of
the techniques is that they can create a distorted picture when
firms are paid to generate a certain number of phone calls or
telegrams and keep canvassing the citizenry until they meet the
quota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly a member of Congress is getting 50 phone calls on
something,'' Levin said. ``That's a lot of phone calls. What the
member doesn't know is that 950 other people were contacted and
said, `No way.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So it looks like you are being inundated,'' Levin said. ``It
creates the perception of huge support or opposition when in
reality there may be no such thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grass Tops
</P>
<P>
   Because mass mobilizations have become so prevalent, a number of
companies have become experts in a technique known as
``grass-tops'' lobbying, aimed at mobilizing an elite as opposed to
the masses.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to figure out to whom a member of Congress cannot
say no _ his chief donor, his campaign manager, a political mentor.
The lobbyist then tries to persuade that person to take his
client's side on an issue. If the method works, the member of
Congress may never know that a person contacting him had been
revved up by a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   To pull off this feat, Washington lobbying and public relations
agencies keep databases of organizers across the country _ most of
them with backgrounds in politics _ who are intimately familiar
with local politicians. Richard Pinsky of West Palm Beach, Fla.,
who managed Dole's Florida primary campaign in 1996, is one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Pinsky said that in the past five years he has been hired by
three Washington public relations and lobbying companies on a
variety of legislation before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with Florida a swing delegation in a House fight over
trade, the Dewey Square Group, a public relations firm, relied on
Pinsky to find prominent citizens to lobby targeted House members
to support giving Clinton ``fast-track'' trade negotiating
authority.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Pinsky said, he asked Robert Martinez, Florida's
former Republican governor, who has an international trade
practice, to reach Rep. Jim Davis, a Democratic freshman. ``It
wasn't necessarily that a former Republican governor would have
influence on a Democratic congressman,'' Pinsky said, ``as that the
governor lived in his district.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis _ who did come to support the president _ said that he had
independently sought to speak with the former governor. And he said
it did not matter if Pinsky had also spoken with Martinez because
``I knew he had a business interest in promoting trade,'' he said.
``I took it into account.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that if someone without an obvious interest reached
him him on an issue because of the involvement of a Washington
lobbying firm, he would want to know about the role of the
intermediaries.

 &HT;    Eaton to close plant in Austin
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Eaton Corp., reacting to the prolonged
semiconductor slump, will close its 239-employee Austin
semiconductor equipment plant and transfer its operations to
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it will lay off 200 workers in Austin starting
Dec. 1. It will phase out production at the Austin plant, located
on Spectrum Drive near RM 620, by March 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At least 40 workers will be asked to move to Beverly, Mass.,
where the company's semiconductor equipment business is based.
Another 30 Eaton employees will remain in Austin to support and
service Eaton equipment installed in local chip manufacturing
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The move is part of the restructuring of Eaton's semiconductor
equipment business that will include eliminating 275 jobs outside
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The parent company, Eaton Corp. of Cleveland, will take a $42
million charge against earnings in the current quarter to pay for
the restructuring. The company expects to take additional charges
of about $4 million in each of the following two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton, like other chip-equipment makers, is feeling the impact
of lower semiconductor sales around the world. Chip makers have
postponed new factories and expansions, which hurts demand for
equipment makers such as Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see any light at the end of the tunnel,'' said
Maureen Hart, an Easton spokeswoman. ``We don't see the market
coming back until the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to lose $80 million this year in its
semiconductor equipment business with revenue down 50 percent, Hart
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin plant makes ion implantation equipment, which is used
to bombard silicon wafers with precise amounts of chemical
impurities -- called dopants _ to change their electrical
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   The $15 million plant was completed in 1996 to accommodate the
company's business expansion in Austin, where Eaton has had
manufacturing operations for nearly two decades. Employment peaked
around 400 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton becomes the latest Austin casualty in the long-running
slump, which began late last year. Other semiconductor and related
companies cutting jobs include Applied Materials Inc., many of
Applied's suppliers, and Motorola Inc., which has offered a sizable
voluntary severance plan. Motorola is signaling to workers that it
will eliminate jobs if enough employees leave the company
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton officials said they examined other alternatives before
deciding to close. ``In the final analysis, we took the action that
we felt would best preserve our business for the future and be in
the best interests of our entire work force,'' said Mary Puma, vice
president and general manager of the Implant Systems Division.
</P>
<P>
   All Austin full-time workers will receive severance pay,
extended medical benefits and outplacement services.
</P>
<P>
   After it cuts 475 jobs, Eaton Semiconductor expects to have
1,050 workers worldwide. The company is the second largest maker of
ion implantation devices. It also makes other semiconductor
manufacturing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said companies like Eaton are making cutbacks now
because forecasts indicate that an upturn is at least a year away.
</P>
<P>
   Pathfinder Research of San Jose, Calif., said its latest
forecast calls for the chip industry revenues to shrink by 12
percent this year to $120 billion. The research firm says the
industry may grow modestly in 1999 if the world economy doesn't
weaken further.
</P>
<P>
   The parent company is a $7.6 billion maker of equipment for the
automobile, industrial, construction, commercial and semiconductor
markets.

 &HT;    Group: Texas utilities charge unfairly
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas electric utilities should not be allowed
to force their customers to pay $4.5 billion in debt for nuclear
power plants if the power industry is opened to competition, a
consumer advocate group said Tuesday in a national report released
in Washington, D.C., and Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ratepayers are being robbed to reward risky investments,''
said Brenda Barron, a spokeswoman in Austin for the U.S. Public
Interest Research Group. The public interest group, founded by
consumer crusader Ralph Nader, is a member of the Safe Energy
Communication Council, which wrote the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report estimated a $4.5 billion payment in Texas would cost
residential households $265 each and commercial customers $1,297
each. The $4.5 billion figure, based on competition beginning in
2001, came from a study by the Texas Public Utility Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities have said that, if competition is allowed, they could
lose their investments in nuclear power plants because they won't
be able to produce power as cheaply as newer ones, especially those
burning natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Calling that potentially lost investment ``stranded costs,'' the
industry argues that since those investments were approved by the
government and are included in current rates, customers should not
be allowed to escape them by going to another power supplier. The
Association of Electric Companies of Texas says that ``the recovery
of stranded costs is essential'' if competition is allowed.
</P>
<P>
   But Barron said that ``every dollar paid in stranded costs is
simply an admission of how much consumers have been overcharged all
along.''
</P>
<P>
   The council's report compared estimated stranded costs in 11
states; the total was $112 billion, with California tops at $28.5
billion and New York next at $17.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' comparatively low $4.5 billion is deceptive, the report
said, because it assumes competition will not start until 2001. In
the meantime, as consumers pay their monthly bills, they're paying
down the costs of those nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Barron at the Austin press conference in the Capitol was
an unlikely ally: Peggy Venable, a spokeswoman for a
business-backed group, Texas Citizens for a Sound Economy.
</P>
<P>
   Part of a national group, Texas Citizens for a Sound Economy
claims 27,000 members here. Venable said members provide about
one-third of the organization's funding; corporations about
one-third; and foundations that support free market activities
about one-third. She said the organization has a policy of not
disclosing the names of its corporate contributors. The group
favors competition as a way of forcing electric rates down.
</P>
<P>
   Venable said consumers should not be forced to pay stranded
costs, but she and Barron split on one important point: whether it
would be worthwhile for consumers to pay some stranded costs if
that is the only way to get competition started.
</P>
<P>
   Barron said that if consumers have to pay any stranded costs,
competition should not be allowed. The public interest group and
others favor competition, under the right conditions, as a way to
promote development of renewable energy resources.
</P>
<P>
   Venable said utility shareholders should be required to pay some
of the stranded costs for poor investments by utility management,
but that the benefits of competition would be large enough to
justify a compromise in which consumers paid some of the stranded
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Several major states, including California and Pennsylvania,
have begun opening their utilities to competition. In Texas,
competition is allowed for wholesale purchases of power but retail
sales are still regulated by state and local governments. The
Legislature is expected to consider competition when it convenes in
January.

 &HT;    Author remembers growing up Jewish in the South
 &HT;    By Christine Evans
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Yes, indeed, Aaron Bronson, a Russian
Jew from the old country, made himself a life, and an unusual one,
plunking his family down smack dab in the middle of a tiny
Tennessee town back in the days when some folks still thought Jews
had horns _ and weren't too shy to come knocking to get a peek at
the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am, sonny. Here's your Jew,'' said Bronson to one such
inquisitive young man, who, after a good look up and down at the
specimen, registered his keen disappointment at the absence of
horns atop the head of the only Jew he had ever met: ``But by
golly, Mr. Bronson,'' he cried, ``you won't do atall!''
</P>
<P>
   Ever the gentleman, ``Mr. Bronson'' apologized for moving to
town without the proper equipment: ``I sure am sorry about the
horns,'' he said. ``I got to tell you them kind of Jews have gone
out of style. None of the new kind have horns.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is just one of the lessons the natives learn in The Jew
Store, a family memoir by Boca Raton author Stella Suberman about
growing up among the goyim in a town Suberman calls Concordia, an
isolated pocket of northwestern Tennessee where the Klan runs
strong, Lord help you if you ain't in church on Sundays, and don't
you know if you plop your feet up on the front porch for five
minutes in the afternoon you're pretty much guaranteed half the
town will pass by to hand-deliver the morning gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Suberman, a first-time author at age 76, decided to write her
book after waiting in vain for somebody else to tell the story of
Jews who, like her daddy, crossed the Mason-Dixon Line in the early
20th century to open the so-called ``Jew Stores'' that sold soft
goods and sundries to poorer residents (sharecroppers, factory
workers, blacks) and came to dot the Southern landscape like
blackberries on a pie.
</P>
<P>
   This slice of Southern-Jewish history, it seemed to her, was a
rich but rarely noticed thread in the American cultural tapestry _
not to mention, a mighty fine yarn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had all this stuff in my mind for years and years,'' says
the author, who looks a good 15 years younger than her age with her
feet propped up in the bright yellow living room of her old Florida
home, which happens to be under chaotic renovation _ where are
those old photos of Concordia, anyway? _ beneath the oak trees in a
tucked-away corner in Boca.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concordia was the biggest event in our lives, and we told
stories about it endlessly around the dinner table. So all this
stuff just kept percolating. I wrote it down, worked at it off and
on for a decade, and the pages kept piling up, piling up. Finally I
thought, `My God, I've just got to do it.' And finally I just
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally being the important word here. Suberman first tried
telling the tale in the voice of a young girl, just as she was in
Concordia _ but soon scrapped that version in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I deplore this book,' and my husband did not like it,
either. He said, `Well, it's juvenile and it doesn't sound a bit
like you.' I had probably spent a year on it already, but after I
decided to use a more mature voice, I went very happily every
morning to my desk. I knew I had a story. I knew it was a story
that needed to be told. So I said I'm going to redo this book and
I'm going to do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, well past the age most folks retire, Suberman, who used
to review books for newspapers and work for art museums, found
herself at a tiny oak desk in her cluttered loft study, pecking
away on a word processor that has not yet heard of e-mail. The
low-tech arrangement worked quite well, apparently, because out
came something that closely resembled a manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   Suberman sent it off to Louis Rubin Jr., a writer and founder of
Algonquin Books and also, as it happened, a friend of Suberman's
husband, Jack, a retired dean of humanities at Florida Atlantic
University. Rubin thought she was on to something but told her to
make up her mind whether she wanted to publish a novel or a memoir.
She considered the matter for about 60 seconds before deciding.
Memoir.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin forwarded the revised manuscript to Algonquin, where
editors loved it, and The Jew Store was born _ after Suberman
persuaded her publisher to accept the in-your-face title, on the
grounds that, back then, that's exactly what everybody called it.
``I told them, it's the only title that does justice to the book.
Nowadays it sounds like you're saying the unsayable, but back then
it was just a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   In The Jew Store, which is earning glowing reviews, Suberman
chronicles the minor dramas and misadventures of an assorted and
lively cast of characters, the names of whom have all been changed
by the author, who found herself suddenly in the grip of Southern
civility and the notion that there's no call to stomp hurt feelings
into people when you don't have to. (She also decided to change the
name of the town, but, as she writes in the prologue, what happened
there is ``pretty much the truth, or, as my father would say,
`close enough so nobody argues about it.''')
</P>
<P>
   Featured characters include her amiable, optimistic father; her
timid and perpetually worried mother; her studious brother and
charismatic sister. There's also a plump, crusading townswoman
named Miss Brookie Simmons, who lives in a house that looks like a
``white-iced, sat-on cake,'' her bigoted but powerful cousin, Tom
Dillon, and a delightfully wise black housekeeper, Lizzie Maud, who
must take a back seat in Southern society but nonetheless manages
to run things.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in 1920, when Aaron Bronson and his wife Reba
move their young family to Concordia (anyone who knows their way
around the South can probably find the real town on the map) after
a few years in Nashville, where Aaron received some training under
a Jewish shopkeeper. Sure, Nashville is the South, but there,
unlike Concordia, there were other Jewish families with whom to
commiserate, and also, as Suberman writes, ``the prospect of a
glass of tea in the afternoons with the rabbi's wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Nashville, the Bronson family had enjoyed or at least
endured the rattle and din of a busy Jewish enclave in the Bronx.
And now, suddenly, here they were in the boonies, in a place, noted
Reba Bronson incredulously, where women constantly grabbed up
brooms to sweep the dirt from dirt yards. ``Whoever heard?''
</P>
<P>
   It took guts and maybe a little mishegoss (craziness) for a
Jewish family to set up shop in the South. But Bronson prided
himself on being a ``BORN SALESMAN'' _ his daughter imagines a big,
neon sign flashing in his head _ and to him a business opportunity
was a business opportunity, even if to seize it you had to move
your kosher household across the Mason-Dixon to a place where folks
fry chicken in bacon drippings.
</P>
<P>
   While Suberman's mother took comfort in the notion that the
family's stay in Concordia was only ``tem-po-rary,'' her father set
about making a living. His first task, finding a space on First
Street in which to open his store, was one of the hardest, for
certainly not everybody wanted a Jew for a neighbor. For a moment,
he wondered if he would be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He began to face facts: the accent that he now knew he had,
his lack of an education, his size ... he was an undersized Jew
pitted against Gentile giants.
</P>
<P>
   He could only think that everything was a failure, and it was
his fault: He had been done in by his chutzpah, his arrogance. What
had made him think that his born sal-es-man-ship would open
doors?''
</P>
<P>
   But an optimist such as Aaron Bronson does not easily go down,
and soon enough he had played the worst qualities of two unsavory
characters off each other, and soon after that he proudly opened
Bronson's Low-Priced Store (and displayed the name in big gold
letters, so people wouldn't confuse low-priced with cheap).
</P>
<P>
   From there, Stella Suberman's memoir does read quite a bit like
a novel, as the store thrives, the Klan agitates, and when the town
falls on hard times, it is Aaron Bronson, the outsider, who
conceives a plan to save it.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to open The Jew Store without becoming
mesmerized by the rich mix of language, the oys and Lordys and
other Southern and Yiddish expressions that sit together on a page
the way the Bronsons sat on front porches with their Southern
neighbors: Tom Dillon is ``at the boil, like a pot of wash in a
Southern backyard;'' Reba Bronson frets about the Klan with an
``oyoyoy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bronsons were never the same after their move to Concordia,
and the same might certainly be said of the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good-bye to you Jews,'' a Southern boy declares at the end.
``Having Jews here was the best thing Concordia ever done.''

 &HT;    Employees surprised by changes in benefits at NCR
 &HT;    By Jim Dillon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ NCR Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Lars
Nyberg warned employees last week that pending changes in employee
medical benefits are significant. But some employees were still
caught off guard by one major change.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton-based maker of large database systems, automatic
teller machines and electronic cash registers outlined changes in
employee benefits last week to reduce costs and get its benefits
more in line with those offered by competitors. The changes take
effect. Jan 1.
</P>
<P>
   The changes include having employees, for the first time in
company history, pay a portion of their health-care coverage;
increasing the amount employees pay for generic and prescription
drugs; cutting the number of health maintenance organizations
available to employees from 70 to 53; and more than doubling the
dental deductible for basic and major care.
</P>
<P>
   The change that seems to be raising the most ire is the
elimination of supplemental Medicare coverage.
</P>
<P>
   New hires will not receive supplemental Medicare coverage when
they retire. The company's current plan covers about 10 percent of
a retiree's health care costs, while Medicare covers about 45
percent. The retiree is responsible for the remaining 45 percent,
NCR officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, active employees will not receive supplemental
Medicare coverage when they retire unless they turn 64 by Dec. 31.
This clause covers 64 active employees.
</P>
<P>
   No changes in supplemental coverage are planned for retirees who
are at least 65.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Victor de Groote III is dismayed by the change. Although
he has worked for NCR for 41 years, he will lose the supplemental
coverage because he will be four months shy of turning 64 at the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it very appalling that they have done this,'' said de
Groote, a systems engineer. ``I either have to find the insurance
myself or pay the difference myself. But how am I going to build a
fund in the amount of time I have left?''
</P>
<P>
   de Groote said he plans to appeal his case to the company and
hopes it will extend him coverage. But he doubts he will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Tricia Bell called the change ``scary.'' Her husband, Bob, left
NCR on long-term disability in December 1995 after 29 years of
service after he was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's
disease. Alzheimer's is a progressive, irreversible disease that
often leads to severe dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bell said she and her husband were counting on that
supplemental coverage to help offset anticipated medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, NCR officials say the company's supplemental Medicare
coverage provided little value to retirees. Less than half of all
U.S. companies offer such coverage, officials said, although 11 of
17 high-tech companies NCR measured itself against offer the
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Sawyer, director of global pensions and benefits for NCR,
said there's little chance the supplemental coverage will be
reinstituted.

JOHN CAGE BEFORE HE LET GO  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Sonatas and Interludes are either the sins of John Cage's
youth or else the last of his important music. It depends on what
you think music is, and Cage had some different ideas about that.
</P>
<P>
   The longest of these 20 pieces is a little over four minutes,
the shortest not quite two. What made them different from the other
music being written in 1948 was the medium: the prepared piano, in
which keyboard sound is transformed by strategic insertions of
foreign objects onto or between the piano strings.
</P>
<P>
   What made these pieces pretty much the same as pieces around
them was their man-made-ness: every tone, moment in time and sound
color having been calculated by human faculties to create a
preordained effect.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after writing the Sonatas and Interludes, Cage drifted
in the direction the rest of his life was to follow: the
celebration of the chance happening, the natural event eavesdropped
upon. Music became not an object to be handled and examined but a
state of awareness beckoning to whatever experience might cross
one's path.
</P>
<P>
   Attached to a new version of the Sonatas and Interludes, played
by Aleck Karis and recorded by Bridge, is Cage himself in 1982,
reading a paper called ``Composition in Retrospect,'' which he
wrote the year before. ``The music is always going on,'' he says
several times. ``It is we who turn away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of a later Cage piece as a light switch going on, a nudge
in the shoulder, a pointed finger. It says to its audience,
``Listen to what is going on around you.'' As Cage reads, ``All
that is needed is a frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Karis' program note regales us with a (literally) nuts-and-bolts
description of the prepared piano. We begin with Cage's discovery
that pianos could be not only attacked in unconventional ways in
the manner of Henry Cowell but also temporarily disfigured with the
use of ``screws, nuts, bolts, bits of rubber and plastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Karis complains about modern hardware's high zinc content and
therefore its diminished resonance. Seek out original instruments,
he advises. (The early-music movement strikes again.) Cage's
directions for their placement, writes Karis, are specific but make
allowances for the differing dimensions in the inner workings of
various pianos.
</P>
<P>
   The composer's meddlings do not so much enhance the sonority of
the grand piano as blunt and dull it into thuds, thocks and buzzes.
The piano's normal soft-pedal mechanism shifts the inner hammer
chassis slightly to the side, allowing only one of a key's three
strings to be struck.
</P>
<P>
   Cage takes advantage of the process and thus increases the
variety of tuned and untuned sounds; perhaps two strings will be
prepared and the third not.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the implications of equal temperament are
neutralized. Pianos are tuned today with major and minor keys in
mind. Within every tone there is a latent energy, an implied
direction: F sharp yearns to rise into G; B flat wants to fall back
into A.
</P>
<P>
   Cage's method turns the tightly wound individual sound into
something duller, wider, vaguer. One shifts between recognizable
tones and toneless percussion strokes.
</P>
<P>
   The result hovers and dangles like an Indonesian gamelan
orchestra. Music is no longer driven by a compositional ego toward
a destination; it sits there, a pure heart emptied of self. Cage
quotes from Thoreau: ``I want my writing to be as clear as water I
can see through, so that what I experience is told without my being
in any way in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonatas and Interludes are, as Karis points out, space-age
Scarlatti sonatas straight out of the 18th century. The form is
binary: AABB, or two sections with repeats. These are like vestiges
of the Enlightenment, contained little worlds that place their
trust in order and still treat man as a controller of his destiny.
</P>
<P>
   The ``mature'' Cage practiced the art of helplessness; his music
made us into observers of what may or may not happen.
</P>
<P>
   The musical movement, however, is far from Scarlatti. Sonata No.
15 offers near-endless repetition of a single motif while
stretching and contracting its length. On the other hand, the last
Sonata (No. 16), with its dotted rhythms and mordents, acts as a
kind of satirical farewell to the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas pieces like ``Atlas Eclipticalis'' or ``HPSCHD'' are
perhaps better thought about than listeed to, the Sonatas and
Interludes are a constant delight to the ear. The sounds are
beautiful, and their arrangement mingles expectation and surprise.
</P>
<P>
   What did an older Cage think of his youthful follies? That he
later encouraged performers to violate the precisions of the
Sonatas and Interludes adds up to an indirect disclaimer.
``Self-alteration,'' not self-expression, became Cage's goal. The
burden of creativity shifts from composer to listener.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonatas and Interludes, despite their exquisite
artificiality, have another kind of selflessness. It is the way
their elements seem to sway and bump into one another, like
calibrated wind chimes. It makes them less testaments of the human
agenda than receptacles for God's beauties.
</P>
<P>
   Cage was to go farther by leaving the calibrations behind. We
are asked, in Cage's words, to ``welcome whatever happens next.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonatas and Interludes are an interlude in themselves. They
bear the marks of human intervention, yet in other ways, they are
blissfully happy to be overpowered by nature. Bearing the freight
of both past and future, these little pieces are like a fragile
fleet of ships making their way between an old world and a newer
one.

 &HT;    Yom Kippur holiday inspire young, old
 &HT;    By Carmen M. Henderson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARREN CO., Ohio _ Josh Rovai has become a key member of his
Jewish temple by learning in the past three years to play the
shofar, a ram's horn used as part of today's Yom Kippur observance.
</P>
<P>
   For Rovai, 17, it's been a way to learn more about his faith.
For about 120 Jewish families in Warren County, his mastery of the
shofar is a clear call to worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very unusual for a young person to get involved (in the
temple),'' said Joyce Lucht, 52, of Springboro.
</P>
<P>
   She and Rovai are members of Temple Beth Sholom in Middletown,
and join the county's religious minority in marking their faith's
holiest days. The Jewish community has spent the past 10 days
praying for forgiveness during Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year,
and Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The holidays) are as important to Jews as Easter is to
Christians,'' Lucht said.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of these holy days is already clear to Rovai, a
Lebanon High School senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend all day at the temple to have service and prayer. We
pray for forgiveness and to become a better person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rovai, played the shofar for his congregation during Rosh
Hashana on Sept. 20. It's much like playing a trumpet, which Rovai
learned as a fifth-grader, Rovai said. Another member of the temple
congregation helped him learn how to play the ram's horn, an honor
usually reserved for an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best shofar player I have ever heard, I don't know
who will replace him next year (when he goes to college),'' said
Sondra Ross, president of the temple.
</P>
<P>
   Rovai's mother, Cynthia, said she is proud of her son doing
something special for their congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Rovai's accomplishment is all the more unusual considering the
size of the Jewish community in Warren County. Only about 1,800
people in the county are Jewish, according the the 1990 U.S.
census. Only about 50 families from the county are active members
of Temple Beth Sholom. They must drive to Middletown or Dayton or
Cincinnati to join a congregation.
</P>
<P>
   The distance is not great for Rovai, who appreciates what a
unique role he plays in the religious life of Warren County's Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was honored that the congregation picked me,'' he said.

GERMANY'S GREENS: CAN THEY PUT `CHAOS' BEHIND THEM?

<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ It has been a roller-coaster year for Germany's
environmentalist Greens. They have zigzagged on German troop
deployment in Bosnia, called for a near-tripling of gasoline
prices, only to shelve the idea, gone back and forth on what to do
about NATO and finally found themselves a likely member of
Germany's new government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have shown a certain amount of chaos,'' said Harald
Haendel, a spokesman for the party that seems almost certain to
form a ``Red-Green'' coalition with the Social Democrats of
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder. ``The chaos was a reflection of
a lack of organization, and we now intend to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   But can the Greens, founded in 1979 as a loose coalition of
pacifists, environmentalists, socialists and feminists, evolve from
the freewheeling ways of opposition into a cohesive party of
government that speaks with a single voice?
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, who is to begin coalition talks with the Greens on
Friday, clearly has concerns. ``The Social Democratic Party stands
for economic stability, law and order and continuity in foreign
policy,'' he told the mass-circulation newspaper Bild in an
interview published on Tuesday. ``This is not negotiable.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, closing nuclear power stations that produce a
third of Germany's energy _ a Green demand _ is incompatible with
``economic stability.'' Legalizing soft drugs like marijuana _ a
Green demand _ is incompatible with ``law and order.'' Opposing
NATO expansion _ a Green demand _ is incompatible with ``continuity
in foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, officials indicated, some of Schroeder's concerns
are shared, although it is widely believed that the Greens, hungry
for a power they have never tasted, will prove pragmatic, allowing
the party's most influential figure, Joschka Fischer, a possible
foreign minister, to hold his eclectic followers to NATO policies.
</P>
<P>
   The United States therefore expects periodic irritations _
protests from some party members on NATO expansion, hesitations
over any NATO military action in Kosovo, resolute opposition to
imports of American foods that have been genetically modified _
rather than any serious confrontation with the Greens.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing the unease over the unpredictability they have shown
this year, the Greens announced on Tuesday a reorganization of the
party aimed at wresting some power from local organizations and
increasing centralized control.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, such moves have been resisted, because they smacked
of excessive hierarchy. Even the term ``leader'' has been shunned
because it was a far cry from the sandal-wearing spontaneity of the
party's birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to carry out structural reforms that will lead to a
truly federal party,'' Heide Ruehle, the party manager, said in a
radio interview. ``At the moment, we are a kind of loose collective
of very strong local groups with their own rules and funding, who
have pushed the central party around a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, about 80 percent of the party's financing has gone to
state units of the Greens, and only 20 percent to the central
organization. As a result, Haendel said, the party had little
central control, and ``we have been talking with different
tongues.''
</P>
<P>
   This was evident at a party congress in Magdeburg in March that
turned into a fiasco, when, despite Fischer's pleas, the party came
out against the continued participation of German troops in the
NATO mission in Bosnia. To Fischer's horror, the congress also
voted for the taxes that would sharply increase gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   Both those positions were later revised as their unpopularity
and the obstacles they would pose to an alliance with the Social
Democrats became clear.
</P>
<P>
   But the old split between ``Fundis'' and ``Realos,'' the
die-hard pacifists and the pragmatists, remains, as does a rivalry
between Fischer and Juergen Trittin, another leading figure whose
criticism of the German army caused an outcry early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the election, for instance, Trittin called for
the closing of Germany's 20 nuclear power plants ``as soon as
possible.'' Fischer was silent on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens now plan to set up a 20-member committee that will
provide greater central control and insure that the positions of
the party's various leading figures are closely coordinated, party
members said.
</P>
<P>
   Haendel, the spokesman, said: ``We want to be serious partners
for our European and Atlantic allies. There are treaties, and these
treaties must be respected. We do not want to turn back the tide of
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while the party has taken a position against NATO
expansion, it recognizes that a decision has been taken and will
abide by it, he said. ``In the long term,'' he added, ``we would
like to see the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
take over many tasks from NATO, but that, I repeat, is a long-term
aim.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, it seems clear that the Greens will work hard
to agree on a solid four-year government program with Schroeder and
to disprove departing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's repeated warning
during the campaign: ``The Green Party platform represents a major
security risk for Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be a major adjustment for a party unused to the
strictures of government or central organization. The adjustment
will have to made quickly. Officials said on Tuesday that Schroeder
wanted to be sworn in by Oct. 22 so he can attend a European Union
summit meeting in Austria later that week.

RED SOX ROUT INDIANS, 11-3, AND EXORCISE A FEW DEMONS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ED BROUSSARD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The talk was of curses and ghosts and failures.
Names like Babe Ruth and Bill Buckner were mentioned. All the
Boston Red Sox heard about was doom as they prepared for their
American League division series with the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday at Jacobs Field, the Red Sox averted history as well
as they averted the badgering about their prior postseason
problems. Slamming three Indians pitchers out of their home ball
park, Boston defeated Cleveland 11-3 in Game 1 to take control of
this best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the robust swing of Mo Vaughn, who used his bat to
exorcise personal as well as franchise demons, the Red Sox won
their first postseason game since beating the Mets in Game 5 of the
World Series on Oct. 23, 1986. After losing the final two games of
that series _ Game 6 largely because of Buckner's infamous error at
first base _ Boston was swept in three consecutive series, a string
of 13 games that kept prattle about the Curse of the Bambino alive.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, weary of the media's constant history lessons, did his
part to end them as quickly as possible, smashing a Jaret Wright
fastball an estimated 376 feet into the left-field bleachers to
drive in Darren Lewis and John Valentin in the top of the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite-field home run came on a full count, put the Red
Sox up 3-0 and ended Vaughn's 0-for-14 playoff slump, one that
occurred while Boston was being swept in three games by Cleveland
in 1995. Despite turning stone cold that October, Vaughn won the
American League's Most Valuable Player award. A strong MVP
candidate again this year, there will be no postseason crumble to
sully his achievement should he win it for a second time.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the home run that allowed Boston pitcher Pedro
Martinez to take the mound with a three-run cushion in his first
career playoff game, Vaughn smacked a two-run homer in the sixth
and a two-run double in the eighth to equal Edgar Martinez's major
league single-game playoff record of seven RBI, set in 1995 against
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted an opportunity to get here again,'' said Vaughn,
who called himself mentally unprepared for the 1995 playoffs. ``I
knew I was going to have a better approach to the situation. I'm a
bit older now and I'm more experienced. We had gone 13 games
without a playoff win and we handled that and for me to get off
that 0-for-14 is definitely nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Vaughn's mammoth performance made him the star, the Red
Sox, who will meet the Indians in Game 2 Wednesday afternoon,
rolled because of a team effort. Boston hitters ripped Wright, last
year's rookie sensation who went 3-0 in the postseason, for seven
hits and six earned runs in 4 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   While Wright regrouped after Vaughn's blast to strike out six
batters, Nomar Garciaparra dealt him the death blow in the fifth.
Immediately after Wright struck out Vaughn with two men on base,
the power-hitting shortstop belted one over the left-field wall to
put the Red Sox up 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two bad pitches and six runs, first inning and fifth,''
Indians manager Mike Hargrove said of Wright. ``He just was really
inconsistent and got the ball up.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything but inconsistent, Wright's counterpart, Martinez,
dominated Cleveland's batters until tiring in the sixth. Deftly
mixing curve balls and changeups with his 95 mile-per-hour
fastball, he recorded seven of his eight strikeouts and allowed
just one of his six hits in the first five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Lofton homered after a Sandy Alomar double in the sixth,
and then Jim Thome hit a solo shot in the seventh, but with
Boston's hitters pouncing on relievers Doug Jones and Steve Reed,
it was not enough. Martinez, who dominated Cleveland in the regular
season, exited after seven with his third victory in four starts
this year against the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time around the order, he threw predominantly
fastballs and an occasional changeup,'' Hargrove said. ``The second
time around, he threw a lot of changeups and still threw his
fastball. The third time around he mixed in his breaking ball. His
velocity was good.''
</P>
<P>
   There won't be much velocity on the ball Wednesday when the
Indians face knuckleballer Tim Wakefield (17-8, 4.58 ERA). With his
65 mile-per-hour pitches, Wakefield will give Cleveland a totally
different look, one that earned him two wins and a loss in four
starts against the Indians this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A knuckleball is the toughest pitch that a hitter will ever
have to hit,'' Hargrove said. ``I don't say that lightly. When a
knuckleball pitcher is on his game that day, the other team is in
for a long afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   While Boston started anew in destroying its playoff-game jinx,
Cleveland maintained a dubious postseason streak by losing its
seventh straight series opener. The Indians, however, have overcome
to win three of those series, including two which got them into the
World Series. So with Tuesday's victory, Boston, well aware that
this series is far from over, will have to settle for putting
another opponent to rest _ the playoff ghost of Red Sox past.

JONES LAWYERS PRESS CASE DESPITE TALK OF SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON, CLINTON-SALON) 
(nk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for Paula Jones asked a federal appeals
court in St. Paul, Minn., Tuesday to reinstate her sexual
misconduct lawsuit against President Clinton because, they said, he
lied under oath when he testified that he had not engaged in sexual
relations with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' 25-page brief was immediately placed under seal by
the clerk of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Michael Gans,
who said it could not be released until it was screened for
material that has not yet been made public. Mrs. Jones' lawyers
readily acknowledged, however, that their brief was based heavily
on the report to Congress by Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth
Starr, which alleges that Clinton may have committed offenses
meriting impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report alleges that Clinton lied when he denied under
oath to Jones' lawyers that he had a sexual relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, and that he also encouraged her to lie about it to them.
Clinton has since acknowledged engaging in inappropriate behavior
with Ms. Lewinsky, but he maintains that he did not commit perjury
when he testified in January because what he did with the former
White House intern did not constitute sexual relations as defined
by the judge in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   With a court date in Mrs. Jones' appeal of her lawsuit looming,
her lawyers and Clinton's recently reopened negotiations about
settling. But people in both camps said Tuesday that the two sides
remained far apart on money.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones sued Clinton in 1994, charging that three years
earlier, when he was governor of Arkansas and she was a state
clerical worker, he had her summoned to a hotel room in Little Rock
where he made a crude sexual request. Mrs. Jones' lawyers said they
were asking about Ms. Lewinsky in order to demonstrate a pattern in
Clinton's sexual behavior. In his testimony before the Starr grand
jury, Clinton said that the Jones lawyers were out to embarrass him
and damage him politically.
</P>
<P>
   A federal trial judge in Arkansas dismissed Mrs. Jones' lawsuit
in April, and a three-judge panel is scheduled to hear arguments on
Oct. 20 in St. Paul on her appeal to have the case reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones' lawyers privately contacted the White House earlier
this month and said they would drop the appeal if she were paid $1
million. For the first time, Mrs. Jones' lawyers said she would not
demand any kind of apology to settle the case because Clinton's
admission of a sexual liaison with Ms. Lewinsky made that
unnecessary. People now believe Mrs. Jones was telling the truth,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides made a counteroffer of $500,000 last week, but
that was quickly rejected by the Jones camp. Lawyers for Mrs. Jones
said Tuesday they had not received any new offers from the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a deep dark silence,'' a Jones lawyer said. ``But no
one on our side is blinking.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they were still mulling over what to
do.

SENATE PASSES BILL TO CUT INTEREST RATES FOR STUDENT LOANS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ College students who take out federal loans will
pay the lowest interest rate in decades, saving hundreds of dollars
each, while grants to poorer students will increase by thousands of
dollars under a bill that won final passage in the Senate Tuesday
and is sure to become law.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of students would benefit from the more generous terms
over the next five years. The Senate approved the bill, 96-0, a day
after the House approved it unanimously. Despite reservations about
subsidies for the banks that make most of the loans, the Clinton
administration has embraced the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who is a sponsor of the
measure, estimated that the typical student graduating from college
with $13,000 in debts would save $700 in interest payments. A
student with a loan of $20,000 would save about $1,000 in the five
years it takes to pay back college loans.
</P>
<P>
   In another bonus to recent graduates, the measure extends for
another four months, until next Jan. 31, a window during which they
may go back to the bank and consolidate existing loans at the new
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The lower interest rates for student loans, about three-fourths
of a percentage point below the rates on student loans issued last
year, reflects the general decline in interest rates throughout the
economy as well as changes in how the rates are set. Congress put
the new system into effect earlier this year, but only on a
temporary basis. The legislation makes the system permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the interest rate for borrowers will be the rate
on 91-day Treasury bills plus 1.7 percentage points while the
student is in school, and the Treasury bill rate plus 2.3
percentage points after the student graduates and begins repaying
the loan. The rate could not rise above 8.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, this would result in an interest rate of less than
7.5 percent, compared to just under 8.25 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing costs for students might have gone even lower under a
formula that was to have taken effect this summer, but lenders
contended that the interest rate would have been so low that they
would have to withdraw from the program.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise that passed Tuesday uses a federal subsidy to pay
banks an interest rate that is somewhat higher than what the
students themselves pay.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of all college undergraduates get aid under the
Higher Education Act of 1965, and the federal government is
expected to guarantee 88 million loans over the next 10 years and
to issue more than 25 million Pell grants to low-income students
over the coming five years, sponsors said.
</P>
<P>
   The votes in the House and the Senate to make the aid more
generous is among the few major bills to pass the Congress without
partisan rancor as the legislative session draws to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process in both the House and Senate has been
characterized by a spirit of bipartisanship,'' said Sen. James
Jeffords, R-Vt., who managed the bill in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Next year the maximum annual Pell grant, as the federal aid for
low-income students is known, will rise from $3,000 to $4,500, and
students will be allowed to earn up to $2,200 without losing their
eligibility for the grants. Over the next five years the maximum
Pell grant will rise to $5,800.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the financial aid for students, the bill makes dozens of
changes to federal programs for higher education. It forgives some
loans for students who work in child care or in schools in
low-income neighborhoods, and it increases the budget for college
work-study programs to $1 billion for next year.
</P>
<P>
   But House and Senate conferees rejected a provision that had
passed the Senate amending the welfare law to help welfare
recipients attend college. The provision would have counted two
years of college as meeting the new work requirements for welfare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that increasing financial aid would merely fuel the
engines of academic inflation, lawmakers took a few tentative steps
to hold back the rate of increase in college costs, which have
greatly exceeded the general rate of inflation for years.
</P>
<P>
   One provision in the bill gives parents and students new access
to information from colleges about the factors that are driving
tuition higher. Another cost-saving provision permits colleges to
offer their older faculty members new incentives, such as
additional benefits, to retire voluntarily.

BRAVES TAKE NOTHING FOR GRANTED AGAINST THE CUBS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the Atlanta Braves, everything appears to be in
order.
</P>
<P>
   Their starting rotation, the best in baseball, is well rested.
The players are healthy and confident, having won more games (106)
than any other team in the National League. And the Braves, who
have made the playoffs seven straight times, are playing the
Chicago Cubs, a team that could be emotionally and physically
drained after a thrilling journey to the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   So why did the Braves sound so cautious Tuesday?
</P>
<P>
   Because despite their regular-season success, the Braves have
just one World Series championship to show for it. Having tasted
disappointment in the playoffs before, the Braves take nothing for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's tremendous pressure in the first round,'' said John
Smoltz (17-3), who will start Game 1 for Atlanta at Turner Field on
Wednesday afternoon against Mark Clark (9-14). ``We've yet to lose
in the first round, but that's a scary position to be in, when
you're favored, and you're supposed to go to the World Series.
Three out of five, anybody can beat anybody. There's not a team in
the playoffs right now that doesn't have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta's chances look better because of its pitching, with
Smoltz followed by Tom Glavine (20-6) in Game 2 and Greg Maddux
(18-9) in Game 3. And with proven offensive stars like Chipper
Jones and Andres Galarraga, the Braves have enough experience,
balance and talent to play well into October.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, however, are in the midst of a magical season. They
won the wild card tiebreaker by beating the San Francisco Giants,
5-3, Monday night at Wrigley Field. And with Sammy Sosa on their
side, the Cubs know they have the ability to strike lightning. By
hitting 66 home runs, and dueling with Mark McGwire for the home
run title into the final weekend of the season, Sosa became an
international star and a folk hero in Chicago. He would only add to
his mystique if he could lead the Cubs to their first World Series
appearance since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the Braves have discussed how they will pitch to
Sosa. More accurately, they have discussed how they won't pitch to
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to let Sammy beat me,'' said Glavine. ``I'm sure
a lot of guys in this room feel the same way. If a situation arises
that you have to pitch him, then you deal with it. If the bases are
loaded, you've got to pitch to him. But then again, if the bases
are loaded, I'd rather walk him than give up a grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the game, you might be more aggressive with him with
nobody on base because typically a solo home run early won't beat
you. But with runners on base, or later in the game, you try to do
everything you can to let other guys get the key hit. What Sammy
has done all year long speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs received good news Tuesday about Kerry Wood, their
rookie pitching star. Wood has been sidelined with a sore right
elbow, but he threw well on Monday in Arizona, and he is expected
to pitch in this series. Manager Jim Riggleman would not commit to
a starter beyond Game 1, but Kevin Tapani (19-9) is likely for Game
2, and either Wood (13-6) or Steve Trachsel (15-8) could pitch Game
3.
</P>
<P>
   While starting pitching will be important, the bullpens may
decide the series. Chicago's closer, Rod Beck, has been overworked
during the last week, and both he and Terry Mulholland may not have
the arm strength to pitch effectively early in the series.
Wednesday's forecast in Atlanta calls for a chance of rain, and the
Cubs would not mind if their tired arms received an extra day of
rest.
</P>
<P>
   For the Braves, Kerry Ligtenberg has taken over as the closer
this year, but although Ligtenberg had a strong year, it remains to
be seen how he will handle playoff pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are solidly behind him. ``Kerry I think has only
blown three saves, and he's not even being talked about for rookie
of the year,'' said Smoltz. ``It's Rodney Dangerfield. Our bullpen
is not going to get the respect it deserves, based on what we do as
starters. But if they think that getting to our bullpen will be the
source of them winning, I don't think that's the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Cubs beat the Braves six times in nine meetings in
the regular season, another reason for Chicago to feel confident.
The Braves are the favorites. But the Cubs, who spent September
battling to make the playoffs, may have more momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a typical wild card series, and the momentum they
have is important,'' said Smoltz. ``As we stand here today,
everyone thinks we should win this series. But I think anybody can
win it. We're going to have to be hungry.''

WHITE HOUSE CONSIDERS NEW USES FOR SAMPLING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Having lost two decisions in the lower courts,
Clinton administration officials and advocates of statistical
sampling in the 2000 census have begun to think about ways to use a
modified form of the controversial methodology even if they do not
prevail in the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The officials and proponents of the method say recent rulings by
special federal courts in Virginia and the District of Columbia
that held sampling to be illegal only covered using the method to
determine population counts for the allocation of seats among the
states in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Supreme Court agrees with those rulings, officials
said they would still be free _ some say required _ to use the
method to determine how federal money is allocated and to establish
population counts that are provided to states for drawing
boundaries for congressional, state and local legislative
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're really saying is that the court cases and the
arguments by the opponents of the census 2000 plan have been very
limited to apportionment,'' said Robert Shapiro, Undersecretary of
the Commerce Department's Economic Statistics Administration, the
agency that oversees the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Special three-judge panels ruled this summer that the Census
Bureau's plans to use statistical sampling to augment the 2000
census violated the Census Act of 1976. That act stated that
``except for the determination of population for purposes of
apportionment of representatives in Congress among the several
states,'' the Secretary of Commerce shall use statistical sampling
in conducting the census.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers representing proponents of sampling note that
because the statute uses the term ``shall,'' the law requires the
Census Bureau to use sampling to help determine the population for
the allocation of federal funds and for use in drawing lines for
election districts. That mandate would remain in force even if the
Supreme Court affirms the decisions that sampling used for
apportioning congressional seats among the states is illegal, the
lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Shapiro said he fully expected the
Supreme Court to rule that sampling was indeed legal. He also
stressed that any decision about what the administration would do
if the court upheld the lower courts would be made in consultation
with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official familiar with the census issue said
Tuesday that the White House had asked the Office of Management and
Budget for a legal opinion of whether the president already has the
authority to order that sampling be used for determining the
population for the allocation of federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Republican opponents of sampling said Tuesday that they would
never agree to finance a census count that allowed the sampling
method to be used for the drawing of election districts. ``It's a
non-starter,'' said Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House
Subcommittee on the Census.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that a court decision invalidating sampling would be
limited to apportionment of congressional seats adds a new wrinkle
to what has become a highly complex and partisan battle over the
next census.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever really care too much about the federal funding
aspect,'' said Clark Bensen, president of Polydata, a Republican
demographic research company. ``To the extent that the politicians
get excited about the census, they don't get excited about
apportionment which might shift one or maybe two seats to different
states. They get excited because of redistricting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau wants to use sampling to estimate portions of
the population, like blacks in cities and in rural parts of the
Southeast and Hispanics in the Southwest and California, that tend
to be missed by the traditional means of conducting the census.
</P>
<P>
   These groups tend to live in areas that are overwhelmingly
Democratic. Thus counting more of them could give the Democrats an
advantage when lines for congressional and state and local election
districts are drawn.

NEW EVIDENCE SAID TO CONTAIN NO BOMBSHELL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican investigators said Tuesday that grand
jury evidence to be made public on Friday would bolster charges
that the White House tried to cover up President Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawyers for the House Judiciary Committee said the
new evidence would, on balance, help the president's cause.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides did agree that the material includes no bombshell
that would fundamentally change people's view of whether the
president should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is specifically damaging or specifically
exculpatory,'' a Democratic staff member said, ``but it gives color
and context to the charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats who have reviewed the evidence said it
portrayed Linda Tripp in an unfavorable light. She alerted
prosecutors to the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and
surreptitiously tape-recorded conversations with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very leading,'' a Republican assistant said. ``Is she
manipulative? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff members who spoke Tuesday did so on the condition that
they not be identified by name.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 5,000 pages of documents to be released by the
Judiciary Committee on Friday are edited transcripts of the
Tripp-Lewinsky conversations as well as transcripts of the grand
jury testimony of Ms. Tripp; Betty Currie, the president's
secretary; Vernon Jordan Jr., the president's friend, and Bruce
Lindsey, a deputy White House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury evidence was turned over to the committee by
Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   While the committee staff was reviewing this evidence, Sen.
Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Republican leader, told reporters that
``bad conduct is enough, frankly, for impeachment'' if it ``brought
disrepute on the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott declined to say whether he believed Clinton's conduct met
that standard.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, two Republican and two Democratic members of
Congress who are trying to stake out a bipartisan position on the
Judiciary Committee began an effort Tuesday to find out from Starr
whether he had evidence of potentially impeachable offenses
involving subjects other than the president's relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. That is the only matter Starr has referred to Congress
under the law that requires independent counsels to notify Congress
of evidence of possibly impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The congressmen _ Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; Asa Hutchinson,
R-Ark.; Howard Berman, D-Calif., and Bill Delahunt, D-Mass. _ are
trying to determine whether an impeachment inquiry should go beyond
the Lewinsky affair. The Judiciary Committee plans to vote next
week on whether to begin a formal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   A joint team of Republican and Democratic lawyers went to
Starr's office on Monday to take a first look at evidence in the
Clinton-Lewinsky case that was not presented to Congress. They
asked for a detailed index on the information to help them decide
what they want to look at, a committee official said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde approved the trip to assuage Democrats who say they want to
see whether exculpatory material was not given to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members of the committee were permitted Tuesday for the
first time to speak publicly about the grand jury evidence. Several
from both parties did so but with few quotations from the testimony
or other specific details.
</P>
<P>
   Their descriptions of the evidence were so sketchy that they
must be taken with caution. Before the videotape of Clinton's grand
jury testimony was made public last week, word seeped out that the
president would be seen losing his temper, but that proved not to
be the case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the matters that Republicans said they found most
interesting were these:
</P>
<P>
   _ The repeated refusal by Lindsey and Sidney Blumenthal, another
assistant to the president, to answer questions on the grounds of
executive privilege and, in Lindsey's case, lawyer-client
privilege. Starr and the Republican investigators see this as
evidence of a White House effort to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   _ An assertion by Dick Morris, one of Clinton's political
consultants, that the White House maintains an operation to
intimidate women who have had affairs with the president.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jordan's testimony, the veracity of which the staff members
questioned, that his telephone calls to critical players at crucial
times did not involve the Lewinsky situation.
</P>
<P>
   _ The testimony of a White House switchboard operator that he
received the first reprimand of his career after he declined
suggestions from the White House counsel's office that he hire a
lawyer from a recommended list before he testified before the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Three Democratic lawyers on the committee staff held a briefing
for reporters on the new evidence. These lawyers maintained that in
some respects the evidence showed Clinton in a less sinister way
than the portrayal in Starr's report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Democrats said that Mrs. Currie's testimony
bolstered Clinton's position that he did not help Ms. Lewinsky find
a job in exchange for her giving false testimony in the Paula
Corbin Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit and that he did not instruct
Mrs. Currie to retrieve presents he had given Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr told Congress that Clinton's role in the job search and in
the retrieval of the gifts amounted to evidence of obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   In Starr's report, he pointed to a conflict between Ms. Lewinsky
and Mrs. Currie over which of them brought up the idea that Mrs.
Currie should take possession of the president's gifts to Ms.
Lewinsky. Starr said the question was important because if it was
Mrs. Currie's idea, that could mean that the president had
instructed her to get the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Starr report, Mrs. Currie first testified that
it was Ms. Lewinsky's idea but, told by prosecutors that Ms.
Lewinsky had testified otherwise, agreed that ``she may remember
better than I.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats said Tuesday that Starr used the quotation out of
context and that Mrs. Currie had made the statement in answer to a
question that did not deal with the transfer of gifts.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world looks to the International Monetary Fund to stop
financial crises. Yet the fund's best efforts are failing. Even
apart from the spectacular collapses in Asia last year and in
Russia this year, there has been a ``boom in busts'' _ an explosion
in the number of countries whose economies have been devastated by
simultaneous runs on their currencies and banks.
</P>
<P>
   What is worse, some hard-hit countries, like Indonesia and
Russia, were operating under a bailout program approved by the
fund. The IMF, critics say, appears short of ideas to stanch these
crises, and short of the money that would even allow it to try.
</P>
<P>
   But if the IMF did not exist, it would have to be invented. That
is why most experts, even as they disagree loudly over how to
restructure the fund, argue that the lending institution should not
simply be abandoned. ``The mission,'' said Fred Bergsten, the
director of the Institute for International Economics, ``is to save
the fund, not bury it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before 1973, the IMF had a clear role: The world's currencies
were tethered to gold and the fund bailed out countries running out
of dollars. But since President Nixon eliminated the gold standard,
countries have had the option of letting their currencies float in
value, helping to eliminate persistent balance-of-payments deficits
without outside support.
</P>
<P>
   The fund had to scrounge for a new mission. By the early 1980s,
it had settled into lending to countries hit by massive capital
flight. But Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University charges
that the fund ``is unqualified to assume its new tasks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Its structure harks back to its founding 50 years ago and ill
serves today's needs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the IMF has the will, it no longer has the way to
impose its views. Almost everyone agrees that it cannot perform its
current mission with the sums _ now down to well under $100 billion
by any accounting _ left in its coffers. Paul Krugman of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimates that ``the fund may
need another $200 billion just to bail out Brazil without imposing
a severe recession.''
</P>
<P>
   So the IMF needs to change. But how? Economists have produced a
number of answers. Some call for expanding the IMF's powers to aid
crippled economies, perhaps by turning it into a true ``lender of
last resort'' that disburses money to prop up countries in
financial distress. Others would expand its mission by having it
insure foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another group would take the opposite tack, trimming the
role of the institution. They would offer bailouts to fewer
countries, or focus the fund's efforts on convening negotiations
between debtor countries and their creditors.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the disagreement flows from one deep-seated dispute
_ whether countries as small as Hong Kong or as large as Brazil
should fix their currencies in terms of dollars or let them float
according to the vagaries of the market. If the members of the IMF
could settle the issue of exchange rates, many of the other policy
issues would fall quietly into line.
</P>
<P>
   Countries adopt a fixed exchange rate _ a pledge to convert
currencies into dollars at a preset rate _ in part to reassure
investors that their money is safe. But fixed rates get countries
into financial trouble when, for whatever reason, investors get
spooked and all rush for the exits at the same time. With trillions
of dollars sloshing around world capital markets, the dollar
reserves of nearly every country can be decimated in days, if not
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, like some other countries, brought disaster on itself by
printing too many rubles. The more ominous lesson of the past few
years is that fickle investors can also rock countries that conduct
prudent policies, like Hong Kong. Krugman worries that it takes ``a
minority of skittish investors to set off a self-justifying run on
the country's reserves.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that countries that pledge to preserve fixed rates
at any cost are sometimes forced to do exactly that: Sweden in
1993, Brazil today and scores of other countries whose currencies
have come under attack have been forced to jack up domestic
interest rates to 40, 50 or 100 percent or more to convince
investors to stay.
</P>
<P>
   High rates can stop the outflow of dollars, but they also crush
the domestic economy. Indeed, the fund is criticized for strangling
the economies of South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand last year by
needlessly insisting they impose sky-high interest rates as part of
their fund-approved packages.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute for
International Development, argues that fixed rates do not work well
with unlimited capital flows. His answer is to let currencies
float. ``There was a role for fixed rates in countries like
Argentina and Brazil when they had to break hyperinflation and
prove to investors that monetary policy would not repeat the
blunders of the past,'' he said. ``The mistake was holding onto the
fixed rates. They become a trap if kept longer than necessary, say
18 months or so.''
</P>
<P>
   By proposing that countries move to freely floating rates, Sachs
hopes to minimize the possibility of sudden currency collapses. He
would urge the fund to help countries whose currencies are under
attack, but only after the currency is set free. The money would be
used to mitigate the impact of devaluation on the poor and to
reassure investors that the country's finances would be sound and
its currency unlikely to plunge much further.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs also urges the fund to focus less on bailing out debtor
countries than on helping them negotiate relief from their
creditors. When a debtor cannot repay loans in the United States,
the courts step in and suspend payments until a settlement that is
fair to all creditors can emerge. Sachs wants a similar procedure
internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Korea solved its immediate debt problem by pressuring
its creditors to stretch out loan repayments in negotiations, even
though Korea had no legal coercion on its side to force
cooperation. ``So while international debt negotiations lack the
legal protections to work in theory,'' Sachs said, ``they somehow
manage to work in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the fund steered Korea toward debt negotiations from the
beginning, Sachs argues, there might have been no need to crack
down so hard on its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Meltzer starts from the same presumption as Sachs _ that fixed
rates do not work well in a world of vast capital flows _ but comes
to a different conclusion. He wants to minimize the role of the
fund, whose bailouts, he argues, have done a lot of harm.
</P>
<P>
   His solution is to turn the fund into a limited lender of last
resort, lending money to debtor countries for a fee. But debtors
would have to post ample collateral. That leaves Meltzer vulnerable
to the charge that his plan would bail out only countries that do
not need the fund's help.
</P>
<P>
   And in a sense, he agrees: Classic economic thinking suggests
bailing out only those borrowers who are merely illiquid, simply
lacking ready cash to pay back creditors while holding ample
assets, but not those who are insolvent, without enough assets to
cover their debts.
</P>
<P>
   But many economists, and these include key policy-makers like
Stanley Fischer, the fund's No. 2 official, regard floating rates
as unacceptably risky for developing countries. Fickle investors,
controlling trillions of dollars, can drive currency values up and
down in huge swings for seemingly no valid economic reason.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sudden currency swings play havoc with people's lives.
Depreciation can decimate industries that rely on imported parts,
turning once secure jobs into rubble. In Asia, steep currency
declines sent the price of imports skyrocketing, impoverishing
millions last year. They also drove up the cost, measured in local
currency, of loans denominated in dollars. That threatens many
banks throughout Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no accident,'' Fischer said, ``that countries turn to
fixed rates to bring order to their economies.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists who tie themselves to fixed rates also tether
themselves to the IMF. The world simply needs some institution to
lend money to countries whose reserves are temporarily under
attack, they say.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Bergsten, who advocates rates that are flexible only
enough to float within a preset range, argues for making the fund
work better within its existing role. He would have the fund
scrutinize pertinent financial data of its member nations and
intervene early before they run into problems.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his ``IMF plus'' proposal, he would also require the
fund to eliminate the worst feature of its Mexican and Asian
bailouts. Under those programs, Western creditors were hardly
nicked, encouraging them to take imprudent risks elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, some investors soaked up government bonds, mistakenly
confident that the fund would bail out the Russians if they
faltered. The most direct way to correct this ``moral hazard'' is
for the fund to pressure creditors to offer significant debt
relief.
</P>
<P>
   George Soros, the billionaire investor and philanthropist, has a
more ambitious plan. ``International capital movements need to be
supervised and the allocation of credit regulated by an
international authority,'' he argues.
</P>
<P>
   Soros proposes, as yet without detail, that a new spin-off of
the IMF calm jittery foreign investors by ``guaranteeing
international loans for a modest fee'' up to a limit. The
guarantees would be backed by special drawing rights that, in
effect, use U.S. dollars _ together with backing from other major
countries _ perhaps without explicit congressional permission.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Soros' proposal could overcome political objections on
Capitol Hill, there are still practical challenges to the idea.
Loan insurance encourages investors to ignore the creditworthiness
of borrowers, which is why it is limited in the United States to
relatively small deposits in commercial banks and thrifts. Soros'
proposal may invite reckless investing.
</P>
<P>
   There are also proposals, most recently by Jeffrey Garten, a
former Commerce Department official, to turn the fund or some other
institution into a global central bank able to issue money whenever
the international economy sags. But economists point out that his
bank would require gargantuan resources and the legal power to
intervene in the economies of member countries.
</P>
<P>
   There will be lots of talk of reform this week when the IMF and
World Bank hold their annual meetings. Even if there is as yet no
consensus for radical overhaul, the fund's survival may depend on
its ability to borrow at least some of what its critics propose.

HELLING ENTERS WITH MOMENTUM, SORE BACK

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With only seven players remaining from the 1996
playoff team, and nine who have never appeared in a postseason
game, Rangers manager Johnny Oates conceded that inexperience might
be a problem against the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Especially at Yankee Stadium, with its loud, often-obnoxious
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Rick Helling fits in both categories, there are no
worries about the 27-year-old right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Helling wasn't feeling pressure yesterday. He was having a good
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first playoff experience, and you couldn't ask for
a better place to do it in,'' Helling said. ``To pitch against the
Yankees, with the great team they have this year, the history of
the stadium, all the great things that have gone on through the
years here, I don't think you could ask for a better setting. It's
going to be a lot of fun. The fans will be going crazy, but I'm
looking forward to it. It should be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling enters tonight with momentum. He was 4-0 with a 2.76
earned-run average in September and was chosen American League
pitcher of the month.
</P>
<P>
   He enters with poise and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get intimidated about it and I don't get nervous about
it,'' he said. ``To go out there and think that you're playing on
the same field that Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle, Lou Gehrig and Joe
DiMaggio played on, all the names that were here, to me it's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He also goes in with a sore back.
</P>
<P>
   It first bothered him before a Sept. 17 start against the
Anaheim Angels, and he allowed six runs and failed to get out of
the second inning. It still bothered him when he pitched in Anaheim
five days later, and he held the Angels to one run in eight
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The back is about the same,'' he said. ``It's gotten a little
better, but I can pitch with the pain. I did it in Anaheim. It's
not going to affect me.''

COMMENTARY: MALADROIT DU SEIGNEUR  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When women finally came into power in Washington,
they were in the mood to collect some scalps.
</P>
<P>
   They skewered Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   They cooked Bob Packwood.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time they got to Bill Clinton, women had lost their
appetite to search out and destroy all chauvinistic and harassing
behavior. They were confused. Were these men dangerous predators?
Or were they merely loony lechers?
</P>
<P>
   There was a disturbing pattern developing. The powerful men
getting in the most trouble over women seemed to be getting the
least satisfaction from women. The guys being crucified for sexual
misconduct appear, on closer inspection, to be acting more strange
than swaggering, more dysfunctional than macho.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who put a pubic hair on my Coke can?'' Now there's a crafty
come-hither line. Looking back, Clarence Thomas' insistence on
jabbering about creepy X-rated movies seems more bizarre than
brutish. Bob Packwood's habit of grabbing hair and forcing his
tongue down the throats of women is yucky, to be sure, but also
pathetic. They seem like such losers to have caused so much angst.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bill Clinton faces the most severe punishment possible. But
the more you read Kenneth Starr's dirty best seller, the more it
looks as if the Republicans are huffing and puffing, trying to
impeach the first president on the grounds of illicit sex even
though the illicit so outweighed the sex.
</P>
<P>
   The more we read Starr's prissy documentation, the more it seems
the president has been wrongfully accused. We thought he was a
lusty, carefree Lothario with his young intern, when he was
actually a timid, tortured Lothario.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than joining the capital's proud pantheon of droit du
seigneur with the Kennedy brothers, Bill Clinton joined Messrs.
Thomas and Packwood in the embarrassing pantheon of maladroit du
seigneur.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, when the story of the president and the intern
first rocked the country, there was much speculation that Clinton's
ratings had remained high because Americans secretly lusted for an
alpha president. Lydia Saad of the Gallup Poll told The Wall Street
Journal that Presidents Kennedy and Clinton had both prospered
because of ``our unspoken affection for leaders who live large _
large life, large appetites, large loves.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Starr report has shattered the president's image as an
unreconstructed rake. If Clinton honestly described his encounters
with Monica Lewinsky, he would be laughed out of any locker room in
the country. Their affair has none of the noir glamour of JFK and
Marilyn at the Carlyle Hotel. Bill and Monica make the juvenile
leads in ``Titanic'' seem mature.
</P>
<P>
   It is Ms. Lewinsky who comes across as the red-blooded predator,
wailing to her girl friends that the president wouldn't go all the
way. It is Clinton who behaves more like a teen-age girl trying to
protect her virginity, insisting on holding back, reluctant to
remove any clothes, even pushing away Ms. Lewinsky at times and
pushing up her slipping bra strap, according to her testimony.
``I'm trying to not do this and I'm trying to be good,'' the
president told her primly.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is the one who bristles with testosterone. In her
testimony, she said of one of her encounters with the president:
``He just seemed to get so emotionally upset about it. It seemed a
little strange to me.'' This was no wild, unbridled passion.
``There was sort of foreplay to the foreplay,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's habit, with language and behavior, has been to try to
incorporate his alibi into his sin. The result is more twisted than
titillating.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine televised impeachment hearings designed to
pin down the president's possible perjury on whether he touched
Monica's breast directly or through clothing. This will make Orrin
Hatch waving a copy of ``The Exorcist'' at Anita Hill back in 1991
look positively dignified.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the ludicrous comment Tuesday by Trent Lott, the Senate
majority leader. ``I think bad conduct is enough, frankly, for
impeachment,'' he intoned.
</P>
<P>
   Americans understand perfectly that if good conduct were
required in Washington, the city would have closed up shop long
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans can't throw the president on the pyre for sexual
misconduct in a city where sexual misconduct has always flourished.
And they can't keep treating him as if he were a brazen brute when
he's just a sad philanderer.

 &HT;    Astros drop playoff opener to Padres 2-1
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The opening act played just according to script. Only
Kevin Brown, who caused the Braves post-season fits a year ago,
ended up miscast in a supporting role.
</P>
<P>
   On an afternoon when Randy Johnson proved a tad shy of dominant,
it was Brown who carried his team's fortunes on his back, fanning a
career-best 16 as the San Diego Padres beat the Houston Astros 2-1.
Brown surrendered but two singles before the Astros rallied for a
ninth-inning run off closer Trevor Hoffman in the NL Division
Series opener.
</P>
<P>
   Brown may never have thrown better, even in no-hitting the San
Francisco Giants last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's as good as I've seen him,'' said Moises Alou, a
teammate on last year's Florida Marlins. ''With him on your team,
when he's on the mound you feel confident, just like you do with
Randy on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Johnson was no match Tuesday for the less-celebrated Game
One starter.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-10 left-hander surrendered a bases-loaded sac fly to Jim
Leyritz in the sixth, later offering up an eighth-inning solo homer
to Greg Vaughn. A decent showing, yes. But while Johnson gave up
nine hits and faced several jams, Brown allowed two singles _ both
to catcher Brad Ausmus _ before giving way to Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   And was Brown, owner of a short fuse, more intense than usual
going against Johnson?
</P>
<P>
   ''No doubt, when you're going against a guy like Randy Johnson
you know it's going to take a great effort,'' said Brown, a Georgia
Tech grad. ''But as a pitcher, I'm not facing Randy Johnson. I'm
facing their hitters . . . but I was able to focus, probably as
well as I've done in quite some time.''
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, Brown eclipsed Johnson's strikeout mark of 13 for a
division series and authored the first Astrodome defeat for
Houston's new-found star. He struck out at least one Astro in each
of his eight innings, Derek Bell and Ricky Gutierrez each scoring a
hat trick.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, considerably below the ticket sold figure of 50,080,
showed up expecting a sure-thing in Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But awesome as he's been, the left-hander is just 2-4 in
post-season and unequal to Brown at his best.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's always this big buildup when I pitch in the
post-season,'' said Johnson, going out of his way to praise Brown.
''You guys (in the media) write more about it when I pitch, often
overshadowing the opposing pitcher. It was the same thing with
(Baltimore's) Mike Musina last year. It was the same thing for this
game. If I'm on the other side of the tracks, it'd be a big
incentive to go out and pitch well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anybody is invincible. A lot of the media makes
me sound like I'm going to be, but it makes the other team get
fired up. It sounds like the game is in the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the record show it's not.

 &HT;    UT Researcher's Prediction Comes True
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ University of Texas astrophysicist Robert Duncan
and a colleague predicted the possibility six years ago. On
Tuesday, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
announced that it happened last month.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 27, at 4:22 a.m. CDT, the most powerful blast of
radiation ever detected hitting the Earth engulfed part of the
ionosphere, the uppermost layer of the atmosphere that begins about
37 miles high, over the western United States and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The invisible gamma and X-ray radiation, produced by a tiny but
menacing star 20,000 light-years away in a corner of our Milky Way
galaxy, never reached the ground. Had it, Duncan said, it would
have caused no more health effects than a dental X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   But astonished NASA scientists said the event, which lasted five
minutes, dramatically illustrated the planet's potential
vulnerability to things other than crashing comets and asteroids _
in this case a magnetic flare on SGR 1900+4, a supermagnetic star
called a magnetar, in the constellation Aquila.
</P>
<P>
   ``It amazes me that the ionosphere actually fluctuated,'' said
Duncan, who, with North Carolina astrophysicist Christopher
Thompson, predicted the existence of magnetars in 1992. ``The
energy of this tiny, 12-mile-diameter star came all that way and
made our ionosphere fluctuate.''
</P>
<P>
   The ionosphere fluctuated when its atoms, normally charged with
electricity by solar radiation, received a big electrical boost
from energy produced by a star that is too far away to be seen
except with telescopes that image radio waves.
</P>
<P>
   NASA said it was the first time that a significant change in
Earth's atmosphere had been traced to energy from a star other than
the sun. SGR (for Soft Gamma Repeater) 1900+4 _ no larger than a
city but weighing more than the sun _ is more than 1 billion times
farther away than the sun, which is 93 million miles from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hurley, an astronomer at the University of California,
calculated the total energy that the star must have expended to
produce the impact on Earth. He said if it could be harnessed it
would be enough to power all of human civilization for a billion
billion years.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, only a small fraction of it collided with the
atmosphere. Had much more of it hit, Duncan said, the radiation
could have seriously eroded the atmosphere's protective ozone
layer, allowing much more harmful radiation from the sun to reach
the ground each day.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, the radiation was so intense that it overloaded
gamma-ray sensors on at least seven scientific satellites, causing
them to automatically shut down. It also apparently reduced the
range of high-power radio stations whose signals use the ionosphere
to travel around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Although the radiation didn't reach the ground, the ionosphere's
fluctuation set off ground sensors used by Stanford University to
study lightning in the upper atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if night was briefly turned into day in the
ionosphere,'' said Umran Inan, a Stanford electrical engineer.
</P>
<P>
   NASA and Stanford scientists said they had detected similar but
much smaller bursts of radiation hitting the ionosphere in 1983 and
1996 but didn't know what caused them.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan's and Thompson's magnetar theory became widely known to
scientists in May when NASA researchers reported in the British
journal Nature that they finally had confirmed their existence.
</P>
<P>
   They found evidence that, as Duncan and Thompson had predicted,
magnetars have the strongest magnetic fields in the universe and
there may be millions of them in galaxies such as the Milky Way,
which is estimated to have 400 billion stars.
</P>
<P>
   Magnetars are a type of neutron star, a well-known oddity in the
stellar zoo. Neutron stars are the collapsed cores left over when a
massive star explodes. Duncan said one teaspoon from one of these
extremely dense cores, a ball generally no more than 12 miles in
diameter, would weigh more than an aircraft carrier. Roiled by
periodic starquakes and gamma-ray flares, magnetars are a potential
menace to other objects in space.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said no magnetars are believed to be close enough to
do Earth any serious damage. Duncan said the Aug. 27 event could
happen again, but he and Thompson have figured that magnetars
produce such magnetic flares only about once a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our theory, it's a random event,'' Duncan said. ``It's like
predicting earthquakes _ you can't say when.''
</P>

Texas.

A MELLENCAMP FAN: GUILTY AS CHARGED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ind., Minn.)   (Neal Karlen is the author of ``Slouching Toward Fargo,'' a book
about traveling with the St. Paul Saints minor-league baseball
team.)

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ It was shuffling dusty, long-unopened boxes in my
basement storage room a few weeks ago when I came upon a heavy
carton I had years ago simply labeled ``LAME.''
</P>
<P>
   A pack rat, I had marked the box when I moved back home to
Minneapolis eight years ago after living most of the 80s _ and my
20s _ in Manhattan. Ripping through the packing tape, I discovered
a collection I had adjudged at the time to be the most embarrassing
vinyl albums I had ever purchased.
</P>
<P>
   On top was Bob Dylan's ``Saved,'' followed by the inevitable
``Frampton Comes Alive.'' Below this crust of vinyl flotsam I came
upon six different albums recorded by John Mellencamp, the artist
formerly known as Johnny Cougar, John Cougar and John Cougar
Mellencamp.
</P>
<P>
   Now 46, he will release ``John Mellencamp,'' his first album of
all new material in five years on Tuesday for Columbia Records. A
kind of rock star Job, he has somehow endured for two decades and
14 records, surviving even the ridiculous marketing campaign of
young Johnny Cougar as a glam-James Dean concocted by David Bowie's
ex-manager.
</P>
<P>
   Besides claiming back his name and soul, Mellencamp has since
been through a heart attack, two divorces and a ton of rotten
reviews dating back forever.
</P>
<P>
   He labors on. ``Your Life is Now,'' the new album's already
released first single, is a Mellencamp song at its catchiest: a
Midwest roadhouse rocker with a pounding beat atop the simple words
of a prairie tent sermon. Three weeks after its release, ``Your
Life is Now'' is already the most frequently added single to the
playlists at top 40 stations.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the album will enthrall his fans here in what record
executives call ``Flyoverland'' and enrage the rock intelligentsia
who for decades have called Mellencamp an impostor with simply the
best heartland shtick since William Jennings Bryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is a phony,'' the critic Robert Christgau wrote of the
1982 John Cougar album that contained his breakthrough hit ``Jack
and Diane.'' Mellencamp's anthem ``Small Town'' was a hit in 1985,
and Dave Marsh, Bruce Springsteen's biographer, lectured the
rocker, writing ``that ties to home can be stultifying and
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, back in my Minneapolis storage room, far away in years
and miles from the grip of hip, I didn't care what the critics
said. Instead, I wondered how I could have ever consigned John
Mellencamp to my LAME box. ``I've always (italics)loved(end
italics) John Mellencamp,'' I thought.
</P>
<P>
   And then I realized his banishment must have been a Manhattan
reflex. Back East, Mellencamp had been my guilty rock-and-roll
pleasure, my shameful secret that was apostasy in the groovy world
I then thought I aspired to. I had to watch my step; when I left
New York, I was still on the masthead of Rolling Stone, writing for
an oppressively hip barometer where one was more likely to hear
someone confess to cannibalism than to say, ``I've always
(italics)loved(end italics) John Mellencamp.''
</P>
<P>
   But I couldn't help it. Growing up in the Midwest in the 1970s,
Mellencamp was my Bruce Springsteen. Mellencamp's home town of
Seymour, Ind. (population 13,000), was my St. Louis Park, Minn. His
turf was the Midwest; his first topics prairie love and despair,
the likes of his own Jack and Diane, who learned a little too late
that the guidance counselors weren't kidding when they warned
``life goes on/even after the thrill off living is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp songs also bore a defiant pride of place _ most
famously in ``Small Town.'' He wasn't being facetious when he sang,
``That's probably where they'll bury me.'' Mellencamp lives and
records in Bloomington, 30 miles from Seymour.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, I had no idea what Springsteen meant when he sang of
boardwalks, Asbury Park gypsies or burning oil refineries. I did
understand Mellencamp's crunching odes to feeling as if the world
was happening somewhere else. I related to his bar-band rockers
about the dual-edged sword of living in a small Midwest community
where your neighbors know not only your name but everything else
about you too.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Not that I told anyone of my guilty rock pleasure when I lived
in New York. If I was riding in the back of a car, I would be the
first to jump across the seat to change the station if one of
Mellencamp's songs came on the radio. Yet if I was alone at home, I
would sing ``Jack and Diane'' and `Small Town'' along with the
Mellencamp records I would furtively buy at East Village record
stores, hoping no one I knew saw me.
</P>
<P>
   After discovering my cache of vinyl Mellencamp, I wondered who
else now counted as a guilty rock-and-roll pleasure. Names wouldn't
be as easy to come by as they had been in the old days of the
1980s; this decade a number of traditional guilty rock pleasures
have became hip.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Bennett, long considered as lame as a bad toupee, has been
so hip lately that it's hard to even remember how recently he was
thought a has-been. Kiss, once scorned as corporate-rock incarnate,
remains cool, as do the Carpenters, Richard Nixon's favorite
rockers.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in perhaps ever, one could put Abba on a
dance tape and be complimented for your taste instead of being
asked what planet you were from.
</P>
<P>
   Still, somebody has to be ashamed of what they now liked to
listen to. So last week, inside the slacker coffee shop where I
sometimes do my writing, I took an informal poll among the
assembled hipsters about their own guilty rock pleasures. All
demanded anonymity and seemed properly embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who described herself as an ``out lesbian'' confided her
enthusiasm for Guns-'n'-Roses, ``despite Axl's homophobic lyrics,
the pig.'' A vegetarian whispered ``Ted Nugent,'' despite the
rocker's well-publicized love of bow-hunting. A punk rocker quietly
mumbled ``Grateful Dead,'' the arch enemy of the loud/fast/hardcore
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Over the phone, I asked the expatriated Minnesotan, comedian and
liberal political pundit Al Franken to name his guilty pleasure.
Franken was the only one I asked who didn't sound embarrassed by
his choice. ``Tammy Wynette,'' he said proudly, naming the singer
whose conservative world view of standin' by your man wouldn't seem
to jibe with that of the author of the book ``Rush Limbaugh Is a
Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations.''
</P>
<P>
   I've still got my John Mellencamp, who remains as critically
unhip yet commercially popular as Neil Diamond. I could never
figure out the bad rap against Mellencamp, except for the puerile
way he had been marketed early on. Yet he had repaid his dues.
</P>
<P>
   Cool musicians like the alternative-rock queen Lisa Germano had
played in his band; his videos featured blacks when MTV was being
crucified for featuring only white faces, and his singles still
occasionally hit to the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Now, fishing Mellencamp's records out of my LAME box, I wondered
if they held up as a guilty pleasure. I brought them upstairs to my
turntable, near all the vinyl I had cherry-picked from my
collection all those years ago in New York, albums ranging in
too-coolness from my first edition pressing of the Sex Pistols'
``God Save the Queen'' to original Stax/Volt albums of Otis
Redding.
</P>
<P>
   Mellencamp held up. I then put on his new CD and found myself
half dancing to ``Your Life Is Now.'' Since then, his vinyl has
stayed upstairs, in front of even the Sex Pistols.

SAME PLAYOFF ROUTINE FOR INDIANS
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Not all hope was lost in the Cleveland clubhouse
Tuesday. Optimists could point to the fact that the Indians
wouldn't have to face Pedro Martinez again _ unless there's a fifth
game. Also, the Indians have a history of losing first games of
playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, they lost Game 1 of the division series
against the New York Yankees, yet came back to take the series in
five games. They also bounced back from a Game 1 loss to the
Baltimore Orioles in the American League Championship Series last
year, eventually winning in six games. The Indians, however, did
lose the World Series last season in seven games to Florida after
losing the first game to the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the Indians have lost their previous seven series
openers in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the perfect world scenario,'' Indians manager Mike
Hargrove said after the game. ``We certainly did not come in here
looking to lose the first game to keep our tradition going. If you
can get any comfort out of anything, we have done it before. We
didn't want to have to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove added, ``Our guys are in a good frame of mind after
getting dusted pretty good. We're ready for tomorrow.'' CHANGE OF
PACE
</P>
<P>
   After facing the 95 mph-plus fastball and sharp breaking balls
of Pedro Martinez Tuesday, the Indians face the unenviable
challenge of locating Tim Wakefield's knuckleball this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield said the contrast in pitching styles and the gap in
velocity ought to wreak havoc with Cleveland batsmen as it has all
season when opposing teams had to face the Red Sox starters
back-to-back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way we set up the rotation this year and I found
that it helped me quite a bit,'' Wakefield said. ``After Pedro's
throwing 95 mph, I follow him throwing 65 or 70. The contrast is
very drastic. It wasn't every start, but I found that one-half to
three-quarters of my starts were like that. It did have an effect
on the opposition.'' WARM KNUCKLERS
</P>
<P>
   Warm weather is expected again Wednesday and that is another bit
of good news for Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I like to pitch in warm weather because ... a
knuckleball is a feel pitch,'' he said. ``Having to hold it with my
fingernails and fingertips ... having it cold is almost like
throwing an ice cube. It doesn't feel comfortable sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield said, ``The ideal conditions for me would be a light
breeze blowing out. You want to have a little resistance vs. the
ball, and the wind blowing out would increase the movement.''
DAYTIME BLUES
</P>
<P>
   When the Red Sox play a day game as opposed to a night game, the
difference in their performance is like, well ... night and day.
</P>
<P>
   That's even more true for the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams play far better under the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Boston went 69-45 this season when playing at night, but only
23-25 in the daytime. Cleveland was a strong 68-44 at night, but an
atrocious 21-29 during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Something has to give in the divisional series between the two
clubs, though. Wednesday's game and Friday's game will be played in
the afternoon, as was Tuesday's. Starting times have not been
announced for Games 4 and 5, if they are necessary. GOODEN COMES
FULL CIRCLE
</P>
<P>
   Dwight ``Doc'' Gooden has come a long way in his career and in
his life off the field. But his journey this year from early season
obscurity and doubt to Game 2 starter in the divisional playoff
series is right up there on his list of professional comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't expect to have such a chance back in the
spring when he was toiling for the minor-league Buffalo Bisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had arm problems in spring training and started the season
on the disabled list,'' Gooden said. ``I went to Buffalo to rehab
and once I was in Buffalo I could never imagine this. I am very
blessed to be in the situation I am in now.'' LEWIS LEAVES GAME
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Darren Lewis left the game with a bruise after being
struck on the batting helmet by the Indians' Jaret Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who singled in his first two at-bats, was drilled on the
left ear flap by a Wright fastball in the fifth inning. Lewis was
face-down on the field near the plate for several minutes, then
walked unaided to the Red Sox' dugout.

<P>
   The first large-scale examination of how computers affect the
learning of mathematics in American classrooms found that when used
selectively by trained teachers in middle schools they can
significantly enhance academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   But the study also indicated that their value in elementary
school is far more limited and that when used primarily for drills
and practice at either level, which is common, or when students
spend long periods of time using them, computers in schools can be
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   The results imply that school districts should spend more on
computers in middle schools than elementary schools and should
focus attention on professional development for teachers to make
sure they know how to use the computers effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The study, called ``Does it Compute?'' released Tuesday, was
carried out by a researcher at Educational Testing Service in
Princeton, N.J. and sponsored by the journal Education Week and the
Milken Exchange on Education Technology, which promotes the
effective use of computers in the classroom. It took the scores of
thousands of fourth and eighth graders on the 1996 math portion of
the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, the most
widely cited test given to samples of students across the country,
and examined them based on surveys of students and teachers
regarding classroom computer use.
</P>
<P>
   Among eighth graders, it found that when students used computers
for more complex mathematics like simulations, which measure
changing variables, or applications, where data are manipulated and
analyzed, gains of more than a third of an academic year were
registered. For fourth graders using computers for mathematical
games, the gain was a tenth of an academic year, or a few weeks'
worth of instruction. The study divided computer use into four
categories: drill and practice (common but least effective),
demonstration of new topics (seldom used), as well as mathematical
games, and simulations and applications.
</P>
<P>
   By using a large sample size and controlling for such factors as
socio-economic background, teacher preparedness, class size and
school environment, the new study offers insight in the heated
debate over the cost-benefit of the $5 billion spent annually on
school computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When computers are used to perform certain tasks, namely
applying higher order concepts, and when teachers are proficient
enough in computer use to direct students toward productive uses
more generally, computers do seem to be associated with significant
gains in mathematics achievement,'' concluded the report, written
by Harold Wenglinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It added: ``The effects of technology appear to be much smaller
in the fourth than the eighth grade, and so may not be
cost-effective. To the extent that the primary benefit of computers
lies in applying higher order skills, there may not be much
opportunity to benefit from using computers before middle school.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the circumscribed and mixed nature of the findings, they
are likely to be used by both sides in the debate over whether the
investment has proven itself. In 1983, there was a computer for
every 125 students whereas in 1995, the ratio was 1 to 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this tells me is that under certain conditions, uses of
technology with certain kids in certain subjects at certain times
will be effective,'' said Larry Cuban, an education professor at
Stanford University and a longstanding skeptic toward the value of
computers in schools. ``That kind of conditional statement can be
made about virtually any approach to teaching. The question I
continually ask is how else we could achieve the same results in a
less costly way.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who have advocated increased investment in education
technology say they feel vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is unprecedented about this study is the way it takes a
broad cross section of schools,'' said Christopher Dede, a
professor of education and information technology at George Mason
University in Virginia. ``It turns out that if you are at all in
the ballpark about using technology correctly, there are some
things that are happening that are good. It is not idiosyncratic to
one teaching style or software vendor but something fundamental.
Technology permits different kinds of pedagogy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report describes technology uses among the 6,627 fourth
graders and 7,146 eighth graders who took the core NAEP assessment
in mathematics in 1996. It sought to avoid pitfalls of earlier
studies on computer use by, for example, asking not about ratio of
computer to student but frequency of use since in many schools
computers may be available but unused.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that eighth graders and fourth graders use
computers in school at about the same frequency. Less well off
students have as much access to computers as better off students
and, in fact, poor students had higher levels of computer use than
their better off peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to white, non-poor, and suburban students, those who
are minority, poor and urban find at least as much opportunity to
use computers in school,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It added, ``It seems that policies to promote computer access in
school have succeeded in eliminating inequities of this sort; yet
inequities in teacher preparedness and what is taught using
computers remains.''
</P>
<P>
   The report measured teacher preparedness by whether teachers had
received training in computer use but it did not distinguish
between a weekend seminar and a semester-long course. Any teacher
who had any training was counted as prepared.
</P>
<P>
   It found that when computers were used largely for drill and
practice in eighth grade, there was lower academic achievement. For
fourth graders, mathematical games were positively related to
academic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The report acknowledges that its method allows for possible
cause-and-effect confusion, saying that strong students may use
computers in more complex ways. But by controlling for background
and student work the previous year, the study concluded that
computers were the likely source of the positive results.

RJR NABISCO BRACES FOR DROP IN RUSSIAN SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., the latest U.S. company to be
buffeted by economic crisis from abroad, warned Tuesday that
``depressed market conditions'' in Russia would reduce its
third-quarter earnings well below earlier expectations.
</P>
<P>
   RJR said results would be 46 cents to 48 cents a diluted share;
many analysts had predicted 60 cents. The company issued its
warning after the stock market closed. In after-hours trading, RJR
shares fell to $25, down $1.9375 or 7 percent from their close on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   RJR, while also known for such food brands as Ritz crackers and
Oreo cookies, derives about two-thirds of its profits from tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Its cigarette sales in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet
Union had been running at an impressive rate in the first half of
the year, close to 20 percent of international profits, said
Emanuel Goldman, a tobacco and beverage analyst with PaineWebber in
San Francisco. Last year, the company's sales there accounted for
15 percent of international profits and represented 42 percent of
international volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that earlier rate is not going to happen,'' Goldman said.
``This is an important market for them. It's low profitability, but
higher volume.''
</P>
<P>
   (The rival Philip Morris, by contrast, has much more limited
exposure to Russia. Philip Morris' sales in Russia last year were 9
percent of international volume, and profits were 3.5 percent of
the international total, Goldman said.)
</P>
<P>
   The third quarter is now expected to be the second consecutive
disappointing quarter for RJR. In July, the company reported a loss
of $130 million, attributed in part to weakness in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Along with such U.S. brands as Winston, RJR's sales in Russia
include cigarettes produced specifically for the Russian market.
One, the Peter I heritage brand, is the largest-selling filtered
cigarette in Russia, the company says. Other brands include the
Genghis Khan, sold in Kazakhstan, and the Arsenal, sold in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in Russia forced RJR to suspend imports of its
American brands and manufacture of its Russian brands for about two
weeks, said Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst with Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Though manufacturing has resumed, ``demand from wholesalers
remains extremely uncertain, and the prospects for the company in
Russia remain problematic,'' he said. Demand had all but fallen
off, he said, as wholesalers and distributors ran out of cash to
pay for their orders.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement Tuesday, RJR blamed ``the devaluation of the
ruble, limited availability of trade credit and generally poor
economic conditions'' for the suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the company made $80 million in profits from its
Russian operations, Feldman added. ``This year, with a fair wind in
the fourth quarter, they might make $20 million for the whole
year,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another product of the Russian crisis will be higher taxes. The
company's overall tax rate will be pushed up, from 43.5 percent to
45.5 percent, Feldman said. That happens because the company pays
lower taxes on international profits than on domestic profits and
so, as international profits fall as a percentage of overall
profits, the company's tax rate goes up.
</P>
<P>
   Still, RJR should not flee the Russian market, Feldman said.
``As soon as the Russian economy begins to stabilize, you'll see an
improvement in RJR's business,'' he said. ``The current problems
are severe, but not a reason to give up on the business.''

WHEN COGNAC SINGS SOLO 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The name Le Peu means nothing to Cognac drinkers. Yet, most
Cognac drinkers know it very well _ sort of.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a paradox. For years, the dry, delicate Cognac from
Le Peu has been an important part of Hennessy's VSOP blend, but
like all spirits sold by distillers to the Cognac houses, it has
labored in anonymity, lending its voice to the chorus. But now,
some of the Cognac houses are letting their more talented singers
perform solo.
</P>
<P>
   The new single-distillery Cognacs, as they are known, make a
subversive statement. For the first time, the Cognac makers, with a
jealous, competitive eye on the single-malt business, are asking
consumers to think about their product in an entirely different
way.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledgeable Scotch drinkers, of course, make a point of
knowing the characteristics of individual distilleries, whose
products they seek out with an enthusiasm that sometimes approaches
madness, but Cognac drinkers never have. Now, in a small way, they
are being offered a new definition of one of the world's most
prized spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Hennessy has just released three Cognacs _ Le Peu, Izambard and
Camp Romain, each the product of a single distillery using Cognacs
from seven to 25 years old, each with its own personality, all
priced around $48.
</P>
<P>
   Hennessy is not alone. Louis Royer has just introduced a lineup
of five single-distillery Cognacs intended to represent the
personality of five of the six Cognac districts.
</P>
<P>
   Des Saules, for example, uses grapes from Borderies, a tiny
district whose svelte, rounded Cognacs soften a final blend in much
the same way that merlot civilizes a tough cabernet. The Cognac of
Les Magnolias, from the Grande Champagne district, shows the
finesse and complex fruit and floral aromas associated with
Cognac's premier district.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from about $28 for a Chantal Cognac from the Bons
Bois to $68 for Les Magnolias, and the ages follow an ascending
scale as well, from the two-year-old and three-year-old Cognacs
that make up Chantal to an average of 15 years in Les Magnolias,
quite young for a Grande Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   In taking the single-district approach, Royer has followed in
the footsteps of Gabriel &AMP; Andreu, which for the last three years
has been turning out some smashing Cognacs from the Fins Bois,
Borderies, Petite Champagne and Grande Champagne, all of them made
by single estates with their own distilleries.
</P>
<P>
   The Gabriel &AMP; Andreu Cognacs are priced from $30 for the
eight-year-old Fins Bois to $100 for the 35-year-old Grande
Champagne. The 25-year-old Petite Champagne, which sells for about
$65, is a thing of beauty, light-bodied, subtle and elegant, with a
rich floral, licorice and vanilla bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   The single-distillery experiment could backfire. Scotch
connoisseurs look on most blended Scotches with disdain. If Cognac
drinkers decide that single-distillery Cognacs show more character,
will they abandon blends as too bland? On the other hand, the
skeptical consumer might wonder, if the single-distillery products
are so fabulous, why has it taken several hundred years for them to
be marketed?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Scotch was in the same boat barely 15 years ago, when
most Americans, if they even knew what a single-malt was, could
probably name only Glenlivet and Glenfiddich as examples.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it all comes down to the liquid in the bottle. Le
Peu, ethereal and brightly fruity, can easily stand alone. So can
Hennessy's Camp Romain, a deep, nutty, fruitcake-rich Cognac made
by Betty Lesueur, one of few women who are Cognac distillers.
</P>
<P>
   Izambard, which occupies a middle ground between the two, may be
a Cognac that can make more of a contribution in a blend. Likewise
Des Saules, Royer's Cognac from Borderies. Nutty and supple, it is
a friendly, undemanding Cognac, ideal for Cognac beginners but best
suited to be a team player, not a star. The race is on. May the
best distillery win. &QL;

RIOTS HIGHLIGHT FEELINGS OF BIAS AMONG ISRAEL'S ARAB MINORITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UMM EL-FAHM, Israel _ As though they had copied a script from
their Palestinian brethren in the West Bank, about 1,000 angry
Arabs in this mountainous Israeli village lobbed rocks at Israeli
border police Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The police held their ground and fired tear gas canisters, the
sound echoing through the hills. The young protesters passed out
onions to blunt the chemical's potency. Hooded young men burned
tires in the streets. One even carried a Palestinian flag.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes began Sunday after the border police burned down a
makeshift tent set up by the Arabs here to protest a government
decision to use 1,000 acres of village land for a military training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   The incident sparked three days of rioting in which hundreds of
protesters were injured. It also highlighted feelings of
discrimination among Israel's Arab minority and reignited
sensitivities over land expropriation, an issue that has marred
Jewish-Arab relations since the state of Israel was founded 50
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main issue is the land,'' said Bassam Kanaana, a
33-year-old Arab protester. ``They want to turn the Arab villages
into ghettos by not allowing them to expand naturally. They want to
strangle our ability to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials say the newly designated military area, hills
now used by Arab farmers for grazing sheep and growing olive trees,
will be used by the army as a firing range, but that the villagers
can continue to use the land as long as they agree to vacate it
whenever the army needs it.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Arabs and their left-wing Jewish supporters believe the
government has another agenda for the land, which straddles the
municipal boundaries of Umm el-Fahm and two other Arab villages.
They say the government plans to move Arabs off the land, then
eventually build a Jewish village called Iron. It is a tactic, they
say, that has been used many times before in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pattern,'' said Michael Warschawski, a Jewish
activist and director of the Alternative Information Center, a
left-wing organization that participated in Tuesday's
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an accident that 100 percent of the private land
confiscated in Israel for military purposes belonged to Arabs,'' he
said. ``On the contrary, it reflects very well what is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Umm el-Fahm, 60 miles north-northeast of Tel Aviv, has watched
its borders shrink since 1948, the year Israel was created. First,
the Jewish town of Me Ami sprung up to the south, on land Umm
el-Fahm used to count as its own. Then, the town of Ma'Avya
appeared on the northern border.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest move, the Israeli Defense Ministry declared land
to the west ``closed'' for military use. ``Five, eight years from
now, you will hear that they're planning to build a new Jewish city
here,'' Warschawski predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes underscore just how much in common Israel's
800,000-strong Arab population has with the 2.6 million
Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. And they
underscore the government's different responses to rioting in
Israel and in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the police stormed a village school, beating and
arresting students. Private homes were damaged, and police used
rubber bullets as well as tear gas against the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   But since the Arabs are citizens of Israel, they have political
clout that Palestinians do not.
</P>
<P>
   Arab members of the Knesset, Israel's Parliament, blasted the
border police for using such a strong show of force to quell the
riots. And village leaders struck a deal with Micha Goldman, the
chairman of the Knesset interior committee, to allow the owners to
use the land.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the police deployed at the edges of Umm el-Fahm,
instead of entering the city, and allowed peaceful demonstrations
in surrounding villages to wrap up quietly.
</P>
<P>
   President Ezer Weizmann called on Israel's Arabs and Jews to
find a way to coexist in peace and visited Umm el-Fahm for an hour
Tuesday in a show of support.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, many Israeli Arabs believe that little more than geography
and an Israeli passport separate them from the Palestinians. When
Israel's war for independence ended in 1948, Umm-el-Fahm fell
within the new state. But it stands only a few miles from the
border with the West Bank, which was controlled by Jordan until
Israel capture it in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no difference between us and them,'' said a
Palestinian protester, who gave his name only as Mahameed, echoing
a familiar refrain among the Arab demonstrators here. ``We're
brothers. We have Israeli identity cards, but first, we're
Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   And when violence flares in the West Bank, such as the explosion
in Ramallah on Tuesday that killed an alleged Hamas militant and
wounded two of his brothers, Israeli Arabs typically sympathize.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Israel's Arab community say the feelings stem from
Israeli government policies that make Arab citizens think of
themselves as outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people feel that they are discriminated against in just
about every facet of life,'' said Hassan Jabarin, an Israeli Arab
lawyer and director of the Adala Legal Center for Arab Minority
Rights in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Arab leaders say their municipalities receive only a tiny
portion of the government funds that Jewish municipalities get.
</P>
<P>
   They say their schools were left out of a government-funded
program designed to help poorer students enter college, even
though, they add, far more Arabs than Jews live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   And Israel's Arabs had to go to court just to try to get street
signs printed in Arabic _ they are now printed only in Hebrew and
English. Arabic is the primary language of nearly 20 percent of
Israel's population. The case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   College entrance exams have asked students about Judaism, but
not Islam or Christianity. Arab parties have been conspicuously
left out of government coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, a bill that would prohibit Arabs from running for
prime minister was introduced in the Parliament, then tabled by a
Jewish member.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt like an Israeli,'' said Kanaaneh, the
Palestinian demonstrator, standing with other protesters in his
village of Kufr Qara, next to Umm el-Fahm. ``The state doesn't let
us feel that we belong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like strangers in our own land.'' &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From the nondescript headquarters of his Houston
construction firm, Leo E. Linbeck Jr., a lanky, bow-tied executive
with a drawl, is masterminding a crusade to overturn the nation's
tax system.
</P>
<P>
   Once, someone like him might have hired some of Washington's
``Gucci Gulch'' lobbyists to prowl the marble corridors outside
Congress' tax committees. But Linbeck, with Texas-style audacity,
wants to engineer a populist uprising to replace the income tax
code with a national sales tax. And with $15 million from some
initial investors and mass fund raising, he has run a radio and
television advertising campaign and employed an army of media
consultants, pollsters, political strategists, marketers, academics
and yes, even a few lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine what it would be like if you were in Congress and you
got a thousand phone calls a week and letters and e-mails and
faxes,'' Linbeck, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in
Dallas, said. ``Not people from all over the country, but your
constituents, people whose names you recognize, the people who were
at the polls with you, who live down the street with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck and his fellow investors in ``Americans for Fair
Taxation'' are unusual in the scale of their ambition. But their
methods have become commonplace as lobbying has undergone a
revolution over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely now does a well-connected Washington lobbyist work alone
to persuade power brokers in Congress. Instead, the lobbyist has
become just one of many players running full-fledged national
campaigns intended to create a ``grass-roots'' groundswell in
support of, or more often in opposition to, legislation before
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In their million-dollar costs and their reliance on television,
polling and grass-roots constituency building, these efforts most
resemble presidential campaigns. And they are now so pervasive and
sophisticated that it has become difficult to distinguish between a
lobbying effort, an issue advocacy campaign and a citizens
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these efforts are genuine grass-roots movements. But
others are deceptions in which a special interest pays to create
the appearance of a popular groundswell.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of these techniques has spread the wealth of the
influence industry beyond the lawyer-lobbyist to a new class of
political professionals, who often play overlapping roles as
advisers to presidential and congressional candidates, corporate
tacticians and media pundits.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where the distinctions and conflicts between their
multiple roles seem to matter less and less and can even be a
business advantage, strategists who are ideological enemies in
politics put their differences aside to work together on
large-scale corporate campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is the outgrowth of several developments in technology
and politics. E-mail, computer databases, talk radio and 24-hour
cable television all make it easier to organize and send a
political message across the country at warp speed.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, power in Washington has been dispersed, so
that new ways are needed to influence more legislators. The media
age politician is far more likely to be moved by polls, television
ads and mass constituent contacts than by party discipline, a
committee chairman or a Washington wise man. And the Republicans in
Congress know they came to power with the help of several groups
with grass-roots memberships: the National Federation of
Independent Businesses, the National Rifle Association, the
Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Public policy experts debate whether the new methods of lobbying
have made it more democratic by taking it out of the back rooms of
the Capitol or whether they have simply made it far more difficult
for interests without money to compete in the public arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of a trend in Washington where rational debate on
issues gets buried in big-budget sound bites,'' said Edward
Yingling, the chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck says of his way of moving Congress: ``It's not as
orderly. It's not as predictable. It's not as controlled as some
might want it to be. But I think those are positive attributes.''
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of the worlds of lobbying and politics is
evident in how Linbeck has gone about his people's crusade. He
estimates the effort will take several years and ultimately cost an
extraordinary $90 million, a sum likely only if hundreds of
thousands of Americans join his cause. Right now, a major tax
overhaul is only a glimmer far out on the horizon of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his initial money went to hire prominent academics and
research organizations to develop the 23 percent national sales
tax. But to speed the organizing and make his proposal as
politically appealing as possible, he has also turned to national
experts in politics, using Denis Calabrese, a Houston Republican
consultant and onetime aide to Rep. Dick Armey of Texas as his
chief strategist. With Calabrese's help, ``Americans for Fair
Taxation'' has hired an all-star cast from both parties to propel
his tax plan:
</P>
<P>
   _Richard Wirthlin, President Reagan's pollster, surveyed the
electorate's attitudes towards the tax system, with some help from
Mark Mellman, pollster to the Democratic leadership in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   _Don Sipple, a media adviser to Bob Dole's presidential campaign
produced early television advertisements to test-market the sales
tax.
</P>
<P>
   _Fred Steeper, a well-established Republican pollster in
Michigan, checked on the advertisements' results.
</P>
<P>
   _Creative Response Concepts, whose president, Greg Mueller, was
communications director for Patrick Buchanan's 1996 presidential
run, promotes the sales tax to journalists.
</P>
<P>
   _Charles Sewell, a one-time Democratic staff aide and strategist
who is now a vice president at the Washington office of Ketchum
Public Relations, scours the country for civic leaders who can head
chapters of Americans for Fair Taxation in the nation's 435
congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   _Americans for Fair Taxation does have a more traditional
lobbying team too, from Arter &AMP; Hadden, a law firm whose ranks
include two former members of Congress from Texas Thomas Loeffler,
a Republican and Jim Chapman, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   This may sound like the lobbying equivalent of the Normandy
invasion. But ever since the epic battle against Clinton's proposal
for national health insurance in 1994, these kinds of ensembles
have assembled on issue after issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inside game of lobbying is in decline and the outside game
of consumer messaging _ of marshaling public opinion _ is advancing
and increasing,`` said Mike Murphy, media consultant in 1996 to the
Republican presidential candidates Lamar Alexander and Bob Dole.
``And savvy companies have figured out that the best experts to
hire to do this kind of work are political consultants.'' His
company also specializes in advertising, research and political
organizing for corporations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, new forms of communication like the Internet,
e-mail, talk radio and computerized ``blast faxes'' have made it
far easier to organize national constituencies and instantly
instruct them on when to deluge Congress in letters and phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   And as party discipline has waned, members of Congress have also
proved ever more responsive to television advertising or contacts
from home, or the ups and downs of instantly sampled public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The turn to grass roots persuasion techniques takes place at the
same time that party politics is metamorphosing in the television
age, with fund-raisers replacing block captains and the public
increasingly cut off from either main party. And some say these
lobbying efforts are the politics of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the election industry back in the '70s,'' Brian
Lunde, a former executive director of the Democratic National
Committee, said. ``There was no such thing then. This is the same
thing. It's the next generation of political campaign in the
country.''

   Lambert Bridge Merlot, Sonoma County, Calif., 1995. About $20. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The people at Lambert Bridge Winery, in the Dry Creek region of
northern Sonoma County, think of this wine as being in the style of
a good Pomerol, and they are not far off the mark. The wine has
Bordeaux style with the roundness characteristic of St.-Emilion and
Pomerol.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a particularly subtle wine, but thanks to some
cabernet in the blend, it has good structure, which is winespeak
for tannin. Not a wimpy merlot by any means, it is composed of 78
percent merlot, 14 percent cabernet sauvignon and 8 percent
cabernet franc.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of the grapes came from the Dry Creek region,
and the rest from Carneros, down by the San Pablo Bay. The alcohol
content is about 13 percent. The wine spent 16 months in French oak
barrels, and it is quite ready to be enjoyed now.

BROWN'S 16 STRIKEOUTS BESTS JOHNSON AND ASTROS, 2-1  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ All the attention, all the focus, all the hype before
the game belonged to Randy Johnson. But the 16 strikeouts were
Kevin Brown's. And now, after their 2-1 loss to the San Diego
Padres, Johnson's Houston Astros are down one game to none in their
National League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is generally regarded as the most fearsome pitcher in
the major leagues. But Brown has something Johnson doesn't: a World
Series ring. And now Brown has the most strikeouts ever recorded in
a playoff game _ division or championship series.
</P>
<P>
   And the only reason he did not challenge Bob Gibson's
post-season record of 17 (set in the 1968 World Series) is because
San Diego Manager Bruce Bochy turned to his closer, Trevor Hoffman,
to pitch the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny,'' Houston Manager Larry Dierker said, referring
to a conversation he had with bench coach Matt Galante just before
the ninth. ``We talked about that in the eighth inning. Matt asked
if they would bring Hoffman in and I said, `I hope he does.'''
</P>
<P>
   Which was funny in its own right. Because Hoffman, who had 53
saves, was the most dominating closer in the majors this season.
</P>
<P>
   But that only demonstrates how good Brown was.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, San Diego General Manager Kevin Towers had told
the San Diego Union-Tribune, ``I will take Kevin Brown head-to-head
with Randy Johnson in any game, on Astroturf, cement, asphalt,
grass, you name it. I'll take my chances with Kevin Brown anywhere,
I don't care where it's at.''
</P>
<P>
   And, for at least one night, Towers was right. In tossing eight
scoreless innings against the best lineup in the league, Brown
allowed just two singles (both to Houston's No. 8 hitter Brad
Ausmus). Brown had at least one strikeout in each inning he
pitched, and he struck out the side in the both the third and the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Brown struck out every Astro in the starting lineup except Bill
Spiers. He fanned Derek Bell and Ricky Gutierrez three times each;
Craig Biggio, Jeff Bagwell, Moises Alou, Carl Everett and Johnson
twice apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he may have been more dominating when he pitched a
no-hitter for the Florida Marlins last season. ``But,'' he said,
``I'll take today's game any time because of the setting. The
no-hitter was great from a personal standpoint. But today's game
had a much bigger impact on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   And, all of a sudden, after the Padres had picked up their first
postseason victory in 14 years, it was the Astros who were in the
early hole.
</P>
<P>
   Not because Johnson pitched badly by any means. It was just that
Brown, who was 18-7 with a 2.38 earned run average, pitched a Randy
Johnson-type game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got out-pitched today,'' said Johnson. ``That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   After being obtained from the Seattle Mariners minutes before
the July 31 trading deadline, Johnson was 5-0 at the Astrodome with
a 0.42 ERA and four shutouts in his first four home starts. In all,
Johnson was 10-1 with Houston with a 1.28 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Johnson allowed 9 hits and 2 runs in his 8 innings,
walking 1 while striking out 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy had good stuff, but not his best stuff,'' Dierker said.
``And Kevin was as dominating as you can be. Other than pitching a
no-hitter, I don't know what more he could have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson looked unhittable at the start Tuesday, catching both
Tony Gwynn and Ken Caminiti looking at called third strikes to end
the top of the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first at-bat was over so quick,'' said Gwynn, who has won
the NL batting title 8 times. ``Bip, bap, bip. See ya.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Padres were able to collect a pair of singles off
Johnson in the second, one in the fourth and another in the fifth.
And even though they could not score, it was much more than the
Astros were doing against Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Both pitchers were throwing in the 95 to 97 mile per hour range.
But Brown had all four of his pitches working: a two-seam sinking
fastball, a four-seam fastball that tails up and away; a forkball
with a nasty drop and a slider that seems to rise on left-handed
hitters as it breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw more four-seamers than he has in the past to set up
his sinker,'' Biggio said. ``He threw his four-seamer up and out of
the zone and we chased it a lot of times. And when someone's
throwing 97 out of the zone, you're not going to hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   And nobody really did.
</P>
<P>
   Through five innings, Brown had allowed just one hit: an Ausmus
single with one out in the third. Ausmus would eventually make it
to third on back-to-back passed balls by Carlos Hernandez, who was
screened by Johnson as he attempted to bunt. But Brown fanned
Johnson and Biggio to end the threat. And the game was still
scoreless entering the sixth, when Gwynn led off the top of the
inning by slapping a 1-2 Johnson slider for a line-drive double
over third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how I hit that one ball,'' said Gwynn, who would
later leave the game because his left achilles tendon tightened up.
``I'm just happy it found a hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Vaughn followed by beating out an infield single, after
Spiers had nearly robbed him with a great backhand play at third.
And now the Padres had runners on first and second. Caminiti was
next, and he blooped a single over second and just out of Biggio's
reach. Jim Leyritz followed with a bases-loaded sacrifice fly to
center. And even though the Padres eventually left runners on
second and third, Brown had a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   He made it stand up, stranding runners on second and third
himself by striking out Derek Bell to end the Houston sixth. And
then Vaughn _ who had hit his 50th homer in his final at-bat of the
regular season _ belted a Johnson slider over the left field
scoreboard to open the eighth with an immensely valuable insurance
run to give San Diego a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Brown responded by striking out the side in the eighth to leave
pinch-hitter Dave Clark _ who had walked with two outs _ stranded
at third. But Brown was pitching on three days rest. And he had now
thrown 118 pitches, 77 of them for strikes. And so Bochy went to
Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took somebody like Trevor Hoffman to not have Kevin go back
out,'' Bochy said. ``Hoffman's the best reliever in the game. It
was a win-win situation. Or lose-lose if things wouldn't have
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   They almost didn't. Spiers led off the ninth by doubling over
third. After Bell flew out and Bagwell struck out, Caminiti nearly
robbed Alou with a Graig Nettles-like diving stop at third. But
Caminiti threw the ball away, Alou scampered home, and the Astros
were down by a run. But Everett flew to center to end the game. And
the Padres had made sure the day belonged to Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even realize I had that many strikeouts until the
ninth inning, when Ed Vosberg told me,'' said Brown, whose
career-high in the majors had been 11. ``Thirteen is the most I
ever remember having. And that was in college.''

INDIANS ADD TO DISMAL PLAYOFF OPENER RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The question was simple enough. Why, Omar Vizquel
was asked, have the Indians lost their last seven postseason series
openers? Why does a club that is good enough to win four
consecutive American League Central Division titles, a team
talented enough to have made it to two of the last three World
Series, play so poorly coming out of the blocks?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got no idea,'' said Vizquel, pondering the meaning and
the consequences of Tuesday's 11-3 loss to the Red Sox at Jacobs
Field in the opener of their best-of-five AL Division Series. ``But
it's not easy coming from behind. It's one of the toughest things
in baseball. Not many teams can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came a pause as the Indians shortstop looked for a positive
spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the right people here who can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But not always. In the previous six series, the Indians have won
as many as they have lost, going 3-3. And they have never lost an
opener in Cleveland and come back to win a series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a big deal,'' said Vizquel, who was hitless in three
at-bats against Pedro Martinez. ``It's important to win the first
game. It's always important to get that first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in what turned into an afternoon's delight for Mo
Vaughn and the Red Sox, the Indians stumbled almost coming out of
the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The balloons released in a pregame ceremony were still swirling
around the Jake when starter Jaret Wright found himself in big
trouble, giving up singles to Darren Lewis and John Valentin before
Vaughn powered his first home run of the game over the left-field
fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some mistakes, and that got us into a hole early,''
said Wright, who also gave up a three-run homer to Nomar
Garciaparra in the fifth that settled the issue. ``After the first,
I just said to myself to go out and put up zeros to help my
teammates. Then Nomar came and hit the ball out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, who staggered into the playoffs after winning
another division title in ridiculously easy fashion, understand
that their margin for error _ or errors _ is now all but gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this means is that they are one game closer,'' said left
fielder Brian Giles. ``We never gave ourselves a chance today. We
were down, 3-0. Then it was 6-0. It puts a lot of pressure on us
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians seemed to put pressure on themselves all day, from
Wright's first-inning jitters to the lackadaisical baserunning of
right fielder Manny Ramirez, who went into his home run trot on a
fly ball to deep center in the second that bounced off the fence,
winding up with a single instead of what should have been at least
a double. Ramirez then was doubled up off first when a line drive
by Travis Fryman was speared at third by John Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did they help themselves with some spotty pitching. The
Red Sox pounded Wright and five relievers for 12 hits, including
three homers, as everyone in the lineup other than Troy O'Leary
reached safely.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Indians are in a hole that will become a pit if they
cannot find a way to beat Tim Wakefield and his knuckleball this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we don't want to do is go back to Boston down, 0-2,''
said first baseman Jim Thome, stating the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians know they can come back. But they also know they are
facing a new set of problems, having lost the opener at home.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being at least, manager Mike Hargrove could laugh
about the task at hand. ``It's not the perfect world scenario,'' he
said. ``We certainly didn't lose this one to keep our tradition
going. We would rather have won the first game. If you can get any
comfort out of anything, we have (come back) before. We didn't want
to have to do it again, but we have to do it again, so we'll give
it our best shot.''

LEWIS, VALENTIN CHANGE INDIANS' GAME PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Red Sox manager Jimy Williams, in his usual
understated way, had this to say about Mo Vaughn's seven RBIs:
Remember that ``five of the seven were of individuals who got on
before him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove, in his usual blunt manner
following a loss, had this to say about Darren Lewis and John
Valentin upsetting his best-laid plans: ``We had to change our
approach to pitching to (Vaughn and Nomar Garciaparra) because we
had to pitch to them. Every time they came up, they had runners on
base.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit and endless cassettes of highlight tape will be devoted
to Vaughn's seven RBIs and Garciaparra's four RBIs in the Red Sox'
11-3 playoff-opening rout of the Indians Tuesday, but save a
cassette or two for Lewis and Valentin. They forced the Indians to
pitch to Boston's two most feared hitters for the simple reason
that Boston's first and second batters were on base so often _
eight times, to be precise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Vaughn and Garciaparra came up,'' said Hargrove,
``every base was covered and we had no place to put them. Our goal
going into the series was to pitch around those guys. But how are
you going to pitch around them when the bases are full? When the
bases are full, you've got to pitch to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The bases weren't exactly full _ Vaughn's and Garciaparra's
homers that gave Boston a 6-0 lead came with two runners on _ but
Hargrove's point was well taken. ``The best way to pitch to Vaughn
and Garciapparra,'' he said, ``is to get the people out in front of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys were on for our No. 3 and 4 guys to come through,'' said
Valentin (3 for 4, 1 walk, 4 runs), who had struggled with a most
sluggish .159 average in September. ``Darren and I went up there to
be aggressive. (Cleveland starter Jaret) Wright wasn't around the
strike zone and maybe he overthrew the ball, and we were able to
look for pitches to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone was set in the first when Lewis (2 for 2, 1 hit by
pitch, 1 run) led off with a single and Valentin followed with a
single to left on a hit-and-run. ``We don't have a hit-and-run,''
joked Valentin. ``Darren just happened to be running when I
happened to be hitting.'' Vaughn followed with a three-run homer on
a full count as Wright could not afford to walk the slugger with
two on and none out and Garciaparra in the on-deck circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to put the pressure on them right away in that first
inning,'' said Lewis. ``To be able to put the pressure on them
right away in this situation is very big. What you do is go out and
do anything to get on base. I think John and I take a lot of pride
in this and doing everything we can to score some runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis could not hear out of his left ear and his head was
ringing more than a roomful of cellular phone technicians when he
spoke these words some two hours after his plate appearance in the
fifth. That's because Wright sent a rising fastball inside that
kept moving in until it caught Lewis on the earflap of his batting
helmet. The Red Sox center fielder lay face down at home plate for
minutes until he was finally led off the field. His replacement,
Damon Buford, then scored on Garciaparra's homer and came around
after being hit by a pitch in the eighth when Vaughn stroked a
bases-loaded double.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never lost consciousness,'' said Lewis. ``My ear was just
ringing. Pretty loud, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lewis lay in the dirt, the Red Sox medical staff ``just asked
me to open my eyes, and I did and I told them I felt fine, except
my ears were ringing. Other than that, I felt pretty good. I wasn't
dizzy or anything. I feel fine now. I don't have a headache or
anything. I just can't hear out of one ear.''
</P>
<P>
   The moment, though, was frightening. ``What scared me more than
anything was that my ear was ringing so loud,'' Lewis said, ``and
it's happened to me once before, back when I was in A ball.'' It
was also frightening because Lewis recalled when Robby Thompson,
his teammate in San Francisco, was hit in the face in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball hit me right on the earflap, and I was just glad I
was able to get down in time,'' said Lewis. ``I'd seen one of my
teammates get hit in the face in '93 and ... and ... it's part of
the game. It's like being a wide receiver going over the middle and
taking a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The only recourse after being hit, said Lewis, ``is to jump
right back up and get right back in there.'' Lewis wasn't able to
do that Tuesday _ Buford ran for him, and after Valentin walked,
Garciaparra unloaded. But he and Valentin had done more than enough
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get the two guys out in front of Vaughn and
Garciaparra,'' said Hargrove. Or else there may be more long games,
and a possible short series, for Cleveland.

PRESSURE IS ON GOODEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ He is almost of a different era, a figure from the
past. But Wednesday afternoon at Jacobs Field, Indians pitcher
Dwight Gooden's presence will be vital.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 1-0, in the American League Division Series after
Tuesday's 11-3 rout by the Red Sox, the Cleveland Indians will ask
Gooden to do something he has never done: win a postseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, you remember Doc Gooden, the star of the Mets'
contending teams of a decade ago; Doc Gooden, who fell from grace
so quickly and steadily as a result of substance abuse that now he
is almost an afterthought, someone who came to the Indians more by
chance than design.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gooden, who for all his success with the Mets never won a
playoff or World Series game, must deliver. Or else. ``I wouldn't
say (the drought) frustrates me,'' said Gooden. Tuesday ``But it
would be nice to get one. In my past postseasons, I felt I pitched
well, but unfortunately, the guys I went against pitched very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden compiled an 8-6 record this season with Cleveland, which
made him not an ace but at least part of the postseason rotation,
an amazing feat considering that he started the season on the
disabled list with arm problems.
</P>
<P>
   An aging pitcher with a bad arm is hardly considered a building
block for a successful staff, but Gooden overcame the setbacks,
starting out at Triple A Buffalo and slowly and steadily working
his way back into major league pitching form.
</P>
<P>
   When Mike Hargrove was asked if he would have been surprised if
someone had told him at midseason that Gooden would have been his
starter in Game 2 of the playoffs, the manager nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what really went on in spring training and leading up to
that point with the tendinitis in his shoulder and how inconsistent
he had been up to that point, I think it might have sounded crazy
at that point,'' conceded Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   It may be even crazier if Gooden wins his first postseason game
ever after being considered finished.

   MOBILE, Ala. _ Sometimes, said Reola Jones, a tree just knows
which way to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Georges ripped through her neighborhood here in the
darkness of early Monday morning, blowing through windows and
snapping trees and sending water rippling down the street. Power
lines sparked along a pitch-black street as she prayed in the
little wood house she shares with her elderly father on Duval
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got up out of bed and wondered which window I was going to
end up flying through,'' she said. She sat frightened until
daylight.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn, she saw that two large trees had fallen on either side
of her house. One tree missed the house by just a few feet as it
toppled in the yard. A second one, uprooted, was snagged by power
lines as it toppled toward her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wonderful works of God,'' she said, sitting outside the
house as power company workers tried to untangle the mess of power
lines and limbs as cars crept through a street still puddled with
dingy water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mess,'' said the 56-year-old Ms. Jones. ``But we were
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the most-repeated assessment of this hurricane
here on Mobile Bay _ and elsewhere along the Gulf Coast _ as
Georges faded first into a tropical storm and then a tropical
depression as it moved sluggishly out of the region, dumping heavy
rains on South Alabama, southeastern Georgia and northern Florida.
Roads in Alabama flooded, lights winked out as far north as
Montgomery, and coastal residents from Louisiana to Florida found
beach houses, piers and businesses badly damaged by wind and storm
surges.
</P>
<P>
   But, said people here, it threatened to be much, much worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of houses banged up,'' said Henry Williams, 53, as he
cleaned a mess of tree limbs from the front yard of his small house
on Victory Drive. Not far away, chainsaws tore through the last of
the trees that blocked a narrow street as people swept the dark
water off porches and knelt in mangled flower beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can do is pray that the Good Lord don't take you,''
said Williams, throwing down an armload of tree limbs. ``I slept
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people could not. Hurricane Georges _ which some people
referred to as ``Georgie'' _ had left a wake of death and
destruction through the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, the Dominican
Republic, Haiti and Cuba before raking across the Florida Keys and
them slamming into the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   While winds in Mississippi and Alabama tore off pieces of roofs
and ripped patches from beachside condominiums, storm surges picked
apart piers, eroded beaches and undercut homes. Tens of thousands
evacuated, to shelters, interstate highway hotel rooms and
churches.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters had hoped that Georges would be reduced to a much
weaker storm after crossing the steep mountains of the Dominican
Republic and Cuba, but the storm had sustained winds of some 100
miles per hour and even higher gusts when it made landfall at
Biloxi, Miss., on Sunday. But, instead of pounding northward, the
storm stalled just inland, dropping as much as 30 inches of rain on
parts of the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   As the storm crept to the north and northeast Tuesday, it dumped
as much as 15 inches of rain in southern Alabama and spawned
tornadoes in some parts of the state. Floodwaters filled town
streets in southern Alabama. It was waist-deep in parts of East
Brewton, Ala., and Flomaton, Ala., early Tuesday evening as creeks
and rivers overflowed their banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping it doesn't get to the downtown,'' said Sandy
Stargel, chief dispatcher at the Flomaton Police Department.
``We've already got water in several houses.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was along the coast in Mississippi and Alabama that the
floods caused the most trouble. In Pascagoula, Miss., water reached
rooftops, roads were washed out and oyster shells were swept into
yards. More than 600,000 people had lost power.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands filled hotel rooms as far north as Memphis. Marilyn
Dedeaux of Jackson, Miss., kept 16 relatives and friends and four
large refugee dogs in her home, where they all waited for the
floods to recede.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dedeaux said the people got along well in the crowded house,
but her 75-pound bassett hound, Lindsey, was ``very unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, on the Dog River near Mobile, more than 100 boats
were sunk or damaged as the storm blew through.
</P>
<P>
   Water as deep as 11 feet swamped Water Street in downtown
Mobile, flooding homes and chasing residents into shelters. The
stately mansions on Government Street in Mobile _ homes of old
money and new money _ seemed mostly untouched, while poorer
neighborhoods suffered much worse.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Jones, on Duval Street, wondered a little about that. But
she is not complaining too much, considering her luck with the
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Her luck, before the storm, had not been good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a little job in town, but it played out,'' said Ms.
Jones, who is still unemployed. She and her elderly father live on
his Social Security check while she looks for work.
</P>
<P>
   They had been trying to fix up the small house, and its
multi-colored walls, pieced together from different materials, are
signs of that.
</P>
<P>
   As the storm pounded them early Monday, she felt they would lose
the roof, at least, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wind sounded like a missile,'' she said. ``The window
broke,'' and limbs rattled across the shingles. One tree tumbled
across a chain link fence, destroying it _ ``one more thing we got
to do'' _ as water filled the streets, she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the big trees that missed the house also missed her car,
by inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll set us back, further,'' she said of the damages to their
property. But all in all, she said, their luck held. ``I'm just
amazed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While the damage to property along the coast and points inland
will be in the millions, the storm _ which caused some 370 deaths
in the Caribbean _ is blamed for only four deaths on the Gulf
Coast. Candles, lit because of power outtages, led to fatal fires
in Pensacola, Fla., and New Orleans. A traffic accident during the
storm killed a woman in Pensacola, and an elderly woman died while
being moved to a shelter in Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   But no one was killed by flying debris or drowned, at least as
of this evening, in the floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, where people had feared the storm would make
landfall and flood a city that is six feet below sea level, some
21,000 people left shelters Tuesday morning and headed home,
``thankful that we were spared'' said the city's mayor, Marc
Morial.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton met Tuesday with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and emphasized the work that the Palestinians
need to do to combat terrorism as the Israelis withdraw from an
additional 13 percent of the West Bank, senior U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the leaders second meeting in two days, after a session
on Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and it
demonstrated, Clinton's aides said, the president's determination
to complete an interim agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Israel has accepted a phased withdrawal from the West
Bank, of the 13 percent that Washington had insisted on, American
attention turned to the more complicated details of how
Palestinians can improve security. The improvements are supposed to
be made parallel with the Israeli pullbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Those topics involve issues like dismantling terrorist cells,
confiscating some guns and halting the ``incitement'' of residents
through anti-Israeli speeches and propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace is a Palestinian need, Israeli need, Arab need,
international need,'' Arafat said after the hourlong talks with
Clinton. ``We are very close on a number of subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat expressed hope that a deal could be reached at a meeting
here next month, a move agreed to on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said, ``The president is
determined to see an agreement arise from this exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu and Arafat, whose personal and ideological dislike and
distrust for each other have become ingrained, met on Monday for
the first time in almost a year. Even more important, senior
American officials said, they agreed to a series of contacts and a
way to manage crises between them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also wanted to reassure Arafat of Washington's
commitment to help the Palestinians through aid and investment,
White House officials said. Clinton emphasized ``how much terrorism
undermines Arafat, as well,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans also wanted to go over some of Arafat's concerns
about what remains to be done, including Palestinian needs for
security from attacks by Israeli settlers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Early next week Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the
Middle East negotiator, Dennis Ross, will travel to the Middle East
for talks with the two sides, to try to insure that the meeting
next month succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to have Netanyahu, Arafat and their aides and
experts at a site near Washington, with American officials guiding
their negotiations and Clinton involving himself as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   If an interim deal can be finished, talks will formally open on
a final settlement between Israel and the Palestinians, originally
envisioned in the 1993 and 1995 Oslo accords to be completed by May
4.
</P>
<P>
   Although American, Israeli and Palestinian officials
acknowledged that much work remains to be done, all expressed a new
confidence that the time is ripe for a deal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   American officials expressed particular concern about the
dangers of new violence or unilateral actions by either side that
could quickly erode the wary willingness of the two men to work
together.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emphasized to both that they needed to avoid
embarrassing each other.
</P>
<P>
   He and Albright pressed Arafat in his United Nations speech on
Monday to avoid any commitment to declaring an independent
Palestinian state after May 4, if the final-status negotiations
have not succeeded by then.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, while asking the help of the world to achieve that goal,
complied with the American request.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, speaking here on Monday, said he had told Arafat that
any such unilateral step would force him to respond in kind and
destroy the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   The other great concern is of another bombing of Israeli
civilians by Palestinian radicals opposed to Arafat and the peace
effort. American officials pointed to an explosion Tuesday in
Ramallah, on the West Bank, of a car that was apparently being
equipped as a bomb for use against Israelis. The explosion killed a
participant in the Hamas organization and wounded two other
supporters of the militant Islamic group.
</P>
<P>
   Similar attacks have disrupted momentum toward peace and pushed
Netanyahu to attack Arafat for his apparent failure to insure
complete security for Israelis, even when the bombers lived in or
moved through Israeli-controlled territory.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has been bracing for a renewal of Hamas bombings and
Tuesday sealed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza Strip on the
eve of Yom Kippur.

DEMOTED BOEING EXEC OPTS FOR RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Ron Woodard, who was forced out earlier this month as
president of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, has decided to
retire Nov. 1, the company said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard has not said what he plans to do. He was not available
for comment Tuesday, Boeing spokeswoman Sherry Nebel said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his failure as a manager of production, Woodard is
renowned as a salesman of airplanes, and had been publicly offered
a job as vice president for sales and marketing at Boeing. But that
job would have been a demotion, forcing Woodard, 55, to report to
the man who replaced him, Alan Mulally, 53. It also would have
taken part of the job responsibility of Boeing's top-ranking woman,
Nancy Bethell, who has been on medical leave.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing observers said all along that Woodard was not likely to
take the sales job. ``I'm not surprised,'' said an analyst who
asked not to be identified. ``You've already had the fingers
pointed at you. Are you going to stick around?''
</P>
<P>
   In the four-paragraph memo marking Woodard's exit, the company
noted that he had worked in production management and international
sales, and has supported every commercial jetliner since the 707.
Woodard has been at Boeing most of his life, having joined in 1966
at age 23.
</P>
<P>
   The memo quoted Chairman Phil Condit: ``On behalf of the people
of Boeing, I want to personally express our appreciation to Ron for
his many valuable contributions over the years and wish him the
very best in his retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodard has taken the fall for his divison's huge snafus over
the past year, including shortages of parts and high levels of
overtime so bad that the production line was stopped last November.
In booking a record level of orders, salesmen had assumed that
production could keep up. It didn't, nor did the cost produce an
airplane fall by 25 percent, as had been so optimistically planned.
These miscalculations led to the loss of billions in market value
for Boeing shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Condit announced that Boeing expected sharply lower
earnings over the next two years, and made a commitment to
shareholders that profit was a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Condit and Chief Operating Officer Harry Stonecipher followed
this in early August with a meeting with Woodard. Stonecipher and
Condit wanted to know Woodard's plan to ressurect the profit in the
commercial division.
</P>
<P>
   Several meetings followed. When a convincing plan wasn't in hand
by the end of August, the company's top officers decided to replace
Woodard and two lieutenants: Harry Arnold, executive vice president
of airplane development, and Dan Heidt, executive vice president of
airplane components.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually blunt criticism, Stonecipher, said at the
Farnborough Airshow on Sept. 7, that the reason for Woodard's
removal ``had to do with the inability of the team to focus'' on a
way to improve profit margins ``and provide the intensity'' to show
they meant it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to have double-digit margins out of every segment of
our business and they (Woodard's team) didn't show any signs of
getting there,'' Stonecipher said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard has been unusually active in the community for a Boeing
executive. He is a trustee of the University of Puget Sound and is
chairman of the Seattle Symphony. He is also on the board of
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. of Fort Worth.

   BLACKPOOL, England _ Blackpool and the British Labor Party have
been as compatible as fish and chips for years, but the delegates
to this week's convention are having their last fling with the
slatternly old resort.
</P>
<P>
   In another step to shed association with its rabble-rousing
socialist past, the party that Prime Minister Tony Blair calls New
Labor is ending a 70-year-old tradition of gathering here in this
working-class playground on the Irish Sea with its floodlit Eiffel
Tower knockoff, beachfront amusement arcades and rows of prim
Victorian rooming houses with geranium pots on the windowsills.
</P>
<P>
   The years to come will find the delegates in more refined places
like Brighton and Bournemouth on the English Channel, the vacation
spots for the aspirational class wedded to small-business
capitalism and shopping mall consumerism that New Labor now courts.
</P>
<P>
   Blackpool's notoriously censorious landladies have had a lot of
tack-spitting comments to make about being tossed aside for the new
model, and they have been joined this week in denouncing the New
Labor government leaders by shunned members of the party's left
wing and the trade union movement that created old Labor nearly a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
   In his keynote address to the conference on Tuesday, Blair
acknowledged that the blush was fading from the party's symbolic
red rose but said people should not lose their nerve as the
government confronts ``tough decisions'' on the economy, welfare
and productivity in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``No retreat,'' he said defiantly. ``No backing down. Backbone,
not back down, is what Britain needs.''
</P>
<P>
   With the first signs that the long honeymoon his government has
had may be coming to an end, he said, ``We would rather be popular
than unpopular, but it is better to be unpopular than wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   His speech to the Labor faithful last year was triumphal, coming
only months after the party had won the government back from the
Conservatives after 18 years out of power. Tuesday's speech took
credit for accomplishments of the last year but sounded a warning
about the future.
</P>
<P>
   He told delegates in the painted gilt Winter Gardens ballroom
that what he called ``modernizing'' moves would provoke dissidence,
and he appealed for support. ``When we bring forward proposals for
change in our welfare,'' he said, ``don't tell us it's a betrayal
of the welfare state when in truth welfare reform is its only
salvation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``There will be attacks to the left of you, attacks to
the right of you, attacks from behind and in front. Welcome to
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair's personal popularity, in fact, continues high, with
approval ratings in the 60s, and his control of the party is
secure. But his having made Labor into what he called on Tuesday a
``pro-business, pro-enterprise'' party is bringing disapproval from
older party members at a time when recessionary fears are rising
and some multinational employers around Britain are shutting down
or cutting back.
</P>
<P>
   Blair on Tuesday looked out at an audience that included restive
union leaders who are increasingly questioning his government's
austerity policies, which have resulted in high interest rates,
restrained spending and low inflation. Blair reminded them that
voters had chosen ``a New Labor party not in the pocket of the
trade unions, not taxing them through the roof, not chasing after
every passing fad of the political fringe but modern, principled,
in touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago in the same hall, John Edmonds, president of
the Trade Unions Congress, had criticized the government for not
cracking down on big boardroom salaries with a blast more typical
of Blackpool rhetoric than Blair's reflective address.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company director who takes a pay rise of 50,000 pounds when
the rest of the work force is getting a few hundred is not part of
some general trend,'' he said, ``he is a greedy bastard.''
</P>
<P>
   The union movement contributed 77 percent of the party's budget
a decade ago but accounts for less than 40 percent now. The
membership of the Labor Party has changed dramatically, and the
people passing by the bingo parlors and vendors peddling Blackpool
rock candy sticks this week were no longer hard-bitten miners in
cloth caps, but accountants, lawyers, economists, management
consultants and businessmen, most of them dressed in dark suits
accessorized with cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Even without moving out of Blackpool, the Labor Party has
already tidied up its once famously disruptive conferences. New
rules regulate what can come to the floor, and the only people to
be called on are ones who have been briefed and screened ahead of
time.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Seddon, editor of the left-wing weekly Tribune and a
successful dissident candidate for the party's national executive
committee, complained that party members were being turned into
``identikit robots.''
</P>
<P>
   The pro-business New Labor party has taken sponsorship to new
levels in British political life at this conference, with even the
tags around the neck of every delegate, visitor and journalist
bearing the logo of a supermarket chain. In a question-and-answer
meeting with delegates on Sunday, Blair was asked if this didn't
mean the party was for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I feel it's sensible to raise money from people
sponsoring things, provided they understand they get nothing in
return,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another questioner raised a favorite word from past Labor
gatherings in Blackpool and asked if its spirit weren't missing
now.
</P>
<P>
   Blair pounced. ``Real comradeship,'' he said, ``is not what used
to happen when people used to get up, call each other comrade and
then follow it with abuse.''

CLINTON AIDES STEP BACK FROM AN ALLY'S PLANS FOR `WAR' AGAINST
GINGRICH
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CLINTON-CANTON, CLINTON-SALON, CLINTON-JONES,
CLINTON-IMPEACH)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to reassure congressional Democrats that
President Clinton feels more contrite than belligerent about his
affair, the White House distanced him Tuesday from a declaration of
``war'' on House Speaker Newt Gingrich by James Carville, the
president's longtime political lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry also said a planned
advertising campaign by a liberal group to buttress the president
would be better directed at helping Democratic congressional
candidates. But the group, People for the American Way, said it
would go forward with its advertising as soon as next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior adviser to the president also said plans to help raise
several million dollars for a separate pro-Clinton advertising
campaign had been scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   The White House moves were signs of nervousness over the shaky
support for the president among Democrats on Capitol Hill.
Democrats complained about the comments from Carville, in a
television appearance on Sunday, and also worried that the
advertising might siphon money from their cause. Carville, who
managed the president's campaign in 1992, has been an informal
unpaid adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The moves also underscored the trouble the White House is having
as it tries for the right political blend of contrition,
conciliation and attack.
</P>
<P>
   The president's aides and allies argue that in criticizing
Congress, Clinton is helping himself by helping his party in the
November elections. But at times, the president can sound like a
different man than the humble penitent who apologized to a roomful
of clerics three weeks ago. At a $10,000-a-plate fund-raiser here
Monday night, he argued that the furor over his affair with a
former White House intern might help Democrats by motivating
normally apathetic voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adversity is our friend in the sense that at least everyone is
now thinking about the political debate,'' he said. ``I'd do nearly
anything to help the Democrats get elected, but this is a little
bit extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks came a day after Carville announced that ``Corporal
Cue Ball Carville will be rolling into battle against Newt
Gingrich'' on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press.'' In a
trademark, staccato burst of derision, Carville called Gingrich a
``a sanctioned, certified, adjudicated and confessed liar.'' He
spoke after being read critical comments by the Speaker about
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The White House tried Tuesday to assure the public and Congress
that Carville was not speaking for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made it quite clear that he will not be muzzled by
anybody,'' McCurry said of Carville.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry also said he did not think Carville's attack on Gingrich
was ``particularly helpful, and I think there are others who share
that opinion here.'' But, he added, ``there may be some people who
think it's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for the president's judgment, McCurry said Clinton planned
to stick with ``the very careful, dignified approach that we've
been bringing to the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt called the White House on
Monday to criticize Carville's approach as counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic congressional aide said it might make Democrats
look overly partisan. Democrats in marginal districts want to be
able to assure both Clinton loyalists and people who favor
impeachment that they are intent only on fulfilling constitutional
obligations, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks as if they're somehow in collusion with a larger
partisan agenda that's being orchestrated by the White House,'' the
aide added.
</P>
<P>
   Carville said he was operating completely on his own, as he
served notice in an interview that he would not back down, citing
criticisms of the president by Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever Newt Gingrich writes a letter of apology for calling
him a misogynist and a criminal, then I'll withdraw my battle
plans,'' he said. ``But until that time I'll proceed,
notwithstanding the judgment of some people in the White House.''

education and health care will help Democrats, said Mark Mellman, a
Democratic pollster who is informally advising the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think he's apologized enough,'' Mellman said. ``There
is a belief that this Republican Congress is more interested in
investigations and in partisan impeachment hearings than they are
in solving people's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   People for the American Way said that despite White House
objections, it would proceed with television advertising supporting
the president and attacking the Republican Congress as obsessed
with scandal. Nancy Coleman, a spokeswoman for the group, said it
was still raising money for the commercials.

 &HT;    Alabama, Florida battered for 24 hours
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GULF SHORES, Ala. _ When Gil and Sammee Dabbs retired from north
Alabama to this sparkling Gulf-side town, realtors told them
hurricanes were a minor nuisance, ``about one every 17 years,'' Gil
Dabbs said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the couple have lived through three hurricanes in the past
three years, and Sammee Dabbs isn't so sure living near the Gulf of
Mexico is all that the color brochures say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets old,'' she said, after wading through waist-deep water
to reach her home, which stands on pilings about one mile from the
beach. ``I think if we could put a for-sale sign in the front yard
right now we would, but it would just float away.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the eye of Hurricane Georges roared ashore nearly 100
miles to the west in Mississippi, the sprawling storm still
battered the Alabama and Florida Panhandle coasts with nearly 24
hours of hurricane force winds.
</P>
<P>
   Those winds kicked up mountainous breakers that tore into sea
walls, protective sand dunes, walk-overs and beach-front
structures.
</P>
<P>
   In Pensacola Beach, damage was serious but not catastrophic,
with several waterfront condominiums undermined and a few roofs
torn off homes.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said Hurricane Opal in 1995 was much worse, hitting
hundreds of homes instead of dozens, as appeared to be the case
with Georges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say our damage is half what it was with Opal,'' said Roger
Garnjobst, manager of the 36-unit Portside Villas on Fort Pickens
Road. ''We've got a couple of garage doors washed out and a few
leaks, but no roofs missing. It'll take a few weeks to scrape the
sand out of the garages, but that's not too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   A mile away at the Seahorse Condominiums, Nadine Hudson survived
Georges with only a little water blown in around her sliding glass
doors. Opal had taken out the entire bottom floor of her two-story
townhome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opal was a total devastation zone and this was nothing
compared to that,'' she said. ''I'm so happy this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Two units down, M.J. Menge, a Pensacola attorney who owns a unit
but lives on the mainland, wasn't so lucky. Georges took out his
bottom floor, caved in one wall and left his cement slab cracked in
half, with waves crashing underneath where all the sand was washed
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This storm hit at Biloxi but did this much damage here,'' he
said. ``I think it wreaked more havoc over a larger area than
Opal.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty miles to the west in Gulf Shores, the damage appeared much
more severe than in Pensacola Beach. National Guard units patrolled
the beachfront area, and police were stopping all cars at a
check-point and allowing only residents to go through.
</P>
<P>
   Water from the bayou that lies inland from the beach area was
flooding into several residential streets and lapping over Ala. 59
in places.
</P>
<P>
   On the beach, all the waterfront properties appeared to take
heavy damage to their parking lots and ground-level structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really it's not that bad because none of my units are damaged
inside,'' said Pam Sharp, manager of the 48-unit Regatta
Condominiums. ''But you can see the parking lot is undermined and
that will have to be rebuilt.''
</P>
<P>
   The building suffered minor damage during Hurricane Opal, Sharp
said, and she had that repaired within 10 days. Rebuilding the
parking lot will likely take several months, she predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have it done in time for the Shrimp Festival, but
I don't think that's possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Shores winds up its annual summer season each year with a
big Shrimp Festival, featuring live music, food and other
attractions. The event is always held the second weekend in
October, but it was unclear whether the clean-up would be far
enough along to allow this year's event.
</P>
<P>
   As bad as Georges was, many residents said it didn't compare to
Frederic, which devastated Gulf Shores in 1979, washing away
buildings and leaving a rebuilding job that took months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a big clean-up, but it's nowhere near as bad as
Frederic,'' Sharp said. Georges' biggest impact appeared to be on
the beach itself, with the terrible pounding by hour after hour of
giant surf eating away the sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
   Waves on Tuesday were lapping at seawalls, and in places had
undermined the foundations of buildings. A small beach may
re-appear after the stormy surf kicked up by Georges finally
abates, but many residents said it won't be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Opal three years ago and Hurricane Danny last year and
now this,'' Gandy said. ''I was driving down here hoping the damage
would just be moderate and cosmetic, but it's worse than I thought.

WAKEFIELD OUT TO PIRATE WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The last time Tim Wakefield took the mound in a
postseason game, he was unable to prevent the Red Sox from being
eliminated by the Cleveland Indians in a 1995 three-game Division
Series sweep. Wakefield gave up seven runs in 5 1/3 innings on a
murky night in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But there are brighter postseason memories that Wakefield can
draw upon as well. In 1992, when he was just two months removed
from the minor leagues, Wakefield twice beat the mighty Atlanta
Braves for Pittsburgh, nearly enabling the Pirates to beat the
defending champions in the National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   `In '92, I was a rookie with two months' experience and I tried
to treat it as another game, not get caught up in the media
hoopla,'' said the Red Sox knuckleballer, who will start Game 2
against the Indians this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that experience will help me overcome the little
anxiety I'm going to feel (Wednesday). It was a wonderful feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I like this team better than the team we had in '95. The
pitching staff is a lot deeper, the offense is a lot better, and
the defense is definitely a lot better. I really like our
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield said he had ``no input'' in manager Jimy Williams's
decision to start rookie catcher Jason Varitek today instead of
Scott Hatteberg. ``I'm very comfortable with both catchers,'' he
said. ``That was a decision they made. Jason's done a great job
with me. So has Hatteberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg was hitless in six at-bats against Indians starter Doc
Gooden this season. Varitek has never faced him.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek has caught 17 of Wakefield's starts, Hatteberg 16, and
both catchers have been behind the plate for 108 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield's ERA with Hatteberg is 5.00, and the catcher has
thrown out 3 of 15 runners attempting to steal. Varitek threw out 5
of 17 would-be base stealers.

 &HT;    Twisters rip through Georgia
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The storm formerly known as Georges is not dying
quietly, as Richard Lynch found out Tuesday when a tornado spun off
in South Georgia nearly sucked him out of his pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, 38, was driving east on Ga. 37 toward Camilla in Mitchell
County when large tree limbs began hitting his truck.
</P>
<P>
   After he saw the wind push another pickup down a 6-foot
embankment, Lynch drove into the ditch, hoping to get under the
twister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lay across the front seat and locked my legs on the back
side of the steering wheel and held onto the door,'' he said. ``The
wind was trying to pick the truck up. It sucked out the windshield
and even took my windshield wipers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchell County tornado was one of a series of small but
violent twisters reported in southwest and central Georgia, spawned
by the remains of Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   A tornado watch posted in 54 counties in southwest and central
Georgia remained in effect at least until 8 p.m. Tuesday, along
with a flash flood watch.
</P>
<P>
   Georges, now a tropical depression, could depress baseball fans
eager to see the Braves take on the Chicago Cubs and home-run
hurricane Sammy Sosa this afternoon and Thursday night. The
National Weather Service predicts a 60 percent chance of rain
today, tapering to about 40 percent by the 4:15 game time.
</P>
<P>
   In areas of the state hit by damaging floods in recent years,
low river levels may help spare them from another round of
storm-driven disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But if the rain keeps up, Georgia's $400 million peanut crop,
now nearing peak harvest, could be severely damaged, said John
Baldwin, peanut specialist with the University of Georgia's
agricultural extension station in Tifton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a good feeling right now,'' Baldwin said.
``Harvest is at a standstill, and if we have heavy, sustained
rains, we could lose the bulk of the crop. The worst thing that can
happen is bad weather at harvest time.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia cotton growers, with 1.3 million acres nearing harvest,
feared rain would damage the $600 million to $700 million crop.

 &HT;    Georgia average in using computers for eduational uses
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia, like most other states, has been investing
heavily in computer technology and training in the public schools,
but has not always focused that investment in the best ways to
improve student learning, according to an in-depth national study
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   By most of the measures used by the newspaper, Education Week,
for the report, ``Technology Counts '98,'' Georgia is at about the
national average or better than average in putting computers to use
in classrooms. But Georgia and the nation as a whole must now face
questions of what it is trying to accomplish with this expensive
enthusiasm and whether those goals are being met.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to get a critical mass of computers,'' said
Cheryl Lemke, director of the Milken Exchange on Education
Technology, which funded the study. ``The real question is, `How is
it going to be used?'''
</P>
<P>
   On that question, the study found the best use of technology for
raising student achievement allows students to interact dynamically
with information and each other, rather than drill-and-practice.
For example, a dynamic approach for fourth-graders would be math
games and other learning games. In eighth grade, examples were
simulations.
</P>
<P>
   By those measures, Georgia was somewhat below the national
average. Among the state's fourth-graders, 42 percent had teachers
who reported using computers for math games and learning games,
compared with a national average of 54 percent. Among the state's
eighth-graders, 19 percent had teachers who reported using
computers mainly for simulations and applications, compared with a
national average of 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The report's analysis also connects the type of computer
instruction used with student achievement. Georgia's fourth-graders
and eighth-graders both scored below the national average in math,
according to the 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress,
a scientifically respected measure of student achievement. Low
scores reflect the lower use of dynamic teaching methods, the
report says.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's 13 technology instruction centers train teachers in
techniques that put students more in charge of their own learning
rather than having them sit through traditional lectures. This
approach, taught over seven days, is ``all about changing the way
you teach to a more student-centered approach,'' said Michael
Murray, director of the training center at Kennesaw State
University.
</P>
<P>
   After training about 400 teachers in the pilot phase, the
program was launched last October and has trained about 2 or 3
percent of the state's teachers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Education Week report, Georgia is following
seven of nine recommendations put forward for state policy-makers,
including technology requirements for accreditation of education
colleges and technology standards in its curriculum. Among the two
recommendations not followed fully, the state doesn't mandate
existing school buildings undergo changes to accommodate technology
and does not address inequities between rich and poor districts,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Wenglinksy, the report's research scientist, said
nationwide, suburban districts are much more likely to have more
technology resources, and Georgia shows the same tendency. In
Forsyth County, for example, every classroom has a telephone with
voice mail, a TV, a VCR and a teacher who gets at least 10 hours of
technology training every year.
</P>
<P>
   At South Forsyth High, funds were raised privately to help stock
three multimedia classrooms. ``I get almost whatever I ask for,''
said Principal Brenda Colby of her district's commitment to
technology.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, 250 teachers are on the waiting list for 10 hours of
computer training and a computer at Tech Corps Georgia, a private
nonprofit agency, said Tip Kilby, the director. Kilby, whose agency
is supported by NationsBank, Home Depot and other coorporations,
said Atlanta teachers too often lack useful classroom computers to
put into practice the training the district provides away from the
classroom. The agency sends each teacher away with a computer.

   FED LOWERS INTEREST RATES TO EASE EFFECTS OF TURMOIL
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a
percentage point in an attempt to keep the financial turmoil
afflicting much of the world from derailing growth at home. The
Fed's reduction of the main short-term rate it controls, to 5.25
percent from 5.5 percent, also signaled the central bank's
deepening concern about the economy's prospects. It was the first
time the Fed has cut rates since January 1996, and the first change
in rates since March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Lower borrowing rates on many consumer loans are expected as a
result of the rate reduction. Economists said mortgage rates for
home purchases and refinancings should remain below 7 percent
through 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken by global economic and political turmoil, Americans'
confidence in the U.S. economy fell in September for a third
consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
   MIXED MARKET RESPONSE TO RATE CUT
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street was not impressed with the Fed's rate reduction, and
the major market indexes were narrowly mixed at the end of an
active session. The Dow Jones industrial average fell almost 100
points after the reduction was announced but rebounded somewhat to
close down 28.32 points at 8,080.52. Investors in the bond market
had a somewhat more positive reaction and drove up prices, pushing
the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down to 5.09 percent,
another 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
   PRETRIAL MICROSOFT SKIRMISHING
</P>
<P>
   The judge presiding over Microsoft's antitrust case ordered
Oracle to surrender to the software company documents concerning
agreements Oracle has with Apple, IBM and other companies. The
order marked a victory for Microsoft in pretrial maneuverings. But
Microsoft is encountering trouble in efforts to subpoena materials
from Harvard and MIT used for a book about Netscape, Microsoft's
rival in Internet browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   CENDANT REPORTS BIG LOSS
</P>
<P>
   Cendant, a marketer and franchiser that plunged in share value
after it disclosed accounting irregularities, said it lost $217.2
million last year, instead of earning $55.5 million as reported
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA RESTRICTS CURRENCY DEALINGS
</P>
<P>
   China has imposed tough restrictions on foreign-exchange
transactions, the latest sign of backtracking on a range of finance
and trade issues that seem to reflect a slowdown in the nation's
efforts to shift from a planned to a market economy. Wu Xiaoling,
director general of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange,
justified the restrictions by saying untold billions of dollars had
been improperly transferred overseas this year.
</P>
<P>
   AMR SELLING SOME BUSINESSES
</P>
<P>
   AMR, parent of American Airlines, said it would sell a corporate
jet services business and two other units as part of a plan to
focus on core operations. The businesses, which make up AMR's
Global Services division, employ 13,600 people and generate about
$450 million in annual revenues for the company.
</P>
<P>
   REORGANIZATION AT BELL ATLANTIC
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, the largest United States local phone company,
said it would create a new office of the chairman and restructure
into six business units, each with its own president, to adjust for
rapid changes in the communications marketplace. The company
operates 41 million telephone lines and has more than 7 million
wireless customers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   BROADWAY PRODUCER FIGHTS SUIT
</P>
<P>
   Livent, the Broadway theater producer, is arguing in a Canadian
court that a lawsuit filed by its founder threatens to prolong the
pain of the company's shareholders, who have been unable to trade
their shares since early August because of an accounting
investigation.

MARKET PLACE: RESPONSE TO THE FED'S RATE CUT PROVES SOUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also FED, FED-CONSUMERS, MARKET) 
(lb) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board cut interest rates Tuesday. Almost
nobody cheered.
</P>
<P>
   To stock investors, the rate cut _ of a quarter-point in a key
short-term rate _ was too timid. They pushed the Dow Jones
industrial average down 28.32 points.
</P>
<P>
   To bond traders, the cut signaled that they, more than the Fed,
remained in charge of interest-rate policy. And that means
continued high Treasury prices and more flatness in the yield
curve, in which long-term rates are as low as or lower than
short-term rates.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the rate cut by the Fed was considered far better
than no action at all. And further cuts may come later this year.
But bond traders who thought a one-quarter point decline might
finally brake the runaway-train Treasury market were disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to
another new low, 5.09 percent. The 10-year note closed at a yield
of 4.58 percent, well below the new federal funds rate, which is
how much banks charge each other for overnight borrowing, and just
off its lows last Friday of 4.56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This is bad news for the traders and speculators that have sold
Treasuries short in recent months in the belief that yields on the
30-year would never approach 5 percent. These include the trading
desks at major brokerage firms and the large hedge funds like
Long-Term Capital Management, the giant fund that almost failed
last week and is now being run by its creditors. For these
unfortunates, the Federal Reserve's rate reduction provides no
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the historic move down in Treasury yields in recent
months is more about speculation in that market than it is about
the policy of the Federal Reserve Board. What began this summer as
a concerted investor flight from risky securities to the safest,
most liquid market in the world is suffering from what feels like a
short squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Not an orchestrated short squeeze like the one traders put on at
Salomon Brothers in 1991 when they tried to corner the market.
Today's squeeze, in which investors who have sold Treasury
securities they do not own and are therefore hurt whenever the
prices of those issues rise, has been created by professional
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these speculators had bought fixed-income securities
that carried higher yields than Treasuries _ junk bonds,
convertible bonds, mortgage-backed securities _ and hedged those
positions by selling short Treasuries with similar maturities and
lower yields.
</P>
<P>
   Such a trade produced terrific profits for traders and money
managers for the last five years or so. Typically, the yields on
the instruments move in tandem, but this summer they diverged,
leading to losses in both positions. Now these investors are
scrambling to cover their disastrous gambles. And in so doing, they
are pushing Treasury prices even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Combine this with a dearth of new Treasury issues _ the next
government refunding isn't until November _ and it looks as if
Treasury prices will continue to trade at extraordinarily high
levels relative to the Fed funds rate.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp declines in Treasury yields reinforce that the bond
market, not the Federal Reserve, is driving interest-rate policy.
Whereas in the 30 years leading up to 1990, Fed policy led the bond
market in raising or pushing down rates, during this decade the
bond market has been first to the punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the Fed had done nothing since the Asian crisis
first emerged, the bond market has been easing long-term yields
since last fall,'' said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at
Norwest Investment Management Inc. in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   A bond market that eases before the Fed produces a different,
more subtle effect from a Fed ease, according to Paulsen. When the
bond market lowers rates, for example, it has good effects on
mortgage rates, which help consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But its effects on banks' profits are more deleterious. With
short-term rates higher than long-term rates, as is the case now,
banks cannot make as much money on their loans as they could if the
Fed funds rate were below longer-term rates. That's why bank shares
weakened Tuesday, even after the rate cut. Citicorp was down 3
percent to $97.75, NationsBank Corp. lost 2.6 percent and
BankAmerica fell 2 percent to $62.25.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sometimes subtlety is not enough. When real trouble is brewing,
as has been the case since the summer of 1997 in Asia, bond traders
acting ahead of the Fed can mask some of the peril. This can, in
turn, encourage continued passivity from the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bond market acted like it did in the 1970s and 1980s,
there would be no movement until the Fed eased, and the full weight
of the crisis would be evident,'' said Paulsen. ``Now it's masked
and allows for a policy mistake.'' That mistake? Too little a move
by the Fed and too late.
</P>
<P>
   When the Fed cuts rates ahead of the bond market, as was typical
in past decades, both borrowers and lenders get a big break. This
stimulates the economy much more than if only one of the two groups
benefits. Many economists argue that the double whammy is needed
now, given the severity of the crisis roiling economies around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   But abrupt changes in monetary policy by the Fed have also led
to the four-year booms and busts that have characterized the U.S.
economy in the postwar years. Letting the bond market adjust policy
incrementally has resulted in greater economic stability and
smoother cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that the bond market's control over
interest rates will last as long as Greenspan does as chairman of
the Fed. One reason is his unceasing fear of inflation, which has
kept him from lowering rates until now.
</P>
<P>
   And having presided over the longest period of economic
prosperity in postwar history, Greenspan has come to appreciate the
stabilizing effects of a more passive approach to policy. The only
question is whether today's perilous circumstances require more
from the Fed than it is willing to give.

RAMPANT MENTAL HEALTH CARE FRAUD IN MEDICARE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Texas, Ala., La., Tenn., Ark., Ga., S.C., Miss.)   By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal officials said Tuesday that they were
expelling 80 mental health centers from Medicare after finding that
the program to provide psychiatric services to the elderly was
riddled with fraud.
</P>
<P>
   June Gibbs Brown, inspector general of the Department of Health
and Human Services, said that the cost of such care soared to $349
million in 1997, from $60 million in 1993, and that she found that
91 percent of the payments last year were for ``unallowable and
highly questionable services.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she said, Medicare payments to community mental health
centers averaged $10,352 a patient last year, up from $1,642 in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the centers are profit-making entities that have found a
lucrative niche in the program, Medicare officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, said,
``The Health Care Financing Administration and the inspector
general have found extensive evidence of providers who are not
qualified, patients who are ineligible, and services billed to
Medicare that are not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The department said it was immediately expelling 20 community
health centers in Florida, Texas and Louisiana. Sixty more centers
in those and other states will be expelled in the next few months,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The 80 centers account for 7 percent of the 1,150 mental health
centers that participate in Medicare. Many were billing Medicare
for ``services that weren't covered, weren't provided or weren't
needed,'' Shalala said. In addition, she said, many centers failed
to provide even the basic services they had promised.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's action comes six days before a congressional hearing
at which the inspector general was to disclose her findings.
</P>
<P>
   In a report on her investigation, Ms. Brown, the inspector
general, says: ``Medicare was paying for therapy sessions that
involved only recreational and diversionary activities such as
drawing, arts and crafts, watching television, and playing bingo
and other games. In a program designed to pay for intensive
outpatient psychiatric services provided to acutely ill individuals
in order to prevent their hospitalization, Medicare was paying for
services to beneficiaries who had no history of mental illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the Medicare agency,
said she suspected that some doctors were getting kickbacks for
sending patients to community mental health centers. She said the
government would intensify its scrutiny of hospitals that provide
outpatient mental health services to see if they too were abusing
the program.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeParle said that nine states accounted for 85 percent of
all Medicare spending on community mental health centers. The
states are Florida, Texas, Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee, Georgia,
Mississippi, Arkansas and South Carolina. ``Health care
entrepreneurs seem to be alive and well in the South,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have relatively small
numbers of community mental health centers in Medicare (13, 39 and
7, respectively). So far officials have found no particular
problems in those states.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, who is chairman of the Commerce
subcommittee on investigations, which will hold the hearing on
Monday, said, ``It's inexcusable to have such rapid growth in
costs, and doubly inexcusable to have such a high rate of waste and
fraud.'' In an interview, he said Congress would consider
tightening Medicare standards for mental health centers.
</P>
<P>
   Pope Simmons, vice president of the National Council for
Community Behavioral Health Care, which represents 750 mental
health centers, said he supported the federal crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Community mental health centers have been allowed to bill
Medicare for intensive outpatient services since 1990, but there's
a loophole in the law,'' Simmons said. ``All these companies had to
do was to fill out a form attesting that they were community mental
health centers. In states like Florida and Texas, this allowed a
lot of storefront operations to bill Medicare without providing
appropriate services.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said, ``The self-attestation process permitted
unscrupulous providers to participate in Medicare.'' Moreover, she
said, feer than one-third of the states set licensing requirements
for community mental health centers.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Covall, executive director of the National Association of
Psychiatric Health Systems, said the federal government should set
national standards and require state licensing of community mental
health centers, as it does for other health care providers in
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they would examine new applicants more
closely. So far this year they have rejected more than 100
applications from mental health centers that do not provide the
required services.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeParle said psychiatrists had helped set up centers after
finding that this was ``a good business to be getting into all of a
sudden.''

RED SOX ROUT INDIANS, 11-3, AND EXORCISE A FEW DEMONS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resending to correct byline, Chris sted Ed Broussard)   By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The talk was of curses and ghosts and failures.
Names like Babe Ruth and Bill Buckner were mentioned. All the
Boston Red Sox heard about was doom as they prepared for their
American League division series with the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday at Jacobs Field, the Red Sox averted history as well
as they averted the badgering about their prior postseason
problems. Slamming three Indians pitchers out of their home ball
park, Boston defeated Cleveland 11-3 in Game 1 to take control of
this best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the robust swing of Mo Vaughn, who used his bat to
exorcise personal as well as franchise demons, the Red Sox won
their first postseason game since beating the Mets in Game 5 of the
World Series on Oct. 23, 1986. After losing the final two games of
that series _ Game 6 largely because of Buckner's infamous error at
first base _ Boston was swept in three consecutive series, a string
of 13 games that kept prattle about the Curse of the Bambino alive.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, weary of the media's constant history lessons, did his
part to end them as quickly as possible, smashing a Jaret Wright
fastball an estimated 376 feet into the left-field bleachers to
drive in Darren Lewis and John Valentin in the top of the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite-field home run came on a full count, put the Red
Sox up 3-0 and ended Vaughn's 0-for-14 playoff slump, one that
occurred while Boston was being swept in three games by Cleveland
in 1995. Despite turning stone cold that October, Vaughn won the
American League's Most Valuable Player award. A strong MVP
candidate again this year, there will be no postseason crumble to
sully his achievement should he win it for a second time.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the home run that allowed Boston pitcher Pedro
Martinez to take the mound with a three-run cushion in his first
career playoff game, Vaughn smacked a two-run homer in the sixth
and a two-run double in the eighth to equal Edgar Martinez's major
league single-game playoff record of seven RBI, set in 1995 against
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted an opportunity to get here again,'' said Vaughn,
who called himself mentally unprepared for the 1995 playoffs. ``I
knew I was going to have a better approach to the situation. I'm a
bit older now and I'm more experienced. We had gone 13 games
without a playoff win and we handled that and for me to get off
that 0-for-14 is definitely nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Vaughn's mammoth performance made him the star, the Red
Sox, who will meet the Indians in Game 2 Wednesday afternoon,
rolled because of a team effort. Boston hitters ripped Wright, last
year's rookie sensation who went 3-0 in the postseason, for seven
hits and six earned runs in 4 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   While Wright regrouped after Vaughn's blast to strike out six
batters, Nomar Garciaparra dealt him the death blow in the fifth.
Immediately after Wright struck out Vaughn with two men on base,
the power-hitting shortstop belted one over the left-field wall to
put the Red Sox up 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two bad pitches and six runs, first inning and fifth,''
Indians manager Mike Hargrove said of Wright. ``He just was really
inconsistent and got the ball up.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything but inconsistent, Wright's counterpart, Martinez,
dominated Cleveland's batters until tiring in the sixth. Deftly
mixing curve balls and changeups with his 95 mile-per-hour
fastball, he recorded seven of his eight strikeouts and allowed
just one of his six hits in the first five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Lofton homered after a Sandy Alomar double in the sixth,
and then Jim Thome hit a solo shot in the seventh, but with
Boston's hitters pouncing on relievers Doug Jones and Steve Reed,
it was not enough. Martinez, who dominated Cleveland in the regular
season, exited after seven with his third victory in four starts
this year against the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time around the order, he threw predominantly
fastballs and an occasional changeup,'' Hargrove said. ``The second
time around, he threw a lot of changeups and still threw his
fastball. The third time around he mixed in his breaking ball. His
velocity was good.''
</P>
<P>
   There won't be much velocity on the ball Wednesday when the
Indians face knuckleballer Tim Wakefield (17-8, 4.58 ERA). With his
65 mile-per-hour pitches, Wakefield will give Cleveland a totally
different look, one that earned him two wins and a loss in four
starts against the Indians this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A knuckleball is the toughest pitch that a hitter will ever
have to hit,'' Hargrove said. ``I don't say that lightly. When a
knuckleball pitcher is on his game that day, the other team is in
for a long afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   While Boston started anew in destroying its playoff-game jinx,
Cleveland maintained a dubious postseason streak by losing its
seventh straight series opener. The Indians, however, have overcome
to win three of those series, including two which got them into the
World Series. So with Tuesday's victory, Boston, well aware that
this series is far from over, will have to settle for putting
another opponent to rest _ the playoff ghost of Red Sox past.

BERMAN, KNIGHT TALK A GOOD GAME ON ESPN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESPN's Chris Berman set up Tuesday's Division Series opener
between the Red Sox and Cleveland Indians as a game between ``two
cursed teams'' _ one cursed by Babe Ruth, the other by Rocky
Calavito _ trying to ``once and for all get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox got it right, as did Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Before his record-tying seven-RBI performance punctuated by two
home runs, Vaughn told ESPN that he didn't want to hear about
curses and the netherworld.
</P>
<P>
   The Curse of the Bambino, he said, ``ain't got nothing to do
with us.''
</P>
<P>
   So there.
</P>
<P>
   Berman was even more prescient during his pregame analysis.
``This isn't your father's Red Sox anymore,'' he said. ``This isn't
your grandfather's Red Sox anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyperbole or not, say this about Berman. He is a fan of the
game, and though he has the ability to talk for three hours
nonstop, Boomer tells the truth. He gets excited. He understands
and respects the history of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point _ his peppering of details throughout the
broadcast. Dennis Eckersely is one of his favorite pitchers. He
told the uninitiated that Eckersley had pitched for the Red Sox
before being traded to the Cubs for, of all people, Bill Buckner.
``The rest, as they say, is history,'' Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   OK. OK. Most in Massachusetts know about that infamous trade.
But for those outside state lines, the detail was interesting. All
right, so it wasn't a particularly difficult piece of trivia to
uncover.
</P>
<P>
   Berman was better calling the game.
</P>
<P>
   When Cleveland pitcher Jaret Wright threw apparent strikes that
were called balls, Berman refrained from blasting the umpire. ``He
has a better angle than me,'' Berman demurred.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't hesitate to criticize players. In the second
inning, Indians right fielder Manny Ramirez hit a 400-foot shot off
the center-field wall. Instead of sprinting around the bases,
Ramirez went into his home run trot, and by the time he hit full
stride, it was too late to get the double it should have been.
Berman called it the ``longest single'' in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   He also called it ``inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   The next thing you knew, Ramirez was doubled off first base
after a line shot to third baseman John Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ramirez had been on second base, that never would have
happened,'' Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Ray Knight was just as solid as Berman. He criticized
Wright throughout the game, emphasizing that the righthander must
develop a third pitch to go along with his fastball and curve.
``Everything is hard,'' Knight said. ``Even his changeup comes in
at 85 miles per hour. Wright needs to put something else in
hitters' minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight also decoded Indians signals by catcher Sandy Alomar. The
ESPN camera crew caught Alomar flashing Wright his index finger
three times near his thigh at the outside of the plate. ``It's a
sinker, down and away,'' Knight said. The next time, Alomar flashed
Wright one finger on his inside thigh. ``Fastball, inside,'' Knight
said. He was correct both times.
</P>
<P>
   Knight provided the extra insight former players must have to
inform viewers. When Alomar faced Pedro Martinez for the first
time, he fell behind in the count, 0-and-2.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's next pitch was a high fastball that struck out
Alomar. ``That is right out of the scouting report,'' Knight said.
``When Alomar is behind by two strikes, he tends to swing at
anything high.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight was particularly insightful on beanballs. In the fourth
inning, Darren Lewis got beaned on the left earflap. ``Those will
give you a buzz for a couple of minutes,'' Knight said. ``You are
woozy for a while, but it usually clears up pretty quickly. Now I
was hit once in the face. That takes about three months to clear
up.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN is blessed. Berman and Knight called an outstanding game,
and while they are not Ned Martin and Jim Woods in their prime,
they are the cable network's No. 2 announcing team.

OPRAH WINFREY CALLS OFF LEWINSKY INTERVIEW TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Negotiations over the rights to Monica Lewinsky's account of her
relationship with President Clinton took an unusual turn Tuesday
when Oprah Winfrey announced on her television show and in a press
release that she would not pursue an interview with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I no longer want the interview,'' the talk show host said in
her statement. ``I was told that I did have it and then the
conversation moved in a direction that I did not want to go. I do
not pay for interviews, no matter what the payment is called.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Winfrey, elaborating in an interview to be published next
Monday in TV Guide, said Ms. Lewinsky's representatives had
promised her the first interview, but then had phoned back to
demand the ``international rights'' to the tape, which they could
then sell.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Smith, Ms. Lewinsky's representative, said neither she nor
Ms. Lewinsky would comment on Ms. Winfrey's statements.
</P>
<P>
   The report that Ms. Winfrey had been considered a sure bet to
conduct the first television interview with Ms. Lewinsky was one of
the more believable ones generated by the Lewinsky rumor mill,
which has churned out some wildly inflated stories in the last few
weeks. Among them are rumors that Ms. Lewinsky has a $16 million
contract with a pay-per-view company to tell her story and that she
has a modeling deal with a Parisian fashion designer who has
occasionally used condoms as clothing decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Walters of ABC News has also been pursuing an interview
with Ms. Lewinsky, say people at ABC News who insisted on
anonymity. There has even been a rumor that Ms. Walters might do
the interview for the ABC entertainment division, which, unlike the
news division, might be permitted to pay Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But Eileen Murphy, the chief spokeswoman for ABC News, said
Tuesday, ``We will not pay Monica Lewinsky any money for an
interview, whether it was for a news interview or an entertainment
interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's representatives have tried to play one suitor
against another, one person who has negotiated with them said
Tuesday, adding, ``The greed has backfired. Her 15 minutes is
fading fast.''

IN COURT, OUSTED MALAYSIAN DENIES SEX AND GRAFT CHARGES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Visibly bruised and asserting that he
had been beaten by his jailers, Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister, Anwar Ibrahim, denied in court on Tuesday charges of
corruption and sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not guilty!'' he declared as each of the nine charges was read
out. He pointed to bruises above his left eye and on his neck and
rolled up his shirt sleeves to display more bruises, witnesses in
the courtroom said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Anwar's first public appearance since he was arrested
nine days ago in a political confrontation with his former mentor,
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 72, that convulsed the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of riot policemen surrounded the courthouse on Tuesday
and the streets were quiet after more than a week of demonstrations
in support of Anwar that resulted in hundreds of arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, 51, was dismissed from the government at the start of
this month in what Mahathir apparently intended as a quick and
definitive political coup against a too-ambitious underling.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the dismissal has become the country's most severe
political crisis in decades and the broadest public challenge to
Mahathir's 17-year tenure as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   In rallies at Anwar's home, outside the courthouse, in public
parks and in mosques, support seems only to have grown for the man
who had been expected to become Malaysia's next leader.
</P>
<P>
   After being held incommunicado since his arrest, Anwar was
allowed to speak out in court on Tuesday, and he took full
advantage of his public platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was blindfolded and handcuffed,'' he told the court. ``I was
boxed very hard on my lower jaw and left eye. I was also boxed on
the right of my head and they hit me on the left side of my neck
very hard. I was then slapped very hard left and right until blood
came out from my nose and my lips cracked. Because of this, I could
not see and walk properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, who is an ophthalmologist,
was allowed to talk to him in the courtroom, and she said she was
``shocked and stunned that my husband was a victim of police
brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an orbital hematoma on the left eye,'' she said,
``and a small depression on the left forehead, about half an inch.
His vision was slightly impaired and he complained about his
balance being affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Although only a small number of people could fit into the
courtroom, and although the local press has been reporting only the
government's version of events, an underground network has kept the
capital abuzz with reports and rumors about Anwar.
</P>
<P>
   Lim Kit Siang, leader of Malaysia's main opposition party, the
Democratic Action Party, told reporters on Tuesday: ``All
Malaysians are asking one common question: How could they be safe
when the former deputy prime minister could be so brutally beaten
up when in police custody?''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the charges against Anwar revolve around the
government's contention that he engaged in illegal homosexual
relations with four men.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Malaysia, we reject such extreme acts,'' Mahathir said on
Friday. ``We accept men as men and women as women.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, he said he had interviewed the men and women who said
they had had illicit sex with Anwar. He said it was this, and not
differences over policy, that caused him to dismiss his deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Parliament on Tuesday, Mahathir said that because of
those charges, Anwar had been in a hurry to replace him as prime
minister. ``Anwar's wish was for me to step down so that he would
get away without being tried,'' the prime minister asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar has vigorously denied the accusations and called them an
attempt to smear him and end his political career. Many Malaysians,
interviewed around the city, including some who support Mahathir,
have also expressed skepticism about the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar was charged on Tuesday with four counts of ``unnatural''
sex acts, which could result in a prison term of up to 20 years. He
was also charged with five counts of corruption, which could bring
a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five charges of corruption involve allegations that
Anwar had tried to have witnesses deny the sexual charges. The
fifth corruption charge involved an allegation that he had tried to
influence an investigation into corruption by an aide. The charges
of sexual misconduct are apparently based in part on the
confessions of two of Anwar's close associates, who said they had
allowed him to sodomize them. Both men were sentenced to six months
in prison the day before Anwar was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar said that their confessions had been extracted by physical
and psychological torture. And on Tuesday, Reuters reported that
the two men were now retracting their confessions and appealing
their convictions.

 &HT;    Post-Wood wasn't good for Smoltz
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Smoltz, accordion prodigy, scratch golfer,
card-game braggart and one of the more stubborn beings walking this
planet, had simply had it. Turner Field had filled that May 23
evening to see Smoltz go after Chicago man-child Kerry Wood, and
just two innings into it, the kid was humming and Smoltz had spit
the bit _ two runs, six hits, including an RBI single to Wood.
</P>
<P>
   That, plus Smoltz's right elbow, already as delicate as a
Christmas ornament, was throbbing. In an act of mercy, Bobby Cox
pulled him, Smoltz walking off the field, down the dugout stairs,
and who knew where after that?
</P>
<P>
   ``They all came to see this new phenom and I wanted to be up to
the task,'' Smoltz said. ``I didn't think I was going to be up to
the task, and it showed really quickly. I knew walking off the
field that I was going to have to back off for a while, go back on
the DL, take some time off, and I didn't know about the immediate
future.''
</P>
<P>
   What future? Two elbow surgeries; 2,000 innings-plus already on
the odometer; trade rumors whispered just last winter, before
doctors gouged more excess calcium out of his elbow. And now a
second shutdown on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at a low. The frustration level was beyond _ I was ready
to quit. I'd never in my life thought about retiring until this
year, about when it was going to be. And I can't lie about it. I
was thinking about finishing up (the contract), and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   The same Cubs are at The Ted tonight, where they will find a
radically altered Smoltz in Game 1 of National League Division
Series. Since that May night, he has gone 13-2 with a 2.49 ERA,
finishing the year with more strikeouts (132) than hits allowed
(99) in those final 123 innings. He has taken cortisone injections
to the elbow and his back, has had his elbow drained three times
and, through the final month, decided to cancel his next start six
times, only to reverse himself.
</P>
<P>
   At age 31, he became a better pitcher, throwing an effective
change-up for the first time in his career, finishing with a
markedly better strikeout ratio (9.3 per nine innings) than over
the previous nine major-league seasons (7.7). He finished the year
ranked in the top six in five NL pitching lists (including No. 1 in
winning percentage at 17-3. With one more victory tonight, he
replaces Whitey Ford and Dave Stewart for more postseason wins in
history (11).
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have made more wins if he could have made more starts
(than 26),'' catcher Javy Lopez said. ``With the surgery and
eveything, there's no doubt he would have had another Cy Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I always felt he was a heck of a lot more of a pitcher
than people gave him credit for,'' said Tom Glavine, a partner of
Smoltz in Atlanta's rotation since 1988. ``Everyone just assumed he
was just a thrower and, 'Here's my great stuff. I'm going to get
you out.' But I think he proved to people this year he's more of a
pitcher than they gave him credit for.''
</P>
<P>
   Only from necessity. Smoltz had to reform himself. First, he
shelved his split-fingered fastball, for the extra stress he puts
on the arm, and began using it again only in his last start. He
began reworking his breaking pitches, sometimes without a lot of
public notice. Lopez sat down next to him during an August start
and asked what the new pitch was that Smoltz had just thrown him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my 'slow' curve,'' Smoltz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for tell me that,'' Lopez replied.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, his strikeout frequency stayed high, he walked
just 25 men in his last 19 starts, and he kept his slider out of
the dirt. All of that meant better efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might have helped his location,'' Greg Maddux said. ``I
know when you're arm is bothering you, you want to make the fewest
pitches possible. You don't throw the waste pitch, when you're
hoping he'll swing or chase. You're not throwing set-up pitches.
You're tying to get him out with every pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The change-up changed that too. Smoltz had never veered from the
power game the 95 mph fastball, a hard splider, a harder split and
then a big curve coming as close he would get to off-speed. He
experimented with the change-up grips used by the rest of the staff
until finding his own, finally found the right arm-speed, and, even
then after the All-Star break, he wasn't so sure until perhaps this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two outings in particular,'' shortstop Walt Weiss
said, ``I saw him being more effective with it. Guys were swinging
through it a lot, out in front of it, because he's such a power
pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I threw was hard, hard, hard,'' Smoltz said. ``When
I'm on, it looks good. When you're not, it's tough. So I've been
able to slow the batter down now. It increases my control. It
increases my chances to throw less pitches and my efficiency is
better.''
</P>
<P>
   So, why had not Smoltz, who underwent his first elbow
arthroscopy in 1994, worked in this direction before this summer,
when he was driven to thoughts of retirement? Stubborness is part
of the answer. Smoltz confesses to throwing too hard at times this
year, just because on certain days he could.
</P>
<P>
   But then, that has been Smoltz's way throughout his career,
feeling he had to answer to becoming Glavine or Maddux, when he had
enough trouble becoming Smoltz. The 1996 Cy Young award ended most
of that debate, but not all.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he learned anything about his friend this year, Glavine
replied, ``I don't know that I did, to be honest with you. I knew
it was a battle for him to get out and pitch, a battle to change
the way he pitched. I know he's pitched when he was hurt, and he
was tough in that regard. But I've always known those things about
him.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than 18 weeks since Smoltz left the field to
the Cubs in order to go sort out his career. That he found a better
way has made for his most gratifying time in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't wait for tomorrow,'' he said Tuesday. ``The whole
year dragged for me. I could enjoy the wins, with the uncertainty
of the next start. The best say to describe it is, if I could write
a book about it, no one would believe it.''

 &HT;    Astros-Padres notebook
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Rest assured Braves fans, Jim Leyritz still lingers in
the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   It was Leyritz, then a Yankee, who smacked a dramatic game-tying
homer off Mark Wohlers in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series. On
Tuesday, Leyritz keyed the San Diego Padres breakthrough against
Randy Johnson with a long bases-load sacrifice fly in the sixth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I thought it was gone,'' said Leyritz, who earlier
singled off the Astros starter. ``But I knew it was going to be a
big run.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz was a late fill-in for first-baseman Wally Joyner, a
graduate of Redan High in Stone Mountain. The left-handed-hitting
Joyner has been nursing a sore shoulder, but entered the game
defensively in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Neither enjoyed success against Johnson in earlier American
League stints, with Joyner hitting .115 (3-26) and Leyritz .108
(4-37). Leyritz also had the misfortune of being beaned by Johnson
in a 1995 game that led to a bench-clearing brawl with the Seattle
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz is with his fourth team since leaving the Yankees,
acquired by the Padres in June for the pennant drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a big deal here when they picked me up, saying it
was because of my post-season hitting,'' Leyritz said. ``I got a
couple big hits, but my numbers aren't that good overall.''
</P>
<P>
   Try telling that to Wohlers and now Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Misspoken words
</P>
<P>
   In the pregame hype, Astros centerfield Carl Everett said he
respected no opposing pitcher, including the Padres' Kevin Brown.
Everett painfully ate his words after Brown's two-hit, 16 strikeout
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit his spots,'' said Everett, hitless in four at-bats.
``The umpire called (strikes) in a certain place and he kept
hitting it _ down and away.''
</P>
<P>
   Family Affair
</P>
<P>
   Padres outfielder Greg Vaughn stroked a couple singles and a
laser-shot homer off Johnson. Nice day, right? Except that his
cousin, Mo Vaughn hit two home runs and picked up seven RBIs in the
Boston Red Sox's victory over the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to call and see what he had for breakfast,'' the
Padres' Vaughn cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Roll The Video, Please
</P>
<P>
   Asked to detail his sixth-inning escape from a second-and-third
base, two-out jam, Brown said: ``I'm not Greg Maddux. I don't
remember every pitch. . . . It's a situation where you know the
game's on the line and you're just trying to make one good pitch at
a time. Beyond that, I'd have to look at the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Injured List
</P>
<P>
   San Diego leftfielder Tony Gwynn aggravated an Achilles' injury
and left the game in the sixth inning, while second-baseman Quilvio
Veras was removed after being struck on the knee in the ninth.
Manager Bruce Bochy said both should be in the lineup Thursday for
Game 2.

KEY TO COWBOYS' SUCCESS AGAINST REDSKINS LIES DOWN ON THE CORNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ For years, one of the juicy subplots of a
Cowboys-Redskins game was the Pro Bowl-caliber battle between
Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin and Redskins cornerback Darrell
Green.
</P>
<P>
   It was the size and strength of the 6-foot-2, 207-pound Irvin
vs. the blazing speed and guile of the smallish Green (5-8, 184).
</P>
<P>
   But that was before the Redskins signed former Oilers star Cris
Dishman to their roster last year. Dishman teamed with Green to
form one of the NFL's top corner tandems, and both were selected to
the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Both also shared the responsibility of covering Irvin last
season. Although Dishman has struggled some this season, he and
Green are expected to alternate on Irvin when the Cowboys and
Redskins play Sunday at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``When those two are playing well, they are as good as there
is,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the prowess of the two, winning the outside battles
against Green and Dishman are keys to the Cowboys' success. The
Redskins are likely to stack the line of scrimmage to stop the run
and make quarterback Jason Garrett beat them with the pass, and
that means the Cowboys will get one-on-one coverage from the
corners.
</P>
<P>
   All the Cowboys receivers, Ernie Mills and Billy Davis included,
will be counted on to make some plays against Green and Dishman to
loosen up the Redskins' defense. Irvin is second in the league in
receptions and yardage with 26 catches for 356 yards. Davis has
caught 12 passes for 229 yards and Mills has 10 receptions for 147
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows who Michael is and will have a plan to try to
stop him,'' Cowboys receivers coach Dwain Painter said. ``That
should open the door for Billy and Ernie. They have had
opportunities to make plays. At times they have and at times they
haven't. The bottom line is we've got to make plays on the outside.
But that's the goal every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills, who has faced both Dishman and Green more than a few
times during his eight-year career, is looking forward to the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darrell can still run and a lot of people don't know
Dishman,'' Mills said. ``He is a great technique cornerback. It's
going to be a good battle. But I like playing against them. It's
always fun.''

MCI WILL CUT ITS WRITE-OFF ON ACQUISITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom Inc. plans to write off $3.1 billion of Worldcom's
$37 billion purchase price of MCI Communications as research and
development costs _ half of what the company estimated last month.
</P>
<P>
   The lower charge, which was disclosed in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, comes amid
increasingly sharp criticism of such write-offs and other corporate
accounting practices that the SEC finds abusive.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, for example, blocked for nearly two months the
release of America Online's earnings after the company sought to
write off $316 million related to research at two companies it
acquired. On Monday, after reaching an agreement with the
commission, America Online reported earnings that included a
sharply lower write-off of $70.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, MCI Worldcom, the merged company that took effect on
Sept. 14, acknowledged that its lower estimate came in part from
the commission's new scrutiny into companies taking large
write-offs for research and development to avoid a long-term drag
on assets.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is what is known as in-process research and
development, or research that has yet to be turned into a
marketable product. Many technology companies have argued that most
of the price they pay for acquisitions represents such continuing
research. Such accounting has long been a loophole for many savvy
merger and acquisition bankers.
</P>
<P>
   In an acquisition, companies estimate the value of the assets
they are buying. If the purchase price is higher than the value of
the assets, the remainder becomes part of good will.
</P>
<P>
   The acquiring company must then write off the value of these
assets included as good will over a period of three to 40 years.
The one exception is continuing research, which is written off
immediately. A higher charge for in-process research and
development could significantly reduce the good will amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SEC's new guidelines didn't come into effect until
September,'' Gary Brandt, vice president of investor relations at
MCI Worldcom, said Tuesday. ``They did come in and take a look, but
that doesn't impact the expectations of the overall numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom will take the $3.1 billion charge immediately,
according to the SEC filing. That will result in $26 billion being
recorded as good will, which will be amortized over 40 years. When
Worldcom, the United States' fourth-biggest long-distance company
and a large Internet backbone provider, acquired MCI, the
second-biggest long-distance company, it created a company with
revenue of more than $30 billion and operations in 65 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The filing was disclosed after the stock market closed. Earlier,
shares of MCI Worldcom rose 68.75 cents, to $50.5625, in Nasdaq
trading.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Analysts said they were not concerned about the accounting
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SEC has new guidelines for accounting in acquisitions;
Worldcom is just conforming to these guidelines,'' said Eric
Strumingher, a telecommunications analyst with Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact to MCI Worldcom's cash flow because of this change
in the one-time charge is zero.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the move could reduce earnings estimates for 1999 by
3 cents a share. ``Instead of amortizing $600 million in good will
from the deal on their income statement, they will now be
amortizing $650 million,'' he said.

PRIME TIME FOR BERNIE WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What do you think of Bernie Williams? Is the Yankee
center fielder underrated? Should he be included on the list of
great players who have worn pinstripes?
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Williams wrapped up his first American League batting
title, edging the Red Sox' Mo Vaughn, .339-.337. It capped a
balanced season augmented by 26 homers and 97 RBIs, the kind of
numbers that fit right into the Yankee attack. He is a switch
hitter who bats fourth for a club that won a league-record 114
games. Yet he still seems to be often overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to change that. Williams is on a prime-time
postseason stage, and depending on how long the Yankees last, he
could occupy it for more than three weeks. After that, he will be a
free agent and the Yankee front office will have to decide about
his future. Is he a franchise player? Maybe. Would you swap him
even up for Vaughn? Probably not. Is he deserving of top dollar?
That's the big question.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is just a good hitter,'' said Yankee bench coach Don
Zimmer, who in a career spanning more than 50 years has seen most
of the best. ``And he's fast. He brings a bunch of tools to the
table. What is special about him as a hitter is his power from the
righthand side. Most good Yankee clubs are predominantly
lefthanded.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams also is a versatile hitter. He batted .337 against
righthanders, .339 against lefties. Sixteen of his homers came
against lefties, as did 23 of his 30 doubles. An injury limited him
to 128 games, but he still managed to collect 169 hits and score
101 runs. Now it's a question of how much he'll cash in. He can
boost the numbers with a productive offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in life comes down to that one instant that you
have an opportunity to shine,'' said Williams. ``You're either
going to do it or not do it. You should be willing to risk the
downside and failing just because of the rush that you get for
doing good and being a hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have multiple personalities. I have a lot of fun doing what
I do. But I'm not oblivious to what's going on around me. I am, in
fact, very much aware. It's just my choice to take a step back so
that I can be in control. It works a lot better for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 30, figures to be in his prime if he stays healthy. He
has hit .300 the past four years, the duration of his current
contract. He has great expectations about the financial doors that
will swing open after this season. A $10 million salary is not out
of the question, he says. But are the Yankees listening? Come back
in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, when a player talks big dollars, it creates ripples
throughout the clubhouse as well as the front office. Not Williams.
When the media got wind of his contract negotiatiions and began to
debate the issue, he simply told them to cool it. See him in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what happens in my life right now,'' said Williams,
``nothing can take away what I have accomplished. It has become a
very special year. We have a chance to do some extraordinary
things, and that feels great. I would be a fool to let other things
interfere with the kind of special feeling we have on this team
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams says he has no interest in being called a franchise
player by the media or anybody else. He does not see life in terms
of absolutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more of a mind to let things happen,'' he said. ``I try to
react according to the situation. It's all about preparation. As
long as I prepare well and I make sure in my mind I did everything
I needed to to make myself ready, I'm focused. I stress my
mechanics and my physical condition. Those are the things I can
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked so hard to be in the situation that I am now. And I'm
taking advantage of it. I realize I'm not going to be playing my
whole life. My career is relatively short compared to other jobs.
I'm here to let it all out. I think I can be better. I don't let
other people define me. That's just not my nature.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the season, his future will be defined by other
people. The offer from the Yankees will be handsome. But the kind
of attention he attracts on the open market will depend a lot on
how he does in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can be better,'' he said. ``I'm hitting over.300
this season. Maybe I should hit more home runs. If I hit more home
runs, maybe I should think about stealing more bases. If I achieve
that, maybe I should work on having a better arm in the outfield.
There's so much in my game that I really want to do. It just
becomes a struggle and a desire to achieve perfection. Keep doing
the best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Would he return to the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it this way,'' he said. ``You cannot play this game
without having fun because there is so much failure. When the
season is over, I'll be one of those guys that takes his time, sits
back, and reflects on the things I have done. Where am I in my
career? What about my family? Where are we going? And one month
after that, I'll want to start playing baseball again.''

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC SLOW TO RECOVER FROM HURRICANE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN DE LA MAGUANA, Dominican Republic _ A week of bright
sunshine and clear skies has done wonders for the Dominican
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, the flood waters of Hurricane Georges had pulled
back into river beds in most of the country, and towns that had
become islands are now, seven days since the storm struck, just
towns again. Coffee and sugar cane fields are drying out and
streets that had become rivers are now dusty tracks.
</P>
<P>
   But the country is far from back to normal. Nelson Ferrera, a
gaunt, 37-year-old man who ekes out a living using a Honda
motorbike as a taxi, thought things had gotten as bad as they could
get when his home here, in a narrow valley 100 miles west of the
capital, Santo Domingo, was swept away in the floods. But since he
took shelter with several hundred other flood victims in rooms
under the bleachers of the municipal soccer stadium, he has been
learning to live day by day on a few handfuls of rice.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 75,000 people in this farm town of modest homes and
shops, are in the same boat with Ferrera. About 12,000 of the
people have taken shelter in schools, churches and the stadium and
some authorities estimate as many as twice that number are living
with friends and relatives. Many of them here and elsewhere in the
country say they have been unable to get adequate food and water.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same for many people whose homes are still intact,
too, because almost everything in this country but the work of
recovery has been stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are relief supplies not getting out quickly; normal
deliveries of food and other goods have been interrupted because so
many roads and bridges have been washed out and because so many
business people have been taking care of their families instead of
tending to their businesses. And many businesses were knocked out
of commission, too. Yet every day, the relief operation picks up a
bit of steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not going to be a famine,'' said Hugh Parmer, a Texas
lawyer who is in charge of humanitarian aid for the U.S. Agency for
International Development. ``That's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning Parmer, other American aid officials and two
reporters flew out of Santo Domingo on one of the half dozen U.S.
Army Black Hawk helicopters that have been sent to the Dominican
Republic to help in the emergency.
</P>
<P>
   From Santo Domingo, the aircraft skimmed west along the coast
and the dark green mountains that rise to the north, finally
working its way up the San Juan River Valley to San Juan de la
Maguana. From an altitude of 2,000 feet or so, towns like Los
Toros, Torbara Abajo, San Antonio and Los Negros seemed to be
sitting on big mud place mats.
</P>
<P>
   Every street looked like it had been painted beige. One
neighborhood here, known as Mesopotamia, lies at a fork in the San
Juan River. Many of the houses did fine in the hurricane. But by 2
a.m. the next day the San Juan was roaring. Tons of water crashed
down from the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how many people died here. Right after the storm
newspapers in Santo Domingo said hundreds had been lost, possibly
even more than 1,000. On Tuesday, one government official said 29
bodies had been counted. Another said 39 were confirmed dead. Many
people are still missing and the popular wisdom is that many of
them will never be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many were buried in the mud or carried away by the river,''
said Bartolome Garriga, director of Caritas, the Roman Catholic
relief agency, for the Diocese of San Juan here. On one street near
the river, Dario Moretta, a 43-year-old farmer, was up to his knees
in mud, digging out his living room. Outside his window, Chelina
Encarnacion Beltre was standing on a slab of mud that had already
baked hard. ``You see this,'' she said. ``This is where my house
used to be.''

MARINA OWNER HAD A `FEELING' GEORGES WOULD HIT AREA 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAUTIER, Miss. _ When Hurricane Georges was spawned two weeks
ago off the coast of Africa, Richard Pipkin, the owner of a marina
in this Gulf Coast community, had a premonition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called my wife and my foreman, and I told them, `That storm
has got our name on it,''' he said Tuesday. ``I don't know any
other way to say it. It was just a feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, Georges headed in his direction like it was on a
rail.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the storm screamed across the Caribbean, leaving
hundreds dead and billions of dollars in destruction, Pipkin and
his workers at the Mary Walker Marina were preparing for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   When it side-swiped the Florida Keys and headed on a determined
northwest track into the Gulf of Mexico, drawing a bead on New
Orleans, Pipkin refused to let his guard down, and he moved what
boats he could out of harm's way and urged owners to secure those
that would stay.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the pre-dawn Monday, Georges swung to the north,
sparing New Orleans, and slammed into the Gulf Coast just west of
Gautier.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday a somber Pipkin surveyed the wreckage of his marina,
the shredded metal roofs that covered the expensive toys of his
clients, the slips torn to pieces, the sunken boats, the vessel
sitting on his lawn that he had never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fourth hurricane this marina has gone through,''
he said. ``It went through Camille, through Frederick, through
Helena and now Georges, and I was right. Georges had our name on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pipkin was one of thousands of people along the Gulf Coast who
cautiously returned to their homes and businesses Tuesday to
examine what Georges did to their lives when it came ashore at
hurricane strength Monday and then sat over them for hours dumping
torrential rains.
</P>
<P>
   The storm quickly fell apart after hitting land and was
downgraded to a tropical storm and then a tropical depression by
Tuesday as it headed east, dropping even more rain. Up to 15 inches
was expected to fall on southeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Georges spared the United States the fury it
unleashed on the Caribbean islands, where it caused billions in
damage, killed at least 372 people, and severely damaged the
infrastructures and lives of nations and people that can least
afford it.
</P>
<P>
   But the damage was nevertheless extensive to areas of the
Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi coasts, and President
Clinton was to visit the affected region soon and take a look for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, briefed the president on recovery efforts in those four
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very concerned about this,'' Witt said at the White
House. ``He's very interested in going down and meeting with the
people in the communities.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gautier and the nearby communities of Pascagoula and Orange
Grove, which received the brunt of the storm, numerous powerlines
were toppled, trees had crushed houses, and rivers and creeks
continued to rise Tuesday from the rains.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gibson, a carpenter in Pascagoula, tried to dry out his
flooded house, still shaken from riding out the storm with his
11-year-old daughter and two dogs. About 1 a.m. on Sunday he
awakened to see water coming into the house and decided to
``evacuate'' upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lay up there thinking the roof wasn't going to hold on,
planning in my mind how I was going to escape if it came off,'' he
said. ``There was just this consistent wind that wouldn't quit. I
was in a state of shock, I tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson had thought far enough ahead that he had stacked his
furniture, but he didn't think he would get nearly three feet of
water in the front part of the house and more than four feet in the
back. He also didn't think the experience of sitting out a
hurricane in the dark would be that harrowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to do it over again, I wouldn't stay,'' he said. ``To
be totally honest with you, I thought it was going more toward New
Orleans. I just didn't think it would turn like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Orange Grove, Stephen Davis, 31, a machinist and owner
of four purebred Chihuahuas, returned home to his house in the
woods Monday morning and found his house had survived the hurricane
unscathed. But all that day, he watched in dismay as the
floodwaters rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``At about noon (Tuesday) we decided we better get out,'' he
said. He ferried his wife, their ``babies'' and their belongings
out through the rising waters by boat. ``It's not in my house yet,
but we heard there was another three feet of water expected and so
we decided to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the four states that were affected by Georges, hundreds of
thousands of people remained without power, and at the few gas
stations or supermarkets that had generators or which were lucky
enough to have had power restored, lines formed Tuesday as
residents returned and found life's basic necessities in short
supply.
</P>
<P>
   At the Mary Walker Marina, Pipkin wandered around puffing on a
Marlboro, talking to boat owners who were arriving to inspect the
damage. Most of the 160 boats suffered only minor damage, but some,
like the off-shore sport fishing boat Chris Davis had been
restoring for much of the last year, were lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I guess it's totaled,'' Davis, a lawyer from Gulfport,
said as looked at his boat through the murky waters. ``But I think
my insurance company will come through.''
</P>

REPORT ASSESSES INVESTMENT IMPACT ON UTILITY CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts ranks third behind New Hampshire and
Illinois on the cost impact per customer of electric utilities'
previous bad investments, according to a study of 11 states that
have deregulated their utility industries.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-page report was released Tuesday by the Massachusetts
Public Interest Research Group, a consumer-environmental
organization. It was written by the Safe Energy Communications
Council, a Washington, D.C., coalition of energy, environmental and
public interest media organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The study claims that utilities in the 11 states hold &UR;  &LR; $112
billion in bad investments _ mostly uncompetitive power plants,
including nuclear facilities, plus above-market power purchase
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; These bad investments are known as ``stranded costs.'' In a
controversial move, utilities want their customers _ not their
shareholders _ to pay for them as part of deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, where electric deregulation took effect Mar.
1, ratepayers are absorbing utilities' stranded costs.
</P>
<P>
   The report claims that Bay State utilities have $7.4 billion in
stranded costs, meaning that each residential ratepayer in effect
is paying $1,345 in stranded costs. In New Hampshire, which has $2
billion in stranded costs, the economic impact will amount to
$1,963 per residential customer, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   However, the report does not reflect pending or recently
completed sales of nearly $2.7 billion of electric generating
assets by Boston Edison Co., New England Electric and Commonwealth
Energy System, nor the expected sale next month of Boston Edison's
Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station in Plymouth. If those asset sales
were factored in, the cost impact would be lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allowing full stranded cost recovery financed by ratepayers is
not compatible with legal precedents, true competition or the
public interest,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   The study will be used by opponents of Massachusetts' electric
restructuring law. Opponents say the law did not provide consumers
enough of a discount on electricity bills and &UR;  &LR; are urging voters to
repeal the law on a Nov. 3 ballot initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line in every one of the 11 states is that
regulators blew the opportunity to save consumers a substantial
portion of their electric rates,'' said Rob Sargent, Masspirg
energy department director.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the Massachusetts law &UR;  &LR; insist that the state has the
most progressive deregulation law in the country, with ratepayers
paying considerably lower stranded costs than customers in other
states.

SMU PLANS TRIBUTES TO DOAK WALKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the SMU Mustangs depart for Hawaii today, the spirit of a
legend will travel with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we play (Hawaii) Saturday, we plan to wear a No. 37 decal
on the helmets, in honor of Doak Walker,'' SMU coach Mike Cavan
said. ``We also plan to wear it in every game for the rest of the
year, in his memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the plan, unless we have trouble getting it approved by
the NCAA,'' Cavan said. ``I really can't imagine any problem there,
but you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be a memorial service today in Steamboat Springs,
Colo., for Walker, the former SMU All-American who died Sunday at
age 71. Walker will be cremated.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, a three-time All-American who won both the Heisman and
Maxwell trophies during his SMU career (1947-49), was paralyzed in
a skiing accident Jan. 30. In July, he was moved from a Denver
hospital to a facility in Steamboat Springs where he battled
various ailments relating to the injury.
</P>
<P>
   He died Sunday from an infection after surgery for a bleeding
ulcer, said his son, Scott, who added, ``his spirit was great, but
his health had deteriorated, and he had had a lot of infections.
His kidneys had begun to shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   SMU officials said a previously planned tribute to Walker during
the TCU game (Oct. 17 in the Cotton Bowl) will be held in an
altered form. There will be a halftime ceremony honoring Walker,
but a surcharge of $1 for general admission tickets and $2 for
reserved seats has been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The extra fee was intended to raise money for Walker's
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   There also have been various suggestions about honoring Walker
in connection with the new football stadium being built on the
present on-campus site of Ownby Stadium _ the first arena in which
Walker played for the Mustangs.
</P>
<P>
   A hall-of-fame section called Heritage Hall already has been
planned, and will be heavily laden with Walker memorabilia. There
also has been a suggestion to add a ``Doak Walker Plaza.''
</P>
<P>
   There also have been suggestions about adding Walker's name to
the stadium, which is scheduled to be named after principal donor
Gerald J. Ford, a Dallas businessman and SMU alumnus.

LONGHORNS FIND LEADER IN FEISTY FIFTH-YEAR SENIOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Mack Brown, Texas' first-year football coach,
knew he had a scrapper when he watched Wane McGarity fighting
through stiffness in his surgically repaired knee during spring
drills.
</P>
<P>
   But it took an injury to another player before Brown realized he
had something special: a team leader who is fast becoming one of
the nation's premier deep threats. Ironically, McGarity's rise to
prominence began after quarterback Richard Walton broke a finger
Sept. 12 in a 49-31 loss to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Losing the fifth-year senior for an extended period thrust
redshirt freshman Major Applewhite into the quarterback spot and
raised questions about whether the Longhorns' passing game could
remain productive in Walton's absence. McGarity answered with a
career-best outing against No. 5 Kansas State, then topped that
effort in last week's 59-21 rout of Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into a game against Iowa State (6 p.m. Saturday,
Royal-Memorial Stadium), McGarity ranks 18th nationally among wide
receivers with an average of five catches and 107.5 yards per game.
At 21.5 yards per catch, he is second among Big 12 players with at
least 10 receptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wane has really stepped it up since Richard got hurt. He's
played as well as I've seen him play,'' Brown said. ``We've got to
get everybody on this football team playing with as much heart as
Wane McGarity. He doesn't look like a guy who's had three knee
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has. The last one came a year ago, short-circuiting
McGarity's 1997 season after three games. When rehabilitation work
proved grueling in the off-season, Brown broached the possibility
of McGarity accepting a medical scholarship and calling it a
career. The senior from San Antonio wouldn't bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people to remember me as, `That injury plagued
wide receiver who played for Texas,''' McGarity said, bristling at
the title that once threatened to summarize his college career. ``I
still feel like I have something to give to this university. I
never quit on anybody, and nobody quits on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of leadership abilities and a lot to give to
this team. I think I've proved that I'm the same player I was
before the operations. To me, that means a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   To the Texas passing game, which must remain productive to
prevent defenses from selling out to stop record-setting tailback
Ricky Williams, McGarity has meant a much-needed downfield threat
that was lacking last season. Against Kansas State, McGarity
grabbed five passes for 142 yards. He was even better against Rice,
snagging six balls for a career-high 145 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an experienced guy at a position where we really need
one,'' said offensive coordinator Greg Davis. ``It's hard to put a
value on that. With Wane out there, it becomes a question of what
the other team wants to give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you play your safeties up close to stop Ricky and go
one-on-one with Wane? Or do you keep them back deep and open up the
run? He gives this team a dimension it didn't have last year.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has boosted the confidence of Applewhite, who once
avoided throwing to McGarity in drills to let him get more
repetitions with Walton. Now, the two have hooked up 11 times in
two weeks, covering 287 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not only great physically, he's great mentally,''
Applewhite said. ``He knows exactly what I'm thinking and what
we're going to do before we do it. I think Wane and I have
developed a little connection.''
</P>
<P>
   The increased numbers suggest it. But they do not tell the
complete Wane McGarity story, in Brown's estimation. That begins
and ends with the grin McGarity takes to practice on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got so much fight for a guy with three knee operations,''
Brown said. ``To see him smile, you have to pull for him to finish
on a positive note after all the adversity he's been through.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, McGarity has made major strides in that
direction.

STARS REVISIT MEMORY LANE IN EXHIBITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock was a little leery when the topic came
up concerning crowd reaction during tonight's trip to Minneapolis
for a neutral-site clash with the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we're going to be cheered or booed,''
Hitchcock said of the Stars' 7 p.m. preseason game at the Target
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are returning to their roots, traveling back to the
place where they started as the Minnesota North Stars in 1968.
However, the once-beloved team in hockey-mad Minnesota became
somewhat hated when the organization moved to Texas in 1993, with
owner Norman Green citing a failure to make a profit in the Land of
10,000 Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they'll boo me, I hope not,'' said center Mike
Modano, one of few Stars players who remain from the North Stars'
roster. ``They'd boo Norm Green, but I don't think they'd boo the
players. They know it wasn't our fault the team moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano and Craig Ludwig are the only former North Stars
scheduled to make the trip. Derian Hatcher is serving out the third
game of a four-game suspension, while Richard Matvichuk is nursing
a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Winger Brett Hull makes his summer home in Duluth, Minn., and
said he will have friends and family in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The only other Stars player with Minnesota ties _ restricted
free-agent winger Jamie Langenbrunner _ is at home in Duluth and
has not yet signed a contract with the Stars. As of yesterday,
Stars general manager Bob Gainey said he did not have plans to meet
with Langenbrunner while in Minnesota. &QL; 
SPEEDY RECOVERY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Matvichuk could return to play as soon as
mid-October, Hitchcock said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matvichuk is way, way ahead of schedule,'' Hitchcock said.
``We'll see where he is on the weekend, but I look for him to be
available by the middle of October.''
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk's recovery is amazing considering he had the anterior
cruciate ligament in his left knee replaced June 23 and orginally
was given a recovery period of six months. &QL; 
SYDOR PRACTICES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Darryl Sydor returned to practice yesterday after
missing the first two weeks of the preseason because of a contract
squabble.
</P>
<P>
   As for any battle with rookie Sergey Gusev for a place in the
lineup, he said: ``I can't just think there's a place waiting for
me. I have to work and I have to earn it. Whoever is playing well
is going to play, and that's the way it should be.''

ONLINE MAGAZINE'S D.C. BUREAU CHIEF IS FORCED TO RESIGN
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CLINTON, CLINTON-CANTON, CLINTON-IMPEACH, CLINTON-JONES,
OPRAH-MONICA) 
(nk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Washington bureau chief of the online magazine Salon, who
urged his editors not to reveal a 30-year-old affair of Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, was forced
to resign after he publicly questioned the journalistic merits of
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation of Hyde's affair came on Sept. 16, five days
after Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr sent Congress
his report on President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky
and his statements under oath about the relationship. Hyde's
committee plans to debate whether to vote on beginning a formal
impeachment inquiry, based in part on the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   Salon, which is based in San Francisco, came under sharp attack
from both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill and from readers after
publishing the report, which was accompanied by an editorial saying
that ``ugly times call for ugly tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Editor David Talbot said Tuesday that the report, whose
publication had been the source of sharp internal debate as well,
brought at least 400,000 new readers to the site.
</P>
<P>
   But anticipating the highly charged atmosphere that followed
publication of the Hyde story, Talbot said the bureau chief,
Jonathan Broder, was specifically told not to air his differences
with his editors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people trying to shut down Salon because they don't
like what we're publishing,'' Talbot said. ``They tried to hack
into us. We've gotten bomb threats at home. The last thing we
needed was for our Washington correspondent to add fuel to that
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Talbot confirmed that he had told his subordinates last
week that Broder, 50, was no longer working for the publication.
His resignation letter was not sent until this week, though Broder
said he had offered to resign in a heated conversation with one of
the magazine's editors on Sept. 17, after The Washington Post
quoted him as saying he objected to the decision ``on journalistic
grounds, on grounds of fairness and because of the way Salon would
be perceived.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbot said that Broder's decision to ``publicly air his
criticisms'' of the Hyde story was in direct defiance of his
supervisors' instructions and ``a fundamental violation of the
trust that any organization must have in its employees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have determined that sex sells,'' Broder said
Tuesday. ``This whole Clinton scandal is a made-for-Salon story, if
you want to view it through a sexual lens.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made a decision that that's where he wants to take
Salon,'' said Broder, referring to Talbot. ``That's where the money
is. He's the executive editor and chief executive. I just don't
want to go there with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The internal strife at Salon comes as the online magazine is
preparing to shift its profile, putting new emphasis on breaking
news. When it was founded three years ago, the magazine was built
around essays with attitude, on the cultural and intellectual
scene.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Broder's criticism, Talbot pointed out that he is
eliminating one long-running column about sex, ``Unzipped,''
written by Courtney Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Online Journalism Review in March,
Talbot responded to a question about building the magazine's
``brand name'' by saying, ``I think your editorial operations can
get you news as we've been doing lately with the stories we've been
breaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's free PR in a way,'' he said, using shorthand for public
relations.

ANALYSIS: FOR PAKISTAN AND INDIA, ATOM PACT IS A HARD SELL  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ For the prime ministers of India and Pakistan
to follow through on their stated willingness to sign the nuclear
test-ban treaty, both men will need to convince their restive
publics that they got something substantial in return.
</P>
<P>
   The response to their speeches at the U.N. General Assembly last
week, in which they said their countries were ready to sign the
treaty within a year if sanctions against them were lifted, was
optimistic in the United States. But political and policy analysts
here paid more attention to the conditions each man set, and, in
India's case especially, it is far from certain that those
conditions would be met.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, and India's, Atal
Behari Vajpayee, face politically insecure futures and would pay a
high price with voters if they signed the treaty without bringing
home the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's political fortunes have swooned since the United States
imposed economic sanctions on his country after it tested nuclear
weapons in May, seriously worsening Pakistan's bleak economic
prospects. Not surprisingly, he declared he would sign the treaty
only if the United States lifts the economic sanctions and helps
Pakistan get an aid package to prevent its default on $30 billion
in debt.
</P>
<P>
   The week before he went to New York, Sharif sought legislative
approval to sign the treaty, but many members of Parliament were
unwilling to give him the go-ahead without a specific description
of what Pakistan would get in return. And the United States will be
unable to give Sharif what he asked for unless Congress either
gives the president authority to waive sanctions or removes them
itself, and so far only the Senate has agreed to a waiver.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, whose Bharatiya Janata Party heads a fragile coalition
government, has an even more complicated task.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, there has been a broad consensus in India
against signing the treaty. Some officials said that India needed
the freedom to test so it could develop a credible nuclear
deterrent against Pakistan and China; others said that India should
not sign until the five declared nuclear powers agreed to move
decisively toward global disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The BJP doesn't have much room to do a deal without getting
important concessions,'' said Brahma Chellaney, a national security
analyst at the Center for Policy Research, a nonprofit research
group in New Delhi. ``And it's not clear what the Americans can
offer. The president has been weakened and Congress is hostile.''
</P>
<P>
   What India wants from the United States _ for example, the
opportunity to buy advanced technology from the United States _
will be difficult for the United States to give without seeming to
reward India for having tested nuclear weapons in May. The grueling
negotiations between India and the United States since the tests
have yet to resolve this and many other knotty issues.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the United States willing to lift sanctions, much less
make other serious concessions, if all Pakistan and India do is
sign the test ban treaty. American negotiators want both countries
to halt their production of weapons-grade plutonium and uranium _
something Pakistan is especially reluctant to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on Monday to the Asia Society in New York, a dour
Vajpayee made clear India's resentment of Washington's angry
denunciations of the nuclear tests, while the established nuclear
powers have ignored India's pleas for disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ``They first used the Cold War as a pretext for a costly arms
race,'' he said. ``Now, even though the Cold War is over, they have
sought to perpetuate their hegemony through discriminatory
nonproliferation treaties which are bound to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   And he justified India's nuclear tests ``as a powerful challenge
to the practitioners of nuclear apartheid.''
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee was surely playing to his audience back home, but the
anger in India is real. Even the coolest-headed intellectuals ask
why China, an authoritarian government that has exported nuclear
technology to India's arch-rival Pakistan, and has a terrible human
rights record, is allowed to buy American satellites and other
technology while India, the world's largest democracy, is not.
</P>
<P>
   India's nuclear scientists have recently declared that India can
go ahead and sign the test-ban treaty without damaging its weapons
program. The tests conducted in May provided them with what they
need to know, they said.
</P>
<P>
   And while those assurances may ultimately help Vajpayee make the
case domestically for signing the treaty, they will not be enough
by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Richard Haass, director of the foreign policy studies
program at the Brookings Institution, made a swing through New
Delhi and Islamabad to present the recommendations of a task force,
sponsored by Brookings and the Council on Foreign Relations, on
American policy toward India and Pakistan, post-tests. American
diplomats say that the document lays out the direction the
administration wants its own policy to take.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with journalists, Haass maintained that the United
States should recognize that there is no way for India to unlearn
what it learned from its nuclear tests and that the president
should have the authority to waive sanctions under the right
circumstances. But he also said that India should sign the treaty
to stabilize its relationship with Pakistan and to build stronger
ties with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether India will hold on to the residue of
nonalignment or Third Worldism, or let it go,'' he said.

RED SOX'S BIG THREE PROVE WORTHY IN 11-3 ROUT OF INDIANS

By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ On a single brilliant autumn afternoon at Jacobs
Field, Mo Vaughn found redemption, Nomar Garciaparra provided
vindication and Pedro Martinez gave further justification.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the heroics of Boston's three superstars, the
only thing the Cleveland Indians were left with yesterday was a
whole lot of desolation.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn homered twice and doubled to drive in seven runs, tying a
postseason record for a single game, and Garciaparra launched an
important three-run home run and added a sacrifice fly in the
eighth. Together, they drove in all the Red Sox runs and helped
Martinez, the $75 million man, cruise to an 11-3 victory in his
first playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams play again today in Game 2 of the best-of-five
Division Series. The winner plays the survivor of the Rangers-New
York Yankees series for the American League pennant.
</P>
<P>
   If the key Red Sox players continue to outperform Cleveland's as
they did in Game 1, there won't be a need for games 4 and 5 this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was a one-man turning point in the surprisingly lopsided
game. His three-run shot off Indians starter Jaret Wright with
nobody out in the top of the first inning set the game's tone and
provided him some redemption for a disastrous performance in his
only other postseason appearance.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1995 Division Series against Cleveland, Vaughn went
hitless in 14 at-bats, striking out seven times as the Indians
swept the Red Sox en route to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted an opportunity to get here again,'' Vaughn said.
(In 1995) I wasn't prepared. I'm a little bit older now and I'm
more experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said the main thing he didn't do in 1995 was hit the ball
where it was pitched. That's exactly what he did against Wright,
however. Showing patience, he came back from an 0-2 count, running
the count full with two men on base. Then he went to the opposite
field on a 3-2 pitch by Wright. The ball landed just beyond the
left-field wall, 376 feet from home plate. The Indians never
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball was out over the plate, and I just went through it
and it carried,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his latest heroics, Vaughn can't completely forget his
collapse three seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll ever close the books on what happened in
1995,'' he said. ``I think I'll always refer back to it and learn
from it because I think as much as it hurts, you're always going to
learn more from negative things than from positive things. That's
the only way you can get better at what you're trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   For Garciaparra, whose three-run home run in the fifth inning
boosted the Boston lead to 6-0, the game demonstrated yet again
that he belonged in the All-Star Game this year. Indians manager
Mike Hargrove left him off the team, choosing his own shortstop,
Omar Vizquel, instead. Red Sox fans and baseball people across
America criticized the decision, and the shortstop's performance
yesterday further vindicated their claims.

   Garciaparra wasn't talking about the slight afterward,
preferring to praise the efforts of Vaughn and Martinez. Of his
home run, he said, ``I just tried to drive (the ball). Fortunately,
it went out.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Martinez, he further justified the Red Sox's $75 million
off-season investment in his prized right arm. Acquired from the
Montreal Expos and signed for six years to be the ace of a team
with flickering playoff hopes, Martinez ably filled the role
yesterday, dominating Cleveland until two late home runs, by Kenny
Lofton and Jim Thome, led to his exit after seven stellar innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the lead, so it was up to me to get on top of them and
start pitching my game and be ahead of them all of the time. I did,
and I got the best results,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   So did the Red Sox.

the role of Dalila itself, which rises above the musical mediocrity

Why is it that some of the fanciest chefs in town positively dote
on short ribs? Maybe it's because this unglamorous cut brings out
the Henry Higgins in them. In the right hands, and with enough care
and patience, these steer ribs, the ends of the prime ribs, which
start out all toughness, show their elegant and tender side. (David

   (NYT8) JERSEYVILLE, Ill. -- Sept. 29, 1998 --
SPCL-FOOD-III-2-BOS, 9-29 -- At Monsanto's 240-acre research farm,
Roundup Ready corn, corn which is genetically engineered to
withstand the herbicide Roundup, continues grow next to regular
corn. Genetic engineering allows scientists to transfer a single
gene from any organism - plant, animal, or microbe - into a food
crop so it can withstand insects and herbicides, as well as last
longer before spoiling. (Stan Grossfeld/Boston Globe Photo)

9-29 -- The bars, say Premium Standard Farms, stop the sow from
rolling on top of the piglets while they are nursing. The story of
Premium Standard, which raises 1.7 million hogs a year, represents
a changing America, where big, high-tech corporations are replacing
mom and pop farms. (Stan Grossfeld/Boston Globe Photo)

   (NYT4) MILAN, Mo. -- Sept. 29, 1998 -- SPCL-FOOD-II-1-BOS-B&AMP;W,
9-29 -- This hog is head and shoulders above the rest at
Missouri-based Premium Standard Farms, the nation's second largest
hog producer. Nationwide, more animals are being produced on less
land. Concentrated factory farms, virtually non-existent 30 years
ago, are now proliferating, generating billions of dollars in big
business while creating cheaper, leaner food. (Stan

SPCL-FOOD-PESTICIDES-2-BOS-B&AMP;W, 9-29 -- Eleazar Villegas Baypoli,
27, of Buaysiacobe, cradles his son. In February, Villegas was told
to spray the tomatoes with a diluted mixture of three pesticides,
including the highly toxic chemical parathion. After three days of
spraying he felt a ``fire'' in his chest and could barely breathe.
To save his life, doctors performed an emergency tracheotomy. Today
he is bedridden, has no health insurance, no income and suffers
from nerve damage and depression. (Stan Grossfeld/Boston Globe

SPCL-FOOD-PESTICIDES-1-BOS-B&AMP;W, 9-29 -- Belem Colin Silva, 11,
bundles her face with a bandanna while she works in a grape field
that has been sprayed with pesticides. Up to 25 million
agricultural workers in the developing world may suffer at least
one incident of pesticide poisoning each year because they don't
use U.S.-required protective clothing or respirators and are
inadequately trained, according to the World Health Organization.

Biddle contracted the parasite cyclospora in April 1997 after

COURT WILL ADD TO SEX HARASSMENT RULINGS, TAKING UP CASE OF OFFENSE
BY STUDENT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By LINDA GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Adding a dozen cases to the calendar for its new
term, the Supreme Court on Tuesday expanded its review of sexual
harassment law and also agreed to decide whether states can impose
special welfare limits on new residents.
</P>
<P>
   The justices acted in advance of the formal opening next Monday
of the 1998-1999 term, during which they will continue to add new
cases to the 45 already accepted for decision, including Tuesday's
12.
</P>
<P>
   In the last term, the court decided four sexual harassment
cases, clarifying the rules for determining the liability of
employers and, in the instance of sexual harassment committed by
teachers, the liability of school districts. The new case raises
the question whether a school district can ever be found liable
under federal law for one student's harassment of another. The
federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled last year that federal law
did not apply to the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Davis vs. Monroe County Board of Education, No.
97-843, is an appeal by the mother of a girl who was harassed
repeatedly by a boy in her fifth-grade classroom in Macon, Ga. The
classroom teacher took no action, refusing for three months to let
the girl change her seat. The principal also took no action. As the
situation worsened, the girl's grades dropped and she threatened
suicide. Eventually the boy was criminally charged and pleaded
guilty to sexual battery.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, in Gebser vs. Lago Vista Independent School District,
the court ruled that students could sue school districts for
harassment by teachers but that a district would be liable only if
a person in authority had known of the problem and had reacted with
``deliberate indifference.'' In the new case, the plaintiff,
supported by the Clinton administration, is arguing that this
standard has been met in light of school officials' failure to
respond to months of complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The federal appeals courts have disagreed over whether the law
at issue, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, applies to
sexual harassment by students, and several such cases have recently
been appealed to the Supreme Court. Title IX prohibits sex
discrimination in educational programs that receive federal money.
In this case, the 11th U.S. Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, ruled
that while the law obliged school districts to prevent sexual
harassment by their employees, it did not make schools liable for
students' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The court accepted a second case Tuesday involving Title IX, in
the statute's more familiar context of equality in college
athletics rather than sexual harassment. The question is whether
the National Collegiate Athletic Association is itself bound by the
anti-discrimination provisions of the law, which indisputably do
apply to the 1,200 colleges and universities that are NCAA members.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, NCAA vs. Smith, No. 98-84, the 3rd U.S. Court of
Appeals, in Philadelphia, ruled earlier this year that even though
the athletic association itself does not directly receive federal
money, it is an indirect recipient, and therefore covered by Title
IX, by virtue of the dues it collects from its member schools.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court permitted a Title IX suit against the NCAA to
proceed. The plaintiff is a woman who lost her eligibility under
NCAA rules to play intercollegiate volleyball when she graduated
early from college and entered graduate school. The woman, Renee
Smith, is alleging that more men than women receive waivers from
the NCAA of its ``postbaccalaureate bylaw,'' which bars graduate
students from continuing in intercollegiate competition. The
association argues that it is not covered by Title IX.

</P>
<P>
   These were among the court's other new cases:
</P>
<P>
   NEWCOMERS' WELFARE
</P>
<P>
   Accepting an appeal filed by the State of California, the court
agreed to decide whether states can constitutionally place special
limits on the welfare benefits they make available to new
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Such two-tiered benefit levels were authorized by Congress in
the 1996 welfare law, and several states have adopted them.
California has been in the forefront of this effort. At issue in
this case, Anderson vs. Roe, No. 98-97, is a 1992 state law, the
subject of a long-running lawsuit, under which new residents who
receive public assistance are limited during the first 12 months to
the benefit level they would be receiving in their home state.
California has the sixth-highest benefit level in the country,
according to its Supreme Court brief.
</P>
<P>
   The state is appealing from an injunction issued last year by
the federal district court in Los Angeles and upheld by the 9th
U.S. Court of Appeals, in San Francisco. The lead plaintiff is a
woman who moved to California from Oklahoma, where she had never
received public assistance. When she became eligible for welfare in
California, she would have received $565 a month but was informed
that her grant would be held to Oklahoma's level of $307.
</P>
<P>
   In blocking California from putting the law into effect, the
appeals court said there was ``persuasive authority'' for finding
it unconstitutional under Supreme Court precedents holding that the
constitutional right to travel protects people from being
discriminated against on the basis of their state of origin. In its
Supreme Court appeal, the state is arguing that people remain free
to travel or move to California but that ``California is not
obliged to fund the exercise of a constitutional right.''
</P>
<P>
   REDISTRICTING REDUX
</P>
<P>
   Revisiting a familiar subject in a familiar setting, the court
agreed for the third time in five years to review the
constitutionality of a North Carolina congressional district's
boundaries, which a 5-4 majority earlier denounced as a racial
gerrymander.
</P>
<P>
   In its current incarnation, the case that was originally known
as Shaw vs. Reno is called Hunt vs. Cromartie, No. 98-85, and is an
appeal by the state on behalf of a district that has been
substantially redrawn by the state legislature to accommodate the
court's concerns. That district, the 12th, still narrow and still
connecting black population centers along the Interstate 85
corridor, no longer has a majority of black voters. It is 54
percent white and is 95 miles long, compared with its original 160
miles. The state argued in response to the latest challenge by a
group of white voters that the new lines had been drawn not
primarily for reasons of race but to preserve the district's
Democratic majority. Nonetheless a federal district court ruled in
April that the district was ``race-driven'' and consequently
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In its series of decisions beginning with Shaw vs. Reno in 1993,
the Supreme Court has not upheld any of the challenged districts.
The court's ruling in this latest case may well indicate to states
facing redistricting after the next census what the rules will be:
specifically, how states are to balance their obligations under the
Voting Rights Act to insure racial fairness in the electoral
process with the constitutional constraints the court has placed on
their ability to take race into account.
</P>
<P>
   SEARCHING OF PASSENGERS
</P>
<P>
   The court, accepting an appeal by the State of Wyoming, agreed
to decide whether the police can search the personal belongings of
a passenger when they stop a car for a traffic violation. In this
case, Wyoming vs. Houghton, No. 98-184, the state police stopped a
car for speeding and acquired probable cause to search the car when
they saw a syringe in the driver's shirt pocket.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to searching the car and patting down the three
occupants, they searched a closed purse belonging to one of the
passengers, Sandra Houghton, who as a result of the search was
convicted of possessing methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling earlier this year, the Wyoming Supreme Court
overturned the conviction and held that in the absence of any
reason to suspect the passenger of a crime, the search violated the
Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches. The
Supreme Court has not ruled directly on the passenger search issue,
but the Wyoming court cited a 1979 Supreme Court precedent holding
that the search of a customer on the premises of a restaurant that
the police had a warrant to search violated the Fourth Amendment.

EXPERT FOR MICROSOFT HELPS FIGHT ONE OF ITS SUBPOENAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The software industry is a notoriously fast, fluid business,
with today's friend becoming tomorrow's foe. So too, it seems, for
the industry's most famous defendant, Microsoft Corp., in its
pretrial preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft recently selected Richard Schmalensee, a distinguished
economist and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, as its expert witness to explain why the huge software
company is a national asset and not a monopolistic predator. He
will testify before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District
Court in Washington, who will hear the antitrust case filed against
Microsoft by the government and 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   But Schmalensee is also helping to fight a subpoena filed last
week by Microsoft's lawyers in preparation for the trial, scheduled
to begin Oct. 15. MIT and Harvard University filed a motion on
Friday in a federal court in Boston to stop Microsoft from
obtaining the interview tapes and transcripts for a book written by
two business school professors, one from MIT and the other from
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   As the acting dean of MIT's Sloan School of Management,
Schmalensee told Michael Cusumano, a Sloan professor of management
and co-author of the book, to fiercely resist the Microsoft
subpoena. ``He put on his dean's hat and advised me not to hand
anything over,'' Cusumano said.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant to Schmalensee said Tuesday that he was unavailable
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The book research sought by Microsoft involves nearly 200 hours
of tape-recorded sessions and more than 2,000 pages of interview
transcripts with current and former executives of Netscape
Communications Corp. The Microsoft legal team wants the materials
to try to show that Microsoft's rise in the market for Internet
browsing software was more a result of Netscape's mistakes than of
any alleged misconduct by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling on another subpoena, Microsoft won a round Tuesday.
Jackson ordered that Oracle Corp. had to hand over to Microsoft
documents concerning agreements it has with other companies,
including Apple Computer, IBM and others. Microsoft is seeking the
information to try to show that Microsoft meetings the government
has characterized as efforts to thwart competition are actually
commonplace in the industry, where competitors often cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   The book, which will be shipped by Simon and Schuster to stores
within days of the start of the trial, is titled ``Competing on
Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with
Microsoft.'' The other author was David Yoffie, a professor at
Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   The book does document Netscape's missteps, but Yoffie said he
also thought that Microsoft's extremely aggressive business
practices in the Internet software market had almost invited a
strong reaction from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing that he was not making a legal judgment, Yoffie
said, ``I think Microsoft could have achieved 90 percent of what it
did without crossing the line as much as it did.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to the federal courts to decide whether Microsoft
violated any laws. But legal experts said that pointing out the
mistakes of competitors is a standard line of defense in antitrust
cases. It was used successfully in private antitrust cases by Xerox
in the 1970s and Eastman Kodak in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the shot-yourself-in-the-foot defense,'' said Stephen
Axinn, a leading antitrust litigator. ``Microsoft will argue that
it is not a predatory monopolist but that Netscape was its own
worst enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the court will have a great measure of discretion on how
much of a role competitor information will play in the case. It
could weigh heavily, or the court could decide that the real issue
is not Netscape's mistakes but Microsoft's use of its market power,
Axinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard and MIT assert that Microsoft's subpoena of the writers'
materials poses a threat to the First Amendment rights of the
authors and to the integrity of academic research. The Harvard
Business School curriculum, Yoffie observed, is based on case
studies of corporations. The quality of that work, he added, rests
on the ability of the researchers to assure corporate executives
that confidential information will remain confidential.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Our whole research process at Harvard is put at risk by
this,'' Yoffie said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft obtained a copy of the manuscript in early September
through a subpoena issued to Netscape. The authors had given a
couple of Netscape executives copies of the manuscript to read and
review confidentially. On Sept. 18, Microsoft asked the authors to
hand over their tapes and notes voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our response was, `Not on your life,''' Yoffie said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the authors did offer a compromise: Allow a third party
to review the tapes to verify the accuracy of the quotations from
Netscape executives. Microsoft rejected that proposal and
subpoenaed the materials four days later.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Microsoft will prevail remains uncertain. Massachusetts
has a ``shield'' law that affords writers some protection for
confidential sources and unpublished research materials. But that
protection is generally less for academics than it is for print
journalists, and legal experts describe the law as weak.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, legal experts added, will try to override the shield
law by saying that the authors' research is crucial to its defense
and cannot be obtained elsewhere.

IT IS THIRD-AND-FUN FOR JOHNSON'S DOLPHINS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jimmy Johnson replaced Tom Landry as head coach in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Johnson replaced Don Shula as head coach in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Johnson sure knows how to pick his spots. He does not
follow the Rich Kotites or the Ray Handleys. He picks these sunny
places where coaching legends reside and where franchises have won
but have begun to slide. He picks high-profile jobs and then, like
a sweeping storm, stirs things up and brings his own brash style of
bruising football to town. Fun football, too.
</P>
<P>
   It was not that way, at first, in Miami. His first season, the
team was 8-8. Last year, it was 9-7 and lost in the first round of
the playoffs. Dolphin fans were wondering what had happened to
Johnson's magic touch.
</P>
<P>
   But for Johnson, the third season has been his charm.
</P>
<P>
   In his third season at the University of Miami, he went 11-1. In
his third season at Dallas, the Cowboys went 11-5 and won a playoff
game.
</P>
<P>
   It is his third season in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins are 3-0, and it is a healthy 3-0. It is another
team full of Johnson trademarks _ aggressive, gambling, attacking,
confident, arrogant, run-oriented and swift on defense. Playmakers
galore. Charming, really. The Jets get an up-close look when the
Dolphins visit on Sunday at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson looked around after last season and saw a team that had
too many remnants of the Shula era. A team still relying on
quarterback Dan Marino's arm to make everything right. So, Johnson
dismissed his offensive coordinator, Gary Stevens, put Kippy Brown,
the running backs coach, in his place, and simply told his team, in
essence: ``Quit being wimps! We're going to take this ball and
shove it! Get physical! Knock some people on their rears!''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins listened.
</P>
<P>
   What choice did they have?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a team now that loves to challenge you,'' Dolphins
cornerback Terrell Buckley said. ``We aren't making the mistakes we
used to because now the thinking part has given way to just playing
football. What you see right now is what you're going to see in
Week 13, and after that. Challenge the other guy, that's what Jimmy
says. Keep attacking. Do not retreat.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, this is wonderful philosophy but it goes nowhere without
talented players, first, and then without guys who have the mental
makeup to provide staying power. This is where Johnson separates
himself from most coaches. He identifies players who not only have
talent, but will. Take linebacker Zach Thomas. He was a fifth-round
pick out of Texas Tech. But he has become the soul of the defense.
He makes the calls at the snap. He stays in the lineup in the
nickel, pass defense. A lot of coaches passed on Thomas. Not
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Take this year's rookie crop of defensive players, including end
Kenny Mixon (6 feet 4 inches, 273 pounds) and Lorenzo Bromell (6-6,
265). Big, quick players. Mixon, from Louisiana State, was the 49th
player selected in last year's draft; Clemson's Bromell was the
102d. They were there long enough for several coaches to swipe
them. But it was Johnson who nabbed them, and both are contributing
instant big plays.
</P>
<P>
   And then, in free agency, Johnson had got offensive guard Kevin
Donnalley from the Tennessee Oilers. Donnalley is a solid presence
on the field and in the locker room. An intuitive player and
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson drafted running back John Avery from Mississippi last
spring, and that resulted in a rejuvenated and refocused Karim
Abdul-Jabbar. He has averaged nearly 100 yards rushing in each of
the Dolphins' first three games. And he is a Jet killer. Three of
his eight career 100-yard rushing games have come against the Jets,
as have two of his top four rushing performances.
</P>
<P>
   It is the defense, though, that makes the 1998 Dolphins look
strong.
</P>
<P>
   The defense led the way in Miami's last game before its bye last
weekend, a 21-0 victory over Pittsburgh where it limited Pittsburgh
to 200 yards. Miami has limited its last two opponents to fewer
than 100 yards passing. That last happened for Miami 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This defense is allowing only 7.3 points a game _ the best in
the National Football League. It has produced 13 sacks, while the
Dolphins have allowed only 3. It has forced eight turnovers, while
the Miami offense has committed only two.
</P>
<P>
   Here is another testament to the new run-first Dolphins _ of 35
fourth-quarter offensive plays this season, Miami has run the ball
28 times. With Marino? Unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   Miami is a league-best 8-1 after bye weeks, and Johnson is 4-0
with the Dolphins against the Jets, including 31-20 and 24-17
victories last season. The Dolphins have been fast starters under
Johnson in each of his two previous seasons, but wavered at the
finish. This team does not look as if it will follow suit. It is
built on defense and on the running game. Those are staples in
football that have stood the sternest test.
</P>
<P>
   And so has Jimmy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   They laughed at him that first year in Miami _ why, he did no
better than Shula. They scoffed at him last season when his team
struggled and then made the playoffs and then wilted at New
England.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the third season.
</P>
<P>
   Charming times.

 &HT;    What remains of Georges moving slowly to east
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore and Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The whirlwind that was Georges moved
sluggishly across the South on Tuesday, dumping heavy rains on
South Alabama, southeastern Georgia and the Florida Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   Roads in Alabama flooded, lights winked out as far north as
Montgomery, and coastal residents from Louisiana to Florida found
beach houses, piers and businesses badly damaged by wind and storm
surges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had waterfront property, waterback property, waterside
property, water-everywhere property,'' said 43-year-old postal
worker Jayne Howell, who found her brick ranch house in Pascagoula,
Miss., awash in sewage, seaweed and branches.
</P>
<P>
   But as bad as it was, said many of the returning evacuees, it
threatened to be much, much worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Pascagoula River at Merrill rose from 3.4 feet on Monday to
20.8 feet on Tuesday and was expected to swell to more than 26.5
feet later in the day, nearly 5 feet over flood stage.
</P>
<P>
   Some parts of the Alabama coast had received 2 1/2 feet of rain
in addition to damaging wind. At the Dog River south of Mobile,
more than 100 boats capsized or were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   In the Panhandle Tuesday, the maddening staying power of Georges
also brought rivers out of their banks and swamped homes, farms and
Interstate 10.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's initial impact caused $50 million in property damage
to the Pensacola area, Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson estimated
after surveying the city. That was a modest amount, about
one-fourth the estimated damage in the Keys. About half the damage
was from wind and half from rain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seafood wholesaler Phil Rollo in Milton, Fla., said the real
damage will not be known for days or weeks as millions of gallons
of rainwater pour into the Gulf of Mexico, diluting the salt level
and dumping tons of silt and agricultural runoff. Crabs, shrimp and
oysters are all affected in various ways, either killed outright,
driven to deeper water or made unsafe to eat, he said. He
anticipated a delay in the opening of oyster season Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll probably keep the beds closed for two weeks before
they allow anyone to harvest _ if there's anything to harvest,''
Rollo said. ``I don't have any insurance. I'm at the mercy of all
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The flooding does not present a major threat to human life
because relatively few homes are in the flood zones, said Mark
O'Biren, spokesman for the Escambia County emergency operations
center. What flooding reaches populated areas is expected to be
manageable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of carpets are probably going to get wet,'' O'Biren
said.
</P>
<P>
   State emergency management officials reported that rain at
Milton measured 25 inches with more on the way. Tornadoes spawned
by the thundershowers embedded in the storm struck Escambia, Bay
and Walton counties, destroying five homes in Panama City Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Wind damage from Georges combined with an earlier drought to
wipe out 75 percent of the cotton crop in Escambia County, said
county extension agent Lamar Christenberry. That's worth about $1.2
million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was concern that floodwater might affect 600 acres of
catfish farming in the area by carrying sewer overflow, fertilizers
or silt that might harm the fish, but there was no evidence of
damage by Tuesday night, Christenberry said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Department of Environmental Regulation will send
agents today to survey damage near Pensacola, a spokesman in
Tallahassee said. The federal Environmental Protection Agency
already has officials in the area but was not ready to offer an
assessment, a spokesman in Atlanta said.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate 10 was closed because of flooding near Crestview,
Fla., Tuesday, adding to traffic problems already caused by I-10's
shutdown at the Florida-Alabama border.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding along the Shoal River south of Crestview was expected
to close State Road 85, the main link between that city and Fort
Walton Beach, said Nancy Hussong, a spokeswoman at the Okaloosa
County Emergency Operations Center.
</P>
<P>
   Homes scattered along the Escambia, Shoal, Yellow and Blackwater
rivers also were threatened in a three-county area. State
meteorologist Andrew Devanas said the rivers were expected to crest
at record levels in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Accumulated rainwater collapsed the auditorium roof of the
Northwood Elementary School in Crestview.
</P>
<P>
   High water covered a causeway, isolating some residents on
Innerarity Island in the Intercoastal Waterway west of Pensacola.
</P>
<P>
   The damage to Perdido Key, one of the barrier islands near
Pensacola, did not appear to be severe. A four-story condominium
was heavily damaged by a tornado, but most of the other damage
involved pieces of siding and roof tiles falling off of buildings.
Police allowed residents to visit their homes but not to stay
there, enforcing a 6:30 p.m. curfew.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Lawton Chiles announced that for the fifth time this year,
President Clinton has approved an emergency declaration for
Florida, making grants and loans available to those who suffered
damage.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,800 National Guard forces have been called up for
active duty in four Gulf Coast states to help deal with the
aftermath of the hurricane, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The guard forces in Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana
will help local authorities in sandbagging, evacuation, debris
removal, cleanup operations and other efforts, said Pentagon
spokesman Navy Capt. Michael Doubleday. The U.S. Corps of Engineers
also has procured 1.25 million sandbags for the flood-fighting
effort along the Gulf Coast and five military medical teams are on
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Georges swept through the Florida Keys, causing an estimated
$200 million in damage, and then skirted the Panhandle for two
days, making landfall Monday in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Two deaths in a traffic accident and a house fire were blamed on
Georges.
</P>

   At the height of the storm, about 95,000 homes and businesses
were without power in the western Panhandle. About 55,000 were
restored as of midday Tuesday, and most of the remaining 40,000
were expected to have their lights back on by the end of the day,
Gulf Power Co. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Gulf Coast, it will be awhile before the damage is
added up. Some places suffered greatly, but overall, Georges was
not a catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who fled were going back. In Mississippi, the Red
Cross' shelter population of more than 15,000 was dropping
throughout the day.

<P>
   Riverboat casinos in Gulfport and Biloxi, Miss., lost $12.5
million in gaming revenues over the weekend, of which the state of
Mississippi would have taken $1.5 million in taxes, a spokeswoman
said. She said it would probably be at least a week before the
casinos reopened.

CORNELL AND DUCHAMP: A FAN CLUB OF JUST TWO  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DEBORAH SOLOMON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Friendships between artists seldom receive
serious attention. We assume them to be mostly trivial, a web of
anecdote and gossip. They evoke visions of chummy evenings at the
Cedar bar, the Cafe Deux Magots and other bohemian landmarks _
scenarios, more often than not, that involve a lot of scotch and
draw to a close when an artist either passes out or sneaks out the
door with his pal's favorite model.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not enough has been said about the ways in which artists
sustain one another. Joseph Cornell and Marcel Duchamp, those
connoisseurs of the commonplace object, provided a rapt audience
for each other long before the rest of the world acknowledged their
quirky brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   Joining together in the avant-garde 40s, they formed their own
fan club of two. Their intense, cryptic, and appropriately
eccentric friendship is now the subject of ``Joseph Cornell/Marcel
Duchamp: In Resonance,'' an exhibition opening Thursday at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art and remaining on view through Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, they were an unlikely pair. Duchamp, the founder
of the Dada movement, was a poised and worldly Frenchman who
conducted his career as if for his own entertainment. He penciled a
mustache on a picture of the Mona Lisa, exhibited a urinal as a
work of art, and enacted the ultimate Dada prank when he announced,
in 1923, that he was abandoning art for chess.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, he didn't really give up art, but he did, in a way,
give up on himself, settling for the tiny rewards of irony. Asked
how he spent his time, he invariably replied that he was content to
be just a ``respirateur,'' or breather.
</P>
<P>
   If Duchamp was the class jester of 20th-century art, Cornell was
the class loner. A thin, diffident wraith of a man, he lived with
his mother and handicapped brother in Flushing, N.Y., spending his
days in a basement workshop, where he arranged metal rings, cutouts
of birds and other frugal objects in small shadow boxes.
</P>
<P>
   He transposed five-and-dime reality into his own brand of
unreality. He did not travel, never married and kept a diary that
detailed his imagined intimacies with Romantic ballerinas of the
19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Duchamp, in other words, was amused by most everything, whereas
Cornell was amused by almost nothing, discerning a wealth of poetic
meaning _ of pathos, even _ in every last Woolworth's trinket.
Nonetheless, they were kindred spirits, glamorizing nonart objects
decades before art went Pop.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1913, Duchamp invented the ``readymade,'' which sounds
like a Betty Crocker recipe and required about as much time to
prepare; the term refers to ordinary objects (a snow shovel, a
bottle rack) unaltered by anything but Duchamp's wit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, Cornell conceived the form of the Box, which, compared
with Duchamp's stark one-liners, had the dense inwardness of a
diary.
</P>
<P>
   The two artists met in 1933, but their friendship didn't get
under way until the summer of 1942, when Duchamp sailed to New York
as a refugee from World War II.
</P>
<P>
   What drew them to one another? Duchamp, no doubt, recognized
Cornell as an American original, someone whose life and art were
more genuinely surreal than the calculated, showy weirdness of Dali
and the other Surrealists.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell, in turn, appreciated Duchamp's appreciation, and looked
to the Frenchman (who was 16 years his senior) as a guiding light.
It's true that Cornell had many muses, but most of them, such as
Mallarme or Emily Dickinson, were long dead; lunch dates with them
were out of the question. Duchamp, by contrast, was relatively
available and able to meet Cornell for tea.
</P>
<P>
   The current exhibition, which was organized by Ann Temkin of the
Philadelphia Museum, Susan Davidson of the Menil Collection in
Houston and three other art historians, will bring together about
80 works by Cornell and Duchamp in an effort to track the
affinities between them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the heart of the show belongs to a never-before-exhibited
object that is not a work of art at all. ``The Duchamp Dossier,''
which was acquired by the Philadelphia Museum in 1990, is an
achingly soulful souvenir, a cardboard box in which Cornell kept
mementos of his friendship with Duchamp. There are 117 items in
all, a mound of yellowed notes, old photographs and wastebasket
relics that together amount to a hidden embrace of a fellow artist.
</P>
<P>
   Here we find Duchamp's empty tobacco box, two of his white pipe
cleaners, and several of his crumpled laundry receipts (why am I
not surprised to learn that this creator of overly sanitized
objects dry-cleaned his handkerchiefs as well as his socks?).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   We see a packet of Domino sugar, inscribed with the date of a
meeting, and a Horn &AMP; Hardart napkin preserved as if this cafeteria
throwaway were the most delicate and fragrant flower.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Duchamp Dossier'' includes more conventional mementos as
well _ gallery announcements, postcards of the Mona Lisa, letters
and the like. Yet the correspondence between the two artists
probably conceals more than it reveals.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1946, on the eve of sailing for Paris, Duchamp wrote
Cornell with typical brevity, ``Au revoir/affectueusement Marcel.''
</P>
<P>
   What can a stash of dusty paper scraps tell us about art and its
mysterious ways? At the very least, the ``Dossier'' provides a bit
of scholarly news, confirming a long-rumored collaboration between
the two artists.
</P>
<P>
   Newly unearthed notes and receipts (``Dear Cornell/Here's the
$3.75 that I'm sorry has taken so long to send you'') indicate that
Duchamp hired Cornell to help assemble one of his most engaging
projects, ``Box in a Valise.''
</P>
<P>
   A dream accessory for the wartime exile, it consists of an
edition of little suitcases, each containing miniature
reproductions of Duchamp's key works. If he had to run, he was
ready.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell, in other words, helped pack Duchamp's bags, assisting
the peripatetic Frenchman on a singular creative flight. It's a
lovely notion, yet was it a gesture of grave artistic consequence?
Well, Cubism it was not, to cite the product of an historic
collaboration between Picasso and Braque, who claimed to be ``roped
together like mountaineers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornell and Duchamp, by contrast, joked together like
musketeers. The very slightness of their collaboration seems
fitting. All in all, they made a virtue of marginalities, and their
ephemera has proven to have as durable a shelf life as any of the
art of this century.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum would undoubtedly have
surprised both artists. Every friendship has secret corners, but
theirs had a secret box at its center.
</P>
<P>
   Duchamp, apparently, was unaware of the ``Dossier,'' never
suspecting that Cornell was riffling through his wastebasket for
train ticket stubs and other choice detritus to squirrel away at
home. You might say that Cornell did to Duchamp what Duchamp did to
civilization, singling out discards and imbuing them with an
unexpected weight.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense that Cornell never showed the ``Dossier'' to
Duchamp. He compiled it strictly for his own eyes, not to display
to the world. He had a great talent for admiration, and the
fetishized relics of his friendship with Duchamp bespeak an ardor
that was so complete it left no room for irony.
</P>
<P>
   How, one wonders, might Duchamp have responded if Cornell had
one day pulled out the ``Dossier'' from a drawer and shared its
worshipful contents with him?
</P>
<P>
   Ever amused, Duchamp might have chuckled, or just laughed
Cornell off the planet. We, however, are glad that this object has
come to light and can afford to be touched, knowing how rare such
homages are.

<P>
   Fiamma di San Giuliano Ferragamo, a designer who helped develop
one of the most famous shoe labels in fashion, died on Monday at
her home in Florence. She was 57. She died of cancer, said Ferrucio
Ferragamo, her brother and chief executive officer of Salvatore
Ferragamo Italia.
</P>
<P>
   For almost 40 years, Fiamma Ferragamo was responsible for the
design of the famed Ferragamo shoes and leather accessories,
helping to build Ferragamo from a custom shoemaker for the elite to
a global fashion powerhouse with a network of boutiques in New
York, Milan, London and Paris. In 1996, the company had become so
robust it was able to scoop up the Emanuel Ungaro company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferragamo pursued her vigorous activities for her family
company in defiance of doctors' prognostications a decade ago after
she underwent surgery for breast cancer. ``She went against all the
predictions at the beginning,'' Ferruccio Ferragamo said on
Tuesday. ``They thought it was only a question of a few months and
she made it 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   As executive vice president and a board member of the Ferragamo
company, Ms. Ferragamo played a central role in the business,
attending meetings as recently as two weeks ago with her five
siblings and her mother, Wanda, the chairman, said Ferruccio
Ferragamo.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferragamo prided herself on the comfort and elegance of the
Ferragamo shoe, values she inherited from her father, Salvatore,
who founded the firm in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferragamo's most successful shoe design, a round-toe,
low-heeled pump with grosgrain ribbon and gold buckle stamped with
the family signature, became a badge of executive propriety and
country club chic. Even though Ms. Ferragamo designed the Vara _ as
she called the model _ in the 1960s, the shoe has never lost its
appeal and remains a wardrobe staple for many conservative
white-collar women in much the same way the Oxford wingtip is for
white-collar men.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferragamo was born in Florence in 1941, the eldest of three
boys and two girls. She began working for the company at 16 when
her father had already established it as one of the most
prestigious names in shoes. At one point, it seemed that there was
no foot in royal Europe or royal Hollywood that Ferragamo had not
dressed _ from Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Sophia Loren and
Greta Garbo to the Duchess of Windsor, Queen Elena of Italy and, as
he pointed out in ``Shoemaker of Dreams,'' his 1957 autobiography,
Eva Braun.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferragamo inherited his mantle when she was only 19. When he
was dying of cancer, Salvatore Ferragamo left her in charge while
he sought treatment in the United States. He died in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferragamo believed in promotion as well as creation and she
spent weeks flying around the United States selling her product in
stores.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, she received the Neiman Marcus Award for Distinguished
Service in the Field of Fashion, 20 years after her father was
similarly honored.
</P>
<P>
   When she was not designing or plotting acquisitions, Ms.
Ferragamo served on the board of the Italian Environmental Fund,
which protects historic Italian houses. She loved entertaining in
her home and shopping for the home even more. She adored nights at
the opera. A regular visitor with her husband, Giuseppe di San
Giuliano, to the Salzburg Festival, she would not miss a night of
the Maggio Musicale season in Italy directed by Zubin Mehta, a
frequent guest in her home.
</P>
<P>
   An ear for music was augmented with a nose for marmalade, as Ms.
Ferragamo developed her own recipe for the orange jam, which is
sold by the jar in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband, her mother, and her brother, she is
survived by a son, Diego; two daughters, Giulia and Maria; two
other brothers, Leonardo and Massimo; a sister, Fulvia Visconti
Ferragamo, all of Florence; and another sister, Giovanna Gentile
Ferragamo, of Milan. All are officers of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferragamo's successor at the company has not been named,
said Ferruccio Ferragamo. A team of designers that reported to her
will continue to design the line.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferragamo pursued her passions to the last. On a typical
shopping jaunt in New York in May, she was unstoppable. ``We did
Banana Republic, always Saks, Gracious Home was like a candy store
to her,'' said Helen O'Hagan, a friend and former Saks executive.
``Here she is _ I'm falling on my face _ straight out of chemo. We
went to one of those antique shows at the pier and she would be
there in four-inch heels and ahead of the pack.''

PENSION-FUND LOSSES RAISE QUESTIONS ON RISKY CHOICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' employee pension fund, one of the most
aggressive in the country for investing in stocks, lost a record
$2.3 billion when the market deflated in August, more than erasing
its gains for the year, records show.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic drop has triggered discussion among the fund's
board members and the two candidates seeking to replace outgoing
Treasurer Joseph D. Malone, who oversees the fund, over whether the
now-$21.2 billion retirement account should take a more
conservative investment approach.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of August, one of the most tumultuous months for the
stock market, the state fund lost nearly 10 percent of its value,
falling from $23.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Although the size of the monthly loss would appear to be
alarming, analysts say investors should focus on long-term _ not
short-term _ results, which have been healthy. Moreover, the state
is hardly alone as the stock market in the last two months has made
victims of the most sophisticated investors.
</P>
<P>
   The state fund's loss, on a percentage basis, was smaller than
that of the Standard &AMP; Poor's Index of 500 stocks as well as those
of similar-sized public investment funds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the substantial losses have done nothing to curb
the appetite of the fund's directors for equity investments, which
account for nearly all the recent losses. The Public Retirement
Investment Trust Board overwhelmingly decided last week to continue
investing heavily in stocks, which make up more than 50 percent of
the fund's allocation. The state pension fund ranks among the top
public investment funds in the country for its heavy reliance on
stocks, both foreign and domestic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost unanimous among the board members that the asset
allocation is an allocation that we should stay the course with,
recognizing that under a market such as the one in recent months,
that our losses would be greater than a more conservative
portfolio,'' said PRIT board member Ralph White, who is also
president of the Retired State, County &AMP; Municipal Employees
Association of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the directors point out the modest stock market
bounceback in September has already helped the fund recover some of
its July and August losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through this before and over a period of time it's
been proven our approach is the right approach for the PRIT fund,''
said White. ``There will be no change.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fund has never taken such a teeth-shattering punch. Even
during the stock market crash of October 1987, the pension fund
lost about 3 percent of its value, which was quickly recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio's worst setback so far this year was in the risky
emerging markets _ affected by the economic crises in Russia, Asia,
and Latin America. About $613 million of public workers' retirement
money is invested in that segment of the fund, which lost a
stunning 34 percent in 1998 as of Aug. 31, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly $9.1 billion _ the largest concentration of money in the
portfolio _ is invested in domestic stocks, which lost 6 percent
for the year as of the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate and alternative investments were the only bright
spots in the portfolio, averaging about a 10 percent return so far
this year. Fixed income, the most conservative branch of the
portfolio with about $6 billion invested in it, gained 4.3 percent.
And international stocks gained just 1.2 percent during the first
eight months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   None of those gains were enough to make up for the problems in
emerging markets and domestic stocks.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the fund is down 1.44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's one-year performance was a disappointing 2.2 percent.
But the five-year return, considered a more valuable measure by the
industry, was 12.05 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Fehrnstrom, a spokesman for the treasurer, defended the
aggressiveness of the fund, saying a longer-term strategy is
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the increase in our exposure to equities that has helped
us build up the assets in the fund,`` Fehrnstrom said. ``When we
arrived (in 1991) the fund was inappropriately weighted toward
fixed income securities and we changed that... But we don't make
longterm investment decisions based on short-term developments.
Already in September there has been a partial recovery of the
losses for July and August.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first two quarters of the year _ before the tumultuous
summer on Wall Street _ the fund was up 11.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the sudden jolt at the fund has set the two candidates for
treasurer debating the best approach for handling the retirement
account for state and public workers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Shannon O'Brien, a former legislator, would take a more
conservative approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shannon knows that their current equity position is among the
most aggressive for public plans in the country. And Shannon also
knows that controlling risk is vitally important when you're
managing employee pension plans,'' said Michael Travaglini,
O'Brien's campaign manager. ``But clearly the amount of risk that
(the board) has been willing to take on is something Shannon is
going to look very strongly at.''
</P>
<P>
   Her Republican rival, Bob Maginn, an executive at the consulting
firm Bain &AMP; Co., said he would increase pension investments in
private equities _ such as leveraged buyout funds _ which tend to
have higher returns with lower volatility.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the stop-loss measures should be reviewed so that
some investments can be sold before they lose a significant amount
of value.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think it would be a big mistake in the long term to
become afraid of investing in equities,'' Maginn said. ``The type
of investing that was done in the '80s that was unsophisticated and
earning us low returns, if Shannon takes us back to the (former
treasurer) Bob Crane era of putting money in banks ... I would be
strongly against that.''

LIVENT SAYS SUIT BY DRABINSKY ADDS TO WOES OF SHAREHOLDERS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Livent Inc., the Broadway theater producer, is
arguing in a Canadian court that a lawsuit filed by its founder
threatens to prolong the pain of the company's shareholders who
have been unable to trade their shares since early August because
of an accounting investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Webster, Livent's executive vice president, says that if
Garth Drabinsky, the founder, who is under suspension from his
executive role at Livent, succeeds in stopping the investigation,
by KPMG Canada, it may be many weeks before the company can provide
more information on the extent of its accounting problems.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Canadian stock exchange officials suspended trading of
Livent shares on Aug. 10, saying the company must provide more
information on what Livent has described as millions of dollars of
``irregularities.'' The company suspended Drabinsky and his
partner, Myron Gottlieb, upon discovery of the accounting
breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, who have been locked out of their executive
offices, say they have done nothing wrong. Drabinsky sued KPMG
Canada, a unit of the global accounting and consulting firm,
contending that it has a conflict of interest because for almost 20
years KPMG was Drabinsky's personal accounting firm, filing his
personal tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   But Webster said that KPMG's investigators had told Livent's
directors they did not believe their past work for Drabinsky harmed
their ability to investigate the company's accounts. KPMG has
called Drabinsky's lawsuit ``completely without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   In the affidavit filed on Friday in a provincial court in
Toronto, where Livent is based, Webster also provided new details
on how he discovered the irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Webster, a former KPMG partner hired by new management at Livent
in July, said he became ``greatly concerned'' as he was talking to
the company's accountants and trying to prepare the financial
results for the second quarter. The accountants were reluctant to
talk, Webster said, and ``somewhat evasive'' in answering his
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Some accountants then explained, Webster said, that Drabinsky
``was repeatedly instructing Livent accounting personnel not to
provide certain financial information to me and other members of
new management unless and until he had reviewed and approved it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 6, according to the affidavit, five accountants went to
Webster with additional financial information that ``cast doubt
upon the veracity and accuracy'' of Livent's financial books.
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, when Drabinsky was told about the discovery of
the accounting problems, Webster said that Drabinsky replied that
he was aware of the irregularities. But, by Webster's account,
Drabinsky then said he thought the company had fixed the problem
when it wrote down its assets by tens of millions of dollars in
late 1997 and early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Webster said, however, that those write-downs were not connected
to the irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Drabinsky's lawyer, L. David Roebuck, called
Webster's comments ``questionable.'' But he said he would not
respond in detail to the statements since the lawsuit had been
filed against KPMG and not against Webster or the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will deal with Webster's allegations,'' he said, ``at the
appropriate time and place.''

HEDGE-FUND DEBACLE SPOTLIGHTS SECRET FINANCIAL WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management has provided a
rare chance to pull back the curtain on John Meriwether's
cloistered financial brain trust.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has learned more about the black-box trading
strategies that Long-Term Capital's Nobel Prize-winning advisers
concocted. Traders have watched the fund expose its enormous
portfolio of financial instruments as it seeks to sell off
securities to pay creditors. Long-Term Capital's new owners have
had a look at the risk-management computers that produced such big
profits for Meriwether and his investors, year after year.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the veil, Meriwether appears a little less the wizard
that people once imagined, and the levers he pulled appear rather
ordinary. Awe has turned to sympathy, even disdain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they were brilliant guys or something, but they made
some very ordinary trades,'' said Jon Najarian of Mercury Trading
in Chicago. ``They made the same dumb mistakes everyone makes, only
with a lot more money at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the mark of the ultimate salesman had once been the
guy who could sell ice cubes to Eskimos, then Meriwether may well
be remembered as the trader who taught banks about loans. By the
tens of billions of dollars, the best and brightest financiers on
Wall Street underwrote Long-Term Capital's insatiable appetite for
securities that thousands of other fund managers, including many on
their own payroll, spotted and tried to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether is still in day-to-day control of Long-Term Capital
after a rescue effort by a consortium of big banks that is now
valued at $3.6 billion. His new banking partners have signed
pledges of confidentiality when they review his books, but details
are leaking out.
</P>
<P>
   Early indications are that though his financing was often
exotic, his trades were garden-variety. Long-Term Capital bet on
minor price differences between similar sorts of securities that
financial history suggested should not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Like many arbitragers, it gambled that troubled mergers would
eventually be completed as planned. Meriwether underwrote a form of
insurance to investors worried that the stock market would fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing exotic about the trades,'' said a Wall
Street executive close to the negotiations, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. The mystery, he said, was how Wall Street
agreed to lend so much money to a trader whose black box looked
much like their own. ``The question is simply why did we let this
happen. Why did the Street finance this guy to this extent?''
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital did produce stellar returns for investors who
put money in at the fund's inception, in 1994. From then until the
end of last year, every dollar invested would have grown to $2.82,
the kind of profit that would take a decade in the strongest bull
markets. Stocks, however, rarely lose 90 percent of their value in
bear markets, as Long-Term Capital did so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, given the end-of-August picture of Long-Term Capital's
trading portfolio, which put Meriwether's equity holdings at around
60 times his $2.2 billion in capital, the fund had access to a free
flow of bank credit that would make other fund managers salivate.
But some have been unimpressed that in its best years the fund
could coax 40 percent returns from leverage that amplified its
capital base several score or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the amount of money they had, 100-1 leverage, they could
have been doubling, tripling their money each year,'' said Andrew
Brenner, a director of Fimat USA, a New York trading firm.
``Where's the rocket science?''
</P>
<P>
   The rocket science, in turns out, was everywhere: Meriwether's
team was betting on all kinds of securities and on many different
markets, including some in which he had little or no known
expertise. What tied them together was that the emerging-market
turmoil sent securities plunging in tandem in August, knocking the
legs out from under the fund's highly leveraged positions.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Long-Term may have had trouble finding uses for its
capital, prompting it to explore unfamiliar trading terrain.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that surprised people looking at Meriwether's trades
was the degree to which he had recently delved into equity
arbitrage. His traditional specialty was bond arbitrage _ seeking
temporary price anomalies in the wide universe of government and
corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and other credit
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Long-Term Capital Management is said to have transformed
itself into one of the largest players in equity arbitrage on Wall
Street, investing as much as $1 billion in takeover stocks, as well
as derivatives tied to those investments. That may seem small
compared with the bets it made on bonds. But it is still surprising
that Long-Term Capital played the merger game at all, given its
bond specialization.
</P>
<P>
   Traders say Long-Term has been an active player in the risk
arbitrage market for at least two years, investing as early as
October 1996. ``They wanted to do size and they wanted to do it in
a rush,'' said one trader who asked not to be named. Currently the
hedge fund has liquidated almost all of its equity arbitrage
positions, in part because they were forced to get rid of the most
liquid investment to raise cash quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Many were abandoned at an inopportune time. For example, the
hedge fund sold shares in MCI Communications the week after Labor
Day, only days before its deal with Worldcom was consummated,
sending its share price higher. Last week, Long-Term Capital was
thought to be behind a large-scale dumping of stock in American
Stores Co., bailing out before it completes a planned merger with
Albertson's.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term also took a beating, traders say, on its investment in
telecommunications equipment maker Ciena Corp., which was expected
to be acquired by Tellabs Inc. Traders say the hedge fund owned as
much as 2 million shares of Ciena and lost millions when they,
along with other investors, watched those shares fall from a high
of $92 in July to $13 the day the deal was scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term also became a leading seller of a kind of option,
which is effectively an insurance against unusual swings in stock
prices. Through these options, Long-Term assumed the risk of
investors who feared that their stock portfolio, swollen by years
of strong gains, would fall victim to sharp falls in prices. The
business is a great one in a bull market and a potentially
devastating one when stocks turn south, as they did in August.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the biggest undoing at Long-Term Capital was in its
core area of competence, bond ``convergence.'' In bets made on
Danish mortgages, British interest rates, Italian bonds and U.S.
mortgage-backed securities, Long-Term Capital was the 800-pound
gorilla, buying tens of billions of dollars' worth of underpriced
bonds in hopes that they would return to a more historical trading
range.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it sold short government bonds, like those of the
United States and Germany, against which it predicted rises in the
prices of other bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Both those bets backfired, near fatally for Long-Term, when
emerging market turmoil pushed credit spreads everywhere to
historic extremes, a trend that has not yet shown signs of
reversing. Many other investors had the same trades, but Long-Term
Capital had more leverage than most.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a tremendous miscalculation _ betting on convergence
when the world was watching historic divergence,'' one trader said.
``But while many people made that mistake, they did not owe the
banks as much money as Meriwether did. That was fatal.''

 &HT;    Nationwide Insurance accused of discrimination
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Nationwide Insurance, the country's
fourth-largest insurance company, has illegally discriminated
against some Texans based on their race, ethnicity and age,
according to a state regulator who on Tuesday recommended a record
$10 million fine against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, which denied the allegations, sells auto, homeowners
and other insurance in the Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, San
Antonio and Waco-Temple areas. Last year, the Texas Department of
Insurance, prompted by lawmakers and an independent report on
insurance marketing, began investigating Nationwide's sales in all
of its markets except the Waco-Temple area, where offices only
recently were opened.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Haley, an attorney for the department, on Tuesday told
Insurance Commissioner Elton Bomer that the Nationwide
investigation revealed that the company has denied auto insurance
to some Texans based solely on their age. He also said the company
has used a marketing strategy that ``systematically exclude(s)
minority customers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Haley, Nationwide, based in Columbus, Ohio, limits
the areas in which its agents can solicit business based on the
location of its offices. ``The effect of this market strategy is to
steer Nationwide agents away from sales in ZIP code areas where the
population consists predominantly of racial minorities ,'' Haley
said. ``The pattern is consistent in every Texas market where
Nationwide has made its products available.'' Haley did not provide
specifics. A check of Nationwide's Austin-area offices shows all
its Austin offices are west of Interstate 35. Most of the city's
predominantly minority neighborhoods are east of the interstate.
The company also has an office in Round Rock and one near
Pflugerville. Bob Sohovich, an Ohio-based spokesman for Nationwide,
said that before the state's investigation, the company began a new
effort to solicit business in urban areas of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not violated any Texas law,'' Sohovich said. ``We are
not ignoring the issue. We want to serve every section of the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Sohovich added that Nationwide insurance can be purchased over
the telephone and is not limited to direct, agent sales. He said he
did not know whether agents' sales efforts were limited by
territory and could not find out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As of Dec. 31, Nationwide and its various companies covered 2.6
percent of the insured homes in Texas and about 2.7 percent of the
insured cars. That made the company the state's sixth-largest home
insurer and seventh-largest auto insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1993 state law, specifics about the insurance department
investigation are not public information. For that reason, the
department would not disclose in which ZIP codes it believes
Nationwide has discriminated against residents, the disparity
between the amount of coverage sold in non-minority areas vs. the
number of policies sold in minority-dominated areas or how long it
believes Nationwide has used a marketing strategy that results in
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Haley never used the term redlining, an illegal practice of
denying coverage based only on such things as race, ethnicity,
income and where a person lives. Allegations of redlining would
have to include proof that a company intended to deny coverage to
certain people. Allegations of discrimination can be proved
regardless of intent.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance department spokesman Jim Davis said there are limited
circumstances in which such things as income and where a person
lives can legally be used to determine coverage. The department's
allegations against Nationwide do not fall under those
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Johns, head of the Southwestern Insurance Information
Service, an industry group, said he doesn't believe Nationwide or
any other Texas insurer uses redlining or discriminatory practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We flatly reject any allegations that we practice unfair
discrimination in the sale of our products,'' he said on behalf of
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to recommending a $10 million fine, Haley told Bomer
that he should consider modifying the fine if Nationwide could
prove it was spending money that directly resulted in more policies
being sold in the areas where discrimination has been alleged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of this action is to induce Nationwide to open its
business to everyone in the local markets where it does business,''
he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Birny Birnbaum, an insurance data analyst for the
Center for Economic Justice, said the department's action proves
there is redlining going on in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum has been fighting for access to insurers' marketing
reports that he said would lend more proof to such allegations.
Industry officials have fought the release of the information,
saying it would negatively affect competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious why the insurers don't want it to be available,''
Birnbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   The department's investigation, and calls for action from state
lawmakers, came after the center last year released a report on
redlining using information similar to that for which Birnbaum has
been fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials said they worked on the Nationwide case for
nearly a year and are negotiating for a settlement with the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide has 20 days to formally reply to Haley's letter to
Bomer. If a settlement is not reached, the allegations would be
considered by a state administrative judge before Bomer could levy
a fine or take some other action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope the commissioner acts quickly to stop Nationwide from
these discriminatory actions,'' Birnbaum said. The department also
has investigated five other companies. Action against two is
pending in the department's legal department. A seventh
investigation is ongoing.

 &HT;    Court moves to open its own records
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Facing the court of public opinion, the Texas
Supreme Court issued proposed rules Tuesday that the chief justice
says would open virtually all administrative records kept by state
courts.
</P>
<P>
   The draft rules _ to be reviewed next week in a public hearing
at the Supreme Court _ would open the judges' telephone records for
public inspection, Chief Justice Tom Phillips said. Last year the
court overruled an opinion by Attorney General Dan Morales that
would have required release of telephone records.
</P>
<P>
   The rules would subject to public scrutiny travel and expense
records, visitor logs and judges' personal and business appointment
calendars, for example. The rules would not change access to court
files, which generally are open, but would prevent release of draft
opinions and internal memos on court rules and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said the proposed rules follow a national trend to
bring courts under open records provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most freedom of information acts excluded the judiciary,
dealing instead with those branches of government that taxed and
spent your money,'' he said. ``There's been a movement in the past
10 years to include the judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules come at a time when the court continues to
feel the sting of criticism about its campaign fund-raising rules
that allow contributions from parties and lawyers who have cases
before the court. That practice supposedly has been a focus for
CBS' ``60 Minutes'' as the television news program scrutinizes the
court 10 years after its ``Justice for Sale'' investigation linking
court decisions to campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Borges, who as head of the court-monitoring Texas Watch
consumer-action program is one of the Supreme Court's most vocal
critics, called the proposed rules to open administrative records
``totally inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This court says it wants to move things along, but then it
crafts rules that basically are oriented toward officeholders
instead of the public,'' Borges said.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he criticized the 14-day period that judges would
have to respond to open records requests _ instead of requiring
prompt release of records _ and lack of criminal sanctions when
records are wrongly denied.
</P>
<P>
   The issuance of the court's rules begins a four-month process to
refine them before they're put into effect. These rules follow
criticism from state legislators after the court's decision last
year that Morales was wrong in deciding that Supreme Court
telephone records kept by the General Services Commission would not
fall under the judiciary exception to the state's open records act.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules roughly follow suggestions drafted by the
Texas Judicial Council earlier this year at the court's request.
</P>
<P>
   The judicial council, headed by Phillips, includes judges and
other state officials as well as public members outside the legal
profession.
</P>
<P>
   One significant difference is that the Supreme Court dropped a
Judicial Council prohibition against releasing a judge's off-work
appointments. The court proposed that future appointments be
excluded from public release, but not past appointments _ whether
the judge was on his or her own time or not.
</P>
<P>
   Borges called the draft rules a ``double standard'' that
excludes judges from the toothier open- records law applicable to
the rest of state government. ``They're no different from any other
state officials who spend state or county tax money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, the court is saying, 'Don't bother us. We'll
decide whether we're doing our jobs.' ``
</P>
<P>
   But Phillips said the courts should not fall under a legislative
act for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's appropriate for the judicial branch to go
to the executive for rulings,'' he said, referring to the attorney
general's function to interpret open-records disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed rules, a judge's denial of a records request
would be subject to an appeal to a committee of presiding judges.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said those presiding judges _ appointed by the governor
_ provided independence from the rest of the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   A decision by them would not be appealable under the rules _
even if it went against the Supreme Court, he said _ although
someone requesting information might also sue to open court
records.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with that, the chief justice said, would be the
possibility that an action to command the Supreme Court's release
of records would have to be decided by _ the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the same problem you would face under the
open-records act,'' Phillips said.
</P>

SPRINGBOARD MADE OF OAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)(SLANG) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ The 30th Oak Tree Racing Association season
starts small this afternoon with the $100,000 Autumn Days Handicap
sprint on Santa Anita's hillside turf course.
</P>
<P>
   But in the weekends ahead, the names, purses and implications
will grow large as the Oak Tree meet serves again as the West's
springboard to the seven Breeders' Cup races, to be held Nov. 7 at
Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   The first three weekends of the six-week meet are packed with
seven Breeders' Cup preps, six of which have produced Breeders' Cup
winners in that event's 15-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The $300,000 Oak Tree Turf Championship on Sunday is expected to
match five horses, including Bonapartiste and River Bay, two of the
leading U.S. candidates for the Breeders' Cup turf.
</P>
<P>
   The $500,000 Goodwood Handicap on Oct. 17, its purse doubled
since last year, might attract Silver Charm, the 1997 Kentucky
Derby winner, and Free House, this summer's Pacific Classic winner.
Silver Charm could go to the Oct. 16 Meadowlands Cup in New Jersey
instead, and Free House could wait for the Oct. 31 California Cup
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The $200,000 Oak Leaf Stakes for 2-year-old fillies on Oct. 10
and the $200,000 Norfolk Stakes for 2-year-olds on Oct. 11 are the
logical spots for Bob Baffert-trained Excellent Meeting and Worldly
Ways, early favorites for the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and
the Breeders' Cup Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   Other Oak Tree races with a historical link to the Breeders'
Cup: the $175,000 Lady's Secret Handicap for fillies and mares on
Oct. 11; the $150,000 Ancient Title Handicap sprint on Oct. 17, and
the $250,000 Oak Tree Mile on turf on Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Horses who came out of Oak Tree have won races on 10 of the 15
Breeders' Cup cards and have competed in 96 of the 105 Breeders'
Cup races. But there's more to Oak Tree than Breeders' Cup preps.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-day season marks the return of major-league thoroughbred
racing to Los Angeles County after 2{ months at Del Mar and little
Fairplex Park in Pomona.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Oak Tree's biggest events come too late in the season to
have anything to do with the Breeders' Cup: the 10 Cal Cup races on
Oct. 31 and the $500,000 Yellow Ribbon Stakes for turf fillies and
mares on Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The sentimental story of the meet could be the comeback of 1996
Santa Anita Derby winner Cavonnier two years after beginning
treatment for a tendon injury. He worked 5 furlongs in 58 2/5
seconds Tuesday, is looking for a return race this week and is
pointing for the Cal Cup Mile.
</P>
<P>
   And for fans who prefer big money to big names, Oak Tree is
guaranteeing a $2 million pool for the pick-six on Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   OAK TREE AT A GLANCE &QC;

JUDGE FINDS COLISEUM SAFE FOR ISLANDERS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. _ Ending, at least for now, a bitter battle
between the Nassau County Executive and the New York Islanders, a
state judge declared Tuesday that Nassau County Veterans Memorial
Coliseum was safe and that the Islanders must play all their
scheduled home and exhibition games at the arena.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling in state Supreme Court, Justice Burton S. Joseph
noted that engineers hired by the National Hockey League had found
the 26-year-old arena to be safe, and he said that ``any breach of
the team's agreement to play its games at the Coliseum would cause
Nassau County irreparable harm.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 10, contending that Nassau Coliseum was unsafe to play
hockey in, the Islanders moved out of the arena, packing their
office files, furniture and some memorabilia into a convoy of vans.
The team vowed to play its home games at an assortment of arenas
off Long Island, citing concerns that the hoist system for the
22,000-pound scoreboard and sound system posed a safety risk.
</P>
<P>
   Although Joseph urged both sides Tuesday to settle their
differences, his decision amounts to a stinging defeat for the
Islanders, who had filed a federal lawsuit seeking to break their
lease after moving out of the arena, and a victory for County
Executive Thomas S. Gulotta.
</P>
<P>
   Gulotta, who came to the courthouse to hear the ruling, said he
was ``very pleased'' by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the ruling dealt with the question of whether the
Coliseum is safe, the overriding issue that separates the team and
the county is who will pay for a new arena, which both county
officials and the owners of the team agree is necessary. After the
ruling, Gulotta urged the owners of the Islanders, Howard Milstein
and Steven Gluckstern, to return to the bargaining table so that
negotiations on plans for a new arena could be put ``on the fast
track.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have directed Mort Certilman, Nassau County's negotiator,''
Gulotta said, ``to resume with all due haste, planning for a new
multifaceted sports complex to meet the future needs of the
Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   David Seldin, the president of New York Sports Ventures, which
owns the Islanders, Tuesday called the ruling a tie and said the
team would abide by the judge's ruling. He said that the next
scheduled exhibition game, on Sunday against the Washington
Capitals, would be played at the Coliseum and that, to entice fans
back to the arena, tickets to the game would be free for season
subscribers and $10 for any seat for all other fans. An exhibition
game scheduled for Sept. 25 against the New Jersey Devils was
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Seldin said he was also prepared to return to the bargaining
table if Gulotta's offer was ``in good faith.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The comments on both sides of the issue were quite measured in
comparison with those of the last few weeks. At one point, the
Islanders accused Gulotta and other county officials of ``using the
tactics of felons'' to ``cover up the truth'' about safety issues
at the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Gulotta in turn, described the team as ``a pig at the trough,''
and accused the team's owners of using the safety issue as a ruse
to obtain financial gain at the bargaining table in plans for a new
arena.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan proposed by Gulotta, a new arena would sit at the
center of a new transportation, business and commercial hub in the
heart of Nassau County. The old Coliseum would become a convention
center. A new hotel and shops would be added to the new complex,
which would be linked by a new transportation system to nearby
colleges and universities, shopping centers, commercial buildings
and shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
   Financing for the project remains elusive. Although the state
has promised $30 million to help build a new arena, county
taxpayers are reluctant to help pay for it. Gulotta had said he
would prefer that funds come from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Seldin said Tuesday's ruling supported some of the team's
contentions. He noted that the judge said the engineers hired by
the league to inspect the Coliseum had given the court a list of
seven items that required maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous safety problems, including the hoist system, he said,
have already been repaired by the county and by the Spectacor
Management Group, the company that manages the Coliseum for the
county, since a series of legal actions were initiated by both the
Islanders and the county earlier this month.

PETTITTE WORKS THROUGH SEASON OF STRUGGLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By KATHY KUDRAVI 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although Andy Pettitte struggled all year, including
an un-Pettitte like 1-3 September, New York Yankees manager Joe
Torre had no qualms about starting him in today's Game 2 of the
Division Series against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stuff is as good now as it has been this season,'' Torre
said. ``I think a common thread (in Pettitte's struggles) has been
his striving for perfection, and he's not satisfied with what he
sees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A perfect game is probably the only way he'll be satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing the Rangers once this season, Pettitte gave up seven hits
in a 6-4 victory Aug. 14 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte tried working through his problems by focusing on one
part of his pitching in each start. But work with the Yankees
coaches helped rebuild Pettitte's confidence to the point that his
relief appearance against Tampa Bay on Sept. 25 was comfortable for
the left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I am a perfectionist, and that's one of my faults,''
said Pettitte, who is from Deer Park. ``I've been up here four
years and really haven't struggled until now. But I don't get down
on myself; it's not me.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible explanation for Pettitte's struggles this season
could be that he has been buzzed by several balls hit right back at
him. ``It's more mental than anything,'' he said. ``Every time the
ball comes, you flinch more, and it can definitely affect you. I
didn't feel like it was, but maybe I was trying to finish in a
better fielding position.''

FROM THE BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS, `CEREALECTIBLES'  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Mass.)   (af)  
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the days when Roy Rogers cantered down happy trails and Howdy
Doody was the national timekeeper for the 10-and-under set, what
commanded attention around the breakfast table was what was in the
brightly colored cardboard box: sugary, crunchy cereal that could
be drowned in milk, crowned with fruit or aimed in the direction of
an annoying brother or sister.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is the box that is commanding attention on the nostalgia
market. Brightly-colored cereal boxes that cost 29 cents with the
cereal inside sell for $200 or $300 in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bruce calls these artifacts of post-World War II America
``cerealectibles.'' He has been measuring, dating and cataloguing
them for the last several years and has just published the second
volume of a planned trilogy, ``Cereal Boxes and Prizes: 1960's''
(Flake World Publishing).
</P>
<P>
   He is also exploring the idea of building a home for his
collection of thousands of boxes. What he has in mind is a cereal
museum in Florida, near Disney World or Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder. ``The cerealectibles market is largely character
driven,'' he said. ``The more popular the featured 'toon, athlete
or critter, the higher the price the item will command when sold or
traded.''
</P>
<P>
   So a box of Kellogg's OK's from 1961 with Yogi Bear flexing his
muscles is worth $150 to $300, and a ``Happy Birthday Yogi'' box of
Kellogg's Corn Flakes from 1962 is worth $200 to $500. A box of
Post Pebbles from 1969 with Fred Flintstone is worth as much as
$175.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the plainer 1950s, cereal marketing was clearly tied to
Madison Avenue hucksterism. ``Kids! Wear the Sign of Superman!''
screamed a box of Kellogg's Corn Flakes from 1955 that carried a
mail-in coupon for the ``Superman Official Belt and Buckle.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce said that the cereal box was worth $250 and the red-vinyl
belt, which originally cost 25 cents, $200.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce takes note of brands that have long since been forgotten,
like Post Sugar Cornfetti, now valued at $125. He also turned up
reminders of the Cold War: Cheerios offered a model of an atomic
submarine (``actually shoots torpedoes'') for 50 cents in 1958.
That box is now worth $50, Bruce said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheerios was also packaged in a box that could be cut and folded
into a model of an airport with an ``airport missile station,'' a
cluster of little plastic rockets around a radar dish. Bruce said
the complete installation was worth $300.
</P>
<P>
   Before Bruce, 44, became `` Cereal Box'' he was `` Lunch Box.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, he was, as he put it, ``an official artist'' _ a
sculptor running a gallery in Boston. He was also bored. ``My job
was becoming more and more administrative, writing grants for more
whining artists,'' he recalled. ``I said, `Enough.' I knew nothing
about collectibles but didn't think you had to be rocket scientist
to thrive in that field, so I decided to create a collectibles
craze.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent six months rummaging through flea markets, garage sales
and antique shows. ``I knew I had to come up with a commodity that
reflected the electronic landscape of my generation, the TV
shows,'' he said. And then he found a Jetsons lunch box in a thrift
shop in Cambridge, Mass., and soon he was crisscrossing the
country, becoming the Nelson Bunker Hunt of lunch box collectors.
</P>
<P>
   He began writing two books. ``By the time they came out I had
amassed this huge collection, and lo and behold I caught a wave and
lunch boxes became one of the defining collectibles if not the
defining collectibles of the '80s.''
</P>
<P>
   But he decided to cash out. He even sold the words `` Lunch
Box'' to an electrician in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that out of a generation of 80 million boomers,
fewer than 25 percent carried lunch boxes. The rest were brown
baggers. I was looking for something that had more universal
appeal. I realized the real mother lode of nostalgia was the
breakfast table. Every child in America had breakfast, read the
back of a cereal box and dreamed about sending away for this or
that toy. I thought if I could tap into that, I really would be
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no market, he said, ``just a handful of passionate
collectors.'' Cereal companies had little interest in packaging or
in hiring archivists. He went to what he calls ``the cereal
cities'' _ Battle Creek, Mich. (where Kellogg's offered tours of
its corn-flake factory until the mid-1980s); Niagara Falls (where
Nabisco made Shredded Wheat); Buffalo (where General Mills packaged
a variety of cereals for the Northeast); Memphis (where Kellogg's
did the same for the South); Lancaster, Pa. (where Kellogg's and
Quaker had factories); Cedar Rapids, Iowa (where Quaker made Cap'n
Crunch, among other cereals), and St. Louis (the home of Ralston
Purina). He advertised in local newspapers, offering to buy old
cereal boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The process was something of an education for Bruce, who was not
a big cereal eater as a child. His own children appear to be
following in his footsteps. When he interviewed Thurl Ravenscroft,
the deep voice of Tony the Tiger since the 1950s, he asked
Ravenscroft to tape a gr-r-r-eat big hello to Bruce's 7-year-old
son Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   Ravenscroft obliged. Bruce went home and hit the play buttom.
``Nicholas looked at me and said, `Who's Tony the Tiger?' ''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Priceline.com, the Internet buying service that tries to book
flights for travelers at prices they propose, is planning to do the
same thing with hotels starting next month.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jay Walker, vice chairman of the company, rooms
will be offered by late October at more than 1,000 hotels in 26
cities nationwide, including Dallas, Houston, New York, Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Denver, Seattle, Boston and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to add more U.S. cities later this year and
international destinations next year. Walker would not name the
participating hotels but said all would be major chain properties.
</P>
<P>
   The process will be similar to the way Priceline books airline
seats. Using the company's World Wide Web site (www.priceline.com),
travelers will select a city and a geographical zone within it,
travel dates, the amount of money they are willing to pay and a
minimum category of hotel desired. The categories, from two-star to
five-star, will be described on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The company's computer will scan its database in an attempt to
find a hotel that will accept the named price; the request will be
accepted or rejected within an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers are guaranteed the minimum category of room chosen; in
turn they must take the hotel assigned. They will not know the
specific hotel (or its location, except for the broad geographical
zone) until the reservations are confirmed and paid for, Walker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations will be accepted up to a year in advance but not
within 48 hours of arrival. There will be no fee to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline, based in Stamford, Conn., has sold more than 60,000
economy-class airline seats, most of them domestic, since it
introduced that service in April, according to Walker. Critics have
asserted that most major domestic airlines do not participate in
the program; Brian Ek, a company spokesman, responded, ``We're
offering tickets through major airlines, but we cannot say what
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Passengers must be willing to travel anytime between 6 a.m. and
10 p.m. and make one stopover; they cannot choose their airline,
and they earn no frequent-flier points.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline, which recently added a car-buying service in the New
York area, received a patent last month for its method and use of
``buyer-driven commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   New Swiss Airline
</P>
<P>
   A new airline, Swiss World Airways, began service earlier this
month between Newark, N.J., and Geneva, with flights every day
except Wednesday. The president and chief executive of the company
is Peter Leishman, who formerly helped found two British low-fare
start-ups, Debonair and Easyjet.
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva-based airline received approval from the Department
of Transportation only a few days before it started flying,
according to Leishman, and it is only now getting its flights into
the computer reservations systems used by travel agents. Swiss
World Airways' Boeing 767 _ the airline currently has just one jet,
which it leases _ seats 159 passengers in three classes.
</P>
<P>
   One-way unrestricted fares range from $167 to $530 in economy
class, $667 to $1,000 in business class and $1,267 to $2,000 in
first class.
</P>
<P>
   The line offers a few unconventional twists. Food service
consists of mostly cold choices to avoid reheating, with only one
hot entree cooked on board. Travelers flying on discount fares pay
for food, drinks and headsets; full-fare travelers get them free.
The frequent-flier program consists of instant lottery-style
tickets offering a gift or a premium that applies to the next
flight.
</P>
<P>
   The line hopes to add a second flight to Geneva from New York in
November, via Basel, and service from Dulles International Airport
or Baltimore-Washington International Airport next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The toll-free worldwide reservations number is (011-800-11)
767-767.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle's New Boston Home
</P>
<P>
   The US Airways Shuttle is scheduled to move on Sunday from
Terminal A at Logan International Airport in Boston to the newly
renovated Terminal B. The new shuttle gates will be 10, 12 and 13
at the end of the concourse. Counters for ticketing and check-in
will be next to the security checkpoint at the entrance to the main
concourse and at the gates.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle offers 17 daily round-trip flights between Logan and
La Guardia Airport in New York, as well as 15 daily flights between
Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and La Guardia.
</P>
<P>
   Train to the Plane
</P>
<P>
   A rail link in Denmark from Copenhagen International Airport to
the Central Railway Station downtown opened Sunday. The seven-mile
trip takes 11 minutes and costs $2.60, compared with a taxi fare of
around $20. The train terminal is underneath the airport's
departure and arrival halls.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Update
</P>
<P>
   Two new hotels on the hip side are scheduled to open Thursday,
one in Chicago and one in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Blues Hotel, a Loews Hotel, at the Marina City
riverfront complex in Chicago, is the first in a series planned by
House of Blues Hospitality. The 367 guest rooms will offer in-room
faxes, CD players, videocassette recorders, voice mail and two-line
phones, as well as direct Internet access via TV sets.
</P>
<P>
   Meetings and other events can be arranged in the House of Blues
Music Hall and Restaurant next door; the complex also has a 36-lane
bowling center and a health club.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Denver, the 189-room Hotel Monaco is situated at
1717 Champa St. in two renovated adjoining buildings, the 1917
Railway Exchange Building and the 1937 Art Moderne Title Building.
Rooms will have CD players and two-line phones with data ports. The
hotel is part of the Kimpton Hotel and Restaurant Group.

BROWN STANDS TALL IN PADRES WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ And you thought Kevin Brown was too boring to do
impersonations.
</P>
<P>
   Giving his best Randy Johnson imitation against none other than
baseball's reigning strikeout king, the stoic-but-spectacular Brown
suffocated the National League's most potent offense in a
16-strikeout, two-hit masterpiece that led the Padres to a 2-1
victory against the Astros at the Astrodome yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was as dominant as a pitcher can be without throwing a
no-hitter,'' said Astros manager Larry Dierker, whose team set
franchise records for runs and home runs in a 102-win regular
season but now trails the best-of-five Division Series 1-0 with
Game 2 set for tomorrow. ``When our team gives up only two runs, 90
percent of the time we're going to win. But Kevin was so good, he
put us in the other 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyritz produced a bases-loaded sacrifice fly in the fifth
inning and Greg Vaughn drilled a solo homer in the eighth for the
Padres, but Brown was essentially a one-man show.
</P>
<P>
   With a sailing 95-mph fastball to complement his 88-mph sinker,
Brown approached a postseason record with his career-high 16
strikeouts. His Astro-nomical performance included striking out
every Houston batter at least once, allowing only two runners to
reach third base, only four balls out of the infield, and
handcuffing Houston's star quartet of Craig Biggio, Jeff Bagwell,
Derek Bell and Moises Alou into 0-for-11 with eight strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   In the history of baseball postseason, only Bob Gibson's
17-strikeout game in the 1968 World Series topped Brown's total.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I had great stuff, but it must have been moving
pretty good,'' said Brown, who threw 118 pitches (77 strikes) on
three days' rest. ``Obviously, going against Randy, I needed
something special and I thought that was pretty good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Only when Brown left the game for fellow Cy Young Award
candidate Trevor Hoffman after the eighth did the Astros have a
prayer. Bill Spiers doubled and _ after outs by Bell and Bagwell _
scored on Ken Caminiti's throwing error, which was forced by Alou's
infield single to make it 2-1 in the ninth. Hoffman, however,
fought back from a 3-0 count to get Carl Everett to fly out to
center field to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres improved to 86-0 this season when leading after eight
innings and a remarkable 175-0 in that situation since July 24,
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who had been 5-0 at the dome with four shutouts with
the Astros, wasn't at his best, striking out nine but also allowing
nine hits.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, he threw a wicked, sidearm slider on the outside
corner to Tony Gwynn, who calmly poked it down the left-field line
for a leadoff double. After Vaughn's infield single and a
broken-bat bloop single by Caminiti loaded the bases, Leyritz
lofted a 2-2 fastball to the warning track to bring home Gwynn. In
the eighth, Vaughn smashed a 2-0 slider into the left-field seats
for insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brown got stronger as the game progressed, allowing
just two singles, both to No. 8 hitter Brad Ausmus, and striking
out five of the last seven Astros he faced. He was in danger only
twice.
</P>
<P>
   With Ausmus on third base in the third after a single and two
passed balls, Brown struck out Biggio on a high fastball. And in
the sixth, with runners on second and third and two out, he fanned
Bell on a nasty 2-2 sinker in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He defies the laws of gravity with some of those pitches,''
Johnson said. ``I didn't pitch that bad. But he was dialed in and
focused, just better than me today.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 30:
</P>
<P>
   The decisions by the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Henry
Hyde, to insure greater fairness and openness in the examination of
evidence in the Monica Lewinsky affair are sound on the merits. But
they have a larger importance as encouraging signs that the debate
over President Clinton's future can be kept moving toward some
reasonably prompt resolution. Time magazine found that 35 percent
of its polling sample wanted Clinton out of office, 29 percent
favored censure and 34 percent favored no punishment. You do not
need a poll, however, to sense that citizens do not want this to
drag out indefinitely. Barring the emergence of explosive new
evidence, there is no reason that it should.
</P>
<P>
   This page advocates a negotiated settlement that would allow
Clinton to remain in office in exchange for a censure based on his
admission of lying under oath. We believe Hyde's handling of the
Judiciary Committee opens the way for gradual progress in that
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has decided that the committee will dispatch a bipartisan
team to comb Kenneth Starr's unreleased documents for material
favorable to Clinton. That will allow the Democrats a fair chance
to prove their charges that Starr used Linda Tripp to set a perjury
trap for Clinton. The exercise will also provide new information
that the public can use in assessing charges of prosecutorial
excess against Starr and his office. The Judiciary Committee should
ask Starr to come forward now with any information about
Whitewater, Webster Hubbell and other matters that he considers to
be potential grounds for impeachment. If he has no such evidence,
he should tell the committee and the country.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde assigned a subcommittee to look into the definition of an
impeachable offense, and decreed that the entire committee should
meet in open session next Monday to vote on whether to begin a full
impeachment inquiry. The House itself will vote next Wednesday on
the committee's recommendation. The Republican leadership would
like to let matters rest there until after the election. These
public debates, then, are of tremendous importance, for they give
the Democrats a chance to wield public pressure for bringing this
matter to a conclusion. The Republicans say they cannot be swayed,
but the polls that indicated growing disapproval of Congress have
clearly influenced Hyde and are creating doubts in the GOP caucus
about House Speaker Newt Gingrich's refusal to consider a deal.
</P>
<P>
   No one can chart a direct course to a plea bargain, but it is
possible to keep moving in that direction by avoiding congressional
gridlock and partisan warfare. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt
and Rep. Barney Frank are right that James Carville's paroxysm
strategy is hurting the president. ``It would be wrong for any
Democrat to forget that the president's mistakes are part of the
problem,'' said Frank, who is not timid about fighting Clinton's
corner when it serves a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But the smart move for Clinton's congressional supporters is to
reach out to Republican moderates like Rep. Lindsey Graham and to
support the efforts of senior figures outside Congress. The public
is ready for a deal built around a cluster of principles that
include electoral continuity, condemnation of Clinton's personal
behavior and recognition of his responsibility for breaking the law
and misleading the American people.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans know there is peril in ignoring the public
desire for closure. But Clinton's gains in the past week should not
induce him, his wife and their surrogates to adopt a war strategy
or to count on Starr's unpopularity as a life preserver. Another
wave of documents is coming tomorrow. There may be more disclosures
down the road. Come Oct. 9, many House Democrats are planning to
vote for the full impeachment inquiry. Any White House plan to
prolong matters or step up the sniping is self-destructive. Now
that they have had a chance to contemplate the seediness of
Clinton's behavior, most Americans do not agree with Sen. Trent
Lott that just ``bad conduct is enough, frankly, for impeachment.''
But that could change, very quickly. &QL;

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 30:
</P>
<P>
   By choosing to lower interest rates by only a small amount, the
Federal Reserve has opted for a gradual and measured response to
the growing problems affecting the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   The move, reducing the rate on loans between banks by a quarter
of a percentage point, to 5.25 percent, was welcome. But financial
markets were nonetheless disappointed, both by the amount of the
cut and because there is no indication that European central banks
will join in the effort to stimulate economic growth in the face of
the deflationary and recessionary winds blowing from Asia and
Russia. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 100 points in the
minutes after the decision was announced, and markets also fell
sharply in Latin America. But most markets later rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's caution may prove to have been too great, but the
central bank nonetheless is to be commended for acting at all.
While financial markets are clearly worried, the statistics still
show a strong domestic economy. The latest consumer confidence
figures from the Conference Board showed a growing number of people
worried that the economy will get worse within the next six months,
but that concern is not yet reflected in consumer spending figures.
</P>
<P>
   If there were a way to stimulate economic activity in part of
the world but not the rest, America would be the least appropriate
candidate for monetary stimulus. But central banks in developing
countries, where the need is greatest, are in no position to
stimulate growth because such actions would put further pressure on
already shaky currencies. It is central banks in the leading
countries that have the ability to act, and that is why pressure
grew on the Fed to ease credit.
</P>
<P>
   It was encouraging that Canada's central bank joined yesterday's
move, but regrettable that Germany's Bundesbank, in its final
months as the de facto European central bank, has been unwilling to
join in cutting. The Bundesbank is rightly proud of its reputation
as being vigilant against inflation, but inflation is not the
world's primary problem now.
</P>
<P>
   If the world economy does not turn around quickly, further rate
cuts, by the Fed and other central banks, may be needed before the
year is out.

Coleman's end spot real twist and Turner 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just when UCLA defensive end Travor Turner began
wondering if he'd ever crack the lineup, a starting job hit him in
the knee. To be more specific, a Houston Cougar hit Kenyon Coleman
in the knee, which sidelined Coleman for three weeks and gave
Turner the chance he thought would never come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing happened to me (at Westchester High School),''
Turner said. ``I didn't start until my junior year, so I was
prepared to have to wait. It's a test. It's a test of whether you
can keep your focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner's ascension to starting end _ he had seven tackles
against Houston after Coleman went down _ is a testament to keeping
focus in the weight room.
</P>
<P>
   As a prep senior, he carried 190 pounds on a 6-foot-4 frame. He
weighed 210 pounds upon arrival in Westwood. As a second-year
freshman, he was 220, and he played sparingly last season as a
235-pound sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he's 250 and proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think guys who were 245 pounds were so big,'' he
said, laughing. ``Now, I look at guys smaller than me, like
(receiver) Brian Poli-Dixon, and say, `Dang, I used to look like
that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Turner remains small for a defensive end. (UCLA's other starter,
Pete Holland, weighs 270.) But he's strong enough to maintain
leverage, and he hasn't lost the athleticism that enabled him to
high jump 6-9 at Westchester. What he lacks in size and strength,
he compensates for with quickness.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed Sack Master by his teammates, Turner is tied for the
team lead with three tackles-for-loss.
</P>
<P>
   __ Miami update: UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis spoke with
his Miami counterpart, Paul Dee, on Tuesday about rescheduling the
cancelled game. They made no decision and are expected to talk
again Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost wish this would get over with,'' Bruins coach Bob
Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   An informal survey of five UCLA players _ four of them seniors _
revealed indifference about playing Miami on Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   __ McNown note of the week: For those not keeping score at home,
UCLA quarterback Cade McNown has completed 72.7 percent of his
passes on first down, 56.5 percent on second down and 47 percent on
third down.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's outstanding,'' Toledo said. ``Anything over one-third
on third down is really good.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Wazu update: Incumbent Steve Birnbaum will start at
quarterback for Washington State on Saturday at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Price considered a change after Birnbaum, a junior,
completed 8 of 21 passes with two interceptions last week against
Cal. His passing efficiency rating (110.4) is eighth in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum and reserve Paul Mencke have not made Cougars fans
forget Ryan Leaf. Combined, they've thrown seven touchdowns and
seven interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   __ Message received: Benched after his lackluster performance
against Houston, sophomore cornerback Marques Anderson showed signs
of life in practice last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He responded to being demoted to second string, but I'm not
ready to get him involved as a starter,'' Toledo said. ``When he's
in the game, if he plays with more intensity, he may get his job
back.''

NEW YORK AND AMTRAK ANNOUNCE PLAN TO UPGRADE SERVICE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amtrak officials and Gov. George Pataki announced a
five-year plan on Tuesday to upgrade the line between New York City
and Albany and rebuild trains used on the route to shave at least
20 minutes off the trip, allowing riders to cover the distance in
less than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   When the work on the $185-million program is completed, trains
that now rarely exceed 90 miles per hour will cruise at 125 mph.
The plan also includes building a second track between Albany and
Schenectady and an upgrade of the track between Albany and Buffalo,
cutting as much as an hour off a trip between New York City and
Buffalo, which now takes more than seven and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
   The upgrade, which comes as Amtrak's ridership in New York state
is expected to reach its highest level in more than 15 years, is
expected to draw even more people to the train and away from cars
and planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two hours from New York to Albany is kind of like a magic
number,'' said Michael Fleischer, a spokesman for the state
Department of Transportation. ``When people realize that the trip
takes less than two hours, it's kind of a stumbling block you get
around.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip from New York City to the state capital now takes
between 2 hours and 20 minutes and 2 hours and 30 minutes. There is
one express train a day that makes the trip in 2 hours and 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak and the state will split the $140-million cost of
rebuilding seven Turboliner trains. The trains, to be rebuilt by
Super Steel Schenectady Inc., will have engines on both ends,
allowing them to change direction without turning around, which
should allow Amtrak to get two or three extra trips a day without
increasing the number of trains. The trains will also get bigger
seats, each with a hookup for a laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $45 million will be used to build a second track
between Albany and Schenectady and to realign other track and
straighten curves to allow trains to reach higher speeds. Overall,
about three-quarters of the state's funding for the project will
come from various federal sources.
</P>
<P>
   The upgrade is not expected to require a fare increase. The fare
from New York to Albany is $34 each way during the week and $41 on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Remington, a spokesman for Amtrak, said that the number of
riders on the railroad's New York state trains is growing at a much
faster rate than Amtrak ridership nationwide. Since last October,
ridership in New York state has increased by more than 10 percent,
to more than 97,000 riders a month. On a typical Friday, the
busiest day of the week, 3,900 riders take Amtrak on routes within
the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the present rate, service for the year would top 1.1 million
for the first time since at least 1983, the earliest year for which
Remington provided statistics. Ridership within New York state has
increased 53 percent since then.
</P>
<P>
   Remington attributed the boom to a strong economy, improved
on-time performance and more narrowly focused advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in New York state are looking for a different sort of
Amtrak service than someone who wants to take a leisurely ride from
Chicago out West,'' Remington said. ``Corridors like this are where
we can compete with the car and plane for business travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   Transportation planning advocates hailed Tuesday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using state capital dollars for mass transportation is a very
good thing, compared to where it usually goes, into roads,'' said
Jon Orcutt, the associate director of the Tri-State Transportation
Campaign, a watchdog group. ``It's the kind of transportation
investment that will help development in city centers along the
line, places like Buffalo, Syracuse and Albany. If you put millions
of dollars into highway lanes, you'd just be accelerating sprawl.''

MERRILL SAID TO CONSIDER BOND-UNIT LAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., which is considering layoffs
because of the recent turbulence in financial markets, may cut as
many as 15 percent, or about 350, of the more than 2,500 people it
employs in its bond businesses, officials at the firm who declined
to be identified said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill, like other big Wall Street firms, is reviewing its
costs because of the downturn in many financial businesses in the
last two months _ including the sales, trading and marketing of
bonds and of most emerging-markets securities.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected that any cuts would fall more on these areas
because they have seen such a drastic decline in business volume,
people at Merrill and other Wall Street firms said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No final decisions have been made,'' Bill Halldin, a spokesman
for Merrill Lynch, said in reply to questions about layoffs at the
firm and in specific businesses within it.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill, one of the biggest brokerage houses, employs about
60,000 people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill is expected to announce its results for the three months
ended Sept. 30 on Oct. 13. Wall Street analysts expect that it
might announce job cuts at that time.

TOM BRADLEY, FORMER LOS ANGELES MAYOR, DIES AT 80 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: SUBS 4th graf to CORRECT reference to Los Angeles.)  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas)  (lb) 
 By JANE FRITSCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Bradley, the sharecropper's son who became mayor of Los
Angeles and presided over the city for two decades of explosive
growth and change, died on Tuesday at the Kaiser Permanente Medical
Center in West Los Angeles. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack. Bradley had been in poor
health since March 20, 1996, when he had his first heart attack.
Two weeks later, after he had undergone cardiac bypass surgery, a
stroke left him partly paralyzed and unable to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was mayor from 1973 to 1993, an era during which Los
Angeles was transformed from a collection of suburban neighborhoods
to what Bradley liked to call a ``world-class city'' with
glittering skyscrapers, a dramatic new skyline and a vibrant
downtown. During the Bradley years, Los Angeles surpassed Chicago
to become the United States' second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   His election as the first black mayor of Los Angeles, which was
then the nation's third-largest city and largely white, reflected a
significant change in local politics in the United States. For most
of that time, Bradley was an immensely popular figure whose stately
bearing and placid demeanor seemed to reassure the residents of his
increasingly polyglot city.
</P>
<P>
   Soft-spoken and self-effacing, Bradley shunned some of the
perquisites that his stature and office might have brought him.
Calling it a foolish waste of money, he refused to use a cellular
telephone that was installed in his car, a former aide recalled.
Still, Bradley learned to move as easily in the society of the
fabulously wealthy as he did in the world of the poor and
disadvantaged from which he had come.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a lot of flash to him,'' said Dee Dee Myers, the
former White House press secretary, who worked for Bradley in the
1980s. ``Quiet determination was his hallmark. His enemies always
underestimated him, but at the end of the day he was always the
last one standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a long period of relative harmony in the city, Bradley's
tenure was marked at the beginning and at the end by racial strife.
</P>
<P>
   He first ran for mayor in 1969, when the Watts riots of four
years earlier were still an open wound in Los Angeles. He was
painted as a dangerous radical by the incumbent mayor, Sam Yorty,
and lost.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1973, Bradley had forged a powerful coalition of black
and white liberals and moderates, and soundly defeated Yorty to
become the city's first black mayor. That he did so at a time when
the black population of Los Angeles was only about 15 percent was a
testament to his broad appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1992, as Bradley was mulling over whether to run for a
sixth term, the city was roiled by three days of riots sparked by
the acquittal of four white police officers who had been charged
with the beating of an unarmed black motorist, Rodney King.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was deeply affected by the riots and, five months later,
announced that he would not run for mayor again. ``The April unrest
tore at my heart,'' he said, ``and I will not be at peace until we
have healed our wounds and rebuilt our neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most in Los Angeles, Bradley was taken by surprise by the
rioting. ``He never really understood it,'' a friend recalled. ``It
was a tragedy in his life that you can't overestimate. It was like
he was hit in the stomach with a two-by-four.''
</P>
<P>
   Since stepping down as mayor, Bradley was associated with the
Los Angeles office of Brobeck, Phleger &AMP; Harrison, a San Francisco
law firm that hoped to capitalize on his ties to Asia; Bradley had
vigorously courted businesses in Pacific Rim nations on behalf of
Los Angeles while he was mayor.
</P>
<P>
   After his stroke, his activities for the firm were severely
curtailed. Friends said he regained most of his mobility but never
regained his ability to speak. Even so, he maintained an active
social life, with a group of loyal friends sharing responsibility
for taking him to lunch and civic events each day. Some friends
read to Bradley regularly because, while his mind remained sharp,
he could no longer read or write, said Wendy Greuel, a former aide.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent lunch with former staff members, Bradley squinted
his delight at jokes about himself, his shoulders heaving with the
gaiety of the occasion, Ms. Greuel said
</P>
<P>
   ``His face would light up,'' said Ms. Myers, who had lunch with
Bradley last spring. ``He very rarely got discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   The second of seven children, Thomas Bradley was born on Dec.
29, 1917, on a cotton plantation in Calvert, Texas. His
grandparents were slaves, and his father, Lee Thomas Bradley, was a
sharecropper who abandoned the family not long after they moved to
Los Angeles, when Tom was 7.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Crenner Bradley, worked as a maid to support the
children. Young Tom earned money with a paper route, and later as a
publicity photographer for the comedian Jimmy Durante.
</P>
<P>
   During the toughest of those early years, the family was so poor
that Tom could not afford new shoes and socks. He lined his worn
shoes with cardboard and vowed that when he got a job he would have
an ample supply of socks, he once told an interviewer. ``They
became a symbol of my poverty,'' he said. ``When I was on the
police department, I can remember every sale that was held in
downtown Los Angeles, I always managed to stop by and stock up on
socks, it was like a security blanket. Then one day I noticed I had
about 200 pairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley entered the University of California at Los Angeles on a
track scholarship in 1937, but dropped out after his junior year to
join the Los Angeles Police Department, where he stayed for 21
years. In 1941, he married Ethel Mae Arnold, whom he had met at
church when they were teen-agers. They had three daughters, one of
whom died on the day she was born.
</P>
<P>
   While working as a police officer, he went to law school at
night and eventually earned a law degree from Southwestern
University. Meanwhile, he was working his way up from walking a
beat to the rank of lieutenant, the highest rank a black officer
had achieved at the time. But in 1961 he concluded that he could go
no higher, and quit the department.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for a time for a law firm, but his real interest was
politics, and in 1963 he ran for and won a seat on the Los Angeles
City Council, to which he was re-elected twice.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he made his first attempt to unseat Yorty, who
repeatedly raised the issue of race and asserted that Bradley was
appealing for votes to blacks and ``left-wing militants.'' At the
same time, some militant blacks denounced Bradley as a ``white
man's candidate'' and referred to him as ``Uncle Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley sought to play down race as an issue, but had little
success. ``I have no sympathy for lawlessness,'' he said, ``but
even less sympathy for injustice, poverty, unemployment and slum
housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, with the race issue receding and Yorty under
attack in personal and financial scandals, Bradley was elected to
his first term as mayor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nonconfrontational and intent on building coalitions, he set out
to revive the storefronts and small businesses that had been wiped
out during the Watts riots, and to successfully position Los
Angeles as the unofficial capital of the Pacific Rim for an era of
burgeoning trade.
</P>
<P>
   For years, as a new wave of Hispanic and Asian immigrants were
drawn to the city, both residential and commercial development went
virtually unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, with Los Angeles booming, Bradley tried the first of
two attempts to defeat the incumbent Republican, George Deukmejian,
for governor of California, but lost by less than one percentage
point.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley reached the height of his popularity when he brought the
Olympic Games to Los Angeles in 1984. Despite a boycott by most of
the communist countries, the Games went off without a hitch and
showed off the glittering city to the world.
</P>
<P>
   He had fought hard to bring the event to Los Angeles, but at the
same time he forced a tough agreement with the International
Olympic Committee to indemnify the city against any possible
financial losses. The Los Angeles games were the first privately
financed Olympics and it turned a huge profit.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation buoyed by the Olympics success, Bradley was
re-elected mayor in 1985 with 68 percent of the vote over John
Ferraro, a conservative City Council member, who got only 30
percent. ``Los Angeles is the city of hope and opportunity,''
Bradley said. ``I am a living example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   With his profile high, Bradley ran against Deukmejian again in
1986, but was soundly defeated and vowed that it was his last
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   During Bradley's five terms as mayor, Los Angeles International
Airport was renovated, the Port of Los Angeles became the biggest
and busiest in the country, the city's financial and business
district was revitalized and construction of a subway was begun.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually, the years of growth for which Bradley could
claim credit brought problems for which he was blamed. Pollution,
traffic jams and overdevelopment had become major issues for
Bradley in his later terms.
</P>
<P>
   A symbol of propriety and ethics, Bradley felt particularly
wounded in 1989 when newspapers began raising questions about his
personal financial and business dealings. The stories, which
prompted investigations by law-enforcement authorities, described
how for years Bradley had been paid as a director or consultant for
banks that did business with the city. Also, he had failed to
disclose some investments and stock dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing, but he
agreed to pay a $20,000 civil penalty for the disclosure lapses.
And he conceded that he had made ``an error in judgment'' by
accepting outside employment while mayor. The damage to his
reputation had been done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst year of my entire life,'' Bradley, an
intensely private man, told a reporter in 1990. ``It went on and
on, day after day, and you know you're literally helpless to do
anything except ignore it and go about your business.''
</P>
<P>
   But more difficult times were ahead. The videotape of the
beating of Rodney King, played over and over on television within
hours after it happened on March 3, 1991, led to calls for the
ouster of Daryl Gates, the city's combative police chief.
</P>
<P>
   Hamstrung by a city charter that gave Gates virtual lifetime
tenure, Bradley appeared helpless to act. He began working behind
the scenes to put pressure on Gates and eventually moved to fire
him, but was blocked by an increasingly powerful City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Bradley and Gates were so strained that when
the rioting first erupted in April, 1992, the two had not spoken
for more than a year. Their poor communication was pointed to by a
panel of inquiry led by William Webster, a former director of the
FBI, as a factor in the city's inability to act quickly to quell
the disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, badly shaken by the acquittal of the white officers,
was uncharacteristically blunt in the hours after the verdict. At a
televised news conference, he said he was ``outraged'' at the
outcome of the trial. ``Today that jury asked us to accept the
senseless and brutal beating of a helpless man,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   He regained his composure in the tumultuous days after the
verdict and set about to bring calm to the city, but critics said
he shared some of the blame for the riots in which more than 50
people died and property damage approached a billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably was outraged,'' said Ferraro, the city council
president, ``but he's the mayor of the city and he's got to keep
his cool and calm.'' Bradley quickly got his anger under control,
Ferraro said, adding, ``I think he's shown some leadership since
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Several days after the riots had subsided, as he began working
on plans to rebuild the city, Bradley was asked whether, if he were
not the mayor, he would be afraid to be a black man in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``I would be angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is survived by his wife and their daughters, Phyllis and
Lorraine.

STUDY: MOST FEMALE VICTIMS KNEW THEIR KILLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSIE STECKNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The majority of Arizona females murdered by a male died at the
hands of someone they knew, and were most often shot to death,
according to a national study expected to be released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Compared nationally, Arizona was the 21st most deadly state for
women, with 35 murders in 1996, the most recent FBI data available.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at only murders in which there was one female
victim and one male offender, not all homicides involving female
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-gun Violence Policy Center in Washington D.C. released
the study to coincide with Domestic Violence Awareness Month in
October.
</P>
<P>
   But center officials also say they want to paint an accurate
picture of who is killing women, and debunk what they call a
pro-gun ``myth'' that women need guns to protect themselves from
stranger attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of female homicide in America is that females
aren't killed by the stranger lurking and waiting to rape and
murder them,'' said Sue Glick, a health policy analyst for the
center. ``It's someone they know.''
</P>
<P>
   But in those cases, the potential victim may be more in need of
personal protection, said Sandy Froman, board member and second
vice president of the NRA. Particularly in the case of a stalker,
said the Tucson attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's even more of a reason to think about whether she wants
to take the responsibility of purchasing a firearm, learning how to
use it . . . and protecting her family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the results of the study, Froman said, ``I don't see
how that translates into `They don't need guns' ''.
</P>
<P>
   Bahney Dedolph, acting executive director of the Arizona
Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said it is difficult to draw
much from the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at one year of data doesn't tell us a whole lot,
except that certainly way too many women are killed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the study confirms the anecdotal information they
receive on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it affirms once again the risk that our intimate
partners can hold for us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those places where we think we're safest we're not, and that's
in our home, with people that we know.''
</P>
<P>
   According to FBI data, there were 3,631 female homicide victims
_ adults and children _ across the country in 1996. The study
looked at 2,129 of those in which there was a single female victim
and a single male offender.
</P>
<P>
   In a state-by-state comparison, Nevada had the highest homicide
rate among the female victims with 3.44 per 100,000 people. That
was more than twice the national average of 1.57 per 100,000
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona hit the national average and tied with Maine for 21st in
the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 35 females killed by a male in Arizona, 30 knew their
attacker and 14 had intimate relationships with them at the time or
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four females were shot to death. Eleven of the victims
were either under age 18 or senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the study found that an overwhelming majority of the
females, 1,866, were murdered by someone they knew; 151 were
murdered by strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,866 victims, just over half were killed by an intimate
partner, such as a husband or ex-boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   A murder weapon was identified in 2,023 of the cases studied.
The center found that more than half of the victims, 1,139, were
shot to death. The others were killed with knives, blunt objects,
bodily force or strangulation. &QL;

STUDENT SAYS CATHOLIC COLLEGE CENSORED HER POEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iona College, a small Roman Catholic school in New Rochelle,
N.Y., is caught up in a swirl of controversy for distributing a
censored version of the student literary magazine that had been
suppressed four months earlier because it included expletives and
sexually explicit language.
</P>
<P>
   Two poems were removed from the magazine, The Cornelion, because
they included expletives, and a sexually explicit word was edited
out of a third poem that is in the current issue of the magazine,
said Mark Arduino, the college's public relations director.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators insist they secured the agreement of the author
of the third poem before editing it, but the author, Kristin
McSpedon, called that assertion a lie in a letter to the editor of
the student newspaper that will appear in the issue of Oct. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make no apologies about what we did,'' said Brother James
Liguori, the president of Iona College. ``It's a question of a
mission-sensitive publication which should reflect the mission of
the college. It contained two pieces of material that were totally
inappropriate for Iona College.''
</P>
<P>
   Liguori said he checked with the school's lawyer before
instructing Michael McGrath, vice provost for student development,
to confiscate 380 copies of the magazine last spring. ``He acted
with my complete concurrence and approval,'' Liguori said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Ms. McSpedon had agreed to the editing of her poem,
Liguori said, ``It is my understanding that she was contacted and
that she did agree.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said Ms. McSpedon's poem ``was edited with the author's
permission.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McSpedon, in her letter to the student newspaper, The
Ionian, wrote that she had originally submitted her poem _ ``Typing
a Term Paper at 3 a.m.'' _ to a poetry contest sponsored by the
college's honors program and had won a $50 award.
</P>
<P>
   When she collected her prize money, she wrote, she was informed
that her poem would appear in The Cornelion and that it would be
published in the magazine ``as it was.'' She said no one had
contacted her about ``any problems with my work.''
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking official of the school who spoke on the conditon
of anonymity said he was sure that Ms. McSpedon was telling the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   The college administration was criticized in an editorial in The
Ionian last week for its handling of the matter. ``Iona's media
board should have been called before a final decision on the
publication's status was made,'' the editorial declared.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath acknowledged that college policy, spelled out in a
constitution, requires consultation with a media board of students,
faculty and administrators before a student publication can be
censored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't convene a quorum of the media board because it was
May and we were into final exams,'' McGrath said. ``I left multiple
phone messages for the editor and assistant editor of The
Cornelion, but they were never returned and I concluded they were
deliberately ignoring me.''
</P>
<P>
   The college constitution, McGrath said, requires student editors
to avoid ``libel, indecency, undocumented allegations, attacks on
personal integrity and the techniques of harassment and innuendo.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Goodman, executive director of the Student Press Law
Center, a nonprofit organization in Arlington, Va., that offers
legal assistance to student journalists, said that the college may
have violated the copyright law in the handling of Ms. McSpedon's
poem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law states that an individual has the right to control the
use of his work,'' Goodman said. ``If this student chooses to sue
for copyright infringement, the statutory monetary damages are
between $500 and $20,000.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said he felt confident that he had acted lawfully, since
the college was acting as the publisher and had the right to edit
written material.

   GORNJI OBRINJE, Yugoslavia _ The bodies of 15 women, children
and elderly members of the Deliaj clan lay slumped among the rocks
and streams of the gorge below their village in Kosovo province
Tuesday, shot in the head at close range and in some cases
mutilated as they tried to escape advancing Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   In village houses, three men, including Fazli Deliaj, the
95-year-old patriarch, who was paralyzed, were burned to death by
Serbs who torched the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Down the dirt track a few miles at Donji Obrinje, three more
elderly people lay dead on their backs in their gardens, shot in
the head as they apparently came out to plead for their lives. Ali
Kolludra, 62, still gripped his hooked walking stick Tuesday as he
lay dead on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Local villagers said the massacre took place on Saturday
morning, two days after the village came under siege by the
Yugoslav army and the police of Serbia, the republic that makes up
the major part of Yugoslavia and includes Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, monitors from the United States and the European
Union inspected the bodies of the Deliaj clan in the gorge. That
night they submitted a graphic written report of what they saw to
their embassies in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the families buried their dead, 21 in all, while
about four miles away in Golubovac, a survivor showed a reporter
the pools of blood left by a separate attack on Saturday that he
said left 13 dead.
</P>
<P>
   The killings appeared to show as definitively as anything that
the forces of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, have been
conducting a campaign of terror and destruction against ethnic
Albanian civilians which is intended to intimidate them, but which
appears instead to be inspiring even stronger defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials in Washington and at NATO last week stepped up
their threats of military force against Milosevic and demanded that
his forces stop their rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian government, whose driving force is Milosevic,
announced on Monday that it had ended its tank and artillery
offensive against separatist guerrillas in Kosovo. But ambassadors
visiting Kosovo Tuesday from Belgrade said they saw no sign that
the army and police had withdrawn to barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the lower Drenica Valley, where the Kosovo Liberation
Army has been most resilient, it appeared that the executions were
intended to send a particularly stark message of terror before
winter sets in and the Serbian forces face more difficulty in
moving around. The spate of killings on Saturday appeared to occur
as Serbian forces wound up their current operations in the area.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said that American diplomats,
including Defense Department personnel, had seen the bodies and
reported their observations, but that they ``are not forensic
experts.''
</P>
<P>
   The American special envoy for Kosovo, Ambassador Christopher
Hill, told CNN that ``there have been a number of these reports''
of massacres. ``This is a very brutal conflict,'' he said. ``It's
one more reason why we need to get international forensic experts
in there,'' to better judge the causes of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   About 250,000 ethnic Albanians _ who outnumber Serbs nine to one
in Kosovo _ have been forced from their homes since the spring.
Many of their homes were burned and looted by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments and human rights groups say they cannot
definitively enumerate the number of civilians _ on either the
ethnic Albanian or the Serbian side _ executed since the start of
the conflict in March. But Human Rights Watch, a New York-based
group, is scheduled to issue a report that documents two major
incidents, in the villages of Prekaz, Likoshe and Cirez, where
Serbian forces shot 80 Albanian civilians in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   At the site of the other execution, in Golubovac, Adem Hoxhaj,
63, described to a reporter Tuesday how 13 men were lined up
against the fence of his house on Saturday morning and shot with a
machine gun from a mound of earth about 10 feet away. There were
separate pools of blood for each body along the fence Tuesday and
the casings of about 80 bullets on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Hoxhaj said the men, between 18 and 35 years old, were all
brought to his house by Serbian police from the nearby forest where
they had been hiding. The rest of the villagers were also brought
in from the forest but were herded into a house and detained, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoxhaj said he escaped from the house and could see the
execution from hedges on the other side of the garden. His
description fit closely with that given to diplomats Tuesday by
another survivor, whose account they said they considered ``very
credible.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gornji Obrinje Tuesday, the bodies of the dead were slowly
being brought up from the gorge. Two of the ethnic Albanian men
arranging the burial wore holsters with pistols.
</P>
<P>
   From the way some of the bodies lay on a rocky path, it was
evident that the women and children had tried to escape and had run
straight into police. Zahide Deliaj, 27, lay on the rocks, shot in
the face, and behind lay her two daughters, Gentiana, 7, and
Donieta, 5, their yellow rubber boots still on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   A few feet behind Mrs. Deliaj, on the same path, lay Mejhane
Deliaj, 27, and her 4-year-old daughter, Menduhije. Behind her lay
Lumnije Deliaj, 30, who relatives said was seven months pregnant.
Her abdomen had been slit open.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report by the diplomatic monitors, who include former
military officers, was very precise in its descriptions of how the
women and children were shot at close range.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors also said in their report that they found an
elderly couple ``heavily mutilated.'' The report said, ``The man
was decapitated, his brain removed and left `displayed' beside his
wife's corpse.'' The woman's throat had been slit and her left foot
mutilated in an apparent attempt to cut it off, the monitors noted.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a puddle of blood remained on the foam mattress
where the woman, Hava Deliaj, 68, was found, and the brain of
Pajazit Deliaj remained on the adjacent mattress. Both were buried
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the clan's elders, Sadri Deliaj, 56, who managed to elude
the attacking Serb forces, described Tuesday how, last Thursday,
large numbers of Serbian troops, tanks and armored personnel
carriers that had been in the area surrounded the village. Armed
members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, underarmed and outgunned,
apparently left the area, fleeing the Serbs, the monitors said.
</P>
<P>
   The more vulnerable members of the family _ about 16 women,
children, aunts and uncles _ were sent down to the gorge where it
was thought they would be safer. There they set up the tarpaulin
shelter for sleeping and fashioned a makeshift kitchen for cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Deliaj said that on Saturday, both soldiers and police
approached the village. ``They came on foot and I heard armored
personnel carriers,'' he said. ``There were all kinds of
uniforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Deliaj said that as the armed Serbs approached the gorge he ran
away. ``I heard the screaming, and I heard the shooting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the body of one victim was carried out of the rocks on a
wooden stretcher Tuesday, her niece, Halime Hajdari, 15, wept. ``I
always hated the Serbs and I hate them now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A young man, Arsim Deliaj, 19, also wept as the bodies of
Gentiana and Donieta Deliaj, who were his nieces, were arranged
side by side on a stretcher. ``If they found me, they'd cut me up
too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Was he angry that the Kosovo Liberation Army couldn't better
defend his relatives? ``Not at all,'' he said. ``They didn't have a
chance, they didn't have the weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Muslim custom requires that the dead be buried as soon as
possible. In this case, the Deliaj family members said they had to
wait until the Serbian forces had left and it was safe to come and
look for the dead and the missing.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday morning, 18 graves had been dug at the top of a shady
green field near the village. Enough blankets had been found to
drape around the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m., they were burying the 14th body, the pregnant Luminje
Deliaj, who was slid into the ground wrapped in a red throw and
then covered with the soft ocher soil.

<P>
   A powerful blast of stellar radiation briefly penetrated Earth's
upper atmosphere one night last month. While it never reached the
ground and posed no health hazard, scientists say, the radiation
stripped atoms of their electrons and disrupted the quiet of the
high night sky with electrical conditions that severely limited the
range of radio transmissions. It rocked delicate instruments on at
least seven spacecraft, causing temporary shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers analyzing data from the event, on Aug. 27, said
Tuesday that the wave of gamma- and X-ray radiation and high-energy
particles had come from a cataclysmic magnetic flare on a star
20,000 light-years away. Such immense magnetic forces, they think,
are strong evidence supporting the existence of a strange type of
astronomical body called a magnetar.
</P>
<P>
   Theory holds that magnetars are exceedingly small and dense
objects _ a variation of neutron stars, which are more massive than
the sun but compressed in a sphere no more than 12 miles in
diameter. Each of these neutron stars is the remnants of the
collapse and explosion of a large star, and the most common form of
them is pulsars, which spin rapidly and emit steady pulses of radio
waves. A magnetar is thought to be one of the few neutron stars
observed so far that repeatedly emit pulses of gamma rays, and it
is believed to have an extremely powerful magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever caused the event of Aug. 27, the observations have
inspired astronomers to speak in superlatives of awe:
</P>
<P>
   _ The radiation, they say, appears to be evidence for the most
powerful magnetic field ever seen in the universe, billions of
times stronger than any on Earth and 100 times stronger than any
previously known in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   _ No blast so powerful has ever been detected striking Earth
from beyond the solar system. One astronomer calculated the total
energy that the star must have released to produce the Aug. 27
radiation surge. If that energy could be harnessed, it would be
enough to power all of civilization virtually to the end of time.
But, of course, only a tiny fraction of that energy reached Earth.
</P>
<P>
   _ The event was the first in which a significant, though
temporary, change in Earth's environment could be traced to energy
from a distant star.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have discovered a new type of star with a superstrong
magnetic field,'' said Dr. Chryssa Kouveliotou, an astrophysicist,
expressing the favored interpretation of the sudden surge of
stellar radiation reaching Earth. She is with the Marshall Space
Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., and spoke in a news conference
at the offices of NASA in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of scientists at radiotelescopes have analyzed the
short-lived afterglow of subatomic particles ejected by the star in
the tumultuous magnetic eruption, probably from stresses that
produced tremendous starquakes. They have drawn similar
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there's smoke, there's fire, and we've seen the smoke
that tells us there's a magnetar out there,'' said Dr. Dale Frail
of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   In the same statement from the observatory, Dr. Shri Kulkarni,
an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology, said the
radio antennas had detected emissions from particles ejected at
nearly the speed of light from the surface of the neutron star
interacting with the extremely powerful magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time this phenomenon, predicted by
theorists, has been seen so clearly from a suspected magnetar,''
Kulkarni said, noting that the radiotelescope observations
complemented the gamma ray and X-ray data gathered by several
spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   At the NASA news conference, Dr. Robert Duncan, an
astrophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin, who has been a
leader in magnetar theory, cautioned that scientists were still
analyzing data from the Aug. 27 observations. ``Magnetar is the
leading theory to explain this,'' he said, ``but in science, the
theory has to keep on passing the tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Cordes, a specialist in neutron stars at ornell
University who was not involved in the new research, called the
findings ``a very astounding triumph for observations and
theoretical astrophysics _ it's a really big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kevin Hurley, a research physicist at the University of
California at Berkeley, who calculated the likely magnitude of the
object's magnetic field, said that seven spacecraft were the first
to record ``the intense flash of X-rays'' from last month's event.
</P>
<P>
   Although the radiation caused several of the craft to shut down
automatically to prevent damage, they still had time to provide
data with which scientists pinpointed the location of the putative
magnetar. It coincided with an object in the constellation Aquila,
designated SGR1900+14, that had previously been observed emitting
periodic flashes of intense gamma rays. It is one of the sources
called soft gamma-ray repeaters.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of magnetars was proposed in 1992 as a theoretical
explanation for these soft gamma repeaters, which were first
detected six years earlier. Only four of them are known so far.
They are different from the gamma ray bursters, which seem to be at
even greater distances and do not appear to repeat themselves. Last
May, astronomers reported detecting such a gamma ray burst that was
so violent and bright that for about 40 seconds it apparently
outshone all the rest of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   A ground network of low-frequency radio transmitters, operated
by Stanford University, monitored the sudden changes in the upper
atmosphere because of the radiation blast. Dr. Umran Inan, an
electrical engineer and head of the Stanford research team, said
the effects were especially marked in the ionosphere, the part of
the atmosphere at altitudes between 35 and 50 miles that is
important to radio communications. Radio stations that usually can
broadcast great distances in the quiet night sky were probably
reduced to the short ranges of daylight, the solar radiation
causing electrical disturbances in the atmosphere.

WELLS, CURTIS LED YANKS TO 2-0 WIN OVER TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Wells gestured angrily on the field when Chad
Curtis and two other Yankees botched a fly ball in a game two weeks
ago. Later, Wells sought out Curtis to apologize. I can't do that,
Wells told him, you guys win games for me.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis helped Wells and the Yankees win a very big game Tuesday
night _ the first game of the American League division series
against Texas. Curtis, picked to start in left field despite
playing miserably in the second half of the season, smacked a
double that set up the Yankee runs and Wells pitched eight innings
in a 2-0 shutout of the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   True to his history as an exceptional playoff performer, Wells
threw a season-high 135 pitches and allowed just 5 hits. He struck
out nine in lowering his career ERA in the post-season to 2.22,
then watched from the bench as Mariano Rivera retired the Rangers
in order in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the pitching depth the Yankees possess, the Rangers'
best chance in this series would have been to win one or both of
the first two games. Now the Yankees can seize control of the
three-of-five-game series at Yankee Stadium Wednesday night, when
Andy Pettitte faces the Rangers' 20-game winner, Rick Helling, in
Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre placed Wells at the back end of the Yankees'
playoff rotation last year, a decision that still bothers Wells.
Coming off a season in which he went 18-4 and pitched a perfect
game, however, Wells got the Game 1 assignment this year, and he
justified that decision.
</P>
<P>
   With the top two buttons of his jersey undone and sporting a
hint of a goatee (to Wells, his war paint), the left-hander
challenged the Rangers all game, hammering fastballs inside and
outside and bending breaking balls over the lower plane of the
strike zone. Remarkably, Wells pitched into ball-strike counts that
were favorable to hitters _ 2-0 or 3-1 _ only three times.
</P>
<P>
   Wells fired first-pitch strikes to 21 of the 30 batters he
faced, reaching 2-0 counts only twice. Conventional wisdom
suggested the Yankees would not pitch to Juan Gonzalez, the
Rangers' massive cleanup hitter. To the contrary: Wells chased
after Gonzalez with inside fastballs, and the slugger went 0 for 3,
striking out, fouling out and chopping a grounder that traveled
about two feet from home plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had runners in scoring position against Wells only
twice after the first inning, their best threat coming in the
seventh. Will Clark singled with one out and after a fielder's
choice groundout, Todd Zeile smacked a single to left. Two on, two
out.
</P>
<P>
   Wells jumped ahead of Mike Simms no balls and two strikes, the
Yankee Stadium crowd of 57,362 roaring. Simms fouled off a pitch,
took two balls, fouled off two more with good swings. Wells did not
allow a three-run homer or grand slam this year, and this did not
seem like the best of times for the first.
</P>
<P>
   Wells zipped a fastball inside, Simms staring at it, the crowd
exploding. Ball 3, said the home-plate umpire, Jim Joyce, and Wells
disgustedly turned away, as fans screamed at Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   Wells attacked again: high fastball, Simms swung and missed, end
of inning. The 2-0 lead Curtis had built remained intact.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis batted .216 after the All-Star Game break, .146 in
September, pressing more with each at-bat. In prticular, Curtis
was unable to cope with pitches thrown to the outer half of the
strike zone. He played so badly in the final weeks that some in the
organization felt the Yankees should have considered replacing him
on the post-season roster with the rookie Ricky Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer, in the meantime, slugged three grand slams in the
final 10 days of the season and Tim Raines contributed
consistently, even after sitting three or four days in a row. The
idea of Curtis starting a playoff game seemed remote.
</P>
<P>
   But with Wells, a left-handed pitcher who induces fly balls,
facing the predominantly right-handed Texas lineup, Torre's
priority in picking his left fielder was defense, and Curtis has
the best glove in left field. Torre also knew that Curtis had a
favorable history against Todd Stottlemyre, with 9 hits in 26
at-bats (.346).
</P>
<P>
   Curtis was due to bat third in the Yankee second inning, which
began with Chili Davis, the 38-year-old designated hitter, playing
mind games with Stottlemyre. The Texas right-hander likes to work
quickly, but after each pitch, Davis would step out and loiter and
slowly get comfortable. Davis ran the count to 2-2, and when the
next pitch went in the dirt, Davis asked for a new ball; in this
way, he controlled the tempo.
</P>
<P>
   On the seventh pitch of the at-bat, Davis looked at a third
strike _ and yet, the tone for the inning had been set. Jorge
Posada patiently waited out a seven-pitch walk, and Stottlemyre
immediately attacked Curtis' weakness, throwing fastballs and
breaking balls outside.
</P>
<P>
   But Curtis reached out for a fastball, driving it to the
opposite field. Gonzalez, the Rangers' cement-shoed right fielder,
lumbered back and toward the right-field corner, the ball carrying
over his outstretched glove. Posada stopped at third, Curtis pulled
into second. One out, Scott Brosius coming to bat.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers opted to play the infield back, and for that reason,
Brosius cared only about making contact and putting the ball in
play. He flailed his bat and hit a roller to the right side _ and
through. Posada scored, Curtis stopped at third.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch battled Stottlemyre to a full count _ the Ranger
pitcher threw 27 pitches in the inning _ and Torre ordered Brosius
to break from first on the next pitch. Knoblauch swung and missed,
a strikeout, and Ivan Rodriguez fired a throw to second in an
attempt to intercept Brosius for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment Rodriguez released the ball, however, Curtis broke
from third and Brosius stopped about 20 feet from second base;
Texas second baseman Mark McLemore caught the ball with no other
choice but to chase Brosius in a rundown, after Curtis slid across
home with the Yankees' second run of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Torre looked quite wise for his choice of left fielder.  &QL;

 &HT;    Vaughn whips Indians as Sox take Game One
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The last time the Cleveland Indians saw Mo Vaughn in
postseason play, well, they didn't see him. He was invisible, a
non-entity, a wisp.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1995 and Vaughn was 0 for 14 with seven strikeouts as the
Boston Red Sox played matador to the bullish Cleveland Indians,
bowing in three straight in the American League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   History would not repeat itself Tuesday afternoon in Jacobs
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was bigger than life Tuesday, and Vaughn is a very big
man.
</P>
<P>
   The 250-pound first baseman personally dismantled the Cleveland
Indians in Game 1 of the American League Division Series, an 11-3
Boston victory.
</P>
<P>
   He drove in a postseason record seven runs.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   He stood taller than the Terminal Tower and wider than Lake
Erie.
</P>
<P>
   And one thing you never want to do is give a junkyard guard dog
a T-bone steak, then try to take it away from him.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribe spotted Boston starter Pedro Martinez a three-run lead
just three hitters into the game _ single, single, three-run home
run by Vaughn to left field, the opposite way.
</P>
<P>
   For 19-game winner Martinez, Boston's Rottweiler, a three-run
lead before he takes the mound is like spotting Secretariat a
three-length lead out of the gate.
</P>
<P>
   You aren't going to see anything but flowing tail. And that's
all the Indians saw from Martinez, who gave up no runs and two hits
over five innings until it was 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   Shaky Cleveland starter Jaret Wright was hit by singles from
Darren Lewis and John Valentin to open the game. Wright was ahead
of Vaughn 0-2, fell behind 3-2, then watched the next pitch nestle
snugly into the left-field jury box, 376 feet from home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned from 1995 to sit back and let the game come to me
and not try to force it,'' Vaughn said. ``You can't make things
happen out there. The thing I didn't do in 1995 was hit the ball
where it was pitched. Now I'm just sitting up there and waiting.
The ball was out over the plate and I just went through it and it
carried into the seats.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 3-0 with nobody out in the top of the first and the
45,185 sitting in Jacobs were as quiet the rest of the afternoon as
if sitting at a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   They might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra crashed a three-run home run in the fifth to
make it 6-0. Vaughn struck again in the sixth off relief pitcher
Doug Jones, a two-run blast to push it to 8-0 and become the first
Red Sox batter to hit two home runs in a postseason game since Rico
Petrocelli ripped a pair in the 1967 World Series against St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess Vaughn's day, Garciparra said, ``Wow! Is that
good enough?''
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman John Valentin, batting second in the order ahead
of Vaughn, scored four times, a Division Series record.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians avoided shutout embarrassment in the sixth on Sandy
Alomar's double and Kenny Lofton's home run, but the embarrassment
of getting crushed at home may have carry-over consequences in this
best-of-5 playoff that continues this afternoon in Jacobs before
shifting Friday and Saturday (if necessary) to Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Worried? Fans sang Take Me Out to the Ballgame in the seventh
inning softly _ like a ballad or a dirge. They should be worried.
This was the seventh straight time the Indians have lost the first
game of a postseason series and for Boston it ended a string of 13
straight postseason defeats.
</P>
<P>
   For Vaughn, the game was a salary drive to end all salary
drives.
</P>
<P>
   He and the Red Sox have been back and forth, over and under, up
and around each other in contract talks and arguments all season.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, they probably could have signed Vaughn to a
three-year deal at $30 million. But they gave Martinez a bigger
contract and Vaughn balked, turning down the club's offer of $37.5
million over four years.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn now is thinking more along the national debt-type figure
of $11 million a year for, oh, four or five years would be nice.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, he wants to put money aside and focus attention on
postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995, the playoffs went so fast for me (three defeats and
out to the Tribe),'' Vaughn said. ``Before I knew it we played
three games and were gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians are feeling that same sensation.

 &HT;    Padres' Brown fans 16 as Astros lose home edge
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ With Randy Johnson having won 10 of his 11 starts in a
Houston uniform and having held opponents scoreless in 42 of his 43
innings in the Astrodome, a dominating pitching performance in the
National League Division Series opener with San Diego was all but
assumed.
</P>
<P>
   The white towel-waving crowd of 50,080 fans got exactly what it
expected _ just not from whom it expected.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego ace Kevin Brown completely overshadowed his Astros
counterpart with a playoff masterpiece, striking out a division
series-record and career-high 16 and holding surprisingly punchless
Houston to two hits over eight innings for a 2-1 victory Tuesday
afternoon in the opener of this best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Unit got one-upped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody is invincible,'' said Johnson, who
pitched well with nine strikeouts in eight innings. ``There's
always this big buildup when I pitch in the postseason. You guys
tend to write more about what could possibly happen, but it always
seems to overshadow the opposing pitcher. And I know if I was Kevin
Brown or Mike Mussina last year, that would be an incentive to go
out and prove all of you wrong, that there's more than one pitcher
out there. He defied the law of gravity out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston was sinking before it knew what hit it. Or what it
wasn't hitting. Mixing a lethal assortment of two- and four-seam,
97-mph fastballs with sliders, sinkers and his new forkball, the
33-year-old right-hander threw a first-pitch strike to 21 of the 28
batters he faced and had batters consistently chasing high
fastballs out of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pitched well but surrendered a bases-loaded sacrifice
fly to Jim Leyritz in the sixth and easily the quietest home run of
this home run-delirious season when Greg Vaughn hit a solo shot to
lead off the eighth. The fans threw it back. Johnson didn't have
that luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most dominant I've seen Brown,'' said Astros
Manager Larry Dierker, whose club falls into a huge hole after
losing the home-field advantage and now has to win three of four,
starting with Thursday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Brown allowed only a pair of singles to Brad Ausmus and pitched
out of a jam in the sixth with two runners in scoring position by
retiring Bill Spiers on a groundout and striking out Derek Bell,
who is now one for 14 lifetime against Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Brown struck out every batter except Spiers and fanned Bell and
Ricky Gutierrez three times each.
</P>
<P>
   The one-run loss was reminiscent of last year's opening defeat
by Atlanta's Greg Maddux that wasted an outstanding game from
Houston's Darryl Kile. The score was identical, as was the futility
by the Killer B's trio of Craig Biggio, Jeff Bagwell and Bell, who
slumped to a collective two-for-37 showing in that three-game sweep
by the Braves and fared little better Tuesday in a combined
zero-for-10 effort.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he'd ever seen Brown throw better, Bagwell said, ``I've
never seen Kevin Brown bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was the only B doing the killing, and he did it with his A
stuff. He shut down the top-scoring team in the league, one with
four starters who had 20 or more homers this season. Although
Houston nicked closer Trevor Hoffman for a run in the ninth on a
Spiers double and a Ken Camini throwing error on Moises Alou's
infield single, the Astros pushed only two base runners past second
off Brown all day.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's only problems came in his postgame press conference when
he was asked to recall his pitch selection in that pivotal sixth
inning. ``I don't remember every pitch,'' he joked. ``Who do you
think I am, Greg Maddux?''
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact . . .

 &HT;    The ball's in his court
 &HT;    By Joe Capozzi
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Mark McGwire's historic season ended
Sunday in St. Louis. The chase for his 70th home run started Monday
in Fort Lauderdale on the second floor of a Las Olas Boulevard bank
building.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the Law Office of David Kraythen, which specializes
in medical malpractice cases, suddenly became the negotiating
backdrop for perhaps the most prized piece of memorabilia in sports
history.
</P>
<P>
   The McGwire-Kraythen connection is this: Philip Ozersky, the
26-year-old Missouri man who snagged McGwire's record-setting
homer, is a cousin of Kraythen's wife.
</P>
<P>
   So when a dive for a baseball landed Ozersky in a high-pressured
game of faxes, sports agents and seven-figure offers, the frazzled
research scientist called his cousin Francine in Florida for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they start talking about million-dollar offers and
drawing up insurance for the ball and if I need insurance for
myself, it's time to get somebody who knows about the law, somebody
you can trust,'' Ozersky said Tuesday in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was grateful to have someone I know I can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   David Kraythen, a lawyer for 26 years, said he isn't charging
Ozersky a nickel. ``It's been mind-boggling to this kid. He has
been inundated. He had problems sleeping (Sunday) night. He turned
to his family for help. Hopefully we'll be able to make his life a
little easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Making life easier for Ozersky this week has meant a much busier
and exciting week for Kraythen's office, just down the boulevard
from the offices of Florida Marlins owner H. Wayne Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   While Kraythen sorts out offers for the ball of up to $1 million
from professional memorabilia dealers, associate lawyer Mike
Freedlund spent part of Tuesday fielding calls from The Tonight
Show with Jay Leno, Today (Ozersky is tentatively scheduled to
appear Friday), and Late Show With David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   And the ball? It's in a safe-deposit box in a St. Louis bank.
It's next move may be across the street from where it was hit _
near Busch Stadium at the St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame, which
hopes to open a temporary display of the ball in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky, a season-ticket holder for the St. Louis Rams football
team, decided at the last minute to attend McGwire's final game for
a chance to see history.
</P>
<P>
   History came screaming right at him in the seventh inning.
Ozersky, who was with friends in a party suite behind the
left-field wall at Busch Stadium, said he picked up the flight of
the ball ``just over the third baseman's head.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball kept getting bigger. ``People were screaming, `It's
coming here! It's coming here!' I was moving toward it, but you
didn't want to get in its way. It hit a couple of (other fans')
hands, and they're still black and blue today.''
</P>
<P>
   When the ball hit a wall and bounced under some bleachers,
Ozersky said he threw his body flat on the ground to get a better
look. ``And it was right there. I picked it up and said, `Oh, my,
God. . . .' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky said he was not injured in the pileup. In newspaper
photographs the next day, he is shown holding the ball with what
appears to be a black-and-blue mark under his left eye. ``That's a
birthmark,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals tried to pressure him into giving the ball to
McGwire, but Ozersky said he wasn't sure what he wanted to do and
wanted time to think. He tried to sleep Sunday night, with the ball
in a basket next to his pillow. ``I got maybe an hour's sleep. At
5:30, the phone started ringing.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ozersky nor Kraythen will say how many offers have been
made. But St. Louis attorney Alan S. Cohen said he represents three
collectors who have combined to offer Ozersky $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the deadline on that offer is 4:50 p.m. EDT Thursday.
deadline was 72 hours after the end of SUnday's game which ended at
3:50 Central time/ deadline was extended a day because Wednesday is
Yom Kippur Ozersky said he won't be rushed into making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't a had a second to put some good thought into
it,'' he said. ``Before the game, people were saying, `If I catch
ball. . . .' I was like, `Right!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky laughed that he should have had a clue, when the game's
ceremonial first pitch was thrown by actor Cuba Gooding Jr., who is
known for his famous ``SHow me the money!'' line in the movie
``Jerry Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the best piece of advice he's gotten so far was from
Krayeth who told him: ``It can have a positive change in your life
and it can have a negative change. Notoriety and `Fifteen Minutes
of Fame can do different things to differnt people. He needs to be
cognizant of that.''

 &HT;    HMO reports called victory for consumers
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas HMOs trailed the nation last year in
providing preventive care that can avert costly health problems,
according to an independent group that assesses the industry
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Patients in the biggest Texas HMOs were less likely than HMO
patients across the country to get mammograms, Pap smears, certain
immunizations, prenatal care and post-delivery checkups in 1997, a
nationwide survey released last week showed. On Tuesday _ just as
many of us are being asked to choose between health plans at the
office _ Texas followed up with its own HMO report card that scored
individual health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Among the plans that fared poorly on preventive care measures
were Anthem Health Plan, now part of AmeriHealth, and PCA Health
Plans of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring well in the state survey were Scott &AMP; White Health Plan,
Prudential HealthCare and United HealthCare of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The state survey, released by the Texas Health Care Information
Council, lets Texas consumers see for the first time how different
HMOs stack up. Typically, data from performance studies are only
made available to employers choosing health plans and the HMOs
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to suggest that one HMO is better than
another,'' said Jim Loyd, executive director of the council. But,
he said, ``you can't make a really informed decision about choosing
an HMO if you have only seen one advertisement or if you've only
heard one story from a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike traditional insurance plans, most HMOs cover the cost of
preventive health care on the assumption that it's cheaper to catch
health problems early. But, an industry spokeswoman emphasized, it
is a patient's responsibility to take advantage of these services.
``I can tell you that there is not a health plan in this state that
doesn't pay for mammograms and doesn't encourage mammograms,'' said
Kelly Jones, director of governmental relations for the Texas
Association of Health Plans. ``Overall, I think it's encouraging
that these things are being offered by every health plan in the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones added that the HMO industry in Texas is relatively young
and supports a smaller percentage of patients than the national
average. One in six Texans with health insurance is enrolled in an
HMO, less than in many other states, which might explain the
lower-than-average scores on the national survey, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones joined consumer groups in calling the release of the
council's data a victory for Texans, who have never seen report
cards on their HMOs. But some advocates warn that the information
does not give a complete picture.
</P>
<P>
   The October issue of Consumer Reports criticized thesurveyfor
seeking only superficial measurements of care and not inquiring
about patient results. Without knowing whether patients got
accurate diagnoses or proper treatments, consumers won't be able to
judge the quality of care an HMO administers, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not information that's going to say this is quality, this
is not quality _ but it's a beginning, and that's progress,'' said
Lisa McGiffert, a senior policy analyst at Consumers Union in
Austin. ``We hope they're going to start looking more at quality
issues like, 'Is health improved?'''
</P>
<P>
   The national survey found 58 percent of Texas HMO patients
received baby check-ups, compared with 66 percent nationally. In
addition, 69 percent in Texas were given beta blockers to prevent
heart attacks versus 74 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Texas HMOs were only slightly below the national average for Pap
smears and mammograms, according to the survey by the National
Committee for Quality Assurance, a nonprofit watchdog agency.
</P>
<P>
   The national statistics did not rate or rank individual health
maintenance organizations. Instead, it compared responses from them
to a variety of performance questions. In its second annual survey,
the group solicited voluntary responses from the nation's 650 HMOs
and compiled its data for employers to use when shopping for health
plans. The committee received data from 447 plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas data can be found at www.thcic.state.tx.us on the
Internet.

 &HT;    Replica of Wright glider makes its way to Dayton
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's just wood, fabric and a little metal, but
the object that went on display in Wright State University's
Student Union on Monday started a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   It's the 1902 Wright Glider, or rather a faithful reproduction
of the glider that proved the Wright brothers' design for a flying
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Young of Richmond, W.Va., the glider's builder and pilot,
brought the kite-like craft to Dayton this week to display it
during the National Aerospace Conference. The conference runs
Thursday through Saturday morning at Wright State.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he also plans to display the glider Sunday afternoon
outside the Wright Cycle Shop, 22 S. Williams St., weather
permitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really wonderful to bring this back to Dayton,'' Young
said Tuesday. ``This is the machine (the Wrights) patented. It's
fully as important as the Kitty Hawk Flyer,'' which made the
world's first successful powered flights in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he built the glider in 1978 and has flown it several
times for an IMAX film and public television specials about the
Wright brothers. He made the flights near Kitty Hawk, N.C., where
Orville and Wilbur Wright flew a series of kites and gliders before
flying a powered craft based on the 1902 machine.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he was pleased to bring the glider here because
Dayton has never had much luck in having a replica of the 1902
machine on display.
</P>
<P>
   The Wrights abandoned the original 1902 glider at Kitty Hawk, he
said. In the 1930s, Army engineers at McCook Field, with Orville
Wright's help, made drawings of the glider and built a replica,
which was later demolished, he said. Another was later built, but
Young said it was donated to the Wright Brothers National Monument
at Kitty Hawk for a new visitors' center in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   A new local group, the First to Fly Foundation, sponsored the
glider's visit in an effort to draw attention to its plan to buy a
set of rare documents from the Wright Co., the aircraft company the
Wrights founded. First to Fly member Nick Engler said a private
collector in Florida owns the documents; the group wants to raise
$900,000 to buy them for the Paul Laurence Dunbar Library at Wright
State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``These papers cover a time period in the Wright brothers'
history that are not in any repository,'' said Dawne Dewey, head of
special collections and archives at Wright State. ``We would be
overjoyed to be the recipient of such a collection,'' she said, but
she added that Wright State is not involved in the fund-raising
effort.

NEWSPAPERS PLAN TO FIGHT RULING ON REPORTERS' NOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Texas, N.Y. ) (mk) 
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At least five major newspapers are preparing to join
NBC in challenging a recent federal appeals court ruling that would
make it easier, in some circumstances, to subpoena reporters'
notes, videotapes that were not broadcast and other unpublished
material in federal lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, released last week by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, in Manhattan, overturned what many newspapers and
network news divisions had considered a longstanding principle in
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The news organizations had argued that when people sought
unpublished or unbroadcast material that was gathered from
nonconfidential sources, they could do so only after proving the
material was essential to their lawsuit and could be obtained
nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   But a three-judge panel for the appeals court ruled, in a case
involving NBC News, that such a qualified privilege for journalists
did not exist in federal law. The decision does not affect a
related federal principle that protects news organizations from
disclosing information gathered from confidential sources. News
organizations are also protected in New York state courts from
disclosing unpublished material from both confidential and
nonconfidential sources.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Daily News,
Newsday, The New York Post and other newspapers have decided to
challenge the appellate decision, and other television networks are
likely to do so, too, lawyers involved in the effort said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers plan to file an amicus brief, asking the three
judges to reconsider their ruling and the full 2nd Circuit to
consider the case. Several other federal appeals courts have
recognized the qualified privilege involving nonconfidential
sources, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it currently stands, trying to get access to a reporter's
files, all his news gathering materials, is a last resort for
litigants because of the qualified privilege,'' said Laura Handman,
a lawyer representing the newspapers. ``We're concerned that it is
going to become a first resort. It is going to affect whether
sources are going to want to talk to reporters.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC said it also would ask the full appellate court to review
the case. ``We were extremely disappointed in the ruling and
believe the Constitution protects news gathering material,'' said
Alexandra Constantinople, an NBC spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved a segment on the show ``Dateline'' that was
broadcast in January 1997 and examined whether law enforcement
officers in Louisiana had pulled over drivers on highways because
of their race or nationality or because they were from out of
state.
</P>
<P>
   The segment included a videotape of an NBC producer, in a rental
car with Florida license plates, being stopped by a Darrell Pierce,
a Louisiana deputy sheriff. The officer said he had stopped the car
because it was alternately slowing down and speeding up. But NBC
said the car had been on cruise control just below the speed limit
until the officer intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the broadcast, Albert and Mary Gonzales filed a
federal civil rights lawsuit against Pierce, asserting that he had
pulled them over on Interstate 10 in Louisiana in 1995 because they
are Hispanic. The couple, who come from Texas, served a subpoena on
NBC seeking the complete, unedited videotape of the producer
driving on the highway and being pulled over. A month later, Pierce
also subpoenaed the unedited videotape.
</P>
<P>
   NBC challenged the subpoenas, citing the qualified privilege on
material gathered from nonconfidential sources _ a protection that
the network said derived from the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr., in a ruling in September
1997, acknowledged that there was a qualified privilege on
nonconfidential material in federal law but said the Gonzaleses and
the deputy sheriff had met the critical tests for disclosure: The
unedited videotape was essential to their lawsuits and the
information could not be obtained anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court determined, however, that there was no
general protection on nonconfidential material. ``We disagree with
the district court's holding that there exists a qualified
journalists' privilege,'' the judges wrote. The judges on the panel
were Joseph McLaughlin, Fred Parker and Arthur Spatt.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the Gonzaleses, Perry Sanders Jr., said he had
cooperated for months with the producers preparing the ``Dateline''
report, allowing them to use information he had gathered for two
other lawsuits challenging the way law enforcement officials
stopped drivers on the interstate. Sanders said he was initially
promised a copy of the unbroadcast portions of videotape, called
outtakes, but that NBC lawyers had rejected the request.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted was some outtakes, to stop the mess that goes on
on our interstate,'' he said. ``It was a critical piece of
evidence, we thought. This was an unnecessary and, for us, very
costly litigation.''

<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Like a turtle coming out of its shell after a
bad storm, Ohio State linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer has slowly begun
to poke his head out to face the media he feels rained down hard on
him earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The storm erupted in the preseason when Katzenmoyer revealed he
needed to ace three summer school classes _ golf, music and AIDS
awareness _ to remain academically eligible. For the next several
weeks, there was nary an OSU story that didn't mention Katzenmoyer
and his academic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, three games and 18 Katzenmoyer tackles later, the stories
on the linebacker have turned back to football. Perhaps no one is
more relieved than The Big Kat himself.
</P>
<P>
   Still, OSU's star linebacker continues to appear genuinely
surprised at the brouhaha that erupted over his eligibility status.
He places the blame for that squarely on the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys chose to make it my team, I guess, (because) I'm the
leader,'' Katzenmoyer told a group of reporters after practice at
the Woody Hayes Athletic Center this week. ``But it never really
was in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although the junior leads the Buckeyes in tackles and is
always a focus of the opposing team's game plan, he has, for now,
simply become another player on a star-studded, No. 1-ranked team.
Quarterback Joe Germaine, wide receivers David Boston and Dee
Miller, tailback Michael Wiley and cornerback Antoine Winfield, to
name a few, have all commanded comparable, if not equal, attention
with their play.
</P>
<P>
   And when OSU players chose their leaders this season, they
selected Jerry Rudzinski, Winfield and Germaine, not Katzenmoyer.
</P>
<P>
   Up until the Sept. 19 game vs. Missouri, teammates and OSU coach
John Cooper were left to defend the linebacker while he stayed away
from the media. They insisted the preseason scrutiny hadn't
affected him, that he was the same old player despite recording
just six tackles (fifth best on the team) in the Buckeyes first two
games. (He had twice as many in his first two games last season.)
</P>
<P>
   After he racked up 12 tackles against the Tigers in OSU's third
game, Katzenmoyer agreed to be interviewed. Like his teammates and
coaches, he said the preseason scrutiny hadn't affected his play.
</P>
<P>
   But he admits he still has a tough time dealing with the
attention he receives. ``I'm not a people person, I guess,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer is no stranger to Joe Paterno and his No.-7 ranked
Penn State Nittany Lions, who visit Ohio Stadium on Saturday.
Paterno said he tried hard to recruit Katzenmoyer and thinks highly
of the 1997 Butkus Award winner. Despite Penn State's reputation as
Linebacker U, Paterno said he can't remember any Nittany Lion
linebacker quite like the 6-4, 255-pound Katzenmoyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've ever had any (linebacker) that big and
strong,'' Paterno said. ``He's all business.''

HEAD OF LOCAL SEES CORRUPTION IN CITY WORKERS' UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ First, he said, came the threat to break his legs.
Next came the telephoned death threats.
</P>
<P>
   When that did not stop Mark Rosenthal from running for the
presidency of his union local, his opponents threw him off the
ballot in what his supporters insist was a kangaroo proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   That was three years ago, and this happened not in the
notoriously corrupt teamsters' or longshoremen's unions, but in
District Council 37, the umbrella group representing New York City
workers, which was long considered a beacon of progressive unionism
but is now the target of many corruption investigations.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Rosenthal got his revenge. He won the presidency of
his local in a landslide, and he has quickly become the go-to guy
for hundreds of reformers eager to end what they see as
embezzlement and election fraud that is engulfing District Council
37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal, whose 2,400-member local, Motor Vehicle Operators
Local 983, represents drivers and boiler tenders, seems an unlikely
repository for such hopes. He is an admittedly overweight
46-year-old with a foghorn voice who some other union leaders say
is abrasive and publicity hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Just three months ago, he was a $30,000-a-year truck driver for
the city's Parks Department. Now he makes $74,367 _ his $30,000
Parks Department salary, $35,000 from the local and $9,367 for
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   But what Rosenthal may lack in polish and experience, he more
than makes up for with street smarts, persistence and courage _
especially courage. He has repeatedly heard how a previous
president of his local, Frank Morelli, was beaten in what is now
Rosenthal's office because he refused to make payments to organized
crime figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lie that I'm not fearful,'' Rosenthal said.
``My whole executive board, they're all afraid for my safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rosenthal has become the most outspoken critic of
District Council 37, which represents 120,000 New York City
municipal employees, including secretaries, social workers and
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Hill, the district council's executive director,
acknowledges that the Manhattan district attorney has subpoenaed
documents from 12 of the council's 56 locals in an investigation
into allegations of embezzlement, falsification of records and
kickbacks from caterers, lawyers and other contractors, as well as
having the union pay for trips overseas and personal credit card
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Several union officials say the district attorney's office has
told them to expect a wave of indictments this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is a cesspool of corruption,'' Rosenthal said. ``I
was really shocked that this could happen in our union because our
union has always had an honorable reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking the helm of Local 983 in July, Rosenthal has not
wasted any time in cleaning things up. Suspecting embezzlement, he
persuaded his local's executive board to expel his predecessor,
Robert Taylor, from the union and order him to pay back $400,000
because he had run up extraordinary expenses without receiving
approval at membership meetings.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents provided by Rosenthal, those expenses
included $45,000 for refreshments for four membership meetings in
1995, $91,000 for the 1995 Christmas party and $81,990 for the 1993
Christmas party.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's phone number was not listed, and officials at District
Council 37 said they were unable to reach him for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal has also sought to cancel a $450,000 contract (he
called the total outrageous) that his predecessor awarded, in
advance, to a lawyer, Adam Ira Klein, to handle a salary
arbitration for the 250 boiler tenders in his local.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that Klein has averaged more than $3,000 an hour
for his work so far. Klein did not respond to repeated phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal has also stopped his predecessor's practice of sending
a $1,200 monthly check to Negotiations Consulting, a Long Island
company run by Gerard DiNardo, the son of Thomas DiNardo, who led
the boiler tenders' local before he merged it with Local 983.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal's lawyer, Arthur Schwartz, said he could find no
evidence that Negotiations Consulting had done any work for the
union. Gerard DiNardo did not return repeated phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after being elected, Rosenthal, a Baruch College dropout
who worked for the Parks Department for 27 years, became one of the
founders of the Committee for Real Change in D.C. 37, a group of
dissidents that is pressing for more oversight of each local's
finances and elections.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal has ruffled lots of feathers in his two months running
Local 983, whose members include city hall chauffeurs, tow truck
operators and milk drivers for the schools. He has had ambivalent
words about Hill, even though he has often consulted the district
council's leader for advice on running Local 983. He praises Hill
for his hard work, but he occasionally attacks him for siding with
unsavory incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   Hill faulted Rosenthal for seeming more eager to run to the news
media to make his complaints than to work with the district
council's leadership to solve them. Some other union leaders had
harsher words, calling Rosenthal undiplomatic and too
confrontational. And Taylor's backers attack Rosenthal as
inexperienced and incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   When a few longtime union leaders crashed a meeting of the
Committee for Real Change two weeks ago, James Tucciarelli,
president of the sewage treatment workers local, who was one of the
crashers, grew so enraged with Rosenthal that he nearly attacked
him.
</P>
<P>
   According to union members who attended the meeting, Rosenthal
angered Tucciarelli by telling the longtime leaders: ``If you don't
reform, you're going to be gone. You won't be here in three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucciarelli said he took that as a personal threat, but
Rosenthal insisted that he was merely warning that veteran leaders
would be voted out if they did not embrace change.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal recounted the two incidents that persuaded him to run
for the presidency. In late 1994, at a union meeting, he told the
leadership of his local that he and other parks workers feared they
would lose their jobs as the Giuliani administration placed more
and more workfare workers in the parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their response was, `You're lucky you have a job,''' Rosenthal
recalled. ``I was really upset with them. I told the guys in the
garage: `These guys don't want to listen. We should run a candidate
against Bob Taylor.' My local is predominantly black and Hispanic,
and I didn't think I had a good chance to win because I was white.
I was actively looking for a candidate. The guys turned around and
said, `Mark, why don't you run?'''
</P>
<P>
   At the union's 1994 Christmas party, he recalled, he was having
a meal when a high-ranking official of the local approached him and
said: ``We hear you're thinking of running. Don't do it. We're from
Bensonhurst. We can always break your legs and have you fired.''
Later, Rosenthal added, the official said he was just kidding.
</P>
<P>
   He grew so angry, he said, that he immediately began working the
room, shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Hi, I'm Mark Rosenthal. I'm running for 983
president,' '' he recalled. ``Everyone was shocked. There hadn't
been an election in this local in 20 years.''

POLICE OFFICER ACCUSED OF IMPERSONATING A REPORTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Police Officer Joseph Locurto held a news
conference in his lawyer's office this month to apologize for
appearing in blackface at a Queens parade and to plead for the
right to continue serving on the force, there was a mole among the
reporters: a police sergeant investigating his case who sat among
the journalists and took notes.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant's appearance at the news conference _ which
resulted in a two-page report filed with the Internal Affairs
Bureau, the police unit charged with investigating police
misconduct _ was angrily denounced Tuesday by Locurto's lawyer,
Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties
Union. In a letter to top police officials, Siegel said the move
raised ``serious questions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Government monitoring of the First Amendment activities of its
citizens through the use of undercover agents is antithetical to a
free society,'' Siegel said in an interview. ``If citizens are now
being told that cops will surreptitiously attend press conferences
and compile files on them, that will chill First Amendment
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   But police officials defended their decision to dispatch an
investigator to the news conference to hear what Locurto had to
say. Marilyn Mode, the department's deputy commissioner for public
information, said she considered news conferences ``open to the
public,'' and added that while the officer did not identify himself
or wear a badge, he did not wear press credentials either.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel countered that only specific journalists were invited to
attend the news conference in his office. ``No invitation was
extended to the public at large,'' he wrote. ``Certainly no
invitation was extended to investigative officers of the New York
City Police Department posing as members of the press corps.''
</P>
<P>
   Locurto is scheduled to face an administrative trial at Police
Headquarters on Oct. 5 at which he will fight to keep his job. He
was suspended without pay for wearing blackface at the annual Labor
Day parade in Broad Channel, Queens, while riding atop a float that
parodied the racist killing of a black man in Jasper, Texas, last
June.
</P>
<P>
   Among the bureau's files is a two-page report signed by Sgt.
Gerardo Lopez and Capt. Carl Sandel and titled, ``Subject: Summary
of Norman Siegel Press Conference.''
</P>
<P>
   The style is terse. ``Mr. Siegel also stated that his client's
right to free speech was violated,'' it said at one point. ``He
stated that the Constitution guarantees this, even if the viewpoint
is offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel, in his letter to police officials, asked for an
investigation into whether the decision to send a police officer to
the news conference violated the rules for using covert police
surveillance of political activities. Under a 1985 federal court
order known as the Handschu agreement, police are prohibited from
investigating political gatherings except for the purposes of crowd
control or when they have specific information that the group has
committed or plans to commit a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mode said that after conferring with George Grasso, the
department's deputy commissioner for legal affairs, she did not
believe the investigation violated the Handschu agreement. But she
added that the department would refer the case to its Handschu
committee for a review. The committee is made up of Grasso; Patrick
Kelleher, the department's first deputy commissioner, and John
Doyle, a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said that for the purposes of the Handschu agreement,
political was defined as ``the exercise of a right of free
expression or association for the purposes of maintaining or
changing governmental policies or social conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it was political,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mode said that while there was no written policy preventing
officers from impersonating reporters, she believed it was against
Police Department guidelines.

 &HT;    Simmons to take advantage of bye week
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ The timing of the bye week couldn't be better for
Bengals linebacker Brian Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   He'll go back to North Carolina and be honored during a home
game against ACC rival Clemson. His name will be placed in the
stadium's ring of honor near Tar Heels legend Lawrence Taylor of
New York Giants fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy about the things I did back there,'' Simmons said.
``But my main focus is to be the type of player here that I was
down there. With time, I think that'll come.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3, 233-pound rookie is due to make the first start of
his NFL career against Pittsburgh on Oct. 11. He replaces Tom
Tumulty, who suffered torn left knee ligaments in a 31-24 loss at
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons probably would have started sooner, but his move into
the lineup was delayed because of surgery Aug. 27 for a slight
cartilage tear in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   He played briefly against Green Bay and had three tackles
against Baltimore, but didn't perform to the level he was used to
during his All-America career in Chapel Hill, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell I was rusty,'' Simmons said. ``Toward the end of
the Baltimore game, I started feeling better. I just had some bad
reads where you could tell I was sitting out for three weeks. My
conditioning is not where it needed to be. So this week, I'm
putting extra emphasis on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons joins fellow inside linebacker Takeo Spikes and
cornerback Artrell Hawkins as rookie starters on a struggling
defense ranked 27th overall, yielding 375.3 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   Spikes leads the team in tackles (31) and sacks (2), while
Hawkins ranks sixth with 17 tackles. Hawkins got his first NFL sack
against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's my turn to go out there and get my chance to try and
make things happen,'' Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans have stressed a sense of urgency for the rookies to
mature fast since training camp. Spikes ($7.53 million) and Simmons
($5.75 million) are signed for five years, while Hawkins has a
three-year, $1.65 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not paying you to come sit down and watch,'' Simmons
said. ``They want you to go out there and earn your keep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to being out there making plays. I consider myself a
playmaker. With the snaps I get at that position, I think I can
bring that.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Bengals president Mike Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simmons has to come on,'' Brown said. ``It's a heck of an
opportunity for him. He has all the physical tools. If he picks up
on it, he may be an excellent player and may make the team
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he's young. Yes, there will be times when he makes a
mistake he won't make a year or two from now. We just have to work
through that with him.''

ON CLINTON, D'AMATO REFUSED TO BE RUSHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES DAO

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato firmly removed himself from
the thorny debate over President Clinton's future Tuesday, saying
he would absolutely not take a position on impeachment and removal
unless the issue came before the Senate _ which would not happen
until well after the November elections, if ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to act on the facts when the matter is presented,''
D'Amato, a Republican, said to reporters at the Capitol
Tuesday.``To make comments beyond that would be absolutely
improper. And I'm not going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In making his clearest statements yet on the president's
problems, if only to sidestep them, D'Amato underscored the
complexity the issue poses for his campaign for a fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the investigations into Clinton's personal and political
affairs, he remains popular in New York, many polls show, and
criticizing him might hurt D'Amato among the moderate voters who
could decide a close race, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is always going to be somewhat more favorable to
Clinton than the rest of the country, and that makes it difficult
for D'Amato to say anything,'' said Lee Miringoff, director for the
Marist College Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, which
has a poll coming out next week showing that the president's job
approval rating has risen to 69 percent in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking Clinton could also generate a backlash among loyal
Democratic voters, motivating them to turn out in larger numbers
for D'Amato's opponent, Rep. Charles Schumer, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, D'Amato may want to avoid criticizing the president
because it could rekindle memories of his role as chairman of the
Senate Whitewater committee, which was viewed as a partisan fiasco
by many New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that D'Amato wants to get back into what many
suspect was one of the biggest mistakes he made in the last six
years, which was the Whitewater hearings,'' said John Zogby, a
pollster from Utica.
</P>
<P>
   But D'Amato may also run the risk of annoying his core
conservative supporters by not signaling some displeasure with the
president's behavior. The senator's campaign has spent much time
and money trying to invigorate those voters by attacking Schumer as
a New York City liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Yet D'Amato has been less willing than many Democrats, including
the state's senior senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, to rebuke the
president. Unlike those Democrats, who have used words like
``reprehensible'' and ``immoral'' to describe Clinton's behavior,
D'Amato has merely called the controversy sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most Americans are saddened by this whole event, and I
am,'' he said during a campaign stop in Buffalo recently.
</P>
<P>
   Such reticence is a clear signal to many analysts and
politicians that D'Amato has calculated that he has as much to lose
as to gain from saying anything on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets hammered no matter what he does,'' said Fred Siegel,
senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist
Democratic policy group. ``He's smart to duck the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, D'Amato may be concerned about infuriating black
voters, who, polls show, are significantly more supportive of
Clinton than white voters.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican strategists have predicted that Democrats will
stay home this fall because they are demoralized by Clinton's
problems. But if blacks believe that Republican candidates are
trying to pillory the president, it could lead to a surge in
Democratic turnout, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big factor in New York elections has been the low turnout
in New York City,'' said Jeffrey Stonecash, a professor of
political science at Syracuse University. ``If he gets that
constituency agitated, he could be in trouble.''

DON KING IS SUED OVER FIGHTER'S CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Promoter Cedric Kushner has filed a lawsuit against
Don King, alleging that King interfered with Kushner's contract
with the heavyweight title contender Hasim Rahman and coerced
Rahman to pull out of a scheduled bout against David Tua last week
by having Rahman fake a hand injury.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, which seeks $12 million, which was filed in
federal court in Manhattan on Monday, Kushner contended that King
signed a contract with Rahman last May even though King knew that
Rahman was under contract to Kushner.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Rahman signed a contract with Kushner that was due to
run through October of this year. Kushner extended the contract
last June without knowing that Rahman had signed a postdated
contract with King.
</P>
<P>
   ``King has been doing these types of things since I came into
boxing and unfortunately before I came into boxing,'' Kushner said.
``He's been doing these types of things on a regular basis and
getting away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Kushner, Rahman, 24, a heavyweight who is 29-0 with
24 knockouts in his four-year pro career, accepted $200,000 from
Kushner when he signed a new deal with the promoter in June, but
did not tell Kushner that the month before he had signed a deal
with King.
</P>
<P>
   Rahman, according to Kushner, also received $150,000 from King
between May and September, and $100,000 of that amount was given to
Rahman not to fight Tua. Rahman, ranked No. 3, said King promised
to have him positioned as the No. 1 contender in the heavyweight
division and be in line to fight Evander Holyfield next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he controls the ratings and he can do whatever he
wants,'' Rahman said regarding what King told him about not
fighting Tua. ``He gave an example of how Henry Akinwande could
lose a fight to Lennox Lewis and still fight for a title.''
</P>
<P>
   A telephone message left for Greg Fritz, a publicist for Don
King Productions, seeking comment on the lawsuit was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   King is already fighting two other lawsuits involving prominent
boxers. He is in court in Manhattan this week seeking to validate
his contract with Felix Trinidad, the International Boxing
Federation welterweight champion. And Mike Tyson has filed a
lawsuit against King, alleging breach of contract and breach of
fudiciary responsibilities and is seeking to end his promotional
contract with King.

BEFORE DEATH, OFFICER'S WIFE MAY HAVE TOLD POLICE OF ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The wife of a New York City police officer who killed
her, their children and himself last week had called his precinct
on more than one occasion to complain that he was violent and
abusive, according to her relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Leeanne Fitzgerald, who was shot to death on Friday along with
her 4-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter at the couple's home in
Greenville, N.Y., had called the 34th Precinct in Washington
Heights several times to complain that she was being physically and
emotionally abused by her husband, Officer Patrick J. Fitzgerald,
according to Mrs. Fitzgerald's sister, Arlene Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said Tuesday that they have not been able to
find any evidence that Mrs. Fitzgerald had called the precinct. But
interviews with state police investigators and neighbors revealed a
long history of troubles between the couple, and court records
showed that the Fitzgeralds' problems were serious enough that they
fought over custody of their children in Orange County Family Court
and received orders of protection against one another.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the couple's longstanding problems, the New York City
Police Department said Tuesday that none of the units that track
domestic violence complaints, like Internal Affairs, had been aware
of the family's history. Police officials try to monitor domestic
violence complaints against officers so they can intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing to indicate that there was a problem,'' said
Marilyn Mode, the chief spokeswoman for the department. ``The
commanding officer of the precinct said he knew of nothing like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lee charged that police officials failed to follow up on
Mrs. Fitzgerald's phone calls to the 34th Precinct. Two friends of
the Fitzgerald family, Denise Gattuso and Andrea Nowack, also said
that Mrs. Fitzgerald had told them that she had lodged complaints
by telephone to the precinct about her husband's abuse. Mrs.
Gattuso said she believed the calls were made because Fitzgerald
had discussed the same two or three calls with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would tell me, and he would tell me,'' said Mrs. Gattuso,
who baby-sat the Fitzgerald children for three years. ``He would
say that she called and that he is going to be in trouble, that she
better stop calling.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lee said she believed that Mrs. Fitzgerald was ignored at
the precinct because Fitzgerald had always been able to convince
his fellow officers that his wife's accusations were unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would tell them that she was manic depressive, and they
would believe him because he is a cop,'' Ms. Lee said. ``They hide
behind their badges, and their wives suffer because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nowack, a town councilwoman in Greenville who attended the
same church as Mrs. Fitzgerald, said that Mrs. Fitzgerald told her
about calling the precinct in late 1996 or early 1997. ``She said
she had spoken to the desk sergeant and he blew her off,'' Ms.
Nowack said. ``She was reporting some kind of abuse, without a
doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Department guidelines require an official inquiry in the
event of domestic violence complaints against police officers. An
officer who takes such a complaint is required to notify the duty
captain, who in turn is required to file reports with both the
Internal Affairs Bureau and the department's early-intervention
counseling unit.
</P>
<P>
   The disciplinary action for confirmed incidents of spousal abuse
can include taking away an officer's gun and badge, placing him on
restricted duty and even dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said that police officials need to closely watch
domestic violence complaints against officers because they have
such high stress jobs and carry guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is widely recognized that there is an increase in domestic
violence when there is easy access to weapons,'' said Elizabeth
Schneider, a Brooklyn Law School professor.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald shot his family and himself with his own gun, not his
department-issued service revolver. Each of the victims _ Mrs.
Fitzgerald, their daughter, Ashley, and their son, Shane _ was shot
three times in the head, meaning that Fitzgerald had to reload his
five-shot, .38-caliber weapon at least once, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald then called the 34th Precinct, told the desk sergeant
he had murdered his family, hung up the telephone and shot himself.
The entire incident took less than six minutes.

SCHUMER PRESSES D'AMATO ON ABORTION RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Spotlighting one of the clearest points of division
between the candidates for Senate, Rep. Charles Schumer attacked
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato on Tuesday over his opposition to abortion
rights, describing him as an ``extremist'' whose votes in Congress
had restricted the rights of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is so extreme that his voting record is not even right
wing,'' said Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat who is challenging
D'Amato for his Senate seat. ``It is so far over as to be off the
river bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, flanked by abortion rights advocates on the steps of
the Westchester County Courthouse in White Plains, noted that
D'Amato had, during his 18 years in the Senate, almost invariably
opposed legislation that was supported by those who support the
right to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   That included bills to allow abortion in cases where a woman had
become pregnant through rape or incest, and a law Schumer sponsored
that imposed penalties on people who blocked access to abortion
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Dole voted for it,'' Schumer said, referring to the former
senate majority leader and the 1996 Republican presidential
candidate. ``But not Al D'Amato.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's attack signaled his intention to press D'Amato on his
abortion rights views. Schumer's advisers view D'Amato's position
on the issue as a political liability in New York state _
particularly among women _ and a subject that had not been hit hard
enough by the senator's previous Democratic challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said he would continue to hit D'Amato on the issue of
abortion, asserting that it would win votes in the election ahead.
``I think he's going to regret the day he voted to take rights away
from women,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who is running with the support of the Right to Life
Party, as he has in each of his three previous Senate races, did
not dispute Schumer's characterization of his views. But speaking
to reporters in Washington, he assailed his opponent for raising
the issue, calling him ``a desperate man, making desperate,
ridiculous charges.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What would you expect of him?'' D'Amato said. ``He's engaged
in a very personal, negative campaign. He said he'd talk about the
record. And he's gotten to nothing but pejoratives.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   D'Amato took his objections to Schumer's campaign tactics to the
airwaves as well, enlisting his political ally, Ed Koch, a Democrat
and former New York City mayor, for a second television
advertisement on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10-second ad, which the D'Amato campaign said would be
broadcast statewide, a stern-looking Koch admonishes Schumer for
running an ad that concludes by showing a picture of D'Amato with
the tag line, ``Too many lies for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new commercial for D'Amato, Koch says: ``Chuck Schumer _
tough campaigning is one thing, but you've gone over the line, and
it's inexcusable. Chuck: Stop it!''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Koch, who described himself as an unwavering
fan of the rough-and-tumble campaign, said Schumer had crossed the
line by describing the senator from New York as a liar.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with negative campaigns, if you are
factual and you are accurate, and you say he voted this way, and he
voted that way,'' said Koch, who had a parting of the ways with
Schumer in 1989 when the congressman backed off from supporting his
re-election bid for mayor. ``When you engage in hot buttons that
attack integrity _ like liar and sleaze _ you go beyond the
acceptable line.''
</P>
<P>
   In White Plains, Schumer brushed off the complaints about his
campaign tactics from D'Amato, who has been running a notably
hard-hitting campaign himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the man who developed negative campaigning, who's run
three slice-and-dice scorched-earth campaigns,'' Schumer said,
``I've got to say that he has an awful thin skin.''
