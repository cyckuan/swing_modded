<HEADLINE> 20th Anniversary Of Truth Discussions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese theorists attended forums
here today to discuss the importance of a nationwide debate in
1978 on the meaning of truth, which was held by many to be a
campaign to open people's minds.
</P>
<P>
The event is important for holding the great banner of Deng
Xiaoping Theory high and building a modernized socialist China in
the next century, according to Ru Xin, vice-president of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The discussion on the criterion for truth was begun in May of
1978, which got support from Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The rival was Hua Guofeng, then Chairman of the CPC Central
Committee, who insisted that Mao Zedong's decisions and
instructions could not be changed, and needed to be safeguarded.
His policy prevented Deng and other old revolutionaries from
coming to work for the Party even the Cultural Revolution
(1966-76) had ended. Deng had been dismissed by Mao from his post
during the Culture Revolution.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Deng, the only criterion to be used in
judging truth is practice. This debate, which is considered by
many as a crucial battle, spread to the Party's leading newspapers
and magazines, and ended in November of 1978 with a victory by
Deng.
</P>
<P>
"The debate was a movement to liberate people's minds. And it
laid an important ideological basis for the reforms and opening
up," Huang Kejian, a professor at People's University, told a CASS
forum.
</P>
<P>
China's reforms and opening up began after the Third Plenary
Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, where Deng's policy was
formally established.
</P>
<P>
At another forum attended by members of the Party School of the
CPC Central Committee, participants said that the principles of
"liberating minds" and "seeking truth from facts" that appeared
during the debate were the central part of Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
"The principles gave a hard blow to dogmatism and destroyed the
cult of the individual," explains one theorist, Yu Guangyuan, who
says that it was shortly after the debate that economic
construction replaced class struggle as the Party's central task.
</P>
<P>
He Zuoxiu, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, says that Deng
Xiaoping Theory has been proven to be true by the developments of
the past 20 years and to be a scientific theory that must be
adhered to.
</P>
<P>
Some observers say that the debate on the criterion for truth
will go nationwide through next month. Many theorists believe that
a further emancipation of minds is needed to solve some
complicated problems caused by reforms of state-owned enterprises
and other developments.
</P>
<P>
Re-opening the discussion will improve national cohesion and
get people to rally around the Party Central Committee with Jiang
Zemin at its core, they added.

<HEADLINE> China's Private Sector Getting Better Legal Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Federation of
Industry and Commerce has submitted to the National People's
Congress a motion for laws to protect the country's thriving
private sector.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Zhang Xuwu, vice-chairman of the
federation, at the second session of its Eighth Executive
Committee here today.
</P>
<P>
The private sector of the economy has grown rapidly in the past
20 years with the assistance and guidance of state policies, and in
the future, its development should be protected by the law, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The federation will set up a specific department in charge of
legal affairs this year to protect the rights and interests of its
members, he added.
</P>
<P>
The private sector has become a key part of China's economy,
paying 54 billion yuan (6.5 billion US dollars) in taxes in 1997,
or 7 percent of the country's total industrial and commercial tax
revenues.
</P>
<P>
The sector employs about 85 million people, 68 million of them
in private business and 17 million in foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the federation will encourage more enterprises
in the sector to get involved in agriculture, high-tech
industries, service, infrastructure, state-owned enterprise
reforms, employing laid-off workers, and supporting welfare.
</P>
<P>
Jing Shuping, the federation's chairman, said today that
private ownership should play an important role in the socialist
market economy.

<HEADLINE> State Council Halts Pyramid Sales Schemes In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Pyramid sales schemes have been
outlawed as of today in China, the State Council said in a
circular today, pointing out that they were not suited to national
conditions and have done some serious harm.
</P>
<P>
It announced that China's marketing system is far from
developed and that its management methods are backward, and that
through various pyramid schemes a number of unscrupulous people
have engaged in a series of illegal activities in recent years,
behaving badly, getting involved in underworld gangs, and preying
on superstitions.
</P>
<P>
Any businesses that registered for pyramid sales before the
State Council announcement have to halt the practice before
October 31. And they should register another form of business to
replace the pyramid sales and cancel the original registration.
</P>
<P>
Industrial and commercial departments will immediately halt all
illegal pyramid sales and penalize any persons who are involved in
unauthorized pyramid sales with fines or more severe penalties in
accordance with the Chinese Criminal Code.
</P>
<P>
The ban calls for government departments to enforce the law on
all forms of pyramid sales better.

<HEADLINE> Greek Army Chief to Visit Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Chief of Staff of the Greek army
Athanasios Tzoganis will visit Cyprus for talks with the island's
political and military leaders, Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tzoganis' three-day official visit, which begins on Wednesday,
aims to discuss the implementation of a joint defense pact signed
between the two countries in November 1993.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Tzoganis is expected to visit a
newly-built military air base in the western coastal district of
Paphos, to be named after the late Greek Prime Minister Andreas
Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
The air base was built under the joint defense pact which
guarantees Greece's protection for Cyprus in case of a new Turkish
offensive against the island.
</P>
<P>
This eastern Mediterranean island has been divided into Greek
Cypriot-controlled south and Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since
1974 when Turkish troops invaded and took over the northern third
of the island in the wake of a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup
seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained over 40,000 troops in the northern part
of the island, which was unilaterally declared in 1983 as a
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" by Turkish
Cypriots. The breakaway state was only recognized by Turkey.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Japan should develop
economic cooperation in the disputed South Kuril Islands, a
Russian official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The economic cooperation should fit in with the interests of
Moscow and Tokyo, Russian Presidential Press Secretary Sergei

"Without investment in the region, nothing will happen there of
its own accord," Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival in Moscow, Yastrzhembsky said he wanted to suggest
to the president a complex of measures because the situation in
the islands was "simply desperate".

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Holds Talks With Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri Tuesday held talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on Israel's recent offer to withdraw from south Lebanon,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hariri told reporters after the two-hour meeting that he asked
Mubarak to continue his good offices to push forward the stagnant
Mideast peace process in the interest of the entire region,
including Israel.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that both Lebanon and Syria were prepared to
establish permanent and comprehensive peace in the region and to
resume talks with Israel from where they were stopped about two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Syria and Lebanon were ready to change the current standoff
from a state of war to permanent and comprehensive peace, if
Israel so desired," said Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided on April 1 to accept the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 425, which calls for an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon. But meanwhile, Israel said it would
not exit unless security arrangements for its northern border
areas are worked out with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the aim of protecting its northern border
areas from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which closely coordinate their Mideast
policies, want the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon
unconditional and simultaneous with a Israeli pullback from the
Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast
War.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's trip followed a brief visit here last Wednesday by
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad. A flurry of diplomatic activities
are being carried out to coordinate Arab stances on the latest
development in the issue of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Hariri will also discuss with Egyptian
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri means of promoting bilateral
cooperation in economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
He will meet with Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid on issues of common interest.

<HEADLINE> East Africa to Expand Regional Development Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, the
three members of the East Africa Cooperation (EAC), vowed Tuesday
to expand the regional development bank in a bid to "integrate
the three economies into a single trade and investment area."
</P>
<P>
The East African Development Bank (EADB), set up in 1967, has
grown into a leading regional development finance body with the
capacity to meet diverse investment needs from the region, Kenyan
Minister of Planning and National Development George Saitoti said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The EADB recorded the third successful year in 1997 with a net
profit of 4.14 million U.S. Dollars, Saitoti said at the end of
the EADB Governing Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister announced that he was replaced by
Tanzanian Finance Minister D. Yona who became the new rotating
Chairman of the EADB Governing Council from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti, Yona and Ugandan Finance Minister J.S. Mayanja-Nkangi
held the one-day meeting here to review the bank's performance in
1997 and discuss how to strengthen the bank's role in further
coordinating the three economies.
</P>
<P>
Investments attracted by the bank rose by 6.5 percent from
27.9 million Dollars in 1996 to 29.7 million Dollars in 1997 as a
result of EADB's aggressive business promotion and the
introduction of new business activities such as Asset Leasing and
Trade Finance, Saitoti said.
</P>
<P>
Throughout 1997, both disbursements and collections from the
bank's projects recorded increases of 38.5 percent and 49.2
percent respectively over 1996, according to the EADB annual
report issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
EADB should "continue to pursue an aggressive stance in
promoting both its core and new business" so as to boost cross
border trade and investments and finally integrating the three
economies into a single trade and investment zone, said Saitoti.
</P>
<P>
As envisaged in the EADB Long Term Strategy, the new business
activities, like Asset Leasing which became operational in 1997,
have played a prominent role in expanding the volume of business
for the bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bank intends to expand and enhance its Trade Finance
operation to include the financing of other export commodities
such as cotton, tea and the importation of strategic commodities
and raw materials for export oriented industries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Following the successful launching of the Local Currency Bond
in Kenya and Uganda respectively in November 1996 and December
1997, the bank now plans to start a similar local currency bond
equivalent to 10 million Dollars which will also be listed for
trading at the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange earlier 1998.
</P>
<P>
The EADB have also agreed with the European Investment Bank in
principle to co-finance the EAC Digital Telecommunication Project
which is expected to be launched in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Infrastructure Plans to Be Cut in New Kenyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The coming Kenyan budget for the
fiscal year from July 1, 1998 will only include a few projects on
infrastructure damaged heavily by months of El Nino rains, said
Minister for Public Works and Housing Kipkalya Kones Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is better to include only a few projects in the budget and
ensure that they are completed successfully and satisfactorily,"
he said at the opening ceremony of a conference on developing and
sustaining of national infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has implemented "too many projects with very little
money. Accordingly, they (the engineers) scale down standards and
specifications to meet the budget," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The end result is too many sub-standard projects which fail
as soon as they are commissioned and the country goes to square
one," he sighed.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Blair's Mideast Tour Much Helpful to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair wrapped up his five-day five-nation Mideast tour Tuesday
after making progress in helping reactivate the stalled peace
process and improving the British-Arab ties.
</P>
<P>
He successfully persuaded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat to hold a meeting in London early May on the stalled
peace process.
</P>
<P>
This means that Blair, whose country holds the current European
Union Presidency, appeared to have won the trust from the Israeli
side which has for long rejected the European mediator's role in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The EU has been pressing the Israeli government to implement
the agreements already signed with Arabs and abandon its hardline
policies, a stance welcomed by Arabs.
</P>
<P>
His visit, which took him to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan,
Israel and Palestine, came at a difficult time when the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been stalled for a year
since a Jewish settlement project was carried out in East
Jerusalem, a place claimed by Palestinians as the capital of their
future state.
</P>
<P>
The success in arranging the London meeting is particularly
important as the United States, the chief mediator in the peace
process, has reportedly said its patience is being worn out over
the prolonged stalemate.
</P>
<P>
However, Blair displayed diplomatic skills in avoiding
challenging the U.S. role in the peace process by repeating the
stance that the European role is only complementary to
Washington's.
</P>
<P>
Blair said during the trip that the EU and Britain will play
more positive role in reviving the peace process, that could also
help speed up the peace process if all the promises being turned
in practice.
</P>
<P>
He also scored a point in another attempt to improve ties, if
not mending them, with Arabs during the trip.
</P>
<P>
During the recent weapons inspection crisis in Iraq, Britain
was the first country to take side with the U.S. against Iraq and
sent its military forces to the Gulf, distancing itself away from
some Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Blair has repeatedly stressed the importance
of the principle of "land for peace" which is to the liking of the
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza, Blair expressed his support to the right of
self-determination of the Palestinians, and promised to lobby
more economic aid to help build the Gaza airport and the Karni
industrial zone between Israel and Palestine.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Middle-Range Ballistic Missile Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli intelligence
officer said on Tuesday that by the end of 1999, Iran will be able
to produce the prototype of the ground to ground missile capable
of hitting Israel, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The officer told the Israeli Knesset (Parliament) Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee that the Iranians are approaching
completion of the development of the engine for the middle-range
ballistic missile Shihab 3.
</P>
<P>
He noted that despite the pressure from the United States,
Russia is still supplying the Iranians with the technological
know-how about developing the missile.
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources said that once Iran completes the development
of the engine, the missile project is assured of eventual
success. They said the engine has been the most difficult stage of
the Shihab 3 and after its completion, the Iranians could complete
the project themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Shihab 3 has a range of 1,300 kilometers and a payload of
700 kilograms. The Israeli sources said the missile is based on
Democratic People's Republic of Korea's No-Dung missile and Russia
took over from Pyongyang in 1994 after failures in the program's
development.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian missile issue was raised in the Knesset just after
the United States agreed on Monday to fund a third Arrow
anti-ballistic missile battery for Israel.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decision was announced by visiting U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Cohen after his meeting with Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai in Tel Aviv Monday. Cohen also pledged
more military support to Israel.

<HEADLINE> Action Plan to Contain Forest Fires in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Fire-fighting experts from around
the world Tuesday agreed on an immediate action plan to contain
the forest fires still raging out of control in Indonesia's East
Kalimantan province after a two-day meeting held in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The short-term plan, involving 10 million U.S. dollars, covers
the province of equipment and training for 1,000 local
fire-fighters, use of aircraft, operational management,
communications and support to government liaison teams.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was chaired by Klaus Topfer, executive director of
the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP).
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that fire fighting experts, United
Nations agencies, international organizations and the donor
community have been brought together in an effort to deal with the
environmental and humanitarian crisis in Southeast Asia, said the
UNEP.
</P>
<P>
"The experts have given a clear message that it is not possible
to fight all the fires, and that we must make priorities with
regard to those that are threatening human health and areas rich
in biological diversity," said Topfer, who was appointed by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan as U.N. Coordinator response to the
fires.
</P>
<P>
The latest report presented to the meeting by the U.N. Disaster
Assessment Coordination mission to Indonesia estimates that over
250,000 hectares of land in East Kalimantan have been razed by
fires this year, and concludes that the situation is out of
effective control.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Seeks to Promote Relations With Arab States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister
Mustafa Osman Ismail said Tuesday that one of the priorities of
his country's foreign policy is to promote relations with all Arab
states.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Ismail said that Sudan will make
endeavors to improve its relations with the Arab states, which
deteriorated during the Gulf War in 1991 as Sudan supported Iraq
and most Arab countries sided with Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
On the Sudanese-U.S. relations, he indicated that dialog
between the two countries has never ceased and that his country
is not seeking confrontation with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
He said that Sudan will pursue an objective course in patching
up its relations with the U.S. at all levels, as U.S. delegations
continue to visit Sudan to explore the status of women, children
and human rights as well as the changing economic situation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He added that he has sent a letter to British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook calling for the development of Sudanese-British
relations. However, he said, a change in Britain's policy toward
Sudan will take some time.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese minister asserted that Sudan's relations with all
European countries except Britain are improving.

<HEADLINE> New Progress Made in Angolan Peace Process: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary General
Kofi Annan has said that "new progress" has been achieved in the
political field in the Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the remarks in a report to be tabled to
the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The report reaching here Tuesday said, out of the 12 tasks
stipulated by the new agenda passed in March this year, 11 has
been accomplished, leaving only the task of re-establishing
national authorities in regions occupied by the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the military situation in Angola is
"relatively quiet", though there was still insecurity in certain
areas, which had affected the work by U.N. observation mission
and humanitarian agencies in the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission will continue with its investigations into
the "incidents in violation of the cease-fire agreement" to
revert the insecure situation, the report pledged.
</P>
<P>
On the demobilization of former UNITA militiamen, the report
said, 6,435 out of the 7,877 remnants soldiers registered have
been de-militarized.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council will discuss on April 29 the Angolan
peace process and the term of U.N. observer mission in Angola
whose deadline is April 30.
</P>
<P>
Blondin Beye, U.N. special envoy to Angola, Monday told the
press in Lisbon, Portugal, on his way to the U.N. meeting, "It is
almost settled" that the Security Council would postpone the term
of the U.N. observer mission in Angola since there has been
positive progress in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Beye didn't comment on whether the Security Council would
cancel its sanctions on UNITA. But he believed that no more
sanctions would be imposed on UNITA other than the existing ones.

<HEADLINE> Baghdad Holds Mass Funeral for Dead Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A mass funeral was held in
Baghdad on Tuesday for 52 Iraqi children who died of
sanctions-spawned malnutrition diseases.
</P>
<P>
The funeral procession set out from ar-Rasheed street, heading
for the United Nations office in Baghdad. Arab student
organizations as well as a U.S. student delegation, now visiting
Iraq, were taking part.
</P>
<P>
Sultan Ash-Shawi, chairman of the Iraqi Association for
Children Support, told reporters that he held the
U.S. administration responsible for these children's deaths.
</P>
<P>
He accused the United States of being persistent on
maintaining the sanctions with no legally justified reason for
its prolongation, now that Iraq has fulfilled its obligations
under relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the international community to seriously and
expeditiously act for the lifting of the unjust sanctions and put
an end to the "U.S-committed systematic genocide" against the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Ash-Shawi later handed a protest note to the
U.N. representative in Baghdad, on behalf of the families of the
dead children.
</P>
<P>
More than a million Iraqi children have died because of the
sanctions which have caused acute shortages of food and medicine
that hit almost all sections of the society.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion
of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Loses 1.9 Billion Tons of Soil to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Vice-Minister of
Agriculture Getachew Tekelemedhin said Tuesday that the country
loses 1.9 billion tons of soil to erosion per year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting here on soil fertility management, the
vice-minister said Ethiopia loses 600 million Birr (68 million
Dollars) per annum to reduced agricultural production triggered
by the effects of soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, if the current trend
continues unabated, Tekelemedhin said, a sizable farming
community in the country will be forced to earn their livelihood
from sources other than farming.
</P>
<P>
The prominent factors for soil degradation in Ethiopia are
population pressure, deforestation, poor agricultural techniques,
overgrazing and drought.
</P>
<P>
He said the soil fertility initiative launched by the World
Bank and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
plays an important role in preventing soil degradation in
sub-Saharan countries including Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Also on the occasion, Ismail Serageldin, vice-president of the
World Bank's special program, expressed the bank's readiness to
support Ethiopia's soil fertility initiative.
</P>
<P>
The meeting has drawn representatives of governmental and
non-governmental organizations, donor agencies, the World Bank
and scientists on soil fertility.

TEHRAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran Tuesday once again
criticized the United States for its accusation that Tehran
supports international terrorism, terming it as Washington's
"old-time" policy against other countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said that Washington's
long-standing accusation against Tehran on this issue was the
continuation of the U.S. policy of threat and imposing economic
sanctions on other countries, especially on Iran.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. of ignoring "the facts in the world
community, the regional situation and the realities in modern
Iran."
</P>
<P>
An annual U.S. report on international terrorism that will go
to the Congress next week lists Iran as one of the nations that
sponsor terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that Iran is against extortion, violence and
terrorism in the international relations, adding that it is the
U.S. that should correct its policies toward Iran.

<HEADLINE> Countries Attempt to Prop up Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Major oil producing countries
around the world have been trying to prop up oil prices by cutting
production output, but analysts doubt the results.
</P>
<P>
The deal was significant because it included seven big non-OPEC
(Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) members such as
Mexico, Norway and Russia, according to an article carried by the
Investor's Business Daily today.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said, however, the agreement reached last month to cut
about 1.5 million barrels a day is not enough to wipe out the
entire daily surplus. They believe even if all the participants
stick to their commitments, the world will still be awash in oil.
</P>
<P>
Most important, analysts don't believe all members of the
OPEC-plus pact will live up to their promises.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, OPEC countries have made pact after
pact defining members' output quotas. But, as it has been revealed
all the time, cheating is rampant, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The latest plunge in oil prices started in the fall, as OPEC
agreed to boost production by 10 percent. At about the same
time, the Asian Crisis reduced the demand for oil in that
region. Meanwhile, a mild winter reduced energy needs in the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Although restricted supply could prop up oil prices, many
countries have their own reasons not to do so. Many governments
depend on national oil companies for a large portion of their
budgets, it said.
</P>
<P>
Getting all of those parties to agree to a deal, let alone
stick to it, is extremely difficult, the paper said. Chances are
someone is going to pump out more oil.
</P>
<P>
If the price of oil is high enough, users cut back on their
consumption, and new companies will enter the market, sending
prices lower. But Even as world economic activity and the demand
for oil have expanded significantly over the past 20 years, proven
oil reserves have continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
Low prices eventually will lead to increased demand, according
to market analysts. Oil companies will lose interest in expensive
and uncertain exploration projects, which will lead to less new
supply. Those changes, in turn, will lead to higher prices.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Pakistan to Cooperate to Solve Afghan Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Pakistan Tuesday
underlined the importance of cooperation among Afghanistan's
neighboring countries in a bid to solve the Afghan crisis after
the Taliban militia agreed to join peace talks.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, Pakistani
special envoy for Afghan affairs Iftekhar Murshid told his Iranian
counterpart Alaeddin Boroujerdi that cooperation between Iran and
Pakistan was "absolutely necessary to bring the Afghan peace
process to a successful conclusion."
</P>
<P>
He said that "the Pakistani government and the prime minister
himself are determined to bring the Afghan crisis to an end, a
feat we are hoping to achieve through cooperation with the
Islamic Republic of Iran."
</P>
<P>
Murshid arrived here Tuesday morning to coordinate with
Iranian officials after U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Bill
Richardson announced Friday that the Taliban group and the
anti-Taliban Northern Alliance have agreed to hold face-to-face
talks on April 27 in Pakistan's capital of Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Murshid said that Taliban's readiness to enter negotiations
with their opposition was a step towards creating understanding
among the Afghan warring factions.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Boroujerdi the results of Richardson's visit
to Pakistan and Afghanistan as well as the negotiations involving
the representatives of the U.N. and the Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC) regarding the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi welcomed the Pakistani proposal to cooperate with
Iran to push the Afghan peace process, saying that Iran supports
cooperation between the U.N. and the OIC to resolve the Afghan
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tehran radio reported that Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi Tuesday also met the Pakistani envoy, voicing
Tehran's readiness to cooperate with Islamabad to solve the
Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Islamic Taliban regime came to power after its armed
forces captured the capital of Kabul in September, 1996. It drove
out the government troops led by President Burhanuddin Rabbani,
leader of the alliance of guerrillas who stormed into the capital
in 1992 after years of war with then Soviet-backed regime.
</P>
<P>
Ever since, a new civil war has been continuing between the
Taliban forces, which control most parts of the country, and the
guerrilla alliance which occupies the north.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Satellite Space Channel Leased to Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Tuesday signed a contract
with Libya to lease a space channel to its western neighbor on its
first satellite Nilesat to be launched into orbit this month, the
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The contract was signed by Amer Aun, the representative of the
General Secretariat of Information and Culture in Libya and Amin
Bassyouni, chairman of the Egyptian Satellites Company (Nilesat).
</P>
<P>
In an address on the occasion, Egyptian Minister of Information
Safwat al-Sherif stressed the importance of cooperation between
Egypt and Libya in the new Egyptian satellite project.
</P>
<P>
"This is an affirmation of Egyptian-Libyan relations and a
unified action that serves the entire Arab nation, balances
globalization and Arabism and maintains Arab cultural and
historical identity as well as traditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sherif described Nilesat as a satellite of "Egyptian origin and
Arab identity."
</P>
<P>
Aun, the Libyan representative, said this project enables
Egypt, a pioneer in the Arab media, to move from a country that
uses satellite technique to one that manufactures satellite.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian satellite Nile 101 will be carried into space on
April 28 by an Ariane rocket from a launching pad in South America.
</P>
<P>
It carries 400 radio and 12 space channels which become 83
television channels by the use of the pressed digital system used
in the Nilesat.
</P>
<P>
Up til now, nine space channels have been leased out of the 12
channels on the satellite. A space channel is expected to be
leased to Lebanon shortly.

<P>
CAIRO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The secretaries general of the Arab
League (AL) and the Francophone Organization Tuesday signed a
protocol on enhancing cooperation between the two bodies and among
their member states in the economic and cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, signed by AL's Esmat Abdul-Meguid and Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, of the organization of French-speaking countries,
accentuates the importance of continuing coordination between the
two secretaries general in a regular way to guarantee active
cooperation between the two organizations.
</P>
<P>
It also outlines some joint projects and activities to be
carried out by the Cairo-based AL and the grouping of
French-speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
The protocol reflects their joint desire to promote cooperation
among all regional gatherings as well as their wish to enhance
peace, development and international cooperation in accordance
with the U.N. charters.
</P>
<P>
The two organizations will work to promote the development
process in Africa within the framework of historical and cultural
ties that link it to the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Six Arab states, namely Egypt, Ethiopia, Comoros, Morocco,
Tunisia and Djibouti belong to the Francophone Organization, whose
majority members come from the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the AL said this protocol shows the two
organizations' belief in the role the regional gatherings should
play at the international level.
</P>
<P>
In late March, Boutros-Ghali invited Abdul-Meguid to a
conference of the Francophone Organization in Paris to discuss
the organization's relations with other regional groups,
particularly with the AL.

<P>
LAGOS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian police operating at the border
between Lagos and Benin have been put on full alert following the
seizure of large quantity of ammunition in bags of cassava flour.
</P>
<P>
The police said Tuesday that in a latest case, more than 400 rounds
of ammunition were discovered last week at the same border checkpoint
in a sack which the owners claimed contained garri.
</P>
<P>
When the man was challenged on the findings, he quickly bolted into
Benin, a police spokesman said, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
While intensive investigations are underway to nab the suspect, the
police appealed the public and commercial bus operators to report any
suspicious object.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency, arms being trafficked into
Nigeria from neighboring countries have been on the rise following the
civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The police hold that most of the ammunition smuggled into the
country was being used in armed robbery and other clandestine
operations.

<HEADLINE> Chairmen of Parliament Want Meeting with Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chairmen of the lower and
upper houses of Russia's parliament on Tuesday expressed hope to
meet with Russian President Boris Yeltsin before the third Duma
vote on premier's nomination scheduled for April 24, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
State Duma Chairman Gennady Seleznyov said after his meeting
with Federation Council Chairman Yegor Stroyev that "We want the
president to lift the veil in the run-up to the third ballot on
Premier candidacy Sergei Kiriyenko in the Duma, (and to reveal)
which members of the previous government will include."
</P>
<P>
According to the Duma chairman, Communist faction leader
Gennady Zyuganov, Leader of the People's Power group Nikolali
Ryzhkov and head of the Agrarian group Nikolai Kharitonov in their
message to the upper house chairman expressed hope that the
Federation Council will invite leaders of parliamentary factions
to its April 22 meeting and listen to a report from the Duma
chairman.
</P>
<P>
However, Seleznyov said, the upper house's committees do not
deem it necessary for him to deliver a report. They took a more
radical position and invited Kiriyenko to their meeting tomorrow
so that he will answer all unclear questions, the Duma speaker
said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of leftist and center-left parties and movements in the
Duma Tuesday decided to prevent dissolution of the parliament's
lower chamber by approval of Kiriyenko's candidacy on Friday,
Seleznyov declared.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will tell the Communist Party of Russia's
Central Committee on Thursday that the leftist deputies do not
want the Duma to be dissolved.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraq complained to the
United Nations on Tuesday that the recent statement by Charles
Duelfer, the depute chief of the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, violated his conditions of employment.
</P>
<P>
The statement by Charles Duelfer, published by The New York
Times on April 15, 1998, contains his evaluation of the results of
the visits to Iraq's presidential sites and a quotation from his
report, which the U.N.Secretary-General had yet to transmit to the
Security Council at the time the interview was published.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. chief Kofi Annan, Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's
envoy to the United Nations, said this violated an undertaking by
UNSCOM employees not to make statements or give interviews, unless
specifically authorized to do so.
</P>
<P>
The recent statement by Duelfer, an American, "confirms this
fact and also confirms the need for the United Nations to be more
attentive to ensuring the impartiality of officials operating
under its flag," Hamdoon added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cohen's Mideast Trip, A Mission of Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen's Mideast trip, which ended Tuesday, attained the
goal of exploring market for U.S. weapons in the region.
</P>
<P>
During his week-long visit to Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, Israel
plus a stop-over in Greece, Cohen promised military aid to help
these countries modernize their defense facilities and enhance
their defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
In Turkey, he took up the issue of U.S. participation in
Turkey's military tenders worth billions of U.S. dollars,
including the purchase of 50 attack helicopters in a
3.5-billion-dollar tender, while expressing U.S. interest in
upgrading Turkey's U.S.-made M-48 battle tanks.
</P>
<P>
In Amman, Cohen said Washington was considering to provide
Jordan with heavily-armored A-10 tank-killing jets and to speed up
the delivery of F-16s that Jordan had ordered from the U.S. in an
aid package of 320 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In Egypt, he said, as part of Washington's 1.3-billion-dollar
military assistance this year, Cairo would receive 50 Avenger
mobile launch vehicles with Stinger missiles.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with Israeli leaders, Cohen said Washington would
fund the research and development of Israel's third Arrow
anti-ballistic missile battery, which costs about 150-200 million
dollars, while promising to help Israel carry out its military
modernization program.
</P>
<P>
His talks with Greek defense officials in Athens Tuesday also
focused on U.S. sale of weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with officials of the countries, Cohen talked
a lot about tensions and peace while doing his salesman's job.
</P>
<P>
Cohen expressed grave concerns over the political uncertainty
in the region, while urging all the parties concerned in the
Mideast peacemaking to pool their efforts to push the stalled
peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that tensions between Turkey and
Greece, the two allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
were to be settled peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Iraq issue, he said the U.S. would not reduce
its military buildup in the Gulf until Iraq fully complied with
relevant U.N. resolution on weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
But many local analysts and observers in the region have
doubted whether the U.S. sale of advanced weapons in the area
could help the region realize a lasting peace.

JOHANNESBURG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Tuesday released more details of the military
intelligence report on an alleged plot to overthrow his
government.
</P>
<P>
Introducing debate on his budget vote in Cape Town, Mandela
repeated that the report was a fabrication, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Apart from claiming that there had been an organization called
FAPLA (Force of African People's Liberation Army) aimed at
subverting the 1999 general elections and at assassinating the
president, the report further claimed FAPLA had aimed to murder
judges.
</P>
<P>
FAPLA was also claimed to have planned to occupy parliament,
broadcasting stations and key financial institutions, and planned
to orchestrate general disorder over a period of about four
months before the elections.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said that about 130 people were named in the report as
members, leaders and supporters of the organization, and these
included very senior military personnel, political figures and
others.
</P>
<P>
He repeated the government's assertion that the plan had never
existed.
</P>
<P>
The Commission of Inquiry had concluded that the report was
"without substance and inherently fantastic," he said.
</P>
<P>
South African National Defense Force chief General Georg
Meiring, who handed the report to Mandela on February 5, has
announced resignation over the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Namibia's diamond output is
expected to grow significantly after Namibian Minerals
Corporation (Namco) recovered gem quality diamonds off the
Namibian coast.
</P>
<P>
It is envisaged that with the entry of Namco into offshore
mining, offshore diamond production in Namibia would increase by
up to 20 percent this year, South African Press Association
(SAPA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Namibia's total diamond production could increase by more than
500,000 carats a year, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Namco estimated that it would recover 150,000 carats of
diamonds valued at about 27 million U.S. Dollars in the first
year of production.
</P>
<P>
The company started operation at the Koichab area in Luderitz
Bay early this year.
</P>
<P>
Namco's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Alastair
Holberton, was quoted as saying at the weekend that 95 percent of
the diamonds recovered are of gem quality.
</P>
<P>
Namco has reportedly finalized a three-year marketing
agreement with IDC Holdings, a private company based in London
and Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
IDC's Managing Director, Jack Lumer, said that the shape and
purity of the diamonds recovered by Namco were particularly
attractive to manufacturers and that he did not envisage any
problems in establishing a strong overseas demand for the gems.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Most of the major stock markets in
Europe reversed Monday's healthy gains and ended down Tuesday,
with only London closing flat and Paris and Frankfurt down
sharply.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE-100 index of leading shares recovered from an
early loss of one percent or 69 points to end on a flat note in
thin trading, up only 0.9 point or 0.02 percent at 5955.0.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the market was largely unaffected by the
inflation figures which were in line with expectations, but
investors were nervous ahead of Wednesday's jobs report, which is
seen as potentially significant in determining U.K. interest rates
prospects.
</P>
<P>
Some traders said that the market was only consolidating after
having surging up quite a lot recently.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares closed trade with a loss of 53.06
points or 0.98 percent at 5,388.94 on the DAX-30 index, hit by the
weakness of the dollar against the mark.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that the weak dollar triggered profit-taking in
export sensitive stocks such as car and drug stocks.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that VW, Europe's largest carmaker, was badly
affected by the dollar's decline and its shares fell four percent.
Meanwhile, BMW, another carmaker giant, ended early five percent
down.
</P>
<P>
The Paris CAC-40 index closed 25.29 points or 0.65 percent
lower at 3,860.40, but managed to bounce off early lows following
Wall Street's rally.

Dealers said that investors were reluctant to bid up shares in
the wake of the dollar's fall to below six francs.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone has ordered the
immediate freezing of the bank accounts of 93 foreigners
suspected of collaborating with the military junta ousted in
mid-February, the government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, the 93 foreign nationals
include Lebanese, Indians, Westerners and Africans.
</P>
<P>
The banks involved are Barclays, Standard Chartered and the
Sierra Leone Commercial Bank, the report said, quoting Justice
Minister Solomon Berewa.
</P>
<P>
The first two are the biggest foreign banks in Sierra Leone,
which only resumed business operations at the end of last month,
20 days after the returned of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah from
exile in neighboring Guinea since may last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the justice minister, the 93 foreigners "are
suspected of having collaborated with the ousted military junta
and also to have defrauded the country of much-needed revenue
through customs duties fraud".
</P>
<P>
Bank sources reportedly said that the sums frozen amounted to
millions of U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The government order to freeze their accounts was delivered
to U.S. together with the list of the 93 yesterday (Monday)," one
banker was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
While the West African Peacekeeping Force ECOMOG is carrying
the final offensive to mop up the remnants of the junta and rebel
allies in the east of the country, the trial of more than 40
junta members and collaborators is going on.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean government earlier this month ordered the
deportation of 22 foreign business nationals living in the
country for their alleged assistance to the junta.
</P>
<P>
The police accused the deportees of violating the economic
sanctions and embargo imposed by west African countries and
importing arms and ammunition for the junta.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Still Undecided on Northern Ireland Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
still considering a trip to Northern Ireland to campaign for a
peace accord despite opposition by some political leaders there,
the White House said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is to attend a summit of the Group of Seven leaders and
Russia in Birmingham in Britain in May. U.S. officials had
indicated that he may go to Northern Ireland during the trip.
</P>
<P>
"We are continuing to hold open that possibility," White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said during a regular briefing on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has said he will leave it up to the governments to
decide if a trip by him would be helpful and will await their
invitation.
</P>
<P>
Such a trip to Belfast would fall just days before a May 22
referendum in Northern Ireland and one in Ireland on whether to
accept a peace agreement reached between the Northern Ireland
parties on April 10.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said U.S. officials were consulting further with the
British and Irish governments and staying in touch with leaders of
the Northern Ireland parties as well.
</P>
<P>
He said deputy National Security Adviser Jim Steinberg was
planning a trip to the region in the next week or so for
consultations.
</P>
<P>
"We will go if it is in the interest of peace in Northern
Ireland," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, leader of the biggest pro-British party in
Northern Ireland, the Ulster Unionist Party, has said Clinton
should not visit before the referendum.

<HEADLINE> German Security Authorities Confirms Authenticity of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- German security authorities Tuesday
confirmed the authenticity of a letter which claimed that the Red
Army Faction (RAF) terrorist group had formally disbanded.
</P>
<P>
In an eight-page typed letter sent to the Reuters news agency in
Bonn on Monday, the RAF, a band of leftist urban guerrillas who
pursued a campaign of bombings, kidnappings and assassinations in
the 1970s and 1980s in a bid to destroy the then West German
society, acknowledged the irrelevancy of their project and
declared themselves disbanded.
</P>
<P>
The German Federal Office of Criminal Police in Wiesbaden on
Tuesday said the letter had been proved to be authentic because
the paper used as well as the two-color RAF seal were identical to
previous letters sent by the group.
</P>
<P>
The latest news, however, has aroused a controversy between
German government officials and opposition parties over whether it
is now time to lift the emergency legislations adopted at the
height of the RAF terrorism in the late 1970s which broadened
police power of surveillance and detention of suspected RAF
members.
</P>
<P>
While opposition parties calling for lifting the special laws,
government officials warned that it was still premature to
proclaim an end of terrorist threat in Germany.
</P>
<P>
German Interior Minister Manfred Kanther on Tuesday also
stressed his opposition to a general amnesty for RAF members.
</P>
<P>
The RAF is believed to responsible for killing at least 30
people, including high-ranking politicians and business
executives.
</P>
<P>
The last assassination for which the group claimed
responsibility was the 1991 murder of Detlef Rohwedder, who headed
the agency established after the German reunification to privatize
former East German state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Not to Change Position on Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States Tuesday
reaffirmed its claim that two Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie
bombing must be tried either in Britain or in the United States,
rather than in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
Washington was reacting to a report that Libyan lawyer Ibrahim
legwell had reached an agreement with Scottish lawyer Robert Black
and Jim Swire, who represents British families of victims of the
1988 Pan Am 103 airliner bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, that
his two clients linked to the bombing will be ready to stand trial
under Scottish law in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
But the United States said it would not change its position.
</P>
<P>
"Libya is obligated under Security Council resolutions to
deliver the suspects for trial in either the U.K. or the U.S.,"
State Department spokesman Lee McClenny said.
</P>
<P>
"We have no doubt that this latest Libyan agreement reflects a
desire to evade its obligations rather than a willingness to see
justice done," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Scottish lawyer Black and Swire held talks
in Tripoli this week with Legwell and Libyan foreign affairs and
justice officials. They also met Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in
a bid to gain support for a trial plan formulated by Black.
</P>
<P>
Legwell said Tuesday that he and the Scottish lawyer agreed "on
several basic points and details."
</P>
<P>
"I confirmed to them... that my clients would stand for trial
before such a court, which will be set not in Scotland nor the
United States, but in a neutral country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We also agreed that it would be established with an
international panel of judges to be agreed upon and presided over
by a senior Scottish judge. The court would operate under the
criminal law and procedure of Scotland," he added.
</P>
<P>
McClenny said, "The British family member who visited Libya is
entitled to his views. Other Pan Am 103 family members will have
their own."
</P>
<P>
The American families of victims of the bombing also denounced
the reported agreement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Takes Measures to Deal With Pilot Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force is to
reduce overseas assignments and increase bonus pay to encourage
fliers to stay longer in the military, as a way to deal with a
potential shortage of pilots, the Air Force chief of staff said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force was reportedly expecting to be 835 pilots short
of its required 14,000 this year and it predicts that by 2002 the
pilot gap could more than double, causing possible readiness and
shortage problems.
</P>
<P>
Air Force Chief of Staff General Michael Ryan said Tuesday that
more than 800 pilots refused bonuses of 60,000 U.S. dollars to
extend their time in service five years beyond the nine they
signed up. Only 36 percent of pilots at the nine-year mark agreed
to stay on, said Ryan.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at the Pentagon that the experienced pilots
are decreasing partly because they were often deployed away from
families or given administrative jobs that take them out of the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the lure of better money in commercial flying also
is adding to a rising attrition rate of veteran Air Force pilots,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's not their fault they're leaving," Ryan said. "It may be
our fault. It's hard work and it's hard on their families."
</P>
<P>
The Air Force is now offering bonuses of up to 110,000 dollars
for a five-year extension, while pilots who agree to stay for a
couple of years more can get an extra 22,000 dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force also is to replace some desk jobs that are now
held by pilots with Air Force personnel who don't fly. And it is
trying to reduce overseas assignments for pilots, including for
military exercises.

<HEADLINE> Libya: Solution to Lockerbie Being Worked Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Libyan official said
Tuesday moves will be taken in days to reach a solution
"acceptable to all" on ending the Libya-West crisis over Lockerbie
air bombing, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Libyan Secretary of Justice and Public Security Mohamed
Belqassim al-Zawi made the remarks following a meeting with Arab
League (AL) Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid to coordinate
future moves to settle the dispute over the trial of two Libyans
suspected in blowing up a Pan-Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland,
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Al-Zawi said their talks covered the recent decision by the
International Court of Justice (ICJ) to handle the crisis and the
recent special session of the U.N. Security Council to follow up
the latest developments.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sanctions were imposed on Libya in 1992 in response to
Tripoli's refusal to hand over the two Libyan suspects in the
bombing of the Pan-Am flight in which 270 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the U.S. insist the two Libyans be tried in Britain
or the U.S., a stance rejected by Libya.
</P>
<P>
Libya has said more and more countries have supported Libya in
terms of reaching a compromise on having the two Libyans stand
trial in a neutral country no matter who the judges will be or who
will choose them.
</P>
<P>
Al-Zawi attributed this to years of efforts by Tripoli, the AL,
the Organization of African Unity, the Non-Alignment Movement and
the Organization of Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
He said Tripoli has reached an agreement with Jim Swire and
Robert Black, two representatives of the British victims, to exert
collective efforts to pressurize Britain and the U.S. to accept a
flexible and peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
Swire and Black visited Libya on Thursday, carrying suggestions
to Libyan officials on bringing the two Libyan suspects to trial
before an international judiciary body, comprising five judges,
presided over by a Scottish judge to be appointed by the British
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Libya-West showdown has been again put under the spotlight
following the ICJ ruling in February, that the court has the
authority to settle the Lockerbie case.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have watered down the ruling and insisted
that the Security Council is the body concerned with the issue.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: U.S. Willing to Help Better Greek-Turkish Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States was willing to
help Greece and neighboring Turkey to improve their strained
relations, said U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen after meeting
his Greek counterpart Akis Tsohatzopoulos on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Cohen, who arrived here Tuesday
from Turkey on a lightning visit, said that they discussed the
Greek-Turkish relations, the Cyprus problem and the situation in
the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Washington was willing to help both countries turn
from an atmosphere of suspicion to a climate of trust, calling on
an end to the use of threat of force.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should resolve their disputes through
negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
With an increase in contacts and the exchange of ideas, the
possibility of a peaceful solution of Greek-Turkish differences
was increased.
</P>
<P>
Describing Cyprus' deployment of Russian-made S-300 anti-
aircraft missiles as "a mistake," Cohen stressed that ways must be
found to bring Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots to talks.
</P>
<P>
As for the Balkan rapid-reaction force, he said that U.S. could
also help in the creation of a multinational force for the Balkans
with the aim of aiding regional stability and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Tsohatzopoulos said that Greece was concerned
about the security of Cyprus and would stand by it in the defense
of rights as long as there was a threat whether from Turkish
troops on the island or from the refusal of Turkey to contribute
to the ending of the military cooperation and to an acceptable
resolution of the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Namibia's Diamond Output Expected to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Namibia's diamond output is
expected to grow significantly after Namibian Minerals
Corporation (Namco) recovered gem quality diamonds off the
Namibian coast.
</P>
<P>
It is envisaged that with the entry of Namco into offshore
mining, offshore diamond production in Namibia would increase by
up to 20 percent this year, South African Press Association
(SAPA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Namibia's total diamond production could increase by more than
500,000 carats a year, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Namco estimated that it would recover 150,000 carats of
diamonds valued at about 27 million U.S. Dollars in the first
year of production.
</P>
<P>
The company started operation at the Koichab area in Luderitz
Bay early this year.
</P>
<P>
Namco's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Alastair
Holberton, was quoted as saying at the weekend that 95 percent of
the diamonds recovered are of gem quality.
</P>
<P>
Namco has reportedly finalized a three-year marketing
agreement with IDC Holdings, a private company based in London
and Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
IDC's Managing Director, Jack Lumer, said that the shape and
purity of the diamonds recovered by Namco were particularly
attractive to manufacturers and that he did not envisage any
problems in establishing a strong overseas demand for the gems.

<HEADLINE> Greek Army Chief in Cyprus for Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chief of Staff of the Greek Army
Athanasios Tzoganis pledged here Wednesday that Cyprus and Greece
will enhance military cooperation in accordance with the joint
defense pact between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Tzoganis made the remarks upon his arrival here Wednesday for a
three-day official visit to Cyprus, which is the first of its kind
by a Greek army chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
The Greek military official told reporters that he will have
meetings with Cypriot political and military leaders and will be
briefed on military issues regarding Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Tzoganis noted that "Cyprus' defense capability is today at a
far better level than ever before, especially since the
implementation of the joint defense pact." He was referring to the
joint defense pact signed between the two countries in November
1993, which provides protection for Cyprus' air and sea by Greece
in case of a new Turkish offensive against the island.
</P>
<P>
"We can confront existing threats to a great extent and the
reason I am here is to continue efforts for improvement and
examine the solution of possible problems or face any threats,"
Tzoganis said.
</P>
<P>
On Cypriot government's decision to purchase Russian-made
anti-aircraft missiles, Tzoganis said "Cyprus is an independent
state and it is its government that takes these decisions,
therefore I'm sure that every decision taken would be to the
benefit of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Later Wednesday, Tzoganis had a meeting with Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides, during which they exchanged views on military
issues concerning Greece and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Tzoganis is expected to visit a newly-built
military air base in the western coastal district of Paphos, which
is to be named after the late Greek Prime Minister Andreas
Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has warned that it will destroy military aircraft
deployed on the air base if it is used by Greece.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained about 40,000 troops in the northern part
of the island. Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which is only
recognized by Turkey.

This was revealed by Doje Cering, Chinese Minister of Civil
Affairs, while meeting with Eduardo Rodrigues, Portuguese minister
of Solidarity and Social Security, here today.
</P>
<P>
Aging will be a major problem that China has to face in the
future, he said, and both men agreed that exchanges and
cooperation on research on aging should be increased, because it
is a challenge to most countries.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 120 million senior citizens, who account
for 9 percent of its population, Doje Cering said. A recent survey
showed that the number of the elderly in China is growing at 3
percent annually, and by the year 2030, the number of the elderly
is expected to exceed the population of Europe.
</P>
<P>
China is ready to increase exchanges with all countries and to
learn from their experience, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rodrigues said the problem is global and that he hopes that
Portugal and China will increase exchanges between experts and
make a joint effort to find solutions to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Doje Cering also gave Rodrigues a briefing of the structure and
functions of his ministry and the Basic Social Security System in
China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Comments On Finding Jobs For Unemployed Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji told a State
Council meeting in Beijing today that the Chinese Communist Party
and the Government are confident they can solve the employment
problem for urban people and are sure of establishing a social
security system with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The loss of jobs is inevitable in the course of readjusting the
industrial structure and building a socialist market economy, Zhu
said, and as the economic structure and science and technology
improve, the number of the laid-off will increase, so
re-employment is a normal and long-term process.
</P>
<P>
He said that a rudimentary plan to offer basic needs and new
jobs to workers who are laid off has been formed and he hoped that
departments will get opinions from various sectors.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference who were present at the meeting
expressed great concern about the re-employment question and said
they are satisfied with the arrangements of the CPC Central
Committee and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
They said that government departments need to help workers
change their concept of employment and try to find jobs in other
fields like the service trade and non-state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Also present at today's forum were Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo,
State Councillor and Secretary General of the State Council Wang
Zhongyu, and a number of vice-chairmen of the CPPCC National
Committee.

<HEADLINE> HK's 1st Central Slaughter Facility for Live Ducks to Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's first ever central
slaughter facility for live ducks and other water birds will start
operation early Thursday morning in a poultry stall at the Western
Wholesale Food Market.
</P>
<P>
The stall has obtained a Fresh Provision Shop license from the
Urban Services Department (USD) here on Wednesday. It was the
first such license ever issued for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
It begins operation early Thursday morning and is expected to
provide a few hundred freshly slaughtered, locally-bred ducks on
the first morning, a spokesman for the Agriculture and Fisheries
Department (AFD) announced here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The samples of water birds from these local farms had been
tested by AFD staff to be free from H5N1 virus.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government
had designed the poultry market as centralized facility for the
slaughtering and dressing of water birds under the new policy
requiring the segregation of live chickens and water birds
announced in February.
</P>
<P>
The original facilities of the stalls in the market had to be
updated to meet the necessary requirements for obtaining a Fresh
Provision Shop license.

China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The visit lasted from April 18 to 22 and the officials say they

<HEADLINE> Technology Adds Value to HK Economy: Businessman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- New technology plays a critical
role in building Hong Kong into Asia's leading metropolitan
economy, a well-known Hong Kong businessman said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on Hong Kong's competitiveness, Chairman
of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council Victor Fung described
Hong Kong as a "metropolitan economy," like London and New York,
which is externally oriented and services dominated.
</P>
<P>
No other regional city is as well-positioned as Hong Kong to
assume the role of the leading metropolitan economy in the Asia
Pacific region, Fung stressed.
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't mean bringing every type of economic activity
inside Hong Kong. "We should focus Hong Kong's role as a
management center, a financial center, and a center for the
headquarters of multinational firms doing business in the region,
among others," he continued.
</P>
<P>
But in achieving the leading position in the region Hong Kong
faces two inter-linked challenges: upgrading the technological
capacities of Hong Kong firms and upgrading the skills of the
workforce, the businessman noted.
</P>
<P>
"This means that inside Hong Kong's borders we must build a
first-class technological environment for our companies," Fung
said, adding that the hardest task will be to equip Hong Kong's
workforce with the sophisticated skills necessary to create and
extract the greatest value from the new technologies.
</P>
<P>
In terms of Hong Kong's technological environment and the
technological sophistication of the workforce, Hong Kong stands
just in the middle of the pack over the world. "We need to aim
for the very top," Fung noted.
</P>
<P>
A large number of government officials, business people and
economic experts attended the half-day seminar organized by the
government's Central Policy Unit.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier, Allied Militiaman Wounded in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 22 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier and a
pro-Israeli militiaman were wounded Wednesday during Lebanese
guerrilla attacks in south Lebanon, the country's Voice of the
People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli soldier was wounded when his position at the
hilltop of Radar inside the Israeli occupied south Lebanon came
under mortar barrages by the guerrillas of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted security sources in the country's coastal
city of Tyre, not far from the occupied zone, as saying that they
saw a total of five missiles landed inside and around the Radar
position at noon.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the attack, Israeli artillery bombarded the
villages of Mensulia and Majdal Zoun, north of the western sector
of the zone, believed to be the Hezbollah hideaways.
</P>
<P>
The shelling did not cause any casualties, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a member of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanese Army (SLA) was wounded by a roadside bomb explosion
inside the SLA-controlled town of Jezzine in the northern part of
the zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer "security zone" in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the proclaimed aim of protecting its northern
settlements from cross-border Lebanese guerrilla attacks. Since
then, the Israeli occupying forces and the SLA have been engaged
in a war of attrition with a resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Navy to Get Frigates from U.K. Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian navy will
receive two GEC-Yarrow F-2000 guided-missile frigates from Yarrow
Shipbuilders LTD of Scotland by early next year, Navy Chief
Vice-Admiral Ahmad Ramli Nor said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The plan is for them (Yarrow) to deliver the frigates by the
end of this year and we receive them early next year. We will then
begin the process to commission the ship into the navy's armada,"
he was quoted by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama as
saying at the on-going Defense Services Asia '98 (DSA '98) here.
</P>
<P>
The navy chief cited difficulties in integrating various
state-of-the-art combat systems on board the ships -- KD Jebat and
KD Lekiu -- as the main reason behind the frigates' late delivery.
</P>
<P>
The ship's combat system was made by a Dutch-based company
while the cannon and missiles system was from France and the sonar
from Germany.
</P>
<P>
He said the various systems installed on the 1.42 billion
ringgit (about 380.697 million U.S. dollars) frigates needed a
powerful computer for processing a high flow of information which
was the main cause of the problem.
</P>
<P>
The frigates were planned to be armed with Bofors 57mm guns,
British Aerospace Dynamic Vertical Launch Seawolf air defense
missiles and Aerospatiale MM-40 Exocet anti-ship missiles.
</P>
<P>
He said the navy had not decided on the type of the shipborne
helicopter to complement the frigate's role.
</P>
<P>
There are about 20 Malaysian navy personnel stationed at the
shipyard to oversee the project and to familiarize themselves with
the technology on board the ships.

CHANGCHUN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A week-long exhibition started
today in China's Jilin province to get humans better acquainted
with their friends, the bird.
</P>
<P>
It has displays and picture shows to help people learn more
about birds' habits, migration, and the protection they need,
according to the provincial museum of natural history.
</P>
<P>
There are some 9,000 types of birds on earth now, 1,100 of
which exist in China. Jilin is reported to have 328 kinds,
including 60 on the state protection list.
</P>
<P>
But, their numbers are decreasing sharply and some rare species
are even on the verge of extinction because of environmental
pollution, forest destruction, and bird poaching, says Yang Shihe,
secretary-general of the Jilin Provincial Wildlife Protection
Association.
</P>
<P>
In response to the State Council's call to help the birds in
1981, the provincial government has held a series of activities
like tree planting, hanging up bird houses, summer camps, and
seminars, to help people, especially children, be more aware of
the importance of wildlife protection.
</P>

MOSCOW, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The speaker of the Russian
Federation Council said Wednesday that he is confident of the
approval of Sergei Kiriyenko as prime minister by the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
Yegor Stroyev, chairman of the Council (the upper house of
parliament), said the Duma (the lower house) is sure to approve
Kiriyenko's candidacy in its third round of voting so as to keep
itself from being dissolved.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev's confidence came after his talks with leaders of Duma
factions.
</P>

The State Duma, which has already defied President Boris
Yeltsin's nomination of Kiriyenko twice, is due to hold the final
vote on the 35-year-old former energy minister on Friday.
</P>
<P>
If it rejects Kiriyenko again, Yeltsin will be obliged to use
his constitutional powers to dissolve the chamber and call a
parliamentary election.

"The president will hold a meeting with the State Duma speaker,
Gennady Seleznyov, and Federation Council Chairman Yegor Stroyev
on Thursday," a Kremlin spokesman said on Wednesday.
</P>

Meanwhile, Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Communist
Party, the largest Duma faction, said the Communists' stand on

<HEADLINE> China Looking For Fair Competition In Telecommunications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Li Huifen, the CEO of China
United Telecommunications Corp., told the 1998 China Business
Summit of the World Economic Forum here today that China is
redoubling its efforts to promote fair competition in the
telecommunications sector by drawing a clear line between the
function of government and enterprises and improving legislation.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Ministry of Information Industry will help
the development of a competitive mechanism in the domestic
telecommunications market and that, as an administrative institute
of the information industry, the Ministry will not interfere in
the operations of telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
She said that there won't be a case of it being both a player
and a judge in a competitive market.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom, which was set up in 1994 to break the 40-year-old
monopoly of China's telecommunications by China Telecom, is the
only other national state-owned company providing basic
telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China also needs a better legal framework to halt
monopolies and to see that there is fair competition.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom has a mobile telephone network in over 80 cities,
and local telephone operations in two cities and is building
another local telephone network in Chengdu, in southwestern
China. The number of customers is expected to exceed one million
by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> China Needs More Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China's need for airplanes will
increase greatly in the next few years, according to Chen Feng,
chairman and president of Hainan Airlines Company Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Chen told the 1998 China Business Summit of the World Economic
Forum here today that the number of passenger and cargo planes
flying feeder routes in the country is inadequate to meet the
demands of China's fast growing economy.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the volume of domestic air transport will grow
steadily over the next 20 or so years. In 1996, one out of every
25 Chinese flew at least once and that was about a sixth of the
world average. At the same time, demand for air transport grew at
twice the world average.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that civil airlines are in great need of cargo
planes. There are only 8 cargo planes flying on non-trunk routes
in the country at present, and the capacity of feeder routes still
lags far behind that of rapidly expanding trunk routes.
</P>
<P>
He said that the growth of small regions and complex
topographical factors call for an expansion of feeder lines.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, China has imported a number of 100- to
200-seat aircraft from foreign manufacturers like Boeing, and that
civil airlines will decide the type of sideline airplanes they
want according to the length of feeder routes and their specific
operating costs.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has applied to the
Western European Union (WEU) for associate partnership status,
Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a cabinet meeting, Kasoulides
noted that it is natural for a country already in accession talks
with the European Union (EU), to seek a "proportional" position in
the WEU.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, which applied for EU membership in July 1990, started
accession talks with the EU on March 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The WEU has been inviting Central and Eastern European states
to apply for the associate partnership status.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said his country's application for such a
status will cement the Cyprus-WEU ties. He revealed that Cyprus
has had consultations with WEU since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Based on the Brussels Treaty of 1948, the WEU was set up in
1955. It has 10 full members, while another 18 countries are
linked through partnership and association agreements.
</P>
<P>
Through the organization, member states seek to harmonize their
views on security and defense questions.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets Leaders of Japanese Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 22 (Xinhua)-- China's new Vice-President Hu Jintao
said Wednesday that party diplomacy has played an important role
in promoting bilateral relations and mutual understanding between
China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
During separate meetings with leaders of the Japanese parties,
Hu called for joint efforts by Chinese and Japanese political
parties to boost the two countries' friendly ties as they went
into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party is ready to strengthen its
exchanges and cooperation with the political parties in Japan on
the basis of independence, equality, mutual respect and
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Among the party leaders Hu met are Koichi Kato of Japan's
ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Takako Doi of the Social
Democratic Party (SDP), Hiroyuki Sonoda of New Party Sakigake and
Ichiro Ozawa of Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the statesmen of China and Japan shoulder the
responsibility of advancing a long-term, stable and
good-neighborly bilateral relationship oriented towards the next
century.
</P>
<P>
To this end, it's very important to strictly abide by the
spirit and principles set in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and
the Peace and Friendship Treaty, take lessons from history, expand
mutually beneficial cooperation and handle bilateral ties in a
responsible manner, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the two countries should educate their young
generations with the spirit of long-term Sino-Japanese friendship,
and encourage them to contribute to bilateral, friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Japanese political parties told Hu that they
are willing to reinforce exchanges and cooperation with the
Communist Party of China (CPC), and work for the comprehensive
development of Japan-China good-neighborly ties.
</P>
<P>
Koichi Kato, secretary-general of Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), said that both Japan and China are big
nations and the LDP is ready to make in-depth exchanges of views
with the CPC to contribute to understanding and friendship between
the peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Takako Doi, head of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), said
regular consultations between her party and the CPC, which started
in 1983, have been playing an important role in enhancing
friendship between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
The SDP, by abiding by the principles of Japan-China Joint
Statement and the Japan-China Peace and Friendship Treaty, and by
not forgetting the history, will continue its efforts towards
forging "new era-oriented" Sino-Japanese ties, Doi said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-president, who arrived here Tuesday for a
six-day visit, also met leaders from New Democratic Party of
Japan, New Peace Party and Komei Party.

<P>
YANGON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government Wednesday
rejected allegations against it of human rights abuse and ethnic
repression.
</P>
<P>
The rejection is believed to be directed against a resolution
on the human rights situation in Myanmar presented at a current
meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The anti-Myanmar-government elements routinely, through
Amnesty International, are deliberately fabricating such stories
to influence a report to the committee on the human rights
situation in Myanmar," the government said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government also refuted allegation that it imposed
"oppressive measures against ethnic and religious minorities". It
said 99 percent of all the armed ethnic groups have renounced

<HEADLINE> Tung Encourages HK's Future Immigration Officers to Serve the SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa said
here Wednesday that the Immigration Department plays an important
role in maintaining the social stability and internal security of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a passing out parade of the Immigration Service
Training School, Tung told the young people participating the
parade that they will add new strength to the Immigration
Department and they have chosen a meaningful career for the
well-being of the society.
</P>
<P>
While exercising effective immigration control at Hong Kong's
land, sea and air entry points, the department works closely with
the Police and the Labor Department in detecting illegal
immigration and illegal employment, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Department has also made remarkable
achievements in the investigation of and the combat against the
use of forged documents, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, apart from handling a huge amount of day-to-day work,
the department was heavily involved in the work connected with the
 return of Hong Kong to the motherland, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
This work includes the issue of the HKSAR passports; the
implementation of the provisions of the Basic Law on the right of
abode; the implementation of new arrangements for overseas issue
of travel documents, visas and permits for entry into Hong Kong;
and the handling of all matters relating to nationality on behalf
of the Central People's Government.
</P>
<P>
In the face of these historical missions, all members of the
Immigration Service could pride themselves on the dedication and
professionalism they displayed in the successful completion of all
 the important tasks they were charged with, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the continued efforts in promoting the HKSAR
passport to the governments of foreign countries and securing the
grant of visa-free access to foreign countries for HKSAR passport
holders, the department is actively examining ways to facilitate
the entry of visitors, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Department has also striven for further improvement in the
efficiency and quality of services through policy and procedural
reviews, and the use of advanced technology, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the department has completed the restructuring of
the immigration officer grade and resumed the recruitment of
immigration officers, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"After intensive and tough induction training, you would
definitely help the Department in serving the community," Tung
told the trainees. "I hope that you all take pride in the service
you are going to render," he added.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Rejects Britain's Delinking Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat has rejected a British proposal on separating the issue of
Gaza airport from Israel's further redeployment in the West Bank,
Israel Radio reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted diplomatic sources in Jerusalem as saying
that Arafat's position could make it very difficult for the
upcoming London talks to achieve progress in advancing the stalled
peace process.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who wrapped up a three-day
visit to the region Tuesday, proposed that Israel and the
Palestinians first settle the Gaza airport issue and the launching
of the Karni industrial park on which they have agreed in
principle.
</P>
<P>
He believed that once they make progress on the interim issues,
new momentum could be created to break the year-old deadlock in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been insisting on an early implementation
of the long overdue Israeli redeployment in the West Bank as well
as a settlement of issues including the building of an airport and
seaport, and a safe passage between Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
However, Blair did succeed in persuading Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to attend the London meetings in
early May, during which the U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright will talk with them separately before a summit can be
held.
</P>
<P>
Arafat flew to Egypt Wednesday, one day after Blair's visit,
for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Mubarak has
invited Netanyahu for a meeting in Cairo to discuss the dangerous
situation of the peace process prior to the London meetings.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mousa said Arafat and Mubarak
discussed the U.S. proposal on Israel's second troop redeployment
in the West Bank and the Palestinian side has accepted the
U.S. plan for a 13.1 percent pullback in a period of 12 weeks in
exchange for new Palestinian security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu convened his security cabinet early Wednesday to
discuss the redeployment. But so far there has been no sign that
Netanyahu is willing to give up more than 9 percent of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Mubarak apparently tried to coordinate their
positions before U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross' return
to the region to sell the U.S. idea on Israeli withdrawal and work
out an agenda for the London meetings.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Mortality Rate Continues to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- About 6 out of every 1,000
Chinese died of illness, traffic accidents, poisoning, suicides,
and other causes last year, according to a Ministry of Health
report today.
</P>
<P>
The mortality rate in China has been falling in the past 40
years. In the 1950s, it was 11 out of 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The rate in cities is a bit lower than in rural areas, and
death of males is higher than that of females, whether in cities
or in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Life in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai seems to cause
more deaths than in small and medium-sized cities. In big cities
there were more than 6 deaths per 1,000 people, compared to 4 per
1,000 in small and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the drop in the mortality rate did
not mean an increase in the natural growth rate, the difference
between the rate of births and the rate of deaths.
</P>
<P>
The population growth rate has continued to fall over the past
four decades, mainly because of a decrease of the birth rate.
</P>
<P>
From 1957 to 1997, China's birth rate had dropped from 34.03
per 1,000 to 16.57 per 1,000, and the natural growth rate of
population from 23.23 per 1,000 to 10.06 per 1,000.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Calls for More Urgent Aid to S. Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) Carol Bellamy Wednesday called for more
emergency aid to southern Sudan at the end of her five-day visit
to Kenya, Somalia and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
She left for west Africa later the day after reviewing
UNICEF's humanitarian activities in the three countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are in a critical period -- with 300,000-350,000 --
vulnerable people at risk in the (southern Sudan's) Bar El Ghazal
alone. We are in the 'hungry' season," she said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
"We must also have more funding for seeds, tools and medicines
and more food pledges -- without this we cannot provide the
assistance required and thousands will die in the coming months,"
she warned, adding that the body needs two more planes to deliver
food in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
However, UNICEF, the coordinator of international aid
operations to southern Sudan through the Operation Lifeline Sudan
(OLS), "is pleased with the Sudanese government access clearance
earlier this month," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Now OLS, made up of UNICEF, World Food Program (WFP) and 35
non-governmental organizations, enjoys "the best access to its
operational areas, particular in the Bahr El Ghazal" after the
aid suspension in the previous two months, she said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the WFP warned that the food situation in the Bahr
el Ghazal region has reached a critical level and the region
would face catastrophe unless it receives more relief food soon.
</P>
<P>
Food needs in the area are estimated at a minimum requirement
of 6,000 tons for 350,000 of the worst affected people there.
</P>
<P>
Other areas in southern Sudan like Upper Nile and Eastern
Equatoria are also facing serious food shortages due to a
combination of drought and war, said the OLS earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese civil war broke out in 1983 when the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army (SPLA) re-started fights against the
Muslim-ruled north for more autonomy and religion freedom in the
animist and Christian-dominated south.
</P>
<P>
At least 1.3 million Sudanese have been killed by war or
war-related famine since then.

<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in a
meeting here today with Portugal's Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres, said that China and Portugal and the European Union
should make joint efforts to bring peace, stability and prosperity
to the world in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the prime minister's visit is very important
because of Macao's return to China next year, and that friendly
relations between China and Portugal will be further promoted and
cooperation in the last phase of the transition period
strengthened through this visit.
</P>
<P>
He said that as long as both parties emphasize the overall
situation and long-term stability and development of Macao, and
solve certain problems, the transition will be smooth.
</P>
<P>
China values its relations with Portugal, Jiang said, and is
willing to further develop long-term friendly and cooperative
relations based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit. He
said he is satisfied with the bilateral relations that have
developed since diplomatic ties were established 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Guterres said that political relations between the two
countries are good, and economic cooperation is fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Guterres came to China last Sunday for a five-day official
visit. He said that Portuguese enterpreneurs are interested in the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Guterres that strengthening cooperation between Asia
and Europe and between China and European countries is significant
to world peace and development, and that China and the EU are two
important forces in the world, and China values its long stable
relations with the EU and its member countries.
</P>
<P>
Guterres said that relations between the EU and China are an
important part of the current situation as the global economy
grows and political relations become multi-polarized.

<P>
DAMASCUS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Kuwaiti National
Assembly (Parliament) Ahmed Abdul Aziz Al-Sadoun stressed here
Wednesday that Israel should withdraw from south Lebanon immediately
and unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Israel's proposal to withdraw from south Lebanon conditionally
is unacceptable for Lebanon, Syria or the Arab nation, Al-Sadoun
told reporters before ending a three-day visit to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided on April 1 to endorse the United Nations
Security Council Resolution 425 demanding a unilateral Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon. But meanwhile, it said no troops would
be pulled back unless security arrangements are negotiated with
the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which wants the return of the Golan Heights
captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War, have rejected the
offer. They insist that the withdrawal be unconditional.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agree to coordinate their stances on key
issues and not to unilaterally make peace with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Al-Sadoun held talks with Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad in the coastal resort of Latakia on bilateral,
regional and Arab issues.
</P>
<P>
He voiced support of Kuwait for Syria's principal position on
the Middle East peace process and other issues of the Arab world.

<HEADLINE> Australia: Traditional Family Is Fading Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The notion of a traditional
nuclear family in Australia is fading fast with one in four
children living with only one of their natural parents, official
statistics showed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) family survey found,
out of 4.6 million children aged under 18 in the country, 1.1
million lived with only one of their natural parents, usually as a
result of marriage breakdown.
</P>
<P>
It found almost one quarter, or 200,000 children, had no
contact with their other parents, either by visits, phone or
letter.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1.1 million children, there are more than 800,000
children lived in one-parent families while 350,000 lived in step
or blended families.
</P>
<P>
In the five years since the last ABS family survey, another
83,000, or 7.5 percent of new one-parent families were created.

NAIROBI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- At least 47 people were killed
by a weekend bush fire in northern swamp area of Tonj Country in
southern Sudan's Bahr el Ghazal Province.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here Wednesday by the World Vision said

The fire swept through a settlement at the swamplands near the
village of Ananatak on April 19 where people in this area of
southern Sudan traditionally move to in the dry season in search
of water.
</P>
<P>
A World Vision team rushed to the site and discovered the
charred corpses of at least 15 people, said the press release,
adding that the death toll stood at 47 on April 21.
</P>
<P>
The release noted that the World Vision compound there also
sustained damage during a dust storm caused by strong winds.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets With Japanese Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao said Wednesday that the development of Sino-Japanese
friendly and cooperative ties has brought great benefits to the
two countries and the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks here during a meeting with Japanese Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
Noting that bilateral relations have made remarkable progress
in various fields since the normalization of diplomatic ties
between the two countries, Hu expressed appreciation over Japan's
positive attitude in promoting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Hu also said it was his belief that the significant visit to
Japan by Chinese President Jiang Zemin this fall, to mark the 20th
anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Peace and Friendship
Treaty, will further boost the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan are two influential countries in Asia and the
world, Hu said. In the nearing 21st century, the enhancement of
good neighborly ties on the basis of adhering to the Sino-Japanese
Joint Statement and the Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty
not only conforms to the fundmental interests of the two peoples,
but is conducive to peace, stability and prosperity in Asia and
the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Hu hoped Japan would face up to history, walk along the road of
peaceful development, correctly handle issues relating to its
relations with Taiwan, and never do anything harmful to China's
cause of reunification.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese Communist Party and the government would
consistently uphold a friendly policy towards Japan, and were
willing to make joint efforts with Japan to promote long-term,
stable and healthy development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Referring to bilateral economic ties, Hu said such relations
constitute important parts of bilateral friendly ties.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that China and Japan are complementary in
resources, technology and markets, Hu said he hoped the two
countries would further promote economic trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Congratulating Hu on his assuming the Chinese vice-presidency,
Obuchi said he agreed with Hu's evaluation of Sino-Japanese
relations.
</P>
<P>
Japan will work for friendly Sino-Japanese ties oriented toward
the next century on the basis of serious introspection over the
past unfortunate history, Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Hu's current trip and the forthcoming visit to
Japan by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Obuchi said it was rare
for China's president and vice president to visit Japan within one
year. He believed the visits would greatly boost bilateral
friendly ties.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Obuchi hosted a banquet in honor of Hu.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua)-- About 50,000 officers from the
People's Liberation Army and the armed police force will be
transferred to civilian work this year.
</P>
<P>
A national meeting on the placement of these officers that
concluded here today called concerned departments to do a good job
in making appropriate arrangements for the placement of these
people.
</P>
<P>
The meeting pointed out that to help these people find civilian
jobs that suit them best in terms of intelligence and competence
has a direct bearing on the success of China's disarmament plan.
</P>
<P>
At the 15th national congress of the Chinese Communist Party
last October, the Party's general secretary jiang Zemin announced
that beginning 1998, China would reduce its armed forces by
500,000 by year 2,000.
</P>
<P>
The meeting said any Party and government organizations and
enterprises should not refuse to accept the demobilized officers
under any excuses while the demobilized armymen should take the
interest of the whole into account and be cooperative in this
regard.

<HEADLINE> Marine Resources Becoming Major Part Of China's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China plans to make marine
resources a major part of the country's economic development in
the next century, according to Jiang Chengsong, vice-minister of
Land and Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 28th World Earth Day ceremonies, Jiang said
China's marine economy has grown at an annual rate of more than 20
percent over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
He said he expects the marine sector to have 500 billion yuan
in output value by the year 2000, or 5 percent of the country's
total GDP, and that will increase to 10 percent by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The country's marine economy mainly includes fisheries, salt
production, and shipping. China produces a fourth of the world's
aquatic products, and has ranked first in output worldwide for 7
years running.
</P>
<P>
It has developed 16,000 hectares of salt pans and has become
one of the world's largest sea salt producers.
</P>
<P>
Ocean transportation has also been growing rapidly, and its
main ports can handle more than 800 million tons annually.
</P>
<P>
Offshore oil and gas, marine fish breeding, tourism, marine
resources, and mining are all growing rapidly, Jiang said, and
China has made great headway in protecting its marines resources
for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
He said that China strictly abides by the U.N. Maritime
Convention and has its own maritime laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
To develop marine resources in a better way, China has drawn up
the National Marine Development Program, Policy on Marine
Technology, and Agenda on Marine Development in 21st Century, he
said, and is now drafting a white paper on the maritime policy.

<HEADLINE> Indian Govt to Speed up Insurance Sector Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Indian Minister of State for
Finance R. K. Kumar said Wednesday that insurance sector reform in
the country must proceed quickly to enable strengthening of the
Indian financial sector.
</P>
<P>
It would also provide vital long term savings for investments
in the infrastructure sector, he said while addressing an
international conference on insurance here.
</P>
<P>
Multinationals and developed countries have time and again
urged India to open up its insurance sector to the outside world,
yet the previous governments were quite cautious on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Monopoly in any sector is not conducive to efficiency and it is
necessary to provide competition to the state owned insurance
companies like life insurance corporation and general insurance
corporation by private sector Indian companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The BJP-led government would consider the issue of insurance
reforms expeditiously and put in place a strong regulatory
mechanism for healthy participation by other players, he further
said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese FM Meets Ambassadors on Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz Wednesday met the ambassadors of the five permanent
members of the United Nations Security Council to explain
Lebanon's stance on Israel's withdrawal offer.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz told the ambassadors of China, Russia, France, the
United States and Britain that Israel's offer to withdraw from
south Lebanon is a "maneuver" aimed at separating Lebanon from
Syria in their peace talks with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided on April 1 to endorse the U.N. resolution 425,
which demands a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon. But
meanwhile, it said no troops would be pulled back unless security
arrangements are negotiated with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which agree not to unilaterally make peace
with Israel, have rejected the offer. They insist that the
withdrawal be unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz expressed hope that the five nations will support
Lebanon's position on the issue and help stop Israeli occupation
of its southern territories.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to meet with ambassadors of Arab, non-aligned
and European countries on Thursday in an effort to rally support
for the Lebanese stance.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon to allegedly protect its northern areas from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> China to Focus on Water Conservancy Projects (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Zhu, China is one of 13 countries with an
inadequate water supply, with per capita consumption equal to
one-fourth of the world's average. The utilization ratio of water
energy is only 10 percent, which has become a "bottleneck"
hindering the country's economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has invested more than 200 billion
yuan to build 85,000 reservoirs and 200,000 kilometers of dikes
and dams since 1949. As a result, the additional irrigated land
has reached 36 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
Though China invested 23.8 billion yuan on water facilities in
1996, 14.1 billion yuan more than 1992 figure, Zhu said the
country still needs to invest more. Most of the country's water
irrigation works were built in the 1950s or the 1960s, which
means they need to be outdated or repaired.
</P>
<P>
Zhu emphasized that the Central Government has earmarked a
special fund for key water projects. Local governments also
initiated a fund for the construction of local water facilities.
</P>
<P>
To raise more funds for water conservancy construction, he
said China should attract more overseas investment. So far,
China has introduced 770 million U.S. dollars of direct
overseas investment for the projects.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Water Resources has entrusted the Bank of China
to make preparations for an investment fund for medium- and
small-sized hydropower stations, which is a good example of ways
the country can absorb more overseas funds, he said.

<HEADLINE> German MP Calls for Removal of Iran-German Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Germany should commit
themselves to removing hurdles in order to improve their ice-cold
relations, visiting German parliamentarian Gunter Verhugen was
quoted as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local daily Iran News, Verhugen said that
Bonn "seeks closer cooperation with Iran but this necessitates
action by both sides."
</P>
<P>
He named the Mykonos case and the death sentence on the German
merchant Helmut Hoffer in Iran as the two main obstacles to better
relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A Berlin court last April accused Iranian leaders of
involvement in the assassination of four Iranian Kurdish leaders
in the Mykonos restaurant in Berlin in 1992, stirring a political
crisis between Iran and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
It was only until last November that relations between the EU
and Iran returned to normal. But this did not last long when an
Iranian court sentence the Germany merchant to death for having
illegal sexual relations with an Iranian woman.
</P>
<P>
Verhugen arrived here Monday on a visit aimed at convincing
Tehran to pardon Hoffer.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is a reliable trade partner for Germany and I encourage
the German government to invest in Iran and to attempt to solve
the political differences now looming," he said.

<HEADLINE> Alleviating Unemployment to Be Main Priority of Thai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
said Wednesday that one of his government's priorities has been
the prevention and alleviation of the unemployment problem.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the
International Labor Office's (ILO's) High-Level Tripartite Meeting
on Social Responses to the Financial Crisis in East and Southeast
Asian Countries held here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Towards this end, I believe a comprehensive labor policy and
employment schemes -- focusing upon labor market information,
skill training, job creation and placement, wages and social
security systems, and industrial relations -- are necessary," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for equal importance to be given to national and
international economic and social development policies.
</P>
<P>
Chuan noted that national action will not suffice and therefore
called for international cooperation at the international level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ILO Director-General Michel Hansenne highlighted the
impact of the economic crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
An ILO report predicted that unemployment rates in Thailand,
Indonesia and South Korea, the three countries hardest hit by the
financial crisis, will rise to 6 percent, 10 percent and 7 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Hansenne said the ILO stands ready to assist governments to
face up to the "vigorous structural reform" required, to enhance
the necessary dialogue between governments, workers and employers
and to put in place social safety nets which "not only soften the
blows of crisis but contribute to preventing them from occurring."
</P>
<P>
The three-day high-level tripartite meeting involves workers,
employers and governments facing the negative social consequences
of the financial crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will focus on employment and social protection
issues and review the social consequences of reform policies,
propose actions at country level and discuss follow-up measures.

<HEADLINE> Cancer, Respiratory Illness Are China's Biggest Health Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- About 135 out of every 100,000
Chinese urbanities died of cancer and some 147 out of every
100,000 rural people died of respiratory illnesses last year,
according to a report released by the Ministry of Health today,
making them the major cause of death in China.
</P>
<P>
Cancer has replaced cerebral hemorrhage as the No.1 killer in
cities and was responsible for more deaths than in 1996. Males
seem to be more susceptible to the deadly diseases than females.
</P>
<P>
Respiratory illnesses caused fewer deaths than in 1996, but
still remained the biggest threat to people in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Ten major diseases or problems account for more than 91 percent
of the total number of deaths. These include cerebral hemorrhage,
heart attacks, injuries, poisoning, and digestive tract problems.
</P>
<P>
More urbanites are having problems with endocrine,
neurological, and mental disorders, and rural people still have to
deal with infant illnesses, tuberculosis, and some infectious
diseases. They often have little or no access to medical services
and some infectious diseases are still not under control and pose
a big health problem, according to Liu Aimin, of the Chinese
Academy of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
But, at the same time, many urbanites with better access to
medicare are showing new problems like nervous disorders caused by
the pressures of excessive work and competition, he says.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Farman biplane replica,
which flew over the new Hong Kong International Airport five
months ago, was installed at the airport passenger terminal
Wednesday for long-term display.
</P>
<P>
The original Farman biplane, flown by Belgian aviator Charles
Van den Born, made the first powered aircraft flight in Hong Kong
on March 18, 1911. A full-sized, flying replica was commissioned
by the Hong Kong Historical Aircraft Association (HKHAA) and was
built with funds provided by Shell Hong Kong Ltd.
</P>
<P>
At a handover ceremony Wednesday afternoon, Shell's director
Robert Young said, the replica will invite admiration and respect
from millions of visitors to Hong Kong, as it truly represents the
daring and entrepreneurial spirit of the city.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that it will "serve as an inspiration for generations
to come."
</P>
<P>
Airport Authority board member Maria Tam noted that the Farman
replica will "serve as a reminder to us all of the great
accomplishments made in the development of aviation in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ted Pryor, chairman of the HKHAA, revealed the
association's next goal -- the building of a world-class aviation
museum of Hong Kong, a site for which has already been reserved on
the old airport at Kai Tak.
</P>
<P>
"The facility will honor Hong Kong's aviation pioneers and
provide a unique attraction for both local residents and overseas
visitors," he said.

<P>
TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi announced on Wednesday that Tehran is against laying a
pipeline on the bed of the Caspian Sea bed, terming it a violation
of the rights of other littoral countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the official Islamic Republic News Agency, Kharrazi
said that no party, especially no foreign company, can move in
violation of the rights of others' because there is no consensus
among the Caspian states over a new legal regime for the sea.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Turkmenistan would possibly conclude a
contract with the United States for feasibility studies on laying
a pipeline on the Caspian bed linking it with Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi stated both Iran and Russia have already expressed
opposition to laying such a pipeline also due to environmental
considerations, adding that they would not allow others to make
one-sided decisions.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Caspian belongs to all littoral states -
Russia, Iran, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan - which he
said should set up the legal framework for the largest lake in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly called for collective efforts to regulate
utilization of the Caspian's and exploitation of its natural
resources.

MOGADISHU, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The release efforts of the ten
staff of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
kidnapped in Mogadishu continued Wednesday with elders from the
Abgal clan of Ali Mahdi and representatives from the kidnappers
engaged in one of their last serious talks.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the negotiators said the abductors have
receded from their point of asking for nearly one million US
Dollars ransom. The elders are now pressing the abductors not to
mention any kind of ransom, but accept what are offered by the
business community of their people.
</P>
<P>
The sources said discussions continued with the intention to
offer the gunmen something between 60,000 and 150,000 US Dollars.
The elders Wednesday expressed a great hope that they will be
able to secure the release of the hostages sometime late the day
or Thursday the latest.
</P>
<P>
According to an aid worker who visited the kidnapped ICRC
staff members, the health of the hostages is good and they are
fed well even though they have been terrorized Tuesday after the
release efforts nearly fell apart.
</P>
<P>
The mattresses were taken away from them and they were told
that there's no one here in Mogadishu worrying about their
existence or release so that they should talk to their relatives
and superiors outside Somalia with a cellular telephone they were
offered, said the worker.
</P>
<P>
However, early Tuesday afternoon, everything was restored back
to normal, the mattresses were given back and discussions resumed
until two o'clock Wednesday morning before they took a break of a
few hours. Now the discussions continue again, the hope is that
they will be released late the day or Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The first executions of 23
genocide convicts will take place in Rwanda on Friday at 10:00
a.m, the Rwanda News Agency Wednesday quoted the state-run Radio
Rwanda as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The number of convicts announced in Radio Rwanda's news
broadcasts was initially 33.
</P>
<P>
But Rwandan Minister of Justice Faustin Nteziryayo explained
that "only 23 will be executed, because the files of other
convicts who have requested presidential clemency have not yet
been completed."
</P>
<P>
Five locations have been selected for the public executions.
They are Nyamirambo Soccer Stadium in the capital Kigali, Nyamata
in Kigali Rural, Cyasemakamba in eastern Kibungo prefecture,
Murambi in northeastern Umutara prefecture, as well as Gikongoro
in Gikongoro prefecture.
</P>
<P>
"This will act as a lesson to people who do not respect the
life of others and the government is condemning those who are
still carrying out the killings of innocent people," Radio Rwanda
commented Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
All those who will be executed had applied for the
presidential clemency, which has been refused.
</P>
<P>
With these executions, Rwandan courts are showing that they
are willing to punish those who committed the 1994 atrocities.
</P>
<P>
More than 500,000 people reportedly perished in the 1994
genocide that was perpetrated by the presidential guard, the
former government soldiers, and the extremist Hutu militia and
some locals who have been incited to wipe out Tutsis and
opposition Hutus.

CAIRO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Thirty Arab interior and justice
ministers met here on Wednesday to finalize and sign a landmark
agreement on fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is an Arab effort to hammer out a joint
anti-terrorism strategy.
</P>
<P>
The draft agreement calls on signatory states to cooperate in
preventing and combating terrorism in accordance with laws and
internal measures.
</P>
<P>
It opposes any possible attempts of the signatory states to
organize, finance, commit or take part in committing terrorist
acts in any way.
</P>
<P>
The document defines terrorism as an act of violence or a
threat to use violence, irrespective of motives or ends, that
takes place to implement an individual or collective criminal
scheme aimed at terrorizing people, endangering their lives, and
destroying the environment, or public or private utilities, or
national resources.
</P>
<P>
However, the draft pact confirms the right of the people to
armed struggle against foreign occupation and aggression.
</P>
<P>
It legitimizes the struggle to liberate occupied lands, obtain
the right to self-determination and independence and maintain
national unity according to the principles and resolutions of the
United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Trade Minister on WTO Membership for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Shi Guangsheng, Chinese minister
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, has called for an end
to China's exclusion from the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Shi made the call today during talks with Joaquim Pina Moura,
Portuguese minister of economics.
</P>
<P>
Membership in the organization is "not only a need of China,
but also of the WTO," said Shi following an in-depth briefing
on the Chinese government's position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Customs statistics show the country's 1997 trade volume
posted a year-on-year growth of 12.1 percent to 325.06 billion
U.S. dollars, making the country the 10th largest trading nation
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Portugal supports China's entry into the WTO, said Moura,
adding Portugal is willing to play its role in the European Union
to support China's WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that the global economic affairs should be
decided by the majority of countries through equal consultations,
rather than simply by a few, so as to ensure a sound
development of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Moura pointed out that China has already established a basic
structure for free trade.
</P>
<P>
He said Portugal will fully consider China's special conditions
as a developing country, and expressed the hope that the European
Council would pass a resolution defining China as a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Shi expressed appreciation for Portugal's stand, and noted that
China's entry into the WTO will greatly enhance its economic
cooperation with Portual and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also discussed matters related to mutual
investment and trade issues.
</P>
<P>
Moura is visiting China along with Portugal's Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres.

<HEADLINE> Clan Fighting Kills 3 in Southern Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 22 (Xinhua) -- At least three people were
killed and seven others wounded when heavy fighting broke out
between the Marehan and Majerten subclans in the village of
Gobwein, 18 km north of Somalia's southern port town of Kismaio
late Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to reports received through VHR radios, the attack
was launched by the Majerten subclan based inside Kismaio led by
General Mohamed Said Hirsi Morgan. The sources said one Marehan
subclansman was dead while four others suffered heavy gunshot
wounds.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in which nine technicals were used lasted for
more than an hour before the Majerten subclan was forced to
retreat back to their base. The village of Gobwein has been a
strong militia base for the Marehan subclan since they were
driven out of Kismaio last year.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere has been tense with growing military build up
inside Kismaio since General Morgan arrived in the town about a
week ago, while the Marehan militia are gathering outside the
town.
</P>
<P>
The southern port town of Kismaio, 500 km south of the capital
Mogadishu, has been a focal point for armed clashes between the
two pastoral subclans over the control of the key positions of
Kismaio in the past two years.

<HEADLINE> California Lawmakers Reject Appeal for Computer Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A proposal to limit computer
makers' liability for the year 2000 problem died Tuesday when a
California legislative committee voted against it.
</P>
<P>
The State Assembly Judiciary Committee agreed with trial
lawyers that the industry should not be given cover for "a crisis
of its own making."
</P>
<P>
Co-authored by two California Assembly men, the proposal meant
to limit the financial liability of designers and manufacturers of
computer systems, programs and software due to problems expected
on January 1, 2000, when many old systems may miscalculate the new
year and "crash" unless they are retrofitted or replaced.
</P>
<P>
Of the 15 votes, the proposal received only six in favor. The
bill needed at least eight votes to pass.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 problem is projected to cause billions of dollars
worth of damage as a result of computer malfunctions and billions
more will be spent in advance on system repair.
</P>
<P>
Lawsuits could be another cost resulting from it. The committee
Tuesday was told that lawsuits in California against hardware and
software companies could easily total 2 billion dollars or more.
</P>
<P>
Much of the debate presented to the committee turned on a key
legal question about the year 2000 problem -- is it a product
defect? If so, then manufacturers of the product should be held
responsible.
</P>
<P>
One side of the argument held that the problem arose not from
negligence but from limited resources. The other side said that it
was an intentional design defect, citing the fact that some
companies have continued to market computers with the glitch.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Decide Second Tranche of Aid to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) will decide its second 3 billion U.S. dollar tranche of
bailout package for Indonesia at the Fund's board meeting to be
held on May 4, a senior official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The assistance, part of the IMF-led 43 billion U.S. dollar
package, will be implemented in three stages, said Coordinating
Minister of Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita
at a press conference held jointly by several cabinet ministers
after attending a meeting of the Economic and Financial Resilience
Council headed by President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) will also hold their board meetings
separately to decide their promised aids to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The ADB had agreed to provide 1.5 billion U.S. dollars to
Indonesia while the World Bank one billion U.S. dollars in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and the IMF reached an agreement in October last year
on the 43 billion U.S. dollar package. The Indonesian government
promised to conduct wide-ranging economic and financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, the IMF gave the first 3 billion U.S.
dollar tranche of assistance to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
However, it delayed the second 3 billion dollar tranche of the
bailout package.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said the government has seriously carried out its
latest agreement with the IMF signed on April 8.
</P>
<P>
He said the value of the rupiah has picked up from 10,200
against the U.S. dollar on March 17 to 7,750 per dollar on April
22.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that the public confidence in the rupiah and the
country's economy has gradually recovered, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesia's economy has been badly hit by the Southeast
Asian monetary crisis since July last year. The rupiah has lost
more than 70 percent of its value against the greenback.

<HEADLINE> O'Neal Named NBA Player of Month in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Center Shaquille O'Neal of the
Los Angeles Lakers was named NBA Player of the Month in April, a
press released from the NBA Asia said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal helped lead the Lakers to an NBA-best 9-1 record by
averaging 33.8 points, 10.5 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 2.1 blocked
shots per game during the month.
</P>
<P>
He shot 131 for 212 from the field and ranked first in scoring,
second in field-goal percentage, eighth in rebounding and 10th in
shot blocking among league leaders in April.
</P>
<P>
"Shaquille continues to be a model of consistency in every
category -- scoring, rebounding and shot blocking to name a few,"
said L.A.Lakers head coach Del Harris. "His all-around game has
really improved in the last year or so, and that can only benefit
us down the road."
</P>
<P>
The Lakers led all teams except New Jersey (110.3 points per
game) in scoring during the month with 107.7 points per game,
thanks in large part to O'Neal's consistent offense.
</P>
<P>
He scored 20 or more points in all 10 games and had 30 or more
points seven times and 35 or more points four times. He led his
team in scoring and rebounding 10 and five times respectively.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal had several standout performances during the month
including 50 points and nine rebounds in a 117-106 win at New
Jersey on April 2 and 43 points (18 for 22 shooting), five
rebounds and four blocked shots in 33 minutes in a 124-95 defeat
of Dallas on April 17.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates for NBA Player of the Month were Chicago's
Michael Jordan, Minnesota's Kevin Garnett and Stephon Marbury, New
Jersey's Sam Cassell, Philadelphia's Allen Iverson, Phoenix's
Jason Kidd, San Antonio's Tim Duncan and Utah's Karl Malone.

<HEADLINE> China Now World's Largest Ceramics Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China is producing 1.58 billion
sq.m. of ceramic tiles for buildings and 55 million units of
ceramic bathroom products, according to Liu Jingzhou, the
vice-chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade's Building Materials Branch.
</P>
<P>
Liu said at the opening ceremony of the China International
Ceramics Exhibition yesterday that China has at least 800
companies making these materials and thousands of township-run
enterprises, and the cities of Foshan, Tangshan, and Boshan have
become its largest ceramics producers.
</P>
<P>
The country builds 300 million sq.m. of urban housing annually
and 600 million sq.m. in rural areas, and this has benefitted the
ceramics industry, he said, and, by the year 2000, China is
expected to add 230 new cities and 5,000 towns.
</P>
<P>
Greater Sino-foreign cooperation and technology exchanges have
helped the industry also, he said. More than 440 businesses have
introduced complete production lines from abroad, like automatic
machines from Italy, Germany, and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The five-day ceramics exhibition is sponsored by the Building
Materials Branch of the council and the China Ceramics
Association. It is China's largest ceramics exhibition, with
10,000 sq.m. of floor space. The major participants are from
Italy, Germany, the United States, Britain, Japan, Spain, Hong
Kong, and Taiwan, Liu said.

But the index for March was 0.1 percent down from February,

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong-Spain Trade Grows in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The value of total trade
between Hong Kong and Spain in 1997 reached 1.9 billion U.S.
dollars, a six percent increase over a year earlier, the Spanish
Trade Commission in Hong Kong announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the total trade, 32 percent was due to exports to Hong Kong
from Spain of over 614 million U.S. dollars, representing a two
percent increase over the previous year. Around 50 percent of the
Spanish products were re-exported to the Chinese inland from Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Tejedor, trade commissioner of Spain in Hong Kong, said
at a press conference here that these results are especially
pleasing when considering that Hong Kong-Spain trade has grown at
a faster rate compared to Hong Kong's trade growth with the rest
of the world last year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is Spain's second largest market in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, around 20 percent of Spanish exports to Hong Kong were
construction materials, followed by iron and steel and footwear.
</P>
<P>
Despite Asia's financial crisis, exports of Spanish shoes to
Hong Kong last year achieved a record 77 million U.S. dollars, a
59 percent jump year-on-year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hong Kong is Spain's second largest supplier in Asia
after Japan. The value of Hong Kong's export to Spain amounted to
over 1.3 billion U.S. dollars last year, 90 percent of which were
of the Chinese inland origin including toys and radios.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's domestic exports to Spain are mainly clothing and
watches and clocks, reaching over 57 million U.S. dollars and 20
million U.S. dollars respectively in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Tejedor attributed the year-on-year increasing trade between
Hong Kong and Spain mainly to their good relationship and a free
trade policy that Hong Kong is implementing.
</P>
<P>
To further promote Spanish products and services in the Asia
Pacific market, he said the Spanish trade Commission and the
Spanish Institute for Foreign Trade have organized a Spanish
contingency at the upcoming Asia Pacific Leather Fair Spring Show
to be held in Hong Kong from April 30 to May 2.
</P>
<P>
"We are very confident that Spanish products and services will
continue to make substantial progress" in Hong Kong, the Chinese
inland and Asia as a whole, he added.

<P>
CANBERRA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
higher in Sydney Wednesday after spending the day on tenterhooks
awaiting the decision from the Australia's Federal Court on the
waterfront dispute.
</P>
<P>
But the decision from the full bench of the Federal Court did
not come until around 17:00 (Sydney time) Wednesday, just as the
local session closed.
</P>
<P>
The local unit finished at 65.13 U.S. cents from 64.97 U.S.
cents late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Court opted to extend a stay of orders forcing
stevedoring company Patrick to re-employ 1,400 sacked waterside
workers until the completion of an appeal hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 85.38 Japanese yen from 85.53

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Industrial Bank Issues First Batch of Housing Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai branch of China's
Industrial and Commercial Bank on Tuesday offered its first batch
of housing loans for this year worth 2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The loans, accounting for 10 percent of the total projected by
the bank for this year, come in a variety of forms. The largest
credit amount is 70 percent of the mortgage valued at 500,000 yuan
with a 20-year repayment term.
</P>
<P>
The bank has designated 60 outlets in the city to facilitate
the applicants. It has also provided services for buyers from Hong
Kong, Macao and Taiwan as well as those from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's housing loans are expected to increase at an annual
rate of 20 percent in the next decade, since the housing market is
entering a brisk period.
</P>
<P>
Insiders from Shanghai's commercial banks say that housing
credits are not only lucrative, since the overdue rate is as low
as four per 10,000, but also conducive to tapping the consumption
potential and promoting the sales of commercial housing.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks here have issued more than 1 billion yuan of
loans for individual housing in recent years.

CANBERRA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Marijuana is certain to be
banned by the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) for the
Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, a top IOC official said in Sydney on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Executive board member Jacques Rogge of Belgium said the IOC
wanted to outlaw recreational drugs to avoid a repeatition at this
year's Winter Olympics when Canadian snowboarder Ross Rebagliati
was allowed to keep his gold medal despite testing positive for
cannibas.
</P>
<P>
"The IOC has taken the decision that it will ban these
so-called soft drugs," Rogge was quoted as saying. "We will change
the rules to avoid these loopholes."
</P>
<P>
The IOC responded by setting up a task force of its own four
executive board vice-presidents to formulate a clear policy on
recreational drugs which it planned to present at next week's IOC
board meeting in Sydney.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Human Rights Commission Rejects U.S. Motion Against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Commission on
Human Rights rejected a U.S. motion Tuesday to renew the
resolution on investigating Cuba's human rights record for another
year.
</P>
<P>
Of the 53 commission members, 19 voted against the motion, 16
for and 18 abstained. The motion was submitted by the United
States alone.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that a U.S.-backed anti-Cuba resolution
had been turned back since 1992, and the vote result was seen
another major diplomatic blow to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
In his annual report last month to the commission, Carl-Johan
Groth, the U.N. rapporteur to Cuba since 1992, criticized a
40-year-old U.S. embargo against Cuba and said human rights record
in the U.S. itself needed improvement.
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, Carlos Amat Flores, head of the Cuban
delegation, said the international community had recognized "a
series of signals" that Cuba is opening up, including Pope John
Paul II's visit to his country last January.
</P>
<P>
He accused Washington of having a "history of supporting brutal
dictatorships around the world," saying the U.S. embargo against
Cuba was "the only case of massive violation of human rights in
Cuba."

<HEADLINE> Angolan Forces to Defend Territorial Sky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Defense Minister Pedro
Sebastiao has said that the Angolan armed forces will act within
days to defend its territorial sky.
</P>
<P>
Since the territorial sky of Angola is still facing invasion
by unidentified planes, the armed forces will take actions soon
to avert the situation, Sebastiao told the press Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the armed forces will also take measures to
ensure the safety in land border areas, particularly, in the
northern and eastern frontiers.
</P>
<P>
As to the peace process in Angola, Sabastiao said that the
1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol is being implemented.
</P>
<P>
He added that positive steps have been made in politics,
while many problems still exist in military aspect.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said that measures must be taken if the
military situation continues worsening.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the remnants of the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) kept creating disturbances,
attacking the newly-established local governments and ambushing
vehicles running normally on the highway, which has greatly
threatened the safety of the people and their properties.
</P>
<P>
Sebastiao revealed to the media that the Angolan armed forces
will fight unremittingly against the criminal armed groups across
the country.
</P>
<P>
Fighting against the organized criminals is in line with the
peace accord, Sebastiao said, adding that it needs no approval
from any authority because the main mission of the Angolan armed
forces is to maintain peace and territorial integrity of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Since October 1997 when the United Nations Security Council
passed resolutions to impose sanctions against UNITA, planes from
some countries still invade into the Angolan air to send
materials to the rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
In January, the Angolan Air Force interrupted one plane from
South Africa transporting materials for UNITA. Then, the United
Nations and the Organization of African Unity repeatedly demanded
that the member countries should comply with the U.N. Security
Council's sanction resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Sebastiao disclosed that a workshop on national defense will
be held by the defense ministry from April 23 to 25. The
workshop is aimed at enabling the leaders of People's Assembly,
the administration and the armed forces to understand profoundly
the operations of the national defense organs.
</P>
<P>
Defense experts from Portugal, the United States and Brazil
will be invited to make speeches at the meeting, Sebastiao said.

JOHANNESBURG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has moved up
from 44th to 42nd in a list of the 46 most competitive nations in
the world, the Business Day reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is now ranked ahead of Venezuela, Colombia,
Poland and Russia, the newspaper quoted an economic survey as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The survey released in Lausanne, Switzerland showed that
countries such as India, the Philippines, Turkey and Czech
Republic seem to be more competitive.
</P>
<P>
Struggling Japan plunged down the list, while the United
States stayed in the top spot, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
Japan fell nine places in the World Competitive Yearbook
annual rankings, from ninth in 1997 to 18th this year. Five
years ago, Japan ranked the second.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, Singapore ranked second and Hong Kong
held third place this year as they did in 1997. And China also
rose to 24th from 27th place this year.
</P>
<P>
The study compares the competitiveness of the 46 countries
measured in terms of their economic strength, education and
openness to international trade.
</P>
<P>
The survey defines national competitiveness as a country's
ability to help its businesses to be competitive.

PARIS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- France's central bank, the Bank of

the euro, said French Minister of Finance, Economy and Industry
Dominique Strauss-Kahn Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Europe 1 Television, Strauss-Kahn said
part of the gold reserve "will serve to defend the euro."
</P>
<P>
Other European countries will also offer their shares of gold

</P>
<P>
He said the euro will be as strong as the French franc and
Deutsche mark as is shown through their exchange rates with the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"The euro will be a strong money in such a sense as allowing
France and other countries which join it to escape the logic (of
speculation) of the market," the French minister stressed.

ZHENGZHOU, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Tire Rubber Group
Co. (STRG), the largest tire manufacturer in China, signed a

<HEADLINE> 14 Killed in C. Nigerian Communal Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- At least 14 people, including two
women, were killed Tuesday in a renewed clash between the Bassa
and Ebira communities in Toto, a border town between Nassarawa
state and capital Abuja, in central Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Several vehicles, buildings and dispensing pumps of some
petrol stations in the town were also burnt in the fracas which
began Monday night, the Daily Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The national newspaper said that four fresh human heads were
seen hung beside a transformer in the heart of the town by
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sources were quoted as saying that the main cause of the
dispute was traceable to the age-long land feud between Ebira and
Bassa which had been worsened by political differences.
</P>
<P>
The hitherto quiet town of Toto was in a war mood, with youths
and men, mostly Ebiras, brandishing arrows, cutlasses, bows,
machetes and guns.
</P>
<P>
A detachment of mobile policemen were reported to have been
drafted to the area to maintain peace, but the daily said they
were nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
However, an inspector of police was quoted as saying that
there was nothing they could do to contain the development.
</P>
<P>
"That was why we laid down our arms and we are outside," he
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing 83rd China Export
Commodities Fair in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong
Province, has reported business deals valued at over 3.07 billion
U.S. dollars since opening on April 15.
</P>
<P>
The business volume for the seven-day period equalled figures
for the 1996 fair, but fell by 3.29 percent when compared to 1997
fair.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, United States, Hong Kong and Macao recorded
increased transaction volumes during the week.
</P>
<P>
However, the business volume for Southeast Asian countries fell
by 100 million U.S. dollars when compared to the previous fairs.
</P>
<P>
Light industrial products and arts and crafts accounted for the
lion's share of business transactions, with impressive figures
also recorded for electronic products and machinery, textiles and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
Brisk business volumes were also recorded for high value-added
scientific and technological products, and quality export
commodities.
</P>
<P>
The two week fair attracted 37,579 business people from 156
countries and regions through April 21, respective rises of 6.29
percent and 6.43 percent on the previous two fairs.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government, Muslim Rebels Resume Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from the Philippine
government and the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
Wednesday pushed through with their scheduled low-level talks in a
southern Philippine city.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chairman for political affairs, told
the Philippine News Agency (PNA) that a joint government-MILF
committee on the cessation of hostilities met in Marawi city,
capital of Lanao del Sur province, in the morning.
</P>
<P>
In the two-day meeting, Jaafar said, the MILF will continue to
seek for the government's recognition of MILF territories in
Mindanao island, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
But Lt. Gen. Joselin Nazareno, head of the government cessation
committee, said the government will try to negotiate only for a
"hands-off" policy on two major MILF camps, according to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The two camps are Abubakar, the largest MILF stronghold located
in Maguindanao province, and Busrah in Lanao del Sur province.
</P>
<P>
Other MILF-held areas will be considered "zones of peace" by
the government, Nazareno said.
</P>
<P>
Boasting a membership of nearly 12,000, the MILF is currently
the largest anti-government force in the country after the
mainstream Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) signed a peace
treaty with the government in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The government began low-level peace talks with the MILF in
January 1997 and forged a comprehensive ceasefire in June. But the
two sides are still wide apart over the agenda and the timetable
for formal peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian King Sihanouk Meets Price Ranariddh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SIEM REAP, Cambodia, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's King
Norodom Sihanouk Wednesday met with his son Prince Norodom
Ranariddh at Siem Reap where he is staying.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh, who arrived here on Wednesday morning from Bangkok,
told reporters after the meeting that he and his father talked
about the forthcoming general elections and the supervision of the
elections by international observers.
</P>
<P>
But they did not touch the issues of a ceasefire and pardon to
the generals who supported him, the prince said.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh added that he and his father appealed to the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, the
United States, Japan and the United Nations to send more observers
to Cambodia to supervise the preparations and the process of the
elections.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the elections cannot be held smoothly without the
cooperation of the Funcinpec and the Cambodian People's Party, the
two largest parties led by him and Hun Sen, the second prime
minister who ousted him last July.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh reiterated that he had no cooperative relations with
the Khmer Rouge and did not know if General Nhiek Bun Chhay and
Ta Mok, the remaining leaders of Khmer Rouge, had their forces
integrated.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, King Sihanouk said that he was very pleased
to see the international efforts that helped Cambodia hold the
elections, and reaffirmed his support to a joint statement
released by the "Troika" of the ASEAN and the Friends of Cambodia
on Sunday in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
It was Ranariddh's second trip home, but his first meeting with
the king since he was granted royal pardon.
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced in absentia by a military court last month to
35 years in prison and ordered to pay more than 50 million
U.S. dollars in damages.
</P>
<P>
The king pardoned him on March 21, paving the way for him to
participate in the elections scheduled for July 26.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria May Amend Constitution for Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A provision may have been made in
Nigeria's yet-to-be released draft 1995 Federal constitution for a
sole presidential candidate in the country, the Guardian reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The leading national daily based the projection on the
thinking of the country's Transition Implementation Committee
(TIC), which said Tuesday that the adoption of Head of State
General Sani Abacha by all the five political parties was borne
out by the "secret" constitution.
</P>
<P>
The draft constitution has been used by the government
sometimes, but only few Nigerians are aware of the contents of
it.
</P>
<P>
The polls will still be held on August 1 to pick a president
as the parties' consensus adoption of Abacha has not foreclosed
to scheduled election, TIC said.
</P>
<P>
The only difference is the voting will be a yes-or-no choice
on the candidature of the head of state, TIC added.
</P>
<P>
The latest development did not mark an end to the current
transition to civil rule program Abacha launched three years ago,
TIC Deputy Chairman Alhaji Hassan Yusuf said, adding that
Abacha's sole candidacy was neither undemocratic nor
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
"If it reaches the closing of nomination day and it is only
one candidate, then the election will be held by vote of 'Yes' or
'No'," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the United States and Britain have berated the adoption of
Abacha as the sole presidential candidate in one voice.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decried that the adoption has made the transition
program "seriously flawed and failing", alleging that the
Nigerian government has manipulated the democratic process in the
west African country.
</P>
<P>
Britain has threatened that Commonwealth ministers were likely
to meet soon to discuss whether to apply a limited package of
sanctions against Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the two countries are to hold talks
shortly on what to do about Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nigeria's National Democratic Coalition has also
unfolded plans to resist Abacha's candidature. The
anti-government organization also called on supporters to reject
it.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Marks 2,000 Years of Buddhism in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Buddhists and scholars
have urged that more attention be paid to Buddhism's modern
situation after the religion has spread in China for 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
"Buddhism is still attracting a great number of people in an
era of high-technology and prosperous economy, and the fact has
proved the religion's significance," said Jin Hui, vice president
of the China Buddhism Association, at a forum held here today at
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) to mark the 2000th
anniversary of Buddhism in China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the association show that there are 200,000
monks and nuns registered at temples throughout China, and
hundreds of millions are influenced by the religion.
</P>
<P>
Master Jin Hui said that it is not wise to eye Buddhism as
something backward that is about to become extinct. But he also
hinted that Buddhism should improve its self-management in
accordance with Chinese law to enable it to survive into modern
times.
</P>
<P>
"Buddhists should respect other people's and Party's beliefs,
and cooperate with the government to achieve political goals," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Buddhists have been persecuted and temples damaged at
least four times during the past 2,000 years for political
reasons, Liu Ji, vice president of the CASS, said, adding that the
most serious case occurred during the so-called "Cultural
Revolution" (1966-76). But everything has changed after the reform
and opening-up in the late 1970s when the Party's policy of
religious freedom was resumed.
</P>
<P>
The recent policy promulgated by the central government is to
actively guide Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Liu also suggested that Buddhism be reformed to help push the
"Spiritual Civilization," a campaign to train more patriots and
morally perfect citizens.
</P>
<P>
Many of the scholars and monks said at the forum that China
should focus on research into Buddhism's modern functions,
including diplomatic and commercial functions.
</P>
<P>
A Buddhism research center, whose members are professors from
more than 10 universities and eminent monks nationwide, was
established at CASS today.
</P>
<P>
Buddhism, which originated in India, entered China 2,000 years
ago. There have been debates on the accurate year of its Chinese
debut.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many Chinese and Japanese scholars believed
that 2 B.C. was the year when Buddhism first appeared in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Buddhism spread to other Asian countries, including Korea and
Japan, and the Zen School, which was a typical Chinese version of
Buddhism, has even found its way into the West.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Parliament Accepts Government Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Great Hural (parliament)
of Mongolia Wednesday accepted resignation of the government led
by Prime Minister Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan.
</P>
<P>
At its Wednesday session, 59 deputies voted for and one against
the government's request for resignation en masse.
</P>
<P>
Enkhsaikhan was requested to stay in the prime minister's
office of a caretaker cabinet before the Great Hural appoints a
prime minister to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
On January 15, the Great Hural passed two laws which allow
parliament members to concurrently hold government posts including
premiership.
</P>
<P>
On April 16, the National Democratic Party and the
Social-Democratic Party asked Enkhsaikhan's government to resign
and hand the premiership to the chairman of their coalition -- the
Democratic Union.
</P>
<P>
Enkhsaikhan submitted a formal request to Great Hural Chairman
Radnasumberlyn Gonchigdorzh afterward.
</P>
<P>
Tsakhiya Elbegdorj, vice-chairman of the Great Hural and
president of the National Democratic Party, is expected to be the
new prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Rich Nations Urged to Assist Developing Countries with Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Rich nations should voluntarily
help developing countries with water resource development and
management with generous support in funding and technology
transfer, said a senior Chinese water official here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Dengquan, 59, vice-minister of water resources, said that
developing countries are trapped in a dilemma of developing an
economy and reducing pollution.
</P>
<P>
"Failing to cooperate with developing nations in their struggle
for sustainable use and protection of water resources, developed
countries' interest in water resources will also inevitably
suffer," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu told Xinhua in an interview, "I quite appreciate French
President [Jacques] Chirac's words, 'what is to cause the next
century's wars and strife will not be crude oil and land, but
water resources."
</P>
<P>
He said that advanced countries stress commercial benefits too
much and the nature of intellectual property rights of their
skills when negotiating with developing countries over water
resources aid.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he added, they largely end up playing word games
in fulfilling their promise of helping developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Advanced countries have a duty to assist developing countries,
providing them with no-interest or low-interest loans," he
said. "They should also be more generous in technological
transfer."
</P>
<P>
"Assistance in water resource management should be a
governmental action rather than a commercial one," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Zhu attended an international conference on water and
sustainable development in Paris last month. He said that many
delegates showed strong interest in China's experiences in water
resource development, protection and management, hailing China's
experiences as reference for other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Many businesspeople also approached the Chinese delegation with
topics such as how to participate in China's water supply and
hydro-power generation, believing that there is an enormous
investment potential in water resources in China, he said.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Prosperous in Beijing's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Yuebin Restaurant located in
the Cuihua Hutong (Lane) of Beijing has only one room and three
tables, but it is regarded as a trend-setter in the capital's
private economic sector.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen years ago, Zhang Guixian, 47, opened the Yuebin,
Beijing's first privately run restaurant, with 1,000 yuan (120
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Zhang's courageous move was highly praised at a time when China
had just started its economic reform and opening-up to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
Talking about those past years, Zhang said that although her
restaurant was small, it always drew a large number of clients
that included government officials, sociologists, foreign
ambassadors and journalists.
</P>
<P>
Privately run restaurants can be found everywhere in Beijing
nowadays. And the private economic sector is expanding into all
fields, from small businesses to the high-tech industry and real
estate.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Beijing now has more than 40,000 privately
run enterprises, with registered assets of 25 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some privately run businesses, like Yongyou Software and Yeshi
Clothing, have developed into large conglomerates and own market
shares in other parts of the country and overseas.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Zhang Guixian, private business entrepreneurs in
Beijing, currently do not have to start their business in their
middle ages. Many young entrepreneurs are well-educated and know a
lot about state policies.
</P>
<P>
Shao Genhuo, a 32-year-old with a doctorate degree in
philosophy from the China Agricultural University, set up an
animal feeding company with only 20,000 yuan four years ago. He is
now boss of Beijing's largest privately run group dealing with
farming and animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
His group, named "Dabeinong," has acquired more than 30
state-owned enterprises by means of purchasing, shareholding,
trusting and leasing, and solved problems of re-employment of
several hundred workers. Last year, sales volume of Shao's group
reached nearly 600 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Shicheng, vice-president of the Beijing Society of
Self-Employed and Private Business, said nearly 800,000 people in
Beijing are now engaged in the non-public-owned economic sector
like self-employment and privately run businesses, which have
become an important channel of employment.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Deputy Foreign Minister Visits Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura arrived here on Wednesday for a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that Komura is
expected to convey a message from Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
But it did not disclose the details.
</P>
<P>
Komura's visit is viewed as defying United States efforts to
isolate the Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has imposed economic sanctions on Iran and asked its
allies not to develop political and economic relations with the
country.
</P>
<P>
Japanese ambassador in Tehran Takaya Suto was quoted by IRNA as
saying that Komura's visit is "very crucial" and would help expand
the Tehran-Tokyo ties in political, economic and cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
Suto said that Iran, as an oil-rich country, plays a key role
in issues in the Persian Gulf, Middle East and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
He voiced welcome to Khatami's proposal to carry out dialogs
among different civilizations, which he said would help defuse
regional and international tensions.
</P>
<P>
Japan became Iran's biggest trade partner last year with a
trade volume of 4.44 billion U.S. dollars.

PARIS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Ten years after the Matignon Agreement which put an end to
violent conflict between France and the Kanak independence
fighters of New Caledonia, the parters of the South Pacific
territory and the French government Tuesday signed in Noumea an
agreement on the future status of the territory.
</P>
<P>
The agreement predicts a large autonomy for the island, prior
to its full independence in a transitional period of 15 to 20
years. The agreement will be submitted for approval by the local
parliament at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
-- For the first time in history, the French National Assembly
summoned four former government ministers, including former Prime
Minister Edouard Balladur, for a hearing on Tuesday on the role
played by France in Rwanda before, during and after the 1994
genocide. Although the ministers pleaded for the "positive" role
played by France, the hearing was more significant in symbolic
meaning than the contents of the questions and answers.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The deputies from the centrist Union for French Democracy
and the Socialist Party in the National Assembly will establish a
united front Wednesday in voting for the government project on
introducing the European single currency euro. The deputies of the
Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) and the Communist Party
said they will vote against the draft law.
</P>
<P>
PRP parliament group chairman Jean-Louis Debre said that
although the RPR supports euro, it does not approve the
"political manipulation" by the Socialist government to impose its
economic and social policy through the law.
</P>
<P>
-- April 27 will be the 150th anniversary of the abolition of
slavery by France. Victor Schoelcher, a State Under-Secretary for
Colonies, issued a decree abolishing slavery in the wake of the
1848 Revolution.
</P>
<P>
About 12 million Africans were sold from their homes to America
by Europeans in more than three centuries. France joined "the slave
trade" for 200 years.

<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Today's editions of People's
Daily, Workers Daily, China Youth Daily and various other
Beijing-based newspapers frontpaged articles on Wang Tao, a modern
Chinese model worker in an automobile plant.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tao is different from iron worker Wang Jinxi, a model
worker in northeast China's Daqing Oilfield in the 1960s, in that
he not only works hard, but has also authored four books on motor
vehicle structures and adjustment procedures.
</P>
<P>
Hard and assiduous work was most important criterion for model
workers in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Wang works for the Dongfeng Automobile Company in Shiyan City,
central China's Hubei Province, and is in charge of assembling and
checking motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The modern model worker, who has worked for the company for 23
consecutive years, has an unblemished record and invented the
"Wang Tao Operations Technique" which has greatly improved work
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"Engineer Wang", a reference used by fellow workers, has
consulted with experts concerning technological problems and has
purchases numerous books related to his work.
</P>
<P>
He has been won both national and provincial model worker
titles for 12 years in a row.

CANBERRA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer announced here Wednesday he will visit Vietnam
from April 24 to 28 for talks with Vietnamese leaders over
political, economic and trade issues.
</P>

</P>
<P>
"The bilateral relationship continues to expand, with regional
security dialogue and human rights dialogue as important features

</P>
<P>
Australia and Vietnam, which established diplomatic ties 25
years ago, "also share a range of key regional interests," Downer
said.
</P>
<P>
"My visit takes place as Vietnam prepares itself for (the)

the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) summit at the
end of this year," he added.
</P>

CAIRO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- French hotel company ACCORD signed a tourist agreement
with the Jordan Investment Cooperation (JIC) on Tuesday on
developing tourist projects in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, the ACCORD will market the Ma'in spa near
Amman and the JIC will send 10 people to France to learn the
principles of tourist administration in ACCORD companies,
semi-official Jordan Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The pact was a follow-up to the first official tourist
agreement between the two countries signed in 1992.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The United States' denim-maker Jordache is planning to

</P>
<P>
The Jordache Inc. and the Century Investment Group of
Jordan (CIG) hope to export their casual wear products to
the U.S. and Europe by the end of 1998, according to Jordan Times
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As an appreciation of Jordan's contribution to the Middle
East peace process, the U.S. earlier this year allowed Jordan
to establish the QIZ. Commodities made in the QIZ can be
exported to the U.S. duty free.
</P>
<P>

Railway Corporation (ARC) independently to expand its current
railway system at the cost of 100 million U.S. dollars, the paper
quoted Minister of Transportation Sami Gammoh as saying.
</P>
<P>
The project is the first privatization initiative in Jordan's
transportation sector and meant to meet the increased demand for
Jordan's phosphate in European and Asian markets, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- A market study showed Tuesday that Saudi
Arabia's computer market is growing by 30 percent to 35 percent

<HEADLINE> China Continues to Open Financial Market (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Three insurance groups from
Britain, Australia and Canada were recently allowed to set up
branches in China, and the French Banque Nationale de Paris also
was awarded a business licence in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The latest moves indicate that China is continuing its policy
of opening its financial market to foreign companies while
implementing fundamental reforms within its financial system.
</P>
<P>
China initiated its financial opening-up policy 19 years
ago. Foreign financial institutions have been gradually developing
and becoming a significant component in China's financial system,
playing an increasingly bigger role in China's economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said that, so
far, foreign financial institutions have set up 544 offices and
173 branches in China in both banking and insurance.
</P>
<P>
The branches are from 20 countries and regions including Japan,
Hong Kong, the United States, France and Britain, and most of the
branches are distributed in China's financial centers such as
Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing, Guangzhou and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
So far China has allowed foreign banks to establish business
institutions in 23 cities and Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
The past few years have been the best for foreign financial
institutions to develop in China. Three years ago Beijing had no
branches of foreign financial institutions, and now 14 foreign
banks are offering financial services and more than 220 foreign
financial institutions have established offices in the capital.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Hold Talks With Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat Wednesday held talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the recent efforts for
reactivating the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who flew in Tuesday night from the Saudi Arabia,
briefed Mubarak on the results of his talks with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair in Gaza on Monday, during which they explored
ways to push forward the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
After the tete-a-tete talks, a plenary session was held to
include Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri, Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa, the Palestinian Liberation Organization
Executive Committee chief Abu Mazen, Palestinian Planning and
International Cooperation Minister Nabiel Shaath and the aides.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians welcome Blair's proposal on hosting meetings
to bring together Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to salvage the peace process. Arafat, however,
conditioned a summit on the participation of Europeans and
Americans.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday morning with the Cairo-based Voice of
Arabs Radio, Palestinian ambassador to Britain Afif Safieh said
the Palestinian side has also asked for the participation of both
Egypt and Jordan in London talks.
</P>
<P>
Safieh, who had been present at Blair-Arafat talks, pointed out
that the London talks will provide the last chance to salvage the
peace-making in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the importance of the role of Britain and the
European Union in general in pushing forward the peace march as
complement to the American brokerage.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, at the invitation of Mubarak, is due in Cairo next
Tuesday for talks on unblock the peace impasse.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has agreed to attend the London meetings to be held
on May 4. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will meet
there with Arafat and Netanyahu separately before the two can meet
with each other in search of a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. suggested that Israel withdraws from 13.1 percent of
the West Bank in tandem with Palestinian security guarantees. But
the scope has been rejected as too much by Israel, which insisted
on no more than 9 percent and might eventually settle for 11
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks were stalled since March 1997
over Jewish settlement expansion in East Arab Jerusalem and an
overdue Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> China Continues to Open Financial Market (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Except the nine foreign banks which have been ratified to do
Renminbi business in Pudong area of Shanghai, the business scope
of foreign banks is confined to foreign-exchange deposits and
loans, note discounts, remittances, warranties, import and export
settlements and ratified foreign exchange investment, and their
customers are limited to foreigners, foreign-funded enterprises
and foreign exchange credit of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Despite these restrictions, foreign banks still achieved rapid
business development with considerable profits, demonstrating a
good business environment for foreign financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the PBOC show that, by the end of 1997, the
total assets of foreign banks in China was 37.99 billion U.S.
dollars, with the total outstanding amount of loans and deposits
at 27.5 billion U.S. dollars and 4.48 billion U.S. dollars,
respectively. All these figures reflected significant increases
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Experts said foreign financial institutions have been playing
an important role in China's economic development. Last year
foreign banks granted loans of 27.5 billion U.S. dollars, of which
88.2 percent was granted to businesses within China, while their
outstanding amount of deposits from China was only 3.68 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign financial institutions have brought advanced operating
technologies, fund-raising tools and management methods to China
and provided training for China's international financial
personnel. In addition, they also helped promote competition
within China's financial system.
</P>
<P>
Experts generally held that, with the progress in China's
economic and financial reforms, foreign financial institutions
will gradually be given the same treatment as their Chinese
counterparts, and that the green light will be given to more
foreign financial institutions in coming years.

<HEADLINE> China Acts to Control Dust Pollution in Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China will introduce new
technologies and facilities in addition to its legal and education
measures to control dust pollution in mines.
</P>
<P>
Statistics of the Ministry of Health shows that the number of
Chinese patients with pneumoconiosis, a common disease in mines
caused by inhaling too much dust, totaled 526,000 by the end of
1996. Of these, 119,000 died of the disease, the highest figure in
the world. And, in three years, the disease brought China an
annual economic loss of more than 11 billion yuan (1.3 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Experts have been organized to improve the production
technology and develop new materials and machines that produce
less dust, said Lin Yongsan, vice-minister of Labor and Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
He said related departments are improving education to
employees in mines, providing them with basic industrial hygienic
knowledge and enhancing their knowledge for self-protection. The
ministry will soon release a documentary about controlling dust
pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has issued a number of laws and
regulations about industrial hygiene and safety in recent years to
protect mine workers' safety and health, added Lin.
</P>
<P>
Mining is one of China's basic industries. About 95 percent of
China's 2,000 counties have mining activities. At present, China
has about 260,000 mine employing nearly 20 million people.
</P>
<P>
According to China's laws and regulations, mining companies
should regularly provide health examinations to workers, and those
with pneumoconiosis can get economic compensation.

<HEADLINE> US, Britain Frown on Abacha's Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Britain
Tuesday frowned on the adoption of General Sani Abacha as their
consensus presidential candidate by Nigeria's five political
parties.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin, who spoke in
Washington, urged the head of the Nigerian military government to
reject his nomination by the parties, saying that it is crucial
to the restoration of a stable democratic policy in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. condemned what it described as the "manipulation" of
the government's transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
Rubin Said: "It appears that the government of Nigeria is
manipulating the transition in order to secure the nomination of
General Sani Abacha, who is now in control of the country, as the
sole candidate in the presidential election planned for August
1."
</P>
<P>
"So far, Nigeria's transition is seriously flawed and failing.
What we've seen so far is the manipulation of the democratic
process by General Abacha and his cronies."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the U.S. is urging Abacha "to live up to
his promise to his fellow Nigerians and the entire world and to
refuse the nomination so that a genuine transition to civilian
democratic rule may take place."
</P>
<P>
Britain, which had earlier condemned Abacha's adoption as a
sole candidate, went further Tuesday to threaten to initiate
further sanctions against Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, was quoted by the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) as giving the hint at
Britain's first annual report on human rights around the world.

<HEADLINE> Agreement on Status of New Caledonia Reached </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The pro-French and pro-independence
parties of the South Pacific islands of New Caledonia reached an
agreement on the future of the territory on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the indigenous Kanak people of New
Caledonia could realize their dream for independence within 20
years through a referendum on independence to be held between 2013
and 2018, after one and a half centuries of colonial rule by
France.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in Noumea, capital of New Caledonia,
by French government representative Alain Christnacht, pro-French
RPCR party president Jacques Lafleur, and pro-independence FNLKS
party president Roch Wamytan.
</P>
<P>
The 18-page agreement was reached under the personal
intervention of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
State Secretary for Overseas Affairs Jean-Jack Queyranne said
New Caledonia will enter an "evolutionary process" toward
independence and cease to be an overseas territory of France by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The French government will transfer "in an irreversible way"
the most important powers to the local government which is
established around the local parliament, said the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The governor, appointed by Paris, will be replaced by a
collegiate government to be elected by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
At the referendum, local people will decide whether the
territory will change its status of justice, public order, defense
and money, and therefore fully cut its links with France.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the referendum, the French government will also
"remould the lasting social links "between the French community
and indigenous Kanak community, in order to allow the Kanak people
to establish with France the new relations corresponding to the
realities of our times."
</P>
<P>
The customary rights of the Kanak tribal leaders will be
reinforced and the use of Kanak language will be increased in
schools and media.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jospin will go to Noumea to inaugurate a Kanak
cultural center named after Jean-Marie Tjibaou, a Kanak leader
assassinated in 1988 by a Kanak extremist for signing a ceasefire
agreement with the French government.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Meets Japanese Parliamentary Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao Wednesday spoke highly of the role that the Chinese and
Japanese parliaments have played in enhancing Sino-Japanese
relations.
</P>
<P>
Meeting separately with Japan's House of Representatives
speaker Soichiro Ito and House of Councillors president Juro
Saito, Hu said parliament diplomacy constitutes an important part
of state-to-state relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) and Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) value their
friendly ties with Japanese Diet (parliament), said Hu.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Japanese Diet has accumulated rich experience
in legislature and hoped that the parliaments of China and Japan
would boost bilateral cooperation to play an even bigger role in
fostering Sino-Japanese friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that Sino-Japanese cooperation in various fields has
witnessed remarkable progress since the normalization of bilateral
ties thanks to the efforts of the two countries' governments,
parliaments, political parties and people from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party and government will as always carry
out the good-neighborly and cooperative policy toward Japan, Hu
added.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president briefed the Japanese Legislators on the
formation and function of the NPC and China's political system.
</P>
<P>
Ito said that Hu's current Japan tour and the upcoming visit to
Japan by Chinese President Jiang Zemin would greatly advance
friendly relations between China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the principles set in Japan-China Joint Statement
and Japan-China Peace and Friendship Treaty are the foundation of
bilateral ties. The Japanese Diet would firmly abide by these
principles and work for a friendly Japan-China relationship
oriented toward the next century, he added.
</P>
<P>
Saito said the fact that Hu chose Japan as the first country of
his overseas trip after assuming vice presidency demonstrated that
China treasures its ties with Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Diet is willing to expand exchange with China's
NPC, he told Hu.
</P>
<P>
He said that Japan would not allow the unfortunate history to
repeat and would promote Japan-China friendly relations on the
basis of serious introspection.

<HEADLINE> Turkey-Iran Ties Still Marred by Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is still concerned about
Iran's alleged support for the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) despite their warmer relations, the Daily News reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We still maintain our reservations towards Tehran because of
the PKK. We have not yet been persuaded (that Iran does not
support the PKK)," a senior Foreign Ministry official, who
declined to be named, was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Turkey regards Iran as a key neighbor and has a good will to
improve bilateral relations, he said. But he stressed that
previous mistakes should not be repeated.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has repeatedly accused Tehran of providing military and
financial support to the PKK, which has been fighting a separatist
war in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Iran, however, has categorically rejected the accusation,
saying that it has never aided or sheltered PKK militants.
</P>
<P>
"The PKK issue will be brought to the table during the
security committee talks (between the two countries)," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Local reports have said that Turkey and Iran will hold a series
of talks on security and economic issues in the coming weeks.

<HEADLINE> Western Management Adapts to Chinese Traditions (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- When the Chinese public gets
incensed about reports of overseas-funded businesses exploiting or
abusing Chinese workers' most basic rights, the experience of
3-year-old Xie Congwen comes as a nice change.
</P>
<P>
The toddler's life was saved less than six months ago by help
from Alcoa (Shanghai) Aluminum Products Co. Ltd., a Sino-American
joint venture which employs the boy's parents.
</P>
<P>
With money donated by co-workers, a suitable hospital was found
in Melbourne, Australia, by Graeme Turnley, the former Alcoa
general manager, and his wife. The Xie family was able to stay in
Melbourne from July through October until Congwen had recovered
from a series of operations necessitated by a life-threatening
congenital disease.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Alcoa (Shanghai) was commended recently for good
labor-capital relations along with 10 other Sino-overseas
companies in Shanghai's Minhang Economic and Technological
Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
"Those cited represent an increasing number of foreign-funded
enterprises that have started to absorb in their management style
a Chinese tradition that the business is looked upon as a family
which takes care of everybody working in it," explained Lu
Youming, general manager of the Shanghai Minhang United
Development Co. Ltd., which manages and services the zone on
behalf of the local government.
</P>
<P>
He added that examples of good labor-capital relations also
indicate that what Chinese employees hope to get from the
businesses are not only good wages, but also a corporate culture
which encourages the members to help each other.

<TEXT>
<P>
Concurring with Lu's opinion, Alcoa's financial director Peggy
L. Phillips said the most important factor for an enterprise is
the people working there. Alcoa will help anybody in difficulties,
Chinese or foreign, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Good labor-capital relations also help boost efficiency,"
Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
Among those cited, Lu said, are businesses who paid huge bills
for cancer treatment or kidney transplants for employees, or
raised funds to send children of poor families back to school.
</P>
<P>
To promote understanding between management and workers, she
added, some businesses take regular satisfaction surveys of
employees or convene audiences between the two. "Workers'
viewpoints have been adopted to improve management or their
working and living conditions," Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between management and workers have become a major
concern with the Chinese public in the past year because of highly
publicized incidents in which some overseas-funded firms ignored
or encroached on the rights of their Chinese employees. There were
cases in which employees were forced to work extra hours without
proper pay, and those in which the workers were even insulted and
persecuted for failing to follow unreasonable demands from their
overseas employers.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions and government departments across the country have
made efforts to protect workers' rights. According to Shanghai's
municipal committee for overseas investment, the majority of
overseas-funded businesses in the city have signed labor contracts
with employees which establish clear stipulations on working
hours, wages, pay, labor security, hygiene, medical insurance and
pension plans.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, about 10,000 overseas-funded enterprises
had been set up in Shanghai, employing nearly 950,000 people,
accounting for 17.7 percent of the city's total labor force.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Measures Taken To Ensure Economic Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A fairly obvious change was
recorded in China's macro-economic policy since the beginning of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The government has placed its emphasis on boosting a rapid,
sustained economic growth by increasing investment and stimulating
consumption. A new upsurge of investment has started in all parts
of China.
</P>
<P>
A number of Chinese economists have proposed on many occasions
that the state should increase investment to make the country's
economy grow steadily. Some held the view that the buyer's market
benefits economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The speed of growth has long been the crux of the matter in
China's economic development. The country's economic growth rate
had a slight reduction in the past few years, with a growth of 8.8
percent in 1997 and an expected 8 percent growth rate this year.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Development Planning Commission said
that only if the annual growth rate stands around 8 percent in
forthcoming years can it promote economic restructuring and
enterprise reforms as well as provide more job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
China's economy is in the process from a planned one to a
market one. The supply of a great number of consumer goods has met
or exceeded the market demand in urban districts, hindering
full-scale production at industrial firms. And the development of
rural markets will take a long time.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the central government has decided to
increase investment in the fields of agriculture, water
conservation, infrastructures, new-technology and high-tech
businesses, technological upgrading of enterprises, public
utilities and residential housing.
</P>
<P>
China's investment for development in the next three years is
estimated at eight trillion yuan, which will be raised in the form
of government investment, foreign funds and bonds. Investment in
fixed assets for this year is expected to increase by 400 billion
yuan, compared with the figure for last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Burkina Faso President
Blaise Compaore arrived here Wednesday afternoon for a five-day
state visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The president was received at the Kuala Lumpur International
Airport by Malaysian Deputy Foreign Minister Leo Michael Toyad and
Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Megat Junid Megat
Ayob who is the minister-in-attendance.
</P>
<P>
The African leader will be accorded a ceremonial welcome at
Parliament Square Thursday morning before receiving Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon Thursday, the African leader is scheduled to
attend a delegation meeting to be chaired by Mahathir, which would
focus on bilateral, regional and international issues of common
interest.
</P>
<P>
Compaore will also have an audience with Malaysian King Tuanku
Ja'afar who will host a state banquet in honor of the president.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Compaore is scheduled to attend a briefing at the
Economic Planning Unit in the Prime Minister's Department followed
by a visit to several places, including the Petronas Twin Towers
-- the world's tallest building in the Kuala Lumpur City Center,
and the second national car assembly plant in Rawang near here.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, he will attend briefings at the Malaysian
Industrial Development Authority and the Malaysian Agricultural
Research and Development Institute on Malaysia's strategies for
investment promotion, economic planning and agro-based production.
</P>
<P>
The president is accompanied by a 26-member delegation
including Foreign Minister Ablasse Ouedraogo; Trade, Industry and
Handicraft Minister Idrissa Zampalegre; Agriculture and Animal
Resources Minister Michel Koutaba.

Zhang Hanya, director of the Investment Research Institute
under the State Development Planning Commission, said the present
financial and material resources of China make it possible for the
country to raise the growth rate of investment to 20 percent in
the 1998-99 period.
</P>
<P>
To create greater domestic demand, the government will abolish
the century-old practice of welfare distribution of residential
houses in the latter half of the year, expand the scale of
mortgage loans and develop a real estate secondary market.
</P>
<P>
Though the buyer's market hampers China's economic development
for the time being, many government officials and economists are
confident in economic growth by raising investment.
</P>
<P>
In the last couple of years, market demand for residential
houses, cars and computers has been spiraling. Massive
construction of infrastructure projects has also driven the
development of related industries.
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, some Chinese experts predicted that a new
economic development period would start in 1997. Facts proved that
the real start of the new period will be made this year.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, people have every reason to believe that a sustained
high economic growth rate is far from termination.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: China Sets to Foster Institutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By launching three securities investment funds in a row in less
than a month, China has showed its strong determination to nurture
institutional investors in the securities market, and facilitate
its stable and healthy development, economists here have agreed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese securities market has already undergone rapid
expansion in recent years, with the share of the market capital in
the national GDP soaring from less than eight percent in 1995 to
23 percent last year. At the end of March, the number of listed
companies on the stock market surged to 763, while the market
capital hit 1.878 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, the market is still not spared of over-speculation and
irrational investment as a result of the still flawed legal
framework and lack of adequate supervision.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of the state enterprise reform and the
introduction of a socialist market economic system,
direct financing, or raising funds on the capital market, is bound
to play a more important role, which in turn will give rise to the
necessity of a stable and healthy securities market.
</P>
<P>
To this end, China unveiled the regulations governing the
management of securities investment funds, and launched the first
two such funds early this month.
</P>
<P>
Through purchasing investment funds, the investors entrust
their personal savings to the professional fund managers, who will
then invest in bonds and stocks in the principles of "safety,
liquidity, and profitability".
</P>
<P>
Since risks in investment funds are much lower than the stocks,
securities investment funds are expected to attract more private
savings into the securities market, thereby facilitating the
reform in state-owned ventures.
</P>
<P>
The investment funds are also conducive to fostering rational
and reliable institutional investors on the securities market, and
making the market more rational and stable by reducing the
predominant proportion of individual investors for the present,
economists agreed.
</P>
<P>
The macro-economic backdrop also provided a solid foundation
for the investment funds and the securities market: the Chinese
economy soft-landed and finally embarked on the path of "high
growth and low inflation"; the savings of the Chinese people kept
rising steadily, with the total outstanding individual bank
savings surpassing 4.8 trillion yuan at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the first two funds have already received warm
greetings on the market. Both were nearly 40 times oversubscribed
upon issuing and their prices have surged to and remained at a
high level since being listed on the stock exchanges. The
optimistic market sentiment triggered by the listing of the two
funds also brought the stock indices and turnover to a ten-month
high.
</P>
<P>
Due to the favorable market performance of the two experimental
funds, China is expected to launch the rest two funds after the
debut of Fund Xinghua very soon, according to Zhou Zhengqing,
chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, who also
revealed that more such funds may be on the way if all the five
funds are successful.
</P>
<P>
Based on the fact that the Chinese authorities is already set
on giving a full play to the securities investment funds and
fostering institutional investors, the nation's securities market
is blessed with a promising future, agreed economists.

<HEADLINE> Australia Unveils Five-Year Plan for Auto Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal
government Wednesday unveiled a 1.3-billion-U.S.-dollar plan aimed
at encouraging car manufacturing firms to make long-term
commitments to the nation's automotive industry.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, or the Automotive Competitiveness and
Investment Scheme (ACIS), the duty-free allowance for imported
components to be used in cars assembled in Australia would be
expanded, and incentives would be introduced for increased
investment spending.
</P>
<P>
"The scheme will be consistent with World Trade Organization
(WTO) rules and will ensure a stable transition towards a secure
global position for Australia's car industry," Fischer said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The scheme launched by Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer
and Industry Minister John Moore will not come into force until
the next stage of winding back protection when tariffs are cut
from 20 percent to 15 percent on January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The plan seeks to ease the transition to an even lower industry
protection regime when tariffs on passenger motor vehicles are
further cut to 10 percent from January 1, 2005.
</P>
<P>
Several global car producers, including Toyota, General Motor
and Ford, have set up plants in Australia, with Ford Australia's
annual vehicle output totaling about 100,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers
Director Malcolm Stewart described the government's plan as a
significant step in securing investment, growth, jobs and exports
for Australia's component industry.

<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- "Cosco Geoby", Chinese brand name
strollers, are selling well in the United States, according to
today's edition of Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
The strollers, manufactured by the Good Baby Group in Kunshan,
east China's Jiangsu Province, entered the U.S. market at the end
of 1996, and gained a third place ranking in the baby carriage
market during 1997.
</P>
<P>
Geoby, a moniker meaning "good boy", attracted over 600,000
orders during the Dallas Children's Products Trade Fair held in
February this year.
</P>
<P>
Group General Manager Song Zhenghuan said the secret of Geoby's
success lies in the company's timely and in-depth studies
of trends on the U.S. market. The company has also established an
information system in the United States to ensure timely feedback.
</P>
<P>
Good Baby twin-seat stroller model immediately attracted the
attention of young parents in the United States. The model was
first displayed in February, 1997, with over 50,000 orders for the
product received during March.
</P>
<P>
The company also attributed its success to Cosco, its
U.S. agent which enjoys an impeccable reputation and strong sales
network.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Abolishes its Supervision Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government decided
on Wednesday to abolish its supervision over nine troubled tanks
as their financial conditions have been improved.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here jointly by several cabinet
ministers after attending the second meeting of Economic and
Financial Resilience Council headed by President Soeharto, Finance
Minister Fuad Bawazir said out of the nine banks which have broken
away from the direct supervision of the Indonesian Bank
restructuring Agency (IBRA), four are state-owned banks, one
construction bank under local administration and four private
banks.
</P>
<P>
As part of the national banking reforms to restore its
reputation and regain the confidence of people at home and abroad,
54 banks have been placed under the INRA's supervision since the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
On April 4, the government stopped the operation of seven
private banks and placed another seven banks under the management
of IBRA. The 14 banks are described as the "grave troubled banks"
from the 54 troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
The operations of the seven banks were frozen because they had
been using liquidity funds of Bank Indonesia (BI), central bank,
in excess of 500 percent of their paid-up capital and equal to or
in excess of 75 percent of their total assets.
</P>
<P>
The other seven banks placed under IBRA control had been using
BI liquidity funds totaling more than 2 trillion rupiah (about 240
million U.S. dollars) and also in excess of 500 percent of their
total equity.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has 240 banks and about 200 of them are private ones.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia started its banking reforms in October last year
after signing an agreement with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) on economic and financial reforms in exchange for the
IMF-led bailout package of 43 billion U.S. dollar to overcome
monetary crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
At the end of October last year, the Indonesian government
closed down 16 unsolved private banks in a bid to improve the
efficiency of the banking system.
</P>
<P>
Fuad said the government encourages small and troubled banks to
make their own efforts to merge among them, to supplement funds or
introduce new investment in order to strengthen their competition.

<HEADLINE> Salaries for Web-related Jobs Surveyed in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Salaries for Internet and
Web-related jobs in the United States range roughly from 40,000 to
120,000 U.S. dollars a year, according to the findings of a survey
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, the first of its kind conducted by the American
Electronics Association, was carried out on 19 large companies,

Web content groups.
</P>
<P>
As with many sectors of high technology, all of the jobs
surveyed substantially outpaced the private sector wage average of
28,582 dollars, the association said.
</P>
<P>
Start-ups can be 10 to 20 percent lower than the big companies
when it comes to base salary. Sometimes they are even 10,000 to
20,000 dollars lower, and offering stock or other kinds of
alternative compensation are usual ways to make up for the loss.
</P>
<P>
The highest salaries, with an average of 121,200 dollars a
year, are paid to "Internet strategists," who develop strategy for
use of the Internet in support of division or company goals. This
job requires a bachelor's degree in computer science, business or
marketing and three to five years' experience in information
systems design.
</P>
<P>
Next come electronics commerce managers, who manage Internet
commerce for a business unit. The job requires a bachelor's degree
in computer science or business, plus several years of experience
in defining business systems. They earn 120,100 dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Those who earn 78,500 dollars and 76,700 dollars are Web
publishers and Internet engineers. The former directs staff that
produces content for Web projects, and the latter acts as
technical resource for company's Internet unit.
</P>
<P>
Forum managers, Web editors and graphic artists earn between
50,000 and 45,000 dollars. Forum manager handles an Internet chat
room and needs basic knowledge of online tools and company
policies.
</P>
<P>
A Web editor develops content for web sites and is required to
have a bachelor's degree in English, journalism experience,
knowledge of hypetext markup language (HTML) and Web-page
design. Graphic artists use online tools to solve routine
technical design problems.

BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan and his Portuguese counterpart Jaime Gama held talks here
today.
</P>
<P>
Gama is accompanying Prime Minister Antonio Guterres on the
current visit to China.
</P>

21st century and form a new Euroasian partnership.
</P>
<P>
Gama pointed to the increasing frequency of cooperation,

<HEADLINE> World Personal Computers: Revenue Grows Slower Than Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide personal computer
sales are expected to increase 15.6 percent, while revenue will
grow only 6.4 percent this year, Dataquest, a leading market
research firm in California, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Dataquest, worldwide PC shipments will total 93.1
million units in 1998 and revenue will reach 166 billion
U.S. dollars for computer sellers.
</P>
<P>
Both figures are lower than the firm's previous projections
which estimated a sales growth of 17 percent and a revenue growth
of 16 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The main reason, Dataquest said, is the fact that the
proliferation of personal computers which are priced lower than
1,000 dollars is boosting sales while curbing overall revenue
growth for PC makers.
</P>
<P>
The firm also forecast a slightly higher growth rate for home
PC market than the business sector as more families buy their
first or extra PCs.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Europe and Asia would remain top-selling
regions in the world PC market this year, Dataquest said.
</P>
<P>
Sales increase in the United States, Europe and Asia will be 16
percent, 14 percent and 23 percent respectively, while revenue
growth for them will be three percent, nine percent and 17
percent, in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Israel to Hold Military Talks in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Israel are expected to
hold military talks in Tel Aviv, capital of Israel, at the end of
May in a bid to further develop the military ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News reported Wednesday that Deputy Chief of Turkish
General Staff Cevik Bir and Israeli Defense Under-secretary David
Ivry will meet to discuss the "threats" to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a military source, who asked not to be named,
as saying that "The rising missile threat in the Middle East, as
well as support for terrorism, from which both Turkey and Israel
have been suffering, will be discussed and evaluated during the
talks."
</P>
<P>
Iran, Iraq and Syria are among the countries which will be
reportedly discussed for their alleged support for terrorism and
their efforts to increase their offensive missile technologies,
said the source.
</P>
<P>
The paper also reported that Turkish and Israeli high-ranking
military officials will discuss another joint military
maneuver. But there is no detail about where and when.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, Israel and the United States held a joint naval
maneuver in the Mediterranean off Israel last January, which drew
harsh reactions from the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of April, a group of 30 Israeli defense
officials visited Turkey seeking more opportunities to boost their
current defense industry capacities through cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Israel is upgrading 54 Turkish F-4 warplanes under a contract
worth 632 million U.S. dollars and has also won a bid to upgrade
48 Turkish F-5 fighters.
</P>
<P>
Ankara and Tel Aviv have agreed in principle to jointly
produce hundreds of Popeye II, which, as an advanced model of
Popeye I, has a range of 150 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Popeye series missiles are being used in both F-16 and F-4
warplanes. Turkey purchased 200 Popeye I missiles from Israel and
deliveries began at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Military Industries is modernizing Turkey's aging M-60
tanks as part of Turkey's 4.5-billion-dollar project.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Director Calls for Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A director of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has criticized the
trend of disunity in the sub-regional body resulting in the
setting up of other organizations by some member states.
</P>
<P>
"There must be only one regional community for success to be
achieved, if not it will amount to dissipation of efforts," said
Frank Ofei, ECOWAS Director of Statistics, quoted by New Nigerian
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The director was referring to the establishment of the
Monetary Union of West Africa (Umoa) in 1994, an umbrella body
for French-speaking ECOWAS member countries, said the official
daily.
</P>
<P>
A bigger body with a larger regional market was more likely to
grow better than smaller ones, the director added.
</P>
<P>
Certain ECOWAS programs have been stalled because of the
divided interests of some members which belong to both
organizations.
</P>
<P>
In the latest case, the last-minute withdrawal of Umoa
countries last December has stalled the production and launching
of the ECOWAS travelers' check, a major move taken by the
sub-regional body toward a single monetary zone in west Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to Ofei, French speaking countries within Umoa
cannot be viable unless they are linked to a bigger viable market
to give it a regional outlook.
</P>
<P>
"If you privatize or sell an enterprises to Umoa, it cannot
thrive unless it has a bigger market for its products," the
ECOWAS director said.
</P>
<P>
Another official in the ECOWAS money and payment department,
David Asate, was more straight forward.
</P>
<P>
He urged France not to stall the emergence of a single
currency in west Africa because it was supporting a common
currency within the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The issue of single currency within the ECOWAS sub-region
should be left to the political decisions of members which are
free to place their will where they feel they have more interest,
Asate told journalists last weekend in Abuja, the Nigerian
capital.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS, set up in 1975 as a sub-regional economic bloc, has 16
members, including 11 French-speaking countries.

<HEADLINE> China, Portugal to Strengthen Education Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Portuguese ministers
today pledge to strengthen bilateral education exchanges and
cooperation in line with the smooth development of relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The pledge came from Chinese Minister of Education Chen Zhili
and her Portuguese counterpart Marcal Grilo, who is visiting China
along with Prime Minister Antonio Guterres.
</P>
<P>
Educational exchanges and cooperation constitute an important
part of bilateral relation and will in turn help promote
country-to-country relations, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
She noted that China is willing to cooperate with Portugal and
all other European Union countries in related efforts.
</P>
<P>
Grilo voiced agreement with Chen's view and said the Portuguese
side highly values cooperation with China in all fields,
particularly in the realm of education, science and technology,
economic ties and trade.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also exchanged views on enhancing links
between universities, as well as professional and technical
training, and the prospects for education in Macao following its
return to China in December next year. Discussions also centered
on a number of related issues, including Chinese language and
Chinese culture instruction in Portuguese universities.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Portuguese exchanges and cooperation in the realm of
education have developed smoothly since the two countries signed
an agreement on cultural, scientific and technological cooperation
in 1982. More than 100 Chinese students are currently studying in
Portugal, and eight Chinese universities, including Beijing
University and Qinghua University, have established direct links
with Portuguese counterparts.

future economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China has achieved in great successes in reform and opening-up,
while Portugal's economy is developing toward

economic and trade cooperation to a new high.
</P>
<P>
Guterres said both governments support the cooperation between
entrepreneurs of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is part of Portugal's strategy to develop
economic and trade ties with China, Guterres said, adding that the
fourth meeting of the Sino-Portugal Economic and Trade Committee
which will be held this fall will further improve such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said his country is willing to contribute to
economic ties between the European Union and China.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xinhua, vice-minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, said at the opening ceremony that China's sustained
and rapid economic development and huge market provide opportunities
for Portuguese enterprises.
</P>
<P>

height, have their eyes on the 21st century and seize the
opportunity to improve bilateral ties and economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese State Councillor Wu Yi, Portugal's Foreign Minister
Jaime Gama and Portugal's Economic Minister Joaquim Pina Moura
also attended the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is the first of its kind Portugal has ever
held in China. More than 60 enterprises from Portugal are
participating in the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Guterres also attended a China-Portugal workshop on
biotechnology here today. He said that the advancement of science
and technology should not be dominated by several developed
countries, and that China has made achievements in the field even
though it is a developing country.
</P>
<P>
China is Portugal's ideal cooperative partner in science and
technology, he added.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Puts Fund into Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
allocated 15.9 billion Kwacha (about 8.8 million U.S. Dollars)
for the local government elections expected to be held in June
this year.
</P>
<P>
Of the allocated money, nearly 500 million Kwacha has already
been released to the national registration office to facilitate a
speedy issuance of registration cards, the Zambia Daily Mail
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Election Commission Chairman Bobby Bwalya as
saying here Tuesday that the money was disbursed two weeks ago to
help the office put in place an effective mechanism of processing
cards to enable eligible voters to register for the polls.
</P>
<P>
Although the budgetary allocation may not adequately cater for
all the preparatory ground work, but Bwalya said he is optimistic
that at least a few logistics will be put in place.
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, preparations for the elections are underway
although they have not reached an advanced stage because a report
on the delimitation of wards exercise has not yet been submitted
to the relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
The commission has been holding several meetings with some
opposition parties and the donor community on the elections, and
he is impressed with the response from them, said Bwalya.
</P>
<P>
There is no need to worry over the delay in holding the
elections, he said, adding that the local elections will
definitely take place this year.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Invites Netanyahu for Cairo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak has invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
Cairo next Tuesday to discuss the Middle East peace process,
Israel Radio reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a statement, issued by the Prime Minister's
Office Tuesday night, as saying that Mubarak and Netanyahu will
have a working breakfast together in the Egyptian capital.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Mubarak extended the invitation during a
phone conversation with Netanyahu about a week ago, but the
summit was settled on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be the first between the two leaders in a full
year. Mubarak has repeatedly charged that Netanyahu is not
committed to advancing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the summit comes just days before Netanyahu and
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat are
scheduled to hold separate meetings with the U.S. Secretary of
State Madeline Albright in London on May 4th.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said that they believe Egypt would like to
enhance its role in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is expected to echo an appeal from Jordan's King
Hussein, who has urged Netanyahu to accept the U.S. initiative
for a 13 percent further Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has stayed firm on 9 percent, although there have
been reports this week that he may soften the stance and settle at
11 percent after his meeting with visiting British Prime Minister
Tony Blair early this week.
</P>
<P>
The scope of Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank has
remained a hurdle to unblocking the stalled peace process.

<P>
Sources from the administrative department of the airport said
the devices have proved to be quite effective in driving birds out
of the airport in the past 20 days of operation.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of the environment in the airport area, an
increasing number of birds has threatened the safety of aircraft
landing and taking off from the airport.
</P>
<P>
In October, the airport was forced to close for two hours in
the afternoons for several days as many swallows gathered at the
airport's runways.
</P>
<P>
Before the installation of the devices, the airport had used
many methods to relocate the birds, such as asking workers to
drive out birds and firing warning shoots. However, the methods
were ineffective.

<HEADLINE> Istanbul Mayor Sentenced to 10 Months for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Istanbul Mayor Tayyip Erdogan has
been sentenced to 10 months in prison and a fine of about 320
U.S. dollars for an anti-secular speech.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's State Security Court in Diyarbakir made the verdict
because Erdogan made made the pro-Islamic speech last December in
the southeastern province of Siirt, in violation of the
constitution, local Daily News reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The court convicted Erdogan, also member of the newly-founded
pro-Islamic Virtue party, of "inciting hatred" in an address to
Islamist supporters, in which he reportedly said that "Minarets
will be our bayonets and domes, our shields".
</P>
<P>
Erdogan was elected mayor of Istanbul, the largest city of
Turkey, in 1994. He did not appear at the hearing on Tuesday and
is not expected to be sent to jail immediately.
</P>
<P>
The case must now go through the Court of Appeals which may
approve the decision of the State Security Court in Diyarbakir. If
the Court of Appeals upholds that decision, Erdogan will be sent
to jail and removed from office, losing the chance to run for
election.
</P>
<P>
Erdogan is particularly believed to be preparing to replace
Islamist leader Necmettin Erbakan, whose Welfare Party (RP) was
banned on January 16, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Daily News said that the Interior Ministry can also appeal
to the higher court to remove Erdogan from office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish police has detained at least 16 leading
Islamist businessmen for questioning on suspected links to Islamic
groups this week. "They were taken from their houses at
four in the morning by anti-terrorist police squads and brought
to Ankara for questioning", Erol Yarar, head of an Islamist
business group, was quoted by the paper.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Suzhou State New and
High-Technology Development Zone in east China's Jiangsu Province
reported robust growth in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the zone, which was founded six
years ago, turned out an industrial output value of more than 3.35
billion yuan in the first three months, a rise of 34.9 percent
over the same period last year. The zone's quarterly profit surged
73.3 percent year-on-year to 117 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Contracted overseas investment for projects approved in the
zone in the first quarter totaled 117 million U.S. dollars, the
largest among similar zones in Jiangsu, one of China's economic
powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
During the past six years, the zone has invested 3 billion yuan
in infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
As the overall investment environment improves, more overseas
companies are making their way into the zone. Overseas companies,
including 50 multinational corporations, had funded more than 300
projects in the zone by early this month, with total investment
hitting 3.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis has not affected the zone
considerably, though investors from Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan
regions account for a large proportion of all overseas investment
in the zone, according to one official.
</P>
<P>
The overall economic efficiency of firms in the zone doubled in
the first quarter, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Japanese Jiangsu Fuji Communications Technology
Co. Ltd., for example, reported a profit of 29.54 million yuan in
the first quarter, a surge of 157 percent over a year ago.

<P>
WELLINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The long-term unemployed
people will receive a community wage from October 1 instead of
unemployment benefit as in the past, the government announced on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Employment Minister Peter McCardle said from October 1,
jobseekers will have to sign contracts which require them to do
community work or participate in training or another organized
activity. In return, they will receive a community wage which will
replace the present unemployment.
</P>
<P>
He said the long-term unemployed will have to work or train for
20 hours a week or face losing their benefit.
</P>
<P>
If they refuse, quit or turn up late, their community wage will
be cut or suspended until they comply.
</P>
<P>
McCardle said he expected that at least 60,000 jobless people
will participate in this work-for-the-dole scheme in the next
fiscal year, with 25,000 of them doing community work.
</P>
<P>
He told Radio New Zealand that the amount of community wage is
about the same as the unemployment benefit. But those doing
community work will receive an additional traveling allowance and
be able to claim some extra costs.

<HEADLINE> Business Confidence in NZ Sinks to New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence in New
Zealand sank to a seven-year low in the first quarter of this
year, Radio New Zealand reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted the latest survey of the Economic Research
Institute as reporting that difficult trading conditions and a
weakening domestic economy are chiefly responsible for the falling
confidence.
</P>
<P>
A net of 36 percent of businesses expect the general business
situation to deteriorate during the next six months, up from 20
percent shown in the last survey conducted in the fourth quarter
in 1997, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
It has found that all sectors had turned pessimistic about the
general economic situation.
</P>
<P>
But the institute believes that pessimism is being driven by
several factors, but mainly the continued slowdown in domestic
activity.
</P>
<P>
"Sales in New Zealand have fallen steadily across all sectors
and are expected to decline again over the next three months," the
institute pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Other factors it listed are the Asian economic crisis which has
now hit all the sectors, continued drought in some parts of the
country and the power crisis in New Zealand's largest city
Auckland.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April, 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Minister for
Environment and Forest Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury has called for
creating public awareness about the adverse effect of
desertification, the Bangladesh Observer daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister made this call while inaugurating the country's
first national awareness seminar on "Combating Desertification in
Bangladesh" held in Dhaka Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, which has a total area of 148,393 square
kilometers, is situated within the tropical humid region, she
said.
</P>
<P>
"But its 74,000 square kilometers covering northwestern and
southwestern regions are arid as it experiences minimum rainfall
annually," she said.
</P>
<P>
Such an area accounts for about 50 percent of the country's
total land area, and the desertification problem is more acute in
the northern region, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that 75 percent of the land is in a state of
conversion into deserts, and about 6 million hectares of land were
being lost due to desertification every year.
</P>
<P>
She also expressed concern over the possible permanent
inundation of 17.5 percent of the total land area should there be
a rise in the sea level by one meter.
</P>
<P>
A national environment committee has been formed to formulate
national programs to fight desertification, she told the seminar.

Oil Field in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
It will be the biggest cooperative oil development project in
China's inland areas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Internet Users to Miss out on Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Moving images of the 2000 Sydney
Olympics will not be available on the Internet to protect the
rights of host broadcasters, the International Olympic Committee
(IOC) said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Sydney, The Internet received 600
million hits at the Nagano Winter Games in February, up from less
than 200 million at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is you can no longer control the territorial
issues so you are then breaching other broadcasters' rights," IOC
marketing director Michael Payne told reporters in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"The moment you put it on it's worldwide so you can't then
control it from the territorial side and I think the general view
is that the technology will not be sufficiently advanced (by
2000) to even consider doing something on a territorial
restricted basis."
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the booming Internet market was a threat to
television revenue, which will account for almost one billion
dollars (670 million) at the Sydney Games with the likes of US
giant NBC and Australia's Channel Seven invloved.
</P>
<P>
The IOC successfully trialled a system called Video On Demand
(VOD) in Nagano, which allowed users to access broadcast footage
of sport and press conferences at the Games, plus archival
material.
</P>
<P>
Australia's senior IOC member Kevan Gosper, who also chairs the
IOC's Press Commission, said an agreement was imminent between
broadcasters and IOC technology partner IBM regarding Internet
rights.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government awaits the
green-light from the World Bank to award the tender for the
mechanical removal of the water hyacinth mass now choking Lake
Victoria, the Kenya Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the winning bidder out of the 16 companies which
placed tenders will remain confidential until the
Washington-based financial institution approves the project, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Minister for Natural Resources Francis Lotodo and World
Bank country director Harold Wackman held talks on this Tuesday.
They said the contract for the project would be signed as soon as
the World Bank approves the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
Wackman said that the World Bank was not dictating any terms
or setting a time limit for the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Tenders for the harvesting of the water hyacinth in Lake
Victoria, the second-largest fresh lake in the world, started on
November 7 last year and bids opened on January 5 this year with
a total of 39 firms having purchased the bid document.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank decided late last year to offer Kenya 2.3
million U.S. Dollars to help the east African country remove
water hyacinth from the lake, which also chokes their part of the
lake in Uganda and Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Residential Property Sector Strong in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 22 (Xinhua) -- All the indices show that
Malaysia's residential property sector in 1997 was fundamentally
strong and was gradually consolidating from the strong price
increases of the last few years, the Valuation and Property
Services Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sector did not slow down in the second half of the year as
many expected despite the economic slowdown but remained generally
stable although the percentage increases in the volume and value
of transactions were getting noticeably smaller, the department
said in its July-December 1997 report of the Malaysian Housing
Price Index.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian House Price Index rose 1.9 percent in 1997 to
216.8 points, a reflection that residential property prices were
generally slightly higher in 1997 from 1996, due to the
proportionately greater number of higher-priced properties
transacted in the market in 1997, especially in the first half of
the year, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Total volume of transactions for 1997 was at 175,569 with a
value of 21.8 billion ringgit (5.8445 billion U.S. dollars at the
present exchange rate), compared with a volume of 170,007
transactions and a value of 18.8 billion ringgit (5.0402 billion
dollars) in 1996, it said.
</P>
<P>
This showed a 3.3-percent jump in the volume of transactions
and a 16.2 percent increase in the value transacted.
</P>
<P>
However, it said the trend in the last quarter of 1997 began to
reflect the uncertainty in the national economy experienced in the
second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
"Given that there is a time-lag factor of about six to nine
months, the actual market situation may be more sluggish," the
department said.
</P>
<P>
The department said the amount of financing available to the
property sector will determine the outlook of the residential
property market in 1998.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that the total volume and value of transactions
might fall for the first time in the first quarter of 1998, to
support the earlier contention that the effects of the national
economic slowdown, first apparent around July-August 1997, are
beginning to show in the residential property sector about six
months later.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lanka Anti-Rebel Move Sees Slow Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- May 13 last year saw the Sri
Lankan government forces launching Operation Jayasikuru (Certain
Victory) to clear a 75-kilometer corridor on the main highway
through Tamil rebel-held territory from Vavuniya to the Jaffna
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Almost a year later, the government forces have been able to
only inch along the corridor amid stiff resistance, advancing just
32 kilometers to near Mankulam Town, a rebel stronghold.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, after a brief respite for the Sinhala and Tamil New
Year celebrations in the middle of this month, the forces
attempted to penetrate the rebel fortress, only to be met with
heavy mortar and artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said Wednesday that in the first assault 28
soldiers died and about 200 were injured, many of them seriously.
The rebels reportedly suffered even heavier casualties with more
than 60 dead and 300 injured.
</P>
<P>
However, the army claimed that it had been able to overrun a
rebel camp northwest of Olumadu following a series of clashes with
strong groups of rebels.
</P>
<P>
After a temporary lull, further fierce fighting broke out again
in the area and an air force Mi-24 helicopter gunship backing the
ground troops was hit by the rebels but not seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
Opening the highway to the government is of great significance
as it would give the government a ground route for sending
supplies to both the military and the civilians living in the
Jaffna peninsula which was recaptured by government troops in May
1996.
</P>
<P>
At present the government has to transport the supplies by air
and sea and this has proved to be extremely costly, particularly
with the rebels regularly attacking aircraft and ships in the
northern area.
</P>
<P>
For the rebels, it is also important to prevent the government
from controlling the main highway, whose opening would bisect the
rebel-held territory which stretches from coast to coast in the
middle of the island.
</P>
<P>
Since the fall of the Jaffna peninsula, the rebels have made
this area their headquarters and army infiltration would mean the
disintegration of their new stronghold.
</P>
<P>
The government, which deployed more than 20,000 troops for
Operation Jaya Sikuru, had hoped that the operation would
accomplish its objective within a few months after it started. But
the target date has been ever receding, casting doubt on whether
the objective could be attained at all.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels fighting for a separate state have been
throwing everything they have into this battle which for them is
one of survival.
</P>
<P>
As pointed out by military analysts here, if the road falls,
the Tamil rebels will be weakened considerably and lose their hold
on the Tamil population.
</P>
<P>
And this is something that the rebels have been trying their
utmost to prevent from happening.

<HEADLINE> Albright Urges Senate Approval of Biodiversity Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Tuesday called for early Senate approval of the
U.N. biodiversity convention as many species of plants and animals
face being wiped out by environmental changes.
</P>
<P>
At an event sponsored by the Museum of Natural History to mark
the International Earth Day, Albright said she would appoint a
special state department coordinator for affairs related to global
climate changes.
</P>
<P>
She said that the nation's biologists were convinced a mass
extinction of plants and animals is underway and poses a major
threat to humans in the next century, yet most Americans were
dimly aware of the problem.
</P>
<P>
She urged the Senate to approve the U.N.-initiated Convention
on Biological Diversity as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The convention, signed by most of the world's governments at
the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, seeks to protect
aquatic and agricultural resources, make their uses sustainable
and share their benefits.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state noted a serious loss of biodiversity in
her country, admitting: "We have less than one-twentieth of the
world's people, but we generate one-fifth of all greenhouse gas
emissions."
</P>
<P>
She said in recent years Americans have seen floods, droughts
and tornados that inflicted enormous human and financial costs
upon this country.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, Asia, and in Mexico, the effects of El Nino have had
a devastating impact on coastal populations. Globally, nine of the
last 11 years have been among the warmest in this century, she
added.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Spend US$88 Million on Education Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
spend 4.05 billion taka (about 88 million U.S. dollars) during the
current fiscal year (July 1997-June 1998) on the "Food for
Education" program, English dailies here reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the
parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The sum accounts for 47 percent of the total annual development
budget and 59 percent of the local resource allocation of the
primary and mass education sector, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The allocation for the sector during the 1996-97 fiscal year
was 3.29 billion taka (about 70.2 million dollars), the prime
minister said, adding that this program "is being implemented out
of the government's own resources."
</P>
<P>
This South Asian country's literacy rate among people above the
age of 15 now stands at 42.6 percent. The government has adopted
an education program aiming to eradicate illiteracy in the country
by the year 2006.

<HEADLINE> Australia Plans for Antarctic Base Cleanup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- One of the world's most remote
ghost towns, the abandoned Wilkes Antarctic base, is to be cleaned
up after almost 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government will conduct a detailed survey on how
to remove the accumulated rubbish and other material left behind
in the move to the Casey station in 1969, official sources said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary Secretary (with responsibility for the
Antarctic), Ian MacDonald said in a statement that the cleanup
would be an enormous task and could take more than 20 years,
almost twice as long as the base was in use.
</P>
<P>
MacDonald said he had instructed the Antarctic division to
allocate 90,000 Australian dollars (60,000 U.S. dollars) for a
survey of the old Wilkes station next summer.
</P>
<P>
"The survey will provide information to enable me to finalize
an environmentally friendly and cost-effective plan for the
cleanup of Wilkes," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Subject to any environmental or heritage requirements, the
plan will result in the removal of rubbish and old buildings from
the site."
</P>
<P>
The Wilkes station was established by the United States in 1957
and transferred to Australian control two years later.
</P>
<P>
But the base was located in a valley and faced continual
problems with ice and snow accumulation.
</P>
<P>
It was abandoned when Australia opened the more suitably
located Casey station on nearby hills.
</P>
<P>
MacDonald said it is like a buried ghost town with
accommodation, dining, storage and working structures still in
place.
</P>
<P>
It also features extensive rubbish dumps, old fuel drums and
bladders and food stores.
</P>
<P>
Under the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty which
came into force in January, signatory nations are required to
remove abandoned facilities and rubbish.
</P>
<P>
"Cleaning up Wilkes is a big task and may take more than 20
years to complete because many buildings are only exposed during
major thaws," MacDonald said.

<P>
SIEM REAP, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Deposed First Prime Minister of

</P>
<P>
Ranariddh said at the Siem Reap airport that he was very happy
to return home and meet the King.
</P>
<P>
He said he will express his gratitude to his father for
pardoning him. He will also ask the King to play a role in
assuring national reconciliation and in holding a free and fair
election.
</P>
<P>
"We need a lot of international observers to supervise the
election, but the King's role is greater than all of them," the
Prince said.
</P>
<P>
He is confident in the King's ability to let the Cambodian
people express their desires freely in order to experience
national reconciliation among all political parties including the
Cambodian People's Party and the people.
</P>
<P>
The Prince is expected to stay here for two days.

The King and Queen returned to the northern town of Siem Reap
on April 11 to enjoy the Cambodian new year. He spent the
previous three months in China where he received medical
treatment.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay to Hold Presidential Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Paraguayan Superior
Court of Electoral Justice said the country's presidential
elections will be held on May 10 as scheduled, said reports from
Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Mojoli, president of the electoral court, discarded
reports on Tuesday of any election postponement. He said there is
no authority with power enough to change the constitutional terms.
</P>
<P>
After presenting a new candidate list, the ruling Partido
Colorado party asked for a postponement. They argued that their
new candidates would not have enough time to prepare themselves
for the May 10 election as well as other candidates, and thus a
temporary postponement of the election would be fair.
</P>
<P>
The request was denied by the major opposition, the
Democratic Alliance, which is formed by the Authentic
Liberal Radical and the Encuentro Nacional parties.
</P>
<P>
The Partido Colorado party changed its candidacy list because
its presidential candidate, former General Lino Oviedo, is now
politically incapacitated. He was sentenced to 10 years in jail
for plotting a coup d'etat.
</P>
<P>
On the new list, Oviedo was replaced by his colleague, Raul
Cubas Grau, who transferred his former vice-presidential candidacy
to another leader of the party, Luis Maria Argana.

<HEADLINE> FAO Calls for Urgent Action to Promote Fisheries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The on-going senior officials
meeting of the 24th Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific has called for urgent
action to promote fisheries and sustainable development of
aquaculture.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed at the three-day meeting, which opened here on
Monday, that greater attention should be paid to fisheries
management and international cooperation and coordination
strengthened in fisheries conservation and management in the
region, according to the FAO's regional office.
</P>
<P>
Participants also agreed that the FAO-based Asia-Pacific Fish
Commission (APFIC) is one of the best mechanisms for such
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting voiced support for the work of APFIC and asked FAO
to assume a leading role in cooperation and coordination among
various fishery organizations in the region so as to avoid
duplications.
</P>
<P>
Fishery is crucial for food security in the Asia and Pacific
region and contributes to economic and social well-being in all
developing countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
About 85 percent of fishers in the world live in Asia and the
Pacific and they contributed 52 percent of the world fishery
production in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Income from fishery exports from Asia increased to more than 19
million U.S. dollars in the same year.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated, however, that demand for food-fish for direct
human consumption in the region by 2010 would be 24 million tons
more than the current level of production.
</P>
<P>
The senior officials meeting is to be followed by a two-day
ministerial-level meeting on Thursday. The FAO regional conference
is being attended by about 150 representatives from 26 FAO member
countries in Asia and the Pacific, non-governmental organizations
and U.N. agencies.

<HEADLINE> Cablecar Victims' Families Want Trial of Airmen in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Relatives of the victims of a
cablecar disaster at an Italian ski resort said Tuesday that U.S.
military proceedings against the servicemen who caused the
disaster would not stop their campaign to seek justice in an
Italian civil court.
</P>
<P>
Twenty cablecar passengers were killed at Mt. Cermis on
February 3 after an Italy-based U.S. jet on a training flight cut
the cable and sent the car crashing into the slopes.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the victims were German, five Belgian, three Italian,
two Polish, one Dutch and one Austrian.
</P>
<P>
In Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, a U.S. military judge set two
hearings Monday to decide if the four U.S. Marine Corps officers
aboard the jet should be court-martialed.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Tuesday, the "February 3 Committee"
said it expected the Italian government to appeal to NATO's
central council to bring the trial back to Italy.
</P>
<P>
It said there were strong legal arguments for waiving usual
practice in this case, and assigning jurisdiction to Italy.
</P>
<P>
The committee said it expected a "clear stance" in this
direction from a joint session of the Parliamentary Justice and
Foreign Affairs Committees, when they meet to discuss the tragedy
in a week.
</P>
<P>
Noting that U.S. military procedures do not include civil
plaintiffs, the Committee said this would make it harder to "get
to the bottom of the responsibilities that led to the deaths of
the 20 people".
</P>
<P>
The Committee said the U.S. hearings should focus on the whole
chain of command, the whole system of U.S. training flights in
northern Italy, and repeated local warnings about low-level
flights over inhabited areas -- warnings which were ignored.
</P>
<P>
It also pointed out that the U.S. proceedings were based on
military findings presented well before Italian prosecutors
concluded their own investigation.
</P>
<P>
The military findings "ignore various pieces of testimony and
contain several inaccuracies," the Committee said.
</P>
<P>
The crew on board the U.S. jet were Captains Richard Ashby, 30,
William Raney, 26, Joseph Schweitzer, 30, and Chandler Seagraves,
28.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Military Judge Ronald Rogers on Monday decided on a May 5
hearing for crewmen Seagraves and Raney and a June 15 hearing for
pilots Ashby and Schweitzer.

</P>
<P>
By employing Iceland's technology and computer software,
mathematical models on underground heat reserves at Tanggu have
been established.
</P>

SHANGHAI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- "Who will lead the stock markets
in China? Hi-tech shares," says a recent survey in Shanghai, the
country's largest economic and financial powerhouse and home to
one of the only two exchanges in the country.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by the Shanghai Securities News among
200 local investors. Shanghai has more than 2.5 milliion stock
investors.
</P>
<P>
Of the people surveyed, 53 percent pin high hopes on hi-tech
shares, while nearly one-third favor the Hongqiao Airport.
</P>
<P>
Hi-tech shares, with a volume of 50 million to 80 million
shares each and moderate prices of 10 to 20 yuan are most likely
to lead the markets, they believe.
</P>
<P>
The poll indicates an optimistic market for local investors
this year because of favorable state policies on stock trading,
government policy to reinvigorate the nation through developing
science and education, and bullish international stock markets.

<HEADLINE> Central China's Luoyang Attracts More Outside Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The city of Luoyang has become
central China's new magnet for investment, signified by
construction of the Xiaolangdi water conservation project on the
Yellow River with an investment of 40 billion yuan and a large
chemical fiber project with an investment of 4.95 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
An official from the provincial government said that, as the
largest industrial city in central China's Henan Province, Luoyang
will extend several major projects with investments of 65 billion
yuan during the 1996-2000 period including transforming the old
industrial center and expanding thermo-electricity stations.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolangdi scenic zone has attracted 70 investors from overseas
as well as domestic investment. About 21 projects are under
construction or in operation, with investment expected to reach
380 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The state's major project -- the Luoyang chemical fiber project
-- started operation in February of 1998, and is expected to
produce 200,000 tons of polyester annually. In accordance with the
project, a petrochemical city will be set up in the northern part
of Luoyang.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the petrochemical industry output value of Luoyang is
expected to reach 10 billion yuan, with total profits exceeding 3
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Progress has also been reported in transforming the old
industrial base with an investment exceeding 4.9 billion yuan; 11
projects have become part of the state's plan.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996-2000 period, Luoyang is expected to add 1.98
million kilowatts of installed capacity. Up to now, Luoyang formed
six pillar industries including machine-building, eletronics,
metallurgy, building materials, petrochemicals, light industry and
food processing.
</P>
<P>
Luoyang has attracted investors from more than 20 countries and
regions. By 1997, the city had approved more than 483
foreign-funded enterprises with a total investment of 1.84 billion
U.S. dollars. The city also completed exports of 204 million U.S.
dollars, ranking first in Henan Province.

The air crash was the worst in Colombia since December 20,
1995, when an American Airlines Boeing 757 flew into mountains
near the southwest city of Cali, killing all 159 people on board.

<HEADLINE> Layoffs Soar in Vietnam As Financial Crisis Bites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Vietnam has soared
to record highs as companies feeling the pinch from the Asian
financial crisis and domestic restructing are forced to lay off
thousands of workers, Vietnam Investment Review said in the latest
issue.
</P>
<P>
The English weekly newspaper quoted figures released by the
Ministry of Labor last week as saying that eight percent of
workers at state-owned companies and 11 percent of employees in
foreign-backed companies have been made redundant.
</P>
<P>
The ministry estimated that by the end of last year, around
170,000 people had been laid off, representing 10 percent of the
total workforce.
</P>
<P>
The numbers are even worse in other sectors. According the
ministry figures, industry, agriculture and construction have laid
off 16 percent, 12 percent and eight percent of their respective
workforces.
</P>
<P>
The ministry predicted more pain ahead, with a further 80,000
people, mainly in the state and foreign-backed sectors, expected
to be laid off this year.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in the region is only partly to blame for
the heavy layoffs, said an official with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The slow-down in economic growth, restructuring of state-owned
firms and the modernization of all sectors have contributed
significantly to the high number of layoffs.

<P>
CARACAS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Boxing Association
(WBA) and the World Boxing Council (WBC) have agreed to harmonise
their fight rules, paving the way for undisputed title bouts
between holders of the two belts, a top WBA official said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gilberto Jesus Mendoza, vice-president of the WBA's
classification committee, said that The rule changes were hammered
out at a meeting last weekend in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
He added: "The project is to create a super-champion. That
means that a WBA boxer will fight one from the WBC for a so-called
super championship."
</P>
<P>
Among the rule changes were the WBC's decision to adopt the
WBA's system of awarding a knockout victory for three knockdowns
in the same round.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the WBA will apply the WBC's procedure of
deducting one point for an intentional or unintentional clash of
heads.
</P>
<P>
A second meeting will be held in two weeks in Venezuela,
where the WBA is based, to finalise the rule changes which also
include the adoption of common glove sizes and weight classes.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Team Finds Similarity in Geological Origin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese and U.S.
geologists have determined that China, North America and Australia
were on the same continent dating back 1.8 billion years ago,
supporting the well-known Wegener Hypothesis of continental drift,
a spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
By means of measuring magnetic inclination and declination, the
geologists unraveled the mystery of continental movement and
depicted detailed courses of their faraway travel.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, U.S. and Australian scientists found that North
America and Australia were both located near the equator 800
million to 1.8 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
Later geological surveys showed that the Jixian Section in
Tianjin and the Changhe Section in central Hubei Province have
samples of rock core which were aged 800 million-to-1.8 billion
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The magnetic information from those rock core samples indicates
that modern China's geology is closely linked with that of North
America and Australia, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Magnetically similar Earth layers always have the same fossils
of living things, said Zhang Huimin, a research fellow with
Tianjin Institute of Geology and Mineral Resources.
</P>
<P>
Geologists have found the same plant fossils between the Jixian
Section and layers in North America.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, scientists proved that the mineral veins and ore
deposits in the Asian and Australian paleo-continents are the same.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the research, also joined by the
U.S. Geological Survey, would explain continental drift and plate
movement.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said he hopes for further cooperation among scientists
from various countries in the field.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Panama has begun a power
shutdown two hours per day as part of an emergency plan to deal
with a water shortage in its main hydro-electrical plants.
</P>
<P>
The regulation, in force since Tuesday, will cut economic
activity by 25 percent, private business sources said.
</P>
<P>
A source from the Panamanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry
said that commercial and industrial activities will be affected
most by the measure.
</P>
<P>
Fernando Aramburu Porras, director of the Institute of
Hydraulic and Electrical Resources, said that water shortage in
the hydro-electrical plants of "Bayano" and "Fortuna" forced the
government to take the extreme step.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Panamanian people to save electricity to avoid an
indefinite energy rationing.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the isolated rains which have recently fallen in
the central zone of the country, there has been no increase in the
flows of the river which funnel energy in hydro-electrical plants,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The regular electrical shutdown arrangement is expected to last
more than a month until the rainy season begins in June.

<HEADLINE> Court Ruling Will Not Divert Dock Reforms: Howard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- An adverse Federal Court finding
in Australia's ongoing waterfront dispute would not divert the
government from its plan to reform the docks, Australian Prime
Minister John Howard said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the government would continue to support any
company that sought to improve productivity on the docks as long
as they operated within the law.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister played down the significance of Tuesday's
Federal Court ruling which ordered Patrick Stevedores to reinstate
1,400 fired workers.
</P>
<P>
Stevedoring company Patrick dismissed the 1,400 unionized dock
workers throughout the nation on April 7 with the encouragement of
the federal government, triggering a two-week-long nationwide
labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
In supporting the company's move, the government aims to break
the monopoly of the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) over the
nation's ports and improve their efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Federal Court Justice Tony North said on Tuesday that Patrick
had a case to answer over claims that it had conspired with other
parties to illegally lay off its workforce.
</P>
<P>
The matter became complicated after the full bench of the
Federal Court Tuesday night froze the order for 24 hours. The
court will hear an application for leave from Patrick to appeal
against the order on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I never thought the cause of waterfront reform was going to be
easy," Howard told Australia's John Laws radio program.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected any use of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"This issue does not involve the use of the army," he said. "I
believe the role of enforcing the domestic law of this country is
a role that has to be discharged by the police."
</P>
<P>
Howard said waterfront workers were the aristocracy of the
union movement who earned an average 48,000 U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
But the issue was about productivity, not high wages, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is not an anti-union campaign. I do not hate the MUA, I
do not hate the unions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The future of Patrick's government-sanctioned push to replace
unionized labor with non-union one now hinges on the outcome of
its appeal against Justice North's decision to the full bench of
the Federal Court.
</P>
<P>
The outcome is expected to be known on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that if the dispute drags on for months, the
nation's economy will be severely affected as it relies on import
and export. Some of the nation's major ports have been blocked by
protesting dock workers to varying extent.
</P>
<P>
Such a failure would lead to the use of force by the government
to end the dispute.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1960s, the arrest of an Australian labor union
leader by policemen prompted 1 million Australian union members to
go on strike.

<HEADLINE> Italian Railways to Increase Investment for Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Italian railway company Ferrovie
dello Stato (FS) Tuesday announced a plan to invest 10 trillion
lire (5.5 billion U.S. dollars) over the next three years to
improve safety on the country's rail network.
</P>
<P>
The FS has come under heavy fire recently following a string of
rail accidents, which have thrown the spotlight on the country's
aging rail system and chronic problems with efficiency, safety and
crisis-management mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the new plan, FS managing Director Giancarlo Cimoli
said safety standards on Italian railways were in fact higher than
the European average.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless he promised a range of improvements, including
cutting the number of trains on the most crowded routes,
introducing automatic velocity control systems on key lines, using
"black box" recorders on many trains and a reduction in the number
of level-crossings.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, the FS will activate its new Automatic
Train Control security system on 280 of Italy's 16,000 kilometers
of railway, officials said. The system, which controls velocity,
will be extended to 7,000 kilometers of track in the subsequent
two or three years.
</P>
<P>
Cimoli also promised that in addition to the basic investment
of 10 trillion lire (5.5 billion U.S. dollars), a further 1.2
trillion lire (5.61 billion U.S. dollars) would be spent each year
to upgrade tracks, trains and other infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
With the new safety plan, the FS will need more qualified staff
who are able to handle the automated systems, he said, promising
intensified training for drivers and an internal inquiry aimed at
identifying potentially dangerous habits in train and station
personnel.
</P>
<P>
An attached report on accidents in 1997 said one of the main
causes was "the failure of train personnel to observe signals and
other procedures correctly."
</P>
<P>
The FS added that despite appearances, the number of rail
accidents fell from 174 in 1996 to 146 last year.
</P>
<P>
However, it conceded that last year's accidents had been more
serious, causing eight deaths and 39 injuries compared to five and
14 in the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Qaidam Basin Using World Bank Loan to Aid 170,000 Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai Province
will enact a five-year project to help 170,000 farmers get rid of
poverty with the aid of a World Bank loan.
</P>
<P>
The project, with an investment of 689 million yuan and 40
million U.S. dollars of World Bank loans, includes:
</P>
<P>
-- Four small irrigation zones, each with 6,500 hectares of
land;
</P>
<P>
-- A 35-kilwatt transmission line 65 kilometers long;
</P>
<P>
-- A 271-kilometer, 10 kilowatt transmission line;
</P>
<P>
-- And 20,000 hectares of arable land.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai provincial government increased input for poverty
relief in recent years, helping 690,000 people rise above the
poverty line in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, farmers in the arid eastern mountainous area have
migrated to the Qaidam Basin to develop oasis agriculture and to
lead a better life.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guanghe, deputy governor of the province, said the Qaidam
Basin is the most promising place for developing farming in
Qinghai. It is abundant in arable land with 300,000 hectares
available for exploration.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a combination of available labor in the
eastern portion of the province with natural resources in the
western part should contribute to Qinghai's development.

<HEADLINE> Rubber Dam to Help Revitalize Area Near Marco Polo Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A rubber dam under construction
in southwestern Beijing will return the area around the Marco Polo
Bridge to its beautiful past, officials believe.
</P>
<P>
The project started last week below the bridge and will be
finished at the end of this year, according to Wang Minzhou of the
Beijing Water Sources Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The 800-year-old bridge is famous for its 485 stone lions. It
is also the site where Japanese started an all-out invasion of
China on July 7, 1937.
</P>
<P>
Thirty kilometers from the downtown area, the white stone
bridge was the first stop for ancient people when they left
Beijing. "Passers-by at that time could enjoy fresh air, bright
moonlight, clear water and weeping willows with a backdrop of
remote, dark-green mountains," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
A stone inscription penned by Emperor Qian Long of the Qing
dynasty (1644-1911) 250 years ago stands on the east end of the
bridge just the same as before.
</P>
<P>
However, beautiful scenes have been absent for decades because
of a water shortage. Local farmers said they could drive their
tractors, cows and sheep on the dried-up river bed.
</P>
<P>
"Silver moonlight, blue water and green willows are only
colorful dreams left for us," complained young visitors.
</P>
<P>
When a 300-meter-long dam is built below the bridge, water will
be re-directed from a branch of the Yongding River one kilometer
away, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the height of the dam could be lowered to avoid
strong presure brought by floods. The city now has 52 such rubber
dams.
</P>
<P>
Sources said three years ago water was introduced to the bridge
area, which attracted thousands of visitors. However, the program
was stopped because of a shortage of water.

MANAGUA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan writers expressed
their condolences Tuesday on the death of Mexican poet and
philosopher Octavio Paz, winner of the 1990 Nobel Prize for
Literature.
</P>
<P>
Paz died from cancer at his home in Mexico City on Sunday night

critical thinking of Paz constitute part of the historical and
invaluable legacy of Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
Poet Pablo Antonio Cuadra, a friend of the deceased, said Paz
"was a poet in a permanent state of invention. Invention was for
him to destroy the old and fill the abyss with the new, and to
build the unexpected with the remains of the repeated."
</P>
<P>
Ramirez Mercado, former Nicaraguan president and one of the
most important novelists of the country, said that Paz was "one of
the greatest literary voices on the continent," and described him
as "brilliant."

of Hispano-American literature, one of the most eminent figures
writing in the Spanish language."

<HEADLINE> More Investments in Fixed Assets in Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Western China has invested more
in fixed assets than eastern or central China do in the first
quarter of this year, according to a report released recently by
the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The report said that from January to March, the fixed-asset
investment increase rates for eastern, central and western areas

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Scientist Claims Cracking of "Millennium Bug" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A Bulgarian computer expert claimed
that he has cracked the problem of the so-called "millennium bug"
that would crash nearly all the computers in the world on the
first day of the next century.
</P>
<P>
In headline stories in the nation's major newspapers Tuesday,
Evgenii Nikolov, head of the National Laboratory for Computer
Viruses, said he has cracked the problem, but wants to keep his
findings secret for now.
</P>
<P>
"We have the fate of some 500 million desktop PCs at our finger
tips and if their owners want to stride over into the new
millennium, they would have to come up with 500 U.S. dollars which
is the price of our product," Evgenii Nikolov said.
</P>
<P>
He said he and his fellow researchers have found it difficult
to raise enough money to patent their discovery. They may need
100 million U.S. dollars to do that in Bulgaria and in at least
five G-7 countries. Another option for them is to patent the
discovery with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office which will
cost one million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Microsoft has shown an interest in the
discovery.
</P>
<P>
Computer users have long been warned to expect software
failures on the first day of the new millennium. Currently,
computers recognize the year by its last two digits. So no
problems are expected till after December 31, 1999, but at
midnight that day computers worldwide can lose track of time
confusing the date with January 1, 1900.
</P>
<P>
The idea behind computers using a two-digit reference was to
increase memory capacity. At the time it was thought that the
problem would be solved in due course.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Children Having Sufficient Reading Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The children of southwest China's
Tibet Autonomous Region have had the same access to popular
children's books like "Crow and Fox" and "Little Carp Wanting To
Be A Dragon" for a decade as did the children of Beijing -- the
difference now is that they read Tibetan versions of those popular
books.
</P>
<P>
Sources at several major publishers of Tibetan translations
told Xinhua Tuesday that they have published plenty of children's
books in the Tibetan language to meet the needs of more than
780,000 Tibetan children.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the specialized Tibetan Language Press in Tibet,
there are a number of other publishers in Beijing, Tibet, Qinghai,
Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan that can publish children's books in
the Tibetan language.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's National Minority Press, for example, has published
more than 50 different children's books in the Tibetan language
since 1980, from fairy tales to popular science reading materials.
</P>
<P>
"These books are rich in content and reasonable in price," a
senior editor of National Minority Press says. An eight-volume set
of World Famous Fairy Tales published in 1993 sold for only five
yuan (60 U.S. cents), for example.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan People's Press, which mainly publishes books in the
Tibetan language, has published a large number of children's books
in its 27-year history, including the widely praised "One Hundred
Thousand Whys".
</P>
<P>
According to a Tibetan Press and Publication Administration
official, in addition to children's books, there are special
columns and pages in more than 30 newspapers published in the
Tibetan language.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan language has existed for more than 1,300 years, and
is the record of Tibetan history and culture, scholars point
out. The Tibetan Autonomous Region is now applying a policy of
Tibetan language being the dominant language while using both
Chinese and Tibetan, in accordance with the Chinese Constitution.

ROME, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Italy Tuesday announced
a reduction of its discount rate from 5.5 percent to 5 percent,
the lowest level for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
It also lowered its overnight rate from 7 percent to 6.5
percent. The new rates, which will be effective as of Wednesday,
were "confirmation of the positive state of financial
markets... and the consolidation of low inflation rates," the
central bank said in a statement released to the press.
</P>
<P>
The biggest beneficiary of the reduction will be public
accounts because of the indirect link between the key discount rate
and yields paid on state bonds.
</P>

<P>
In Beijing, Rexrodt is due to participate in the seventh

expected to discuss the Asian financial crisis and explore future
cooperation possibilities between Germany and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The expected presence of a record number of about 700 business
leaders in the conference showed that despite the financial
turmoils the economic attractiveness of Asia was still unbroken
and that German companies still had confidence in the economic
outlook of the region, the German minister said.
</P>

During his visit, Rexrodt will also open a German consumer
goods fair in Shanghai, the first-ever complete show of German
consumer goods industry in a foreign country. The tour will also

<HEADLINE> Romanian FM Leaves for U.S. to Impulse Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Foreign Affairs
Minister Andrei Plesu Tuesday left for the United States on a
five-day visit to give a new impulse to the Romanian-American
relations.
</P>
<P>
Andrei Plesu will present to the U.S. leaders some of the ideas
stipulated in the new governmental program, so as to convince
Washington that Radu Vasile's government will accomplish the
reform.
</P>
<P>
Washington declared recently its discontent for the way in
which the reform of the Romanian society is carried on, and
threatened that if nothing changes about the reform within 6
months, the United States will withdraw its support for Romania.
</P>
<P>
The authorities of Bucharest want to consolidate the bilateral
relations with the U.S. by an efficient application of the
strategic partnership, which was officially launched last July,
when U.S. President Bill Clinton visited Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
The strategic partnership was defined as a form of coordination
and solidarization in accomplishing some common objectives
referring to the political-military relations, to the economic
reform in Romania, to the common fight against the organized crime
and the non-conventional risks and to Romania's contribution to
security in central and southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Plesu will plead for the improvement of economic relations
between the two countries, which are far from achieving their
target.
</P>
<P>
The total U.S. investments in Romania were 360 million dollars
by March 31, 1998. The U.S. represents only 9 percent of the total
foreign capital invested in Romania. At the end of the last year,
the U.S. was in the 5th place as regards the capital invested in
Romania, following France, South Korea, the Netherlands and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Andrei Plesu's coming talks with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright are considered as preparations for the visit of
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu to the United States in
July this year.

<HEADLINE> Dow Sets New High, Led by IBM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Stocks in New York rose to new
highs Tuesday, led by IBM which reported a 13 percent decline in
earnings.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 43.10 points to 9,184.94
in heavy trading, topping the previous high of 9,167.50 reached
Friday.
</P>
<P>
International Business Machines rose more than 6 percent and
led the Dow's gains. Even though it reported a 13 percent decline
in earnings late Monday as a result of fierce price wars, IBM
topped the diminished expectations of Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index had its first close
above 1,900, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index also
reached a new high.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling 674.06
million shares, up sharply from 595.19 million on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The S&AMP;P 500 rose 2.69 to 1,126.34, and the NYSE composite index
rose 0.79 to a record 584.80.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 16.73 to 1,903.87, its first
foray above 1,900.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.60 to
491.41, and the small-company dominated American Stock Exchange
composite index rose 1.84 to 749.79, padding Monday's records for
both measures.

<HEADLINE> Washington D.C. Gets New Police Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Charles Ramsey, a veteran
policeman from Chicago, became the 28th chief of the beleaguered
police department in Washington D.C. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ramsey, 48, swore to protect the city, saying, "My boss is
going to be the people of Washington D.C."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the city council unanimously approved Ramsey's
appointment to the position.
</P>
<P>
"The Metropolitan Police Department is a good police department
with good and talented people within its ranks but good is not
enough," Ramsey said after his swearing-in. "I will expect and
accept nothing less than MPD becoming the finest police department
in the nation."
</P>
<P>
Ramsey, a Chicago native who was deputy police superintendent
there, was selected from 51 applicants by a coalition of local
officials, community leaders and a presidentially appointed board
that oversees much of the capital's government.
</P>
<P>
Residents and officials alike had expressed the need for
bringing in an outsider to deal with the department.
</P>
<P>
The department has been through several upheavals in the last
year, including the resignation of Police Chief Larry Soulsby last
November.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Support for U.N. Humanitarian Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Tuesday that U.N. humanitarian aid for those
suffering from civil conflict is imperative.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when speaking to the Los Angeles World
Affairs Council during his tour of the western United States.
</P>
<P>
The end of the Cold War seemed to herald a new era of peace and
security, but these hopes were quickly dashed as ethnic conflict
and political upheavals led to a series of massive humanitarian
tragedies, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The nature of warfare has changed. Most wars are now internal
struggles," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The dividing line between combatants and civilians
has become less clear cut. Ninety percent of victims are
civilians, whereas during the First World War the comparable
figure was 5 percent."
</P>
<P>
"There are more lethal weapons available to a greater number of
people than at any other time in history. Many are in the hands of
the estimated 250,000 child soldiers, as young as ten or twelve,"
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Sudan, Afghanistan and Rwanda are the cases where the United
Nations has found not only big humanitarian aid workload but also
remarkable challenges to make the aid done, he said.
</P>
<P>
A 14-year civil war in Sudan has taken more than 1 million
lives with an equivalent number of people vulnerable to famine and
starvation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But Sudan is in jeopardy of falling off the screen. It has
become one of the world's `forgotten emergencies,'" he added.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said that too often humanitarian agencies
are left alone on the front line because there is no political
will by U.N. member states to intervene and sometimes there is "a
dangerous tendency towards isolationism."
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the importance of humanitarian aid, he said that if
a society does not secure basic fundamental human rights and at
least some prospect of sustainable political, economic and social
development, "there is a potential for a humanitarian crisis."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Helps Remove Nuclear Material from Georgia Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States has begun a
secretive operation to remove a cache of highly enriched uranium
and spent nuclear fuel from the former Soviet republic of Georgia,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There was concern the material would fall into "the wrong
hands," and other countries are cooperating in the operation,
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking the appropriate steps to ensure the safety of
this material," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright said obviously one of the great priorities the U.S.
has is dealing with the weapons of mass destruction and ensuring
the materials for them would not get into the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
The project at the Physics Institute just outside the capital,
Tbilisi, remained shrouded in secrecy. Institute Director Georgy
Kharadze confirmed that the uranium and spent nuclear fuel are in
the Institute and an American group was working at the institute,
news reports said.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear material consists of 9.5 pounds of highly enriched
uranium-235 and 2 pounds of spent nuclear fuel. The uranium-235
was used for scientific projects involving the Physics Institute's
research reactor, built in the late 1950s, and was left in Georgia
when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Georgia has said it wants to get rid of the uranium, and
officials have offered it for sale on condition it not be used for
military purposes.
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Office said Tuesday that Britain had agreed
to take "a small amount of fresh and spent highly enriched uranium
fuel" from the Georgian institute.
</P>
<P>
Britain said that most of the material is fresh fuel and will
be usable immediately in the routine production of medical isotope
targets for the treatment of cancer.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force planes would fly the 10-plus pounds of
nuclear material from Georgia to Britain for reprocessing.
American military and civilian personnel were in the midst of
packing up the shipment, The New York Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the Americans also asked the French
to take the material, but were rebuffed. British Prime Minister
Tony Blair agreed to store the material in Britain when he visited
Washington early February.
